1905,many areas of the world are experiencing groundwater flooding gf events with serious impacts on the environment and human health in europe gf has received specific attention with the directive 2007 60 ec which requires member states to map gf hazard and risk and propose mitigation measures in italy despite the commitment assigned by the legislative decree 49 2010 to river basin district authorities no models have been developed for groundwater flooding hazard gfh evaluation also for the lack of standard methods based on commonly available data in this paper a new method has been developed through a specific procedure that accounts for i probability of gf events estimation based on available time series of groundwater levels and ii probability mapping through a newly developed matlab code high resolution topographic data and groundwater table model the methodology has been tested and validated in the metropolitan city of naples italy affected by gf since 2010 for which i sixty two year long time series of groundwater levels ii high resolution digital elevation and digital terrain models and iii basement building geometry are available the results show that about 59 of the buildings present in the study area have potentially floodable underground structures in the 2010 2021 period only 2 of these buildings were flooded and most of them were built in the period 1980 2000 when the piezometric levels were deeper due to over pumping of the groundwater the obtained gfh map shows that only 2 of the built area is involved by 1 to 2 year events while 6 is affected by 1 to 10 year events a good spatial correspondence between the return period and locations of gf events occurred during 2010 2021 period was observed thus indicating the significant performance of the model the obtained gfh map output can support decisions of authorities and policy makers to reduce the gf risk keywords groundwater flooding hazard semi urban aquifer piezometric time series flooded basement probability model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater flooding gf is the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface away from perennial river channels or the rising of groundwater into the man made ground including basements and other subsurface infrastructure macdonald et al 2008 macdonald et al 2012 many coastal and continental regions around the world are experiencing the phenomenon of gf e g schirmer et al 2013 bosserelle et al 2022 and the frequency severity and damage of flooding events might increase in the future due to global climate change urbanization land groundwater use changes and migration pressures richts and vrba 2016 miller and hutchins 2017 a useful aid in this regard can be provided by satellite remote sensing technology to support the management of flood events which in the last decades have proved adept at depicting the location extent and dynamic evolution of such events e g klemas 2015 ruzza et al 2019 gf has natural or anthropogenic origin and its impact can be significant to rural and urban environments abu rizaiza 1999 aicha et al 2020 allocca et al 2021 2022 cultural heritage stellato et al 2020 infrastructures and human health morris et al 2003 several authors e g macdonald et al 2008 hughes et al 2011 naughton et al 2017 have identified different natural and anthropogenic causes and scenarios for gf occurrence described in detail in allocca et al 2022 being observed in many countries of the world in the last decades the gf phenomenon has unquestionably taken on a global dimension areas of united kingdom hurst and wilkinson 1986 johnson 1994 united states of america schirmer et al 2013 germany kreibich et al 2009 spain vázquez suñé et al 2005 italy coda et al 2019a allocca et al 2022 japan hayashi et al 2009 ukraine jakovljev et al 2002 and middle east george 1992 have suffered the social and economic impact and environmental damages of such phenomenon however only recently risk from gf has received attention in europe indeed the directive 2007 60 ec so called eu floods directive compels member states to produce groundwater flooding hazard gfh maps and risk mitigation measures to reduce disasters and harmful effects to environment and human health and to make urban areas more resilient and safer cobby et al 2009 in italy guidelines provided by the legislative decree 49 2010 derived by the directive 2007 60 ec commit to district basin authorities the production of gfh models and related maps at 1 10 000 scale considering as a boundary condition an extreme event with low probability of occurrence i e an event of magnitude corresponding to that of a 300 500 year flood in this context gfh estimation and mapping lack of a recognized quantitative methodological framework and only a limited set of studies are available within the international scientific community for instance najib et al 2008 used frequency analysis of long daily hydraulic head time series to estimate given the return period the hydraulic head and rainfall events likely to cause extreme groundwater surges responsible for gf within a karst mediterranean aquifer of southern france chebanov and zadniprovska 2011 developed a gis technique for gf risk zoning over six large cities of ukraine through a combination of different map layers of the soil aquifer and underground structures colombo et al 2018 assessed the hydrogeological hazard caused by groundwater rebound for subway and stations of the urban area of milan italy using a stochastic approach yu et al 2019 developed a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model for gf risk assessment in a karst basin of koiliaris river at crete island mancini et al 2020 mapped areas affected by gf based on a parsimonious model which considers both surface and underground hydrological components as a function of different return periods in an urbanized reclamation area of rome italy finally merchán rivera et al 2022 propose a bayesian based approach using a groundwater numerical model to assess the spatio temporal distribution of gf event that occurred in the alz river valley bavaria germany in 2013 developing susceptibility maps based on the exceedance probability of certain groundwater levels and specific cellar depths on this basis and to contribute to the development of a gfh estimation and mapping framework in this paper a methodological procedure of gfh assessment based on a specifically developed matlab code of gfh mapping is presented for the development of the gfh assessment procedure i a time series of groundwater level ii a high resolution model of the groundwater table corresponding to the historical minimum of annual maxima piezometric level and iii a high resolution model of the surface topography subsurface and basements geometry of buildings have been considered to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology and its performance an experimental area of the metropolitan city of naples italy was tested this area hosts a shallow unconfined aquifer system affected in the last decade by gf of private buildings 2 study area 2 1 geologic and hydrogeologic setting the study area is in the eastern sector of metropolitan city of naples italy at 4530000 n and 446 000 e utm 33 n wgs 84 fig 1 a and extends over about 14 km2 it corresponds to northern sector of the casalnuovo di napoli municipality among the most densely populated municipality of italy and europe 75 000 inhabitants and a population density of 10 000 inhabitants km2 at the local scale two hydrogeological complexes crop out in the study area i holocene pyroclastic fluvial complex pf and ii ash fall pyroclastic complex p dated 39 3 39 8 k yrs borehole data fig 1b revealed the presence of a buried tuff horizon with a thickness variable up to 40 m corresponding to the campanian ignimbrite ci in a zeolitized yellow facies dating back to 39 28 0 11 k yrs de vivo et al 2001 the landscape morphology is quite flat with slopes lower than 1 and elevation lower than 30 m a s l the santo spirito stream represents the current drainage system of surface water the study area hosts a mixed land use aquifer system characterized by 45 urbanized 30 of which built and 55 rural areas european environment agency 2018 it is characterized by a heterogeneous and discontinuous multi layered system recharged by direct effective infiltration equal to 300 mm year allocca et al 2014 of the local precipitation and by lateral groundwater flow coming from the upstream aquifer sectors fig 1a and fig 2 the multi layered aquifer system is characterized by an unconfined shallow aquifer hosted in the pf hydrogeological complex and a deep semiconfined aquifer within pyroclastic alluvial deposits underlying ci horizon the 2d hydrostratigraphic model fig 1c allowed defining the top and bottom of the shallow and deep aquifer as well as their average thickness equal to 10 and 100 m respectively locally both aquifers show small differences in terms of potential heads lower than 0 05 m although there are local variations of groundwater flow directions allocca et al 2022 indeed for the deep semiconfined aquifer groundwater flow is about ne sw consistent with groundwater flow scheme at the basin scale fig 1a and the local hydraulic gradient is 8 7 10 4 allocca et al 2022 for the shallow unconfined aquifer groundwater flow is oriented toward n and s fig 1b circumventing locally the ci top and hydraulic gradient varies between 5 9 10 4 and 2 0 10 2 the santo spirito stream interacts negligibly and only occasionally by a slow percolation with the underlying shallow aquifer as the stream is well concrete and characterized by a very ephemeral regime despite being positioned at a level slightly higher than the water table moreover the shallow unconfined aquifer which causes gf of private buildings is characterized by a very high degree of pollution vulnerability and a poor quality state of groundwater mainly related to agricultural activities and urban settlements cusano et al 2019 fusco et al 2020 tufano et al 2020 the groundwater levels of the shallow unconfined aquifer were monitored at the capomazzo well fig 1b from 1929 to 1992 with data missing between 1942 and 1950 by the monitoring network of the national hydrographic and mareographic service nowadays ispra higher institute for environmental protection and research the groundwater level measured at the capomazzo shallow well varies in the pre 1980 period between 23 2 m and 18 2 m a s l fig 2a even if the range of the most frequent values is between 21 5 m and 20 1 m a s l median 20 7 m a s l piezometric levels registered between the 80 s and the beginning of 90 s varies between 20 1 m and 13 9 m a s l while the range of the most frequent values is between 18 7 m and 16 7 m a s l median 18 1 m a s l during the same period piezometric levels have been strongly influenced by groundwater pumping of numerous public and private wells today abandoned for drinking and industrial use coda et al 2019b allocca et al 2022 subsequently in the 2014 and 2019 two piezometers were carried out at a distance lower than 200 m from the capomazzo shallow well fig 1b and equipped with pressure sensor and data logger the monitoring daily data not shown indicate that groundwater level within the shallow unconfined aquifer varies between 20 7 m and 19 1 m a s l in the period 2015 2021 fig 2b even if the range of the most frequent values is between 20 1 m and 19 7 m a s l median 20 m a s l within the deep semiconfined aquifer piezometric levels varies between 20 5 m and 19 3 m a s l in the period 2019 2021 fig 2b while the range of the most frequent values is between 20 2 m and 19 5 m a s l median 20 m a s l the comparison between fig 2a and fig 2b suggests that the historical piezometric data of the capomazzo shallow well used for the hazard modeling fig 2a are comparable with current groundwater levels of shallow water table fig 2b and even the average annual cumulative rainfall is very similar in the two considered periods 2 2 gf characteristics since 1989 withdrawals for drinking and industrial use have been drastically reduced and or suspended due to groundwater quality deterioration deindustrialization process and land use change coda et al 2019a consequently from 1990 onward a remarkable and widespread groundwater rebound has been registered with values up to about 6 m in the study area allocca et al 2022 and 17 m in the surrounding areas in the last years despite groundwater levels recovery has not taken place entirely if compared to the levels of 1920 s fiorelli 1926 frequent gf events of private buildings and underground settlements have been registered the first gf episodes occurred in 2007 affecting private buildings 17 years after the beginning of groundwater rebound unlike the groundwater rebound phenomenon spatially distributed at the municipality scale the gf of private buildings shows a hot spot patterns and a temporally heterogeneous distribution allocca et al 2022 field data collected during the period 2013 2021 by a citizen s survey showed that flooded settlements were mostly built between 1985 and 2000 allocca et al 2022 underground structures such as parking spaces basements foundations garages cellars and lift shafts were affected by gf fig 3 with severe economic consequences allocca et al 2023 fig 3a b provides an overview of the temporal variability from 2010 to 2021 of gf episodes observed at the local scale in 2010 2011 period a total number of 7 private buildings have been affected for a total buildings surface of 6890 m2 in 2014 2015 period flooded buildings increased to 9 flooded surface of 8290 m2 while between 2020 and 2021 are 10 the flooded buildings flooded surface of 8970 m2 currently impacts photos c d e and f in fig 3 and temporal variability of the gf episodes fig 3b are linked to the local hydrological regime fig 2 since the effect of groundwater rebound due to the pumping stop has been completely dissipated 3 materials and methods the proposed gfh assessment procedure is shown in the flow chart of fig 4 in particular as reported in the flow chart at first groundwater level time series fig 4a at the reference station of capomazzo is used as a basis for deriving a probability model fig 4b such model is then used for the construction of a reference probability database fig 4c that in turn represents the basis for relative probability model fig 4d generation subsequently a high resolution groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level over the study area fig 4e is obtained to run the developed procedure of hazard estimation and mapping a digital surface subsurface model dssm fig 4h which simulates the threshold level for flooding by integrating data from digital terrain model fig 4f and basement depth mapping fig 4g is used after data preparation the developed matlab code is run blue circle and the gfh model and associated map are created and classified 3 1 materials for the development of the gfh assessment procedure and its application over the selected study area an i annual maximum groundwater level time series a ii 2 2 m groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level and iii a 2 2 m digital surface and digital terrain models dsm and dtm were used the groundwater level time series in the form of annual maxima was derived by monthly measurements recorded between 1929 and 1980 at the capomazzo well monitoring station located within the study area at 4529779 n and 445 452 e utm 33 n fig 1 the size of the samples is of 44 units and discontinuities are present the 2 2 m groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level was derived by allocca et al 2022 and selected on the basis of the approximate correspondence of the groundwater level value at the monitoring well in the water table model with the minimum of the annual maxima time series to compensate the limited deviation between these two values an operation of vertical shifting to the minimum was carried out the 2 2 m dsm was resampled from a 1 1 m lidar dsm acquired between 2011 and 2012 across the italian national territory http www pcn minambiente it mattm progetto pst dati lidar the vertical accuracy of the lidar data has been estimated in 0 25 m resampling was completed using cubic convolution 3 2 gfh assessment procedure 3 2 1 probability analysis of groundwater levels as a first step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment fig 4a c univariate statistical analysis of available time series was completed to identify the minimum and mean values of the time series fig 4a and its standard deviation subsequently a generalized extreme value parametric distribution function gev e g hosking and wallis 1986 was selected to fit the available annual maxima time series i e discontinuous complementary cumulative distribution function registered at the capomazzo shallow well monitoring station fig 4b and estimate the probability of exceedance of each specific groundwater level in the range of interest and related return periods fig 4c the gev function has the following form 1 f x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 where x is the groundwater level ξ is the shape parameter σ is the scale parameter µ is the location parameter of probability distribution ξ governs the tail behavior of the distribution ξ 0 identifies a heavy tailed distribution while ξ 0 a bounded upper tail the case of ξ 0 termed gumbel distribution describes a distribution not upper and lower bounded useful in the case of extreme events analysis for which can be reasonable hypothesized the asymptotic behavior of the tail the probability function f x described by gumbel distribution also called type i extreme value distribution is of type 2 f x exp exp x μ σ where the parameters σ and µ are estimated considering the mean value of the series α and its standard deviation u through the following equations 3 σ 1 283 u 4 μ α 0 45 u the groundwater level time series in form of annual maxima was automatically parametrized using the distribution fitter tool implemented in matlab with respect to a gumbel distribution σ 0 733 μ 22 333 standard error σ 0 088 μ 0 116 this probability model has already been used successfully to model hydrological data such as rainfall extreme tufano et al 2023 this choice is consistent with the guideline of the italian ministry of the ecological transition suggesting that a 300 to 500 year event should be considered as reference scenario in hydrological hazard evaluation perspective 3 2 2 basement mapping and dssm modeling as a second step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment an available 2 2 m dtm fig 4f and field data depicting the presence geometry and depth of building s basements in the study area fig 4g were used to produce a dssm fig 4h starting from the available dsm and dtm a distribution of buildings over the study area was derived by model subtraction and residuals digitalization into a gis environment subsequently a specific field survey was completed acquiring structuralandnon structuraldata about basements and buildings using a citizen science approach thirty days of field survey between july and august 2021 were needed for completing basement inventory over the study areas through a specific datasheet fig 5 predisposed for data acquisition and standardization in absence of information about the year of construction of buildings data were integrated by comparing satellite images of google earth from 1980 s to today once obtained distribution and geometry including depth of basement was processed into a gis environment deriving a 2 2 m discontinuous raster depicting basement depth such raster was subtracted to the available dtm to derive the dssm considered for hazard estimation and mapping this raster contains absolute elevation values corresponding to geometric threshold values indicating the level at which a gf event could occur once groundwater level exceeds that elevation 3 2 3 gfh mapping as a third step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment the developed matlab code of hazard estimation and mapping was run on the basis of the i probability database a table containing the annual maxima time series fig 4c and data depicting the derived probability model i e simulated magnitude in the form of groundwater level range and corresponding estimated probability of exceedance fig 4c ii 2 2 m groundwater table model of the historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level fig 4e and the iii 2 2 m dssm fig 4h the developed code initially uses the minimum of the annual maxima time series to transform simulated magnitude of the probability database s stage in fig 4c from the observed minimum of 19 47 m a s l to a simulated minimum of 0 m a s l fig 4c d this transformation is needed to generate a relative probability model that can be subsequently assigned to all of the pixels forming the study area in order to derive a specific hazard value this relative probability model represents the overall behavior of the aquifer in terms of annual groundwater fluctuation and serves as the basis for hazard estimation this approach is here considered suitable for hazard mapping in the assumption that over the study area a general increase in groundwater level at a specific position is associated to an equivalent increase in an arbitrary selected different position the generated relative probability model fig 4d in the form of magnitude frequency table is then assigned to each pixel by summing to the simulated magnitude range the value of the historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level of same pixel in this way a 3d hazard model is fully populated by multiple probability models characterized by a variable vertical magnitude scale at this point gfh assessment through probability of exceedance assignation is completed for each pixel of the study area by considering the absolute elevation value for each pixel of the dssm in particular this value identifies the minimum magnitude of the groundwater level inducing a gf event in other words the geometric threshold for flooding and the corresponding probability of exceedance value represents the hazard at that pixel for each pixel this value is assigned to the hazard model that in this way is fully populated to create a gfh map in terms of both probability of exceedance and related return period fig 4i the gfh map is subsequently classified to better depict probability of flooding on an annual basis between 1 and 0 002 corresponding to a return period of 1 to 500 years it is completed identifying four zones each corresponding to a specific hazard range these zones are selected on the basis of overall hazard distribution and river basins district authorities guidelines https www minambiente it direttive distretti idrografici in particular a i ultra high hazard zone floodable by a 1 to 2 year event a ii very high hazard zone floodable by a 2 to 5 year event a iii high hazard zone floodable by a 5 to 10 year event a iv medium hazard zone floodable by a 10 to 50 year event a v low hazard zone floodable by a 50 to 100 year event and a vi very low hazard zone floodable by a 100 to 500 year event gf magnitude for each specific return period is derived from probability analysis considering that the theoretical return period is the inverse of the probability of exceedance 3 2 4 gfh model validation to validate the gfh model data about gf events occurred in the study area between 2010 and 2021 derived from the database of allocca et al 2022 as well as new data obtained during field surveys of basements in the period july august 2021 were used such data were used to develop a comprehensive gf inventory map that was subsequently compared with the hazard model resulting from the developed procedure model validation was completed in terms of presence absence of gf events and for location in which data about event frequency were available in terms of estimated return period 4 results and discussion 4 1 probability of gf fig 6 reports annual maxima time series univariate statistics and generalized extreme value probability models adopted for gfh assessment using the proposed procedure over the study area the annual maxima time series of fig 6a provides an overview of the decadal variation of groundwater table level at the reference monitoring station indicating that between 1929 and 1980 the minimum water table level was of 19 5 m a s l and the maximum water table level was of 23 4 m a s l in relative terms the minimum and maximum registered water table levels were of 5 5 and 2 6 m below the ground level overall the reconstructed time series indicates a semi sinusoidal trend of the water table level with generally increasing values from 1929 to 1960 and decreasing values from 1960 to 1980 local anomalies are present boxplot of fig 6b indicates that the 25th percentile the median and the 75th percentile correspond to 21 3 22 0 and 22 7 m a s l respectively probability graph of fig 6c shows relative frequency distribution and gev model that fit the theoretical probability of exceedance of groundwater levels forming annual maxima time series r2 0 98 the probability model indicates that at the capomazzo shallow well a 5 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 22 7 m a s l a 10 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 23 m a s l and a 100 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 23 5 m a s l uncertainty related to magnitude estimation in relation to events probability is depicted by 95 confidence intervals reported in fig 6c as dashed lines for the analyzed time series confidence intervals indicate a not so large uncertainty related to magnitude estimation also as a consequence of the not so relevant variation of groundwater levels as indicated by the annual maxima time series of fig 6a the gev probability model is able to describe the statistical behavior of hydrological annual maxima but has the disadvantage of underestimating the intensity of very high return period events coles et al 2001 to mitigate this drawback it can be used in combination with probability models that have a higher attitude in estimating low probability events for instance the gamma function that has the potential to better estimate the intensity of very high return period events has been used by guerriero et al 2018 in the context of flood hazard assessment over the central sector of the benevento province model parameterization has been completed using the weighted moment procedure u s water resources council 1982 although it is simple and of fast application a number of authors have indicated that this approach applied to gauged records and historical data is not so efficient in frequency analysis e g wallis and wood 1984 stedinger and cohn 1986 in the case of the proposed analysis this quite low efficiency might be related to an underestimation of the amplitude of the 95 confidence interval similar drawbacks have been recognized by rust et al 2011 they suggested that in presence of limited samples also the maximum likelihood estimator mle tends to underestimate such interval which needs to be carefully determined as a measure of uncertainty associated to hazard evaluation e g apel et al 2004 to mitigate this drawback a bayesian approach can be adopted e g parkes and demeritt 2016 that said the main goal of the paper is to present a procedure of gfh assessment able to work from national to local scale rather than an optimized probability model performance so that the gev model parametrized through the weighted moment procedure is considered able to describe the statistical behavior of groundwater table level data in addition due to the limited number of monitoring points only a single probability model has been considered as representative of the hydrological behavior of the aquifer in terms of groundwater table fluctuation considering the limited extent of the study area and its hydrogeological homogeneity it might be a reasonable assumption for larger areas multiple probability models would be required e g guerriero et al 2019 guerriero et al 2020 as well as the knowledge of boundary conditions between adjacent aquifers 4 2 basement distribution and characteristics table 1 provides an overview of the results of field survey of buildings and basements in the study area 1160 private and public buildings are present but structural and non structural data were collected only for 873 of them about 75 obtained data can be divided according to the period of construction and with reference to the hydrologic regime of the aquifer in i before 1980 ii between 1980 and 2000 and iii after 2000 from a comparison between the three periods no substantial differences emerge in the intended use of buildings conversely some differences in the construction typology have been recognized in particular an increment in the number of buildings with more than three floors is observed in the 1980 2000 period 36 of buildings in the same period 73 of buildings were built with basement for parking and blended cellars and garage uses buildings dating back to this period and thus corresponding to the maximum period of overexploitation of the aquifer system allocca et al 2022 show the deepest basements with values down to 5 m b g l and surface between 28 and 1768 m2 since 2010 eight basements of these buildings have been affected by gf episodes in the pre 1980 period corresponding to the period of moderate groundwater pumping and high piezometric levels allocca et al 2022 only 51 of buildings present basements mostly cellars with depth between 1 and 3 m b g l and surface between 9 and 1559 m2 to date for these buildings no gf event has been recorded in the last 20 years a significant reduction in the construction of buildings and in the number of floors have been observed 74 new buildings 16 of them with more than three floors compared to the 1980 2000 period basements were built in 61 of buildings with depth between 1 5 and 4 m and surface between 41 and 2417 m2 gf evidence has been detected in only two private buildings constructed in this period concerning the type of foundations and construction material of the basements a considerable difficulty has been encountered in finding this type of information despite the high number of unavailable data since the 1980 s an increasing trend can be observed in the use of deep foundation and basements built with reinforced concrete fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of basements and their depth the highest depths are between 3 and 5 m b g l localized mainly in the north western and south western sectors of the study area and for buildings built in the 1980 2000 period and after 2000 the southern sector is characterized by the oldest urban fabric and a depth of basements within 1 2 m survey data have been used as a basis for deriving the dssm fig 7b from the dtm such model depicts the reference level above which a general increase in groundwater table induces a gf event without considering its magnitude in this way it represents a threshold for flooding initiation this datum is needed for identifying the probability of exceedance of a gf event related to a specific fluctuation of the water table level through the proposed approach specifically developed for gf probability of exceedance mapping as indicated by macdonald et al 2008 gf is considered as the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface or into the man made ground independently of its magnitude and duration that is why basement levels are considered as a threshold in constructing the model the use of this threshold is related to the process of developing and populating the three dimensional probability array which contain in each pixel column arrays depicting both probability of exceedance and related magnitude modulated by the minimum water table level for the pixel as derived by the minimum groundwater table model this is a way to relate the probability model to the observed field process i e long term minimum water table level and probability of specific water table level to effectively account for field conditions of gf event initiation in the hazard assessment 4 3 gfh map maps reported in fig 8 depict gfh in the form of probability of exceedance map a and return period map b as resulted by the application of the of developed procedure fig 8a depicts the distribution of areas in which gf has a probability of exceedance higher than 0 002 while fig 8b provides an overview of return period for gf events considering a boundary condition of 500 years i e return period 500 years overall gf events are likely to occur probability of exceedance 0 002 at building basements located in the north western and southern sectors of the study area higher values of gfh in terms of probability of exceedance are observable within the north western sector of the study area where local values approximating the unit are associated to a group of buildings lower values of gfh are distributed over both the north western and south western sectors of the study area where values generally lower than 0 03 are observable local exceptions are characterized by gfh values between 0 1 and 0 5 a further zone characterized by potential gf events as predicted by the hazard model derived by the proposed procedure comprises the s spirito stream fig 8b depicts gfh in terms of events return period through a reclassification of the gfh map into six classes according to the probability of exceedance map buildings potentially involved by gf events display a variable return period buildings located in the north western sector of the study area are characterized by a variable gfh return period from 500 to approximately 1 year while buildings located in the south western sector of the study area are characterized by gfh return period between 5 and 500 years of particular significance is a group of six buildings located in the first sector and characterized by a gfh return period of approximately one year local exceptions consisting in isolated buildings subject to gf events characterized by a return period shorter than 5 years are present the proposed procedure represents in the authors knowledge the first quantitative method for estimating distributed gfh on the basis of probability models and high resolution groundwater table and topographic model accounting for the presence of basements and cellars cobby et al 2009 summarized the advances made in the context of groundwater flood risk management including hazard mapping methods they underlined that field records provide a significant source of data for identifying areas susceptible to gf but such data are not often useful due to under reporting and uncertainty in identifying groundwater as the source of flooding that is why many authors consider gf susceptibility in the context of risk assessment in substitution of hazard mckenzie et al 2010 chebanov and zadniprovska 2011 naughton et al 2017 considering the described potential issues related to field data availability the proposed procedure considers only hydrological data consisting in groundwater table level measured at a specific monitoring well as a source of information for hazard assessment in this way field data can be used to validate the model in terms of extent and eventually return period limitation in amount of available data can be somehow considered of less importance for validation in comparison to eventual needs in terms of model calibration in addition cobby et al 2009 indicated that while at a regional scale hazard mapping has achieved some success further development of the techniques and the production of finer scale maps is hampered by a paucity of data and the difficulty in assigning probabilities of flood occurrence to zones of susceptibility five approaches have been proposed by jacobs 2007 to estimate probabilities of gf on the basis of i observed flooding ii drivers i e rainfall or effective rainfall iii surrogates i e groundwater levels iv combination of drivers and surrogates and v mathematical modelling in the case of the proposed procedure surrogate data consisting in groundwater levels are considered this makes potentially possible to extent the procedure to the whole italian national territory and all of the regions where such data are available limitation of the proposed procedure are related to the need of a statistically significant time series of groundwater table level which might not often be available and a reconstruction of the geometry of the groundwater table of the selected study area in addition it is important to consider that the assumption of time independence of such geometry is of basic importance for the application of the procedure for alluvial aquifers where gf events are common this assumption might be consistent with the effective process of water table fluctuation in aquifers with different characteristics and flow mechanism this assumption might not work 4 4 validation procedure performance evaluation was carried out through comparison between location in which gf events have been predicted by the gfh model fig 8 and available data in terms of location and frequency fig 3 comparison indicates a perfect correspondence in terms of position and frequency return period between locations in which the model predicts gf events with a return period of 1 year and those reported in fig 3 using blue and yellow colors correspondence in position has been also observed for three locations in which a return period of 2 to 5 years has been predicted by the gfh model and a return period of one year was estimated from field observations at further locations predicted as floodable from 5 to 10 years and higher return periods events no significant gf events were observed however considering that field observations for flooding episodes of buildings are available only for the last eleven years the estimation of model performance can be based only on a comparison between field data and predicted gf events with return period lower than 10 years i e purple to magenta areas of fig 8b based on this assumption of twelve locations in which gf events were predicted by the model only two do not correspond to locations in which a gf event was registered 85 of correspondence in terms of frequency return period of the twelve considered locations six are characterized by a consistent frequency return period 50 of correspondence 5 conclusions gf is an emerging hazard for many urban and rural alluvial areas and low elevation coastal regions of the world it can cause displacement of people damage the environment compromise anthropogenic activities and undermine the socio economic development of entire cities gfh mapping is an urgent issue from national to community scale and is a basis to plan mitigation actions and to make cities more resilient and safer in this paper we have proposed a new procedure to assess gfh based on a univariate statistical analysis of a long time series of hydrological data and a specifically developed matlab code of probability mapping despite the presence of the italian legislative decree 49 2010 as transposition of the directive 2007 60 ec at national scale which committed the national river basin district authorities to implement by 2013 gfh maps on the hydrographic basin scale to the authors knowledge the present study is the first one procedure in italy providing a methodological framework and related gfh maps of an urban environment it has been applied and tested in an unconfined semi urban aquifer of the metropolitan city of naples affected by gf of private buildings since 2010 and for which a wide groundwater database is available as well as systematic mapping of flooded buildings the obtained gfh map shows the return period of the event able to produce gf at each pixel of the model the comparison between gfh map and gf inventory map is very encouraging since seven of the ten flooded buildings fall into zones with a return period between 1 and 2 years while the other three are involved in 2 to 5 year events the development of the procedure has been possible due to the presence of a long term time history of groundwater levels measured at the capomazzo shallow well ispra historical archive dismissed since 1992 the availability of such data provides a unique opportunity of investigating gfh within a widely urbanized and densely populated area of the metropolitan city of naples for this reason the recovery and implementation of the old hydrological monitoring network by the ispra and regional environmental protection agencies in italian arpas would be desirable on this basis the implemented procedure has the potential to be applied in urban semi urban and rural areas without any limitation related to spatial scale and model resolution the achievable results can be considered as a new tool to assist local government authorities and decision makers in addressing the problems deriving from gf e g supporting land planning and the design of mitigation measures and represent a first step toward gf risk assessment as

1905,many areas of the world are experiencing groundwater flooding gf events with serious impacts on the environment and human health in europe gf has received specific attention with the directive 2007 60 ec which requires member states to map gf hazard and risk and propose mitigation measures in italy despite the commitment assigned by the legislative decree 49 2010 to river basin district authorities no models have been developed for groundwater flooding hazard gfh evaluation also for the lack of standard methods based on commonly available data in this paper a new method has been developed through a specific procedure that accounts for i probability of gf events estimation based on available time series of groundwater levels and ii probability mapping through a newly developed matlab code high resolution topographic data and groundwater table model the methodology has been tested and validated in the metropolitan city of naples italy affected by gf since 2010 for which i sixty two year long time series of groundwater levels ii high resolution digital elevation and digital terrain models and iii basement building geometry are available the results show that about 59 of the buildings present in the study area have potentially floodable underground structures in the 2010 2021 period only 2 of these buildings were flooded and most of them were built in the period 1980 2000 when the piezometric levels were deeper due to over pumping of the groundwater the obtained gfh map shows that only 2 of the built area is involved by 1 to 2 year events while 6 is affected by 1 to 10 year events a good spatial correspondence between the return period and locations of gf events occurred during 2010 2021 period was observed thus indicating the significant performance of the model the obtained gfh map output can support decisions of authorities and policy makers to reduce the gf risk keywords groundwater flooding hazard semi urban aquifer piezometric time series flooded basement probability model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater flooding gf is the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface away from perennial river channels or the rising of groundwater into the man made ground including basements and other subsurface infrastructure macdonald et al 2008 macdonald et al 2012 many coastal and continental regions around the world are experiencing the phenomenon of gf e g schirmer et al 2013 bosserelle et al 2022 and the frequency severity and damage of flooding events might increase in the future due to global climate change urbanization land groundwater use changes and migration pressures richts and vrba 2016 miller and hutchins 2017 a useful aid in this regard can be provided by satellite remote sensing technology to support the management of flood events which in the last decades have proved adept at depicting the location extent and dynamic evolution of such events e g klemas 2015 ruzza et al 2019 gf has natural or anthropogenic origin and its impact can be significant to rural and urban environments abu rizaiza 1999 aicha et al 2020 allocca et al 2021 2022 cultural heritage stellato et al 2020 infrastructures and human health morris et al 2003 several authors e g macdonald et al 2008 hughes et al 2011 naughton et al 2017 have identified different natural and anthropogenic causes and scenarios for gf occurrence described in detail in allocca et al 2022 being observed in many countries of the world in the last decades the gf phenomenon has unquestionably taken on a global dimension areas of united kingdom hurst and wilkinson 1986 johnson 1994 united states of america schirmer et al 2013 germany kreibich et al 2009 spain vázquez suñé et al 2005 italy coda et al 2019a allocca et al 2022 japan hayashi et al 2009 ukraine jakovljev et al 2002 and middle east george 1992 have suffered the social and economic impact and environmental damages of such phenomenon however only recently risk from gf has received attention in europe indeed the directive 2007 60 ec so called eu floods directive compels member states to produce groundwater flooding hazard gfh maps and risk mitigation measures to reduce disasters and harmful effects to environment and human health and to make urban areas more resilient and safer cobby et al 2009 in italy guidelines provided by the legislative decree 49 2010 derived by the directive 2007 60 ec commit to district basin authorities the production of gfh models and related maps at 1 10 000 scale considering as a boundary condition an extreme event with low probability of occurrence i e an event of magnitude corresponding to that of a 300 500 year flood in this context gfh estimation and mapping lack of a recognized quantitative methodological framework and only a limited set of studies are available within the international scientific community for instance najib et al 2008 used frequency analysis of long daily hydraulic head time series to estimate given the return period the hydraulic head and rainfall events likely to cause extreme groundwater surges responsible for gf within a karst mediterranean aquifer of southern france chebanov and zadniprovska 2011 developed a gis technique for gf risk zoning over six large cities of ukraine through a combination of different map layers of the soil aquifer and underground structures colombo et al 2018 assessed the hydrogeological hazard caused by groundwater rebound for subway and stations of the urban area of milan italy using a stochastic approach yu et al 2019 developed a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model for gf risk assessment in a karst basin of koiliaris river at crete island mancini et al 2020 mapped areas affected by gf based on a parsimonious model which considers both surface and underground hydrological components as a function of different return periods in an urbanized reclamation area of rome italy finally merchán rivera et al 2022 propose a bayesian based approach using a groundwater numerical model to assess the spatio temporal distribution of gf event that occurred in the alz river valley bavaria germany in 2013 developing susceptibility maps based on the exceedance probability of certain groundwater levels and specific cellar depths on this basis and to contribute to the development of a gfh estimation and mapping framework in this paper a methodological procedure of gfh assessment based on a specifically developed matlab code of gfh mapping is presented for the development of the gfh assessment procedure i a time series of groundwater level ii a high resolution model of the groundwater table corresponding to the historical minimum of annual maxima piezometric level and iii a high resolution model of the surface topography subsurface and basements geometry of buildings have been considered to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology and its performance an experimental area of the metropolitan city of naples italy was tested this area hosts a shallow unconfined aquifer system affected in the last decade by gf of private buildings 2 study area 2 1 geologic and hydrogeologic setting the study area is in the eastern sector of metropolitan city of naples italy at 4530000 n and 446 000 e utm 33 n wgs 84 fig 1 a and extends over about 14 km2 it corresponds to northern sector of the casalnuovo di napoli municipality among the most densely populated municipality of italy and europe 75 000 inhabitants and a population density of 10 000 inhabitants km2 at the local scale two hydrogeological complexes crop out in the study area i holocene pyroclastic fluvial complex pf and ii ash fall pyroclastic complex p dated 39 3 39 8 k yrs borehole data fig 1b revealed the presence of a buried tuff horizon with a thickness variable up to 40 m corresponding to the campanian ignimbrite ci in a zeolitized yellow facies dating back to 39 28 0 11 k yrs de vivo et al 2001 the landscape morphology is quite flat with slopes lower than 1 and elevation lower than 30 m a s l the santo spirito stream represents the current drainage system of surface water the study area hosts a mixed land use aquifer system characterized by 45 urbanized 30 of which built and 55 rural areas european environment agency 2018 it is characterized by a heterogeneous and discontinuous multi layered system recharged by direct effective infiltration equal to 300 mm year allocca et al 2014 of the local precipitation and by lateral groundwater flow coming from the upstream aquifer sectors fig 1a and fig 2 the multi layered aquifer system is characterized by an unconfined shallow aquifer hosted in the pf hydrogeological complex and a deep semiconfined aquifer within pyroclastic alluvial deposits underlying ci horizon the 2d hydrostratigraphic model fig 1c allowed defining the top and bottom of the shallow and deep aquifer as well as their average thickness equal to 10 and 100 m respectively locally both aquifers show small differences in terms of potential heads lower than 0 05 m although there are local variations of groundwater flow directions allocca et al 2022 indeed for the deep semiconfined aquifer groundwater flow is about ne sw consistent with groundwater flow scheme at the basin scale fig 1a and the local hydraulic gradient is 8 7 10 4 allocca et al 2022 for the shallow unconfined aquifer groundwater flow is oriented toward n and s fig 1b circumventing locally the ci top and hydraulic gradient varies between 5 9 10 4 and 2 0 10 2 the santo spirito stream interacts negligibly and only occasionally by a slow percolation with the underlying shallow aquifer as the stream is well concrete and characterized by a very ephemeral regime despite being positioned at a level slightly higher than the water table moreover the shallow unconfined aquifer which causes gf of private buildings is characterized by a very high degree of pollution vulnerability and a poor quality state of groundwater mainly related to agricultural activities and urban settlements cusano et al 2019 fusco et al 2020 tufano et al 2020 the groundwater levels of the shallow unconfined aquifer were monitored at the capomazzo well fig 1b from 1929 to 1992 with data missing between 1942 and 1950 by the monitoring network of the national hydrographic and mareographic service nowadays ispra higher institute for environmental protection and research the groundwater level measured at the capomazzo shallow well varies in the pre 1980 period between 23 2 m and 18 2 m a s l fig 2a even if the range of the most frequent values is between 21 5 m and 20 1 m a s l median 20 7 m a s l piezometric levels registered between the 80 s and the beginning of 90 s varies between 20 1 m and 13 9 m a s l while the range of the most frequent values is between 18 7 m and 16 7 m a s l median 18 1 m a s l during the same period piezometric levels have been strongly influenced by groundwater pumping of numerous public and private wells today abandoned for drinking and industrial use coda et al 2019b allocca et al 2022 subsequently in the 2014 and 2019 two piezometers were carried out at a distance lower than 200 m from the capomazzo shallow well fig 1b and equipped with pressure sensor and data logger the monitoring daily data not shown indicate that groundwater level within the shallow unconfined aquifer varies between 20 7 m and 19 1 m a s l in the period 2015 2021 fig 2b even if the range of the most frequent values is between 20 1 m and 19 7 m a s l median 20 m a s l within the deep semiconfined aquifer piezometric levels varies between 20 5 m and 19 3 m a s l in the period 2019 2021 fig 2b while the range of the most frequent values is between 20 2 m and 19 5 m a s l median 20 m a s l the comparison between fig 2a and fig 2b suggests that the historical piezometric data of the capomazzo shallow well used for the hazard modeling fig 2a are comparable with current groundwater levels of shallow water table fig 2b and even the average annual cumulative rainfall is very similar in the two considered periods 2 2 gf characteristics since 1989 withdrawals for drinking and industrial use have been drastically reduced and or suspended due to groundwater quality deterioration deindustrialization process and land use change coda et al 2019a consequently from 1990 onward a remarkable and widespread groundwater rebound has been registered with values up to about 6 m in the study area allocca et al 2022 and 17 m in the surrounding areas in the last years despite groundwater levels recovery has not taken place entirely if compared to the levels of 1920 s fiorelli 1926 frequent gf events of private buildings and underground settlements have been registered the first gf episodes occurred in 2007 affecting private buildings 17 years after the beginning of groundwater rebound unlike the groundwater rebound phenomenon spatially distributed at the municipality scale the gf of private buildings shows a hot spot patterns and a temporally heterogeneous distribution allocca et al 2022 field data collected during the period 2013 2021 by a citizen s survey showed that flooded settlements were mostly built between 1985 and 2000 allocca et al 2022 underground structures such as parking spaces basements foundations garages cellars and lift shafts were affected by gf fig 3 with severe economic consequences allocca et al 2023 fig 3a b provides an overview of the temporal variability from 2010 to 2021 of gf episodes observed at the local scale in 2010 2011 period a total number of 7 private buildings have been affected for a total buildings surface of 6890 m2 in 2014 2015 period flooded buildings increased to 9 flooded surface of 8290 m2 while between 2020 and 2021 are 10 the flooded buildings flooded surface of 8970 m2 currently impacts photos c d e and f in fig 3 and temporal variability of the gf episodes fig 3b are linked to the local hydrological regime fig 2 since the effect of groundwater rebound due to the pumping stop has been completely dissipated 3 materials and methods the proposed gfh assessment procedure is shown in the flow chart of fig 4 in particular as reported in the flow chart at first groundwater level time series fig 4a at the reference station of capomazzo is used as a basis for deriving a probability model fig 4b such model is then used for the construction of a reference probability database fig 4c that in turn represents the basis for relative probability model fig 4d generation subsequently a high resolution groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level over the study area fig 4e is obtained to run the developed procedure of hazard estimation and mapping a digital surface subsurface model dssm fig 4h which simulates the threshold level for flooding by integrating data from digital terrain model fig 4f and basement depth mapping fig 4g is used after data preparation the developed matlab code is run blue circle and the gfh model and associated map are created and classified 3 1 materials for the development of the gfh assessment procedure and its application over the selected study area an i annual maximum groundwater level time series a ii 2 2 m groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level and iii a 2 2 m digital surface and digital terrain models dsm and dtm were used the groundwater level time series in the form of annual maxima was derived by monthly measurements recorded between 1929 and 1980 at the capomazzo well monitoring station located within the study area at 4529779 n and 445 452 e utm 33 n fig 1 the size of the samples is of 44 units and discontinuities are present the 2 2 m groundwater table model depicting the spatial distribution of historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level was derived by allocca et al 2022 and selected on the basis of the approximate correspondence of the groundwater level value at the monitoring well in the water table model with the minimum of the annual maxima time series to compensate the limited deviation between these two values an operation of vertical shifting to the minimum was carried out the 2 2 m dsm was resampled from a 1 1 m lidar dsm acquired between 2011 and 2012 across the italian national territory http www pcn minambiente it mattm progetto pst dati lidar the vertical accuracy of the lidar data has been estimated in 0 25 m resampling was completed using cubic convolution 3 2 gfh assessment procedure 3 2 1 probability analysis of groundwater levels as a first step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment fig 4a c univariate statistical analysis of available time series was completed to identify the minimum and mean values of the time series fig 4a and its standard deviation subsequently a generalized extreme value parametric distribution function gev e g hosking and wallis 1986 was selected to fit the available annual maxima time series i e discontinuous complementary cumulative distribution function registered at the capomazzo shallow well monitoring station fig 4b and estimate the probability of exceedance of each specific groundwater level in the range of interest and related return periods fig 4c the gev function has the following form 1 f x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 where x is the groundwater level ξ is the shape parameter σ is the scale parameter µ is the location parameter of probability distribution ξ governs the tail behavior of the distribution ξ 0 identifies a heavy tailed distribution while ξ 0 a bounded upper tail the case of ξ 0 termed gumbel distribution describes a distribution not upper and lower bounded useful in the case of extreme events analysis for which can be reasonable hypothesized the asymptotic behavior of the tail the probability function f x described by gumbel distribution also called type i extreme value distribution is of type 2 f x exp exp x μ σ where the parameters σ and µ are estimated considering the mean value of the series α and its standard deviation u through the following equations 3 σ 1 283 u 4 μ α 0 45 u the groundwater level time series in form of annual maxima was automatically parametrized using the distribution fitter tool implemented in matlab with respect to a gumbel distribution σ 0 733 μ 22 333 standard error σ 0 088 μ 0 116 this probability model has already been used successfully to model hydrological data such as rainfall extreme tufano et al 2023 this choice is consistent with the guideline of the italian ministry of the ecological transition suggesting that a 300 to 500 year event should be considered as reference scenario in hydrological hazard evaluation perspective 3 2 2 basement mapping and dssm modeling as a second step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment an available 2 2 m dtm fig 4f and field data depicting the presence geometry and depth of building s basements in the study area fig 4g were used to produce a dssm fig 4h starting from the available dsm and dtm a distribution of buildings over the study area was derived by model subtraction and residuals digitalization into a gis environment subsequently a specific field survey was completed acquiring structuralandnon structuraldata about basements and buildings using a citizen science approach thirty days of field survey between july and august 2021 were needed for completing basement inventory over the study areas through a specific datasheet fig 5 predisposed for data acquisition and standardization in absence of information about the year of construction of buildings data were integrated by comparing satellite images of google earth from 1980 s to today once obtained distribution and geometry including depth of basement was processed into a gis environment deriving a 2 2 m discontinuous raster depicting basement depth such raster was subtracted to the available dtm to derive the dssm considered for hazard estimation and mapping this raster contains absolute elevation values corresponding to geometric threshold values indicating the level at which a gf event could occur once groundwater level exceeds that elevation 3 2 3 gfh mapping as a third step of the proposed procedure for gfh assessment the developed matlab code of hazard estimation and mapping was run on the basis of the i probability database a table containing the annual maxima time series fig 4c and data depicting the derived probability model i e simulated magnitude in the form of groundwater level range and corresponding estimated probability of exceedance fig 4c ii 2 2 m groundwater table model of the historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level fig 4e and the iii 2 2 m dssm fig 4h the developed code initially uses the minimum of the annual maxima time series to transform simulated magnitude of the probability database s stage in fig 4c from the observed minimum of 19 47 m a s l to a simulated minimum of 0 m a s l fig 4c d this transformation is needed to generate a relative probability model that can be subsequently assigned to all of the pixels forming the study area in order to derive a specific hazard value this relative probability model represents the overall behavior of the aquifer in terms of annual groundwater fluctuation and serves as the basis for hazard estimation this approach is here considered suitable for hazard mapping in the assumption that over the study area a general increase in groundwater level at a specific position is associated to an equivalent increase in an arbitrary selected different position the generated relative probability model fig 4d in the form of magnitude frequency table is then assigned to each pixel by summing to the simulated magnitude range the value of the historical minimum of annual maxima groundwater level of same pixel in this way a 3d hazard model is fully populated by multiple probability models characterized by a variable vertical magnitude scale at this point gfh assessment through probability of exceedance assignation is completed for each pixel of the study area by considering the absolute elevation value for each pixel of the dssm in particular this value identifies the minimum magnitude of the groundwater level inducing a gf event in other words the geometric threshold for flooding and the corresponding probability of exceedance value represents the hazard at that pixel for each pixel this value is assigned to the hazard model that in this way is fully populated to create a gfh map in terms of both probability of exceedance and related return period fig 4i the gfh map is subsequently classified to better depict probability of flooding on an annual basis between 1 and 0 002 corresponding to a return period of 1 to 500 years it is completed identifying four zones each corresponding to a specific hazard range these zones are selected on the basis of overall hazard distribution and river basins district authorities guidelines https www minambiente it direttive distretti idrografici in particular a i ultra high hazard zone floodable by a 1 to 2 year event a ii very high hazard zone floodable by a 2 to 5 year event a iii high hazard zone floodable by a 5 to 10 year event a iv medium hazard zone floodable by a 10 to 50 year event a v low hazard zone floodable by a 50 to 100 year event and a vi very low hazard zone floodable by a 100 to 500 year event gf magnitude for each specific return period is derived from probability analysis considering that the theoretical return period is the inverse of the probability of exceedance 3 2 4 gfh model validation to validate the gfh model data about gf events occurred in the study area between 2010 and 2021 derived from the database of allocca et al 2022 as well as new data obtained during field surveys of basements in the period july august 2021 were used such data were used to develop a comprehensive gf inventory map that was subsequently compared with the hazard model resulting from the developed procedure model validation was completed in terms of presence absence of gf events and for location in which data about event frequency were available in terms of estimated return period 4 results and discussion 4 1 probability of gf fig 6 reports annual maxima time series univariate statistics and generalized extreme value probability models adopted for gfh assessment using the proposed procedure over the study area the annual maxima time series of fig 6a provides an overview of the decadal variation of groundwater table level at the reference monitoring station indicating that between 1929 and 1980 the minimum water table level was of 19 5 m a s l and the maximum water table level was of 23 4 m a s l in relative terms the minimum and maximum registered water table levels were of 5 5 and 2 6 m below the ground level overall the reconstructed time series indicates a semi sinusoidal trend of the water table level with generally increasing values from 1929 to 1960 and decreasing values from 1960 to 1980 local anomalies are present boxplot of fig 6b indicates that the 25th percentile the median and the 75th percentile correspond to 21 3 22 0 and 22 7 m a s l respectively probability graph of fig 6c shows relative frequency distribution and gev model that fit the theoretical probability of exceedance of groundwater levels forming annual maxima time series r2 0 98 the probability model indicates that at the capomazzo shallow well a 5 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 22 7 m a s l a 10 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 23 m a s l and a 100 year groundwater level is expected to reach a magnitude of 23 5 m a s l uncertainty related to magnitude estimation in relation to events probability is depicted by 95 confidence intervals reported in fig 6c as dashed lines for the analyzed time series confidence intervals indicate a not so large uncertainty related to magnitude estimation also as a consequence of the not so relevant variation of groundwater levels as indicated by the annual maxima time series of fig 6a the gev probability model is able to describe the statistical behavior of hydrological annual maxima but has the disadvantage of underestimating the intensity of very high return period events coles et al 2001 to mitigate this drawback it can be used in combination with probability models that have a higher attitude in estimating low probability events for instance the gamma function that has the potential to better estimate the intensity of very high return period events has been used by guerriero et al 2018 in the context of flood hazard assessment over the central sector of the benevento province model parameterization has been completed using the weighted moment procedure u s water resources council 1982 although it is simple and of fast application a number of authors have indicated that this approach applied to gauged records and historical data is not so efficient in frequency analysis e g wallis and wood 1984 stedinger and cohn 1986 in the case of the proposed analysis this quite low efficiency might be related to an underestimation of the amplitude of the 95 confidence interval similar drawbacks have been recognized by rust et al 2011 they suggested that in presence of limited samples also the maximum likelihood estimator mle tends to underestimate such interval which needs to be carefully determined as a measure of uncertainty associated to hazard evaluation e g apel et al 2004 to mitigate this drawback a bayesian approach can be adopted e g parkes and demeritt 2016 that said the main goal of the paper is to present a procedure of gfh assessment able to work from national to local scale rather than an optimized probability model performance so that the gev model parametrized through the weighted moment procedure is considered able to describe the statistical behavior of groundwater table level data in addition due to the limited number of monitoring points only a single probability model has been considered as representative of the hydrological behavior of the aquifer in terms of groundwater table fluctuation considering the limited extent of the study area and its hydrogeological homogeneity it might be a reasonable assumption for larger areas multiple probability models would be required e g guerriero et al 2019 guerriero et al 2020 as well as the knowledge of boundary conditions between adjacent aquifers 4 2 basement distribution and characteristics table 1 provides an overview of the results of field survey of buildings and basements in the study area 1160 private and public buildings are present but structural and non structural data were collected only for 873 of them about 75 obtained data can be divided according to the period of construction and with reference to the hydrologic regime of the aquifer in i before 1980 ii between 1980 and 2000 and iii after 2000 from a comparison between the three periods no substantial differences emerge in the intended use of buildings conversely some differences in the construction typology have been recognized in particular an increment in the number of buildings with more than three floors is observed in the 1980 2000 period 36 of buildings in the same period 73 of buildings were built with basement for parking and blended cellars and garage uses buildings dating back to this period and thus corresponding to the maximum period of overexploitation of the aquifer system allocca et al 2022 show the deepest basements with values down to 5 m b g l and surface between 28 and 1768 m2 since 2010 eight basements of these buildings have been affected by gf episodes in the pre 1980 period corresponding to the period of moderate groundwater pumping and high piezometric levels allocca et al 2022 only 51 of buildings present basements mostly cellars with depth between 1 and 3 m b g l and surface between 9 and 1559 m2 to date for these buildings no gf event has been recorded in the last 20 years a significant reduction in the construction of buildings and in the number of floors have been observed 74 new buildings 16 of them with more than three floors compared to the 1980 2000 period basements were built in 61 of buildings with depth between 1 5 and 4 m and surface between 41 and 2417 m2 gf evidence has been detected in only two private buildings constructed in this period concerning the type of foundations and construction material of the basements a considerable difficulty has been encountered in finding this type of information despite the high number of unavailable data since the 1980 s an increasing trend can be observed in the use of deep foundation and basements built with reinforced concrete fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of basements and their depth the highest depths are between 3 and 5 m b g l localized mainly in the north western and south western sectors of the study area and for buildings built in the 1980 2000 period and after 2000 the southern sector is characterized by the oldest urban fabric and a depth of basements within 1 2 m survey data have been used as a basis for deriving the dssm fig 7b from the dtm such model depicts the reference level above which a general increase in groundwater table induces a gf event without considering its magnitude in this way it represents a threshold for flooding initiation this datum is needed for identifying the probability of exceedance of a gf event related to a specific fluctuation of the water table level through the proposed approach specifically developed for gf probability of exceedance mapping as indicated by macdonald et al 2008 gf is considered as the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface or into the man made ground independently of its magnitude and duration that is why basement levels are considered as a threshold in constructing the model the use of this threshold is related to the process of developing and populating the three dimensional probability array which contain in each pixel column arrays depicting both probability of exceedance and related magnitude modulated by the minimum water table level for the pixel as derived by the minimum groundwater table model this is a way to relate the probability model to the observed field process i e long term minimum water table level and probability of specific water table level to effectively account for field conditions of gf event initiation in the hazard assessment 4 3 gfh map maps reported in fig 8 depict gfh in the form of probability of exceedance map a and return period map b as resulted by the application of the of developed procedure fig 8a depicts the distribution of areas in which gf has a probability of exceedance higher than 0 002 while fig 8b provides an overview of return period for gf events considering a boundary condition of 500 years i e return period 500 years overall gf events are likely to occur probability of exceedance 0 002 at building basements located in the north western and southern sectors of the study area higher values of gfh in terms of probability of exceedance are observable within the north western sector of the study area where local values approximating the unit are associated to a group of buildings lower values of gfh are distributed over both the north western and south western sectors of the study area where values generally lower than 0 03 are observable local exceptions are characterized by gfh values between 0 1 and 0 5 a further zone characterized by potential gf events as predicted by the hazard model derived by the proposed procedure comprises the s spirito stream fig 8b depicts gfh in terms of events return period through a reclassification of the gfh map into six classes according to the probability of exceedance map buildings potentially involved by gf events display a variable return period buildings located in the north western sector of the study area are characterized by a variable gfh return period from 500 to approximately 1 year while buildings located in the south western sector of the study area are characterized by gfh return period between 5 and 500 years of particular significance is a group of six buildings located in the first sector and characterized by a gfh return period of approximately one year local exceptions consisting in isolated buildings subject to gf events characterized by a return period shorter than 5 years are present the proposed procedure represents in the authors knowledge the first quantitative method for estimating distributed gfh on the basis of probability models and high resolution groundwater table and topographic model accounting for the presence of basements and cellars cobby et al 2009 summarized the advances made in the context of groundwater flood risk management including hazard mapping methods they underlined that field records provide a significant source of data for identifying areas susceptible to gf but such data are not often useful due to under reporting and uncertainty in identifying groundwater as the source of flooding that is why many authors consider gf susceptibility in the context of risk assessment in substitution of hazard mckenzie et al 2010 chebanov and zadniprovska 2011 naughton et al 2017 considering the described potential issues related to field data availability the proposed procedure considers only hydrological data consisting in groundwater table level measured at a specific monitoring well as a source of information for hazard assessment in this way field data can be used to validate the model in terms of extent and eventually return period limitation in amount of available data can be somehow considered of less importance for validation in comparison to eventual needs in terms of model calibration in addition cobby et al 2009 indicated that while at a regional scale hazard mapping has achieved some success further development of the techniques and the production of finer scale maps is hampered by a paucity of data and the difficulty in assigning probabilities of flood occurrence to zones of susceptibility five approaches have been proposed by jacobs 2007 to estimate probabilities of gf on the basis of i observed flooding ii drivers i e rainfall or effective rainfall iii surrogates i e groundwater levels iv combination of drivers and surrogates and v mathematical modelling in the case of the proposed procedure surrogate data consisting in groundwater levels are considered this makes potentially possible to extent the procedure to the whole italian national territory and all of the regions where such data are available limitation of the proposed procedure are related to the need of a statistically significant time series of groundwater table level which might not often be available and a reconstruction of the geometry of the groundwater table of the selected study area in addition it is important to consider that the assumption of time independence of such geometry is of basic importance for the application of the procedure for alluvial aquifers where gf events are common this assumption might be consistent with the effective process of water table fluctuation in aquifers with different characteristics and flow mechanism this assumption might not work 4 4 validation procedure performance evaluation was carried out through comparison between location in which gf events have been predicted by the gfh model fig 8 and available data in terms of location and frequency fig 3 comparison indicates a perfect correspondence in terms of position and frequency return period between locations in which the model predicts gf events with a return period of 1 year and those reported in fig 3 using blue and yellow colors correspondence in position has been also observed for three locations in which a return period of 2 to 5 years has been predicted by the gfh model and a return period of one year was estimated from field observations at further locations predicted as floodable from 5 to 10 years and higher return periods events no significant gf events were observed however considering that field observations for flooding episodes of buildings are available only for the last eleven years the estimation of model performance can be based only on a comparison between field data and predicted gf events with return period lower than 10 years i e purple to magenta areas of fig 8b based on this assumption of twelve locations in which gf events were predicted by the model only two do not correspond to locations in which a gf event was registered 85 of correspondence in terms of frequency return period of the twelve considered locations six are characterized by a consistent frequency return period 50 of correspondence 5 conclusions gf is an emerging hazard for many urban and rural alluvial areas and low elevation coastal regions of the world it can cause displacement of people damage the environment compromise anthropogenic activities and undermine the socio economic development of entire cities gfh mapping is an urgent issue from national to community scale and is a basis to plan mitigation actions and to make cities more resilient and safer in this paper we have proposed a new procedure to assess gfh based on a univariate statistical analysis of a long time series of hydrological data and a specifically developed matlab code of probability mapping despite the presence of the italian legislative decree 49 2010 as transposition of the directive 2007 60 ec at national scale which committed the national river basin district authorities to implement by 2013 gfh maps on the hydrographic basin scale to the authors knowledge the present study is the first one procedure in italy providing a methodological framework and related gfh maps of an urban environment it has been applied and tested in an unconfined semi urban aquifer of the metropolitan city of naples affected by gf of private buildings since 2010 and for which a wide groundwater database is available as well as systematic mapping of flooded buildings the obtained gfh map shows the return period of the event able to produce gf at each pixel of the model the comparison between gfh map and gf inventory map is very encouraging since seven of the ten flooded buildings fall into zones with a return period between 1 and 2 years while the other three are involved in 2 to 5 year events the development of the procedure has been possible due to the presence of a long term time history of groundwater levels measured at the capomazzo shallow well ispra historical archive dismissed since 1992 the availability of such data provides a unique opportunity of investigating gfh within a widely urbanized and densely populated area of the metropolitan city of naples for this reason the recovery and implementation of the old hydrological monitoring network by the ispra and regional environmental protection agencies in italian arpas would be desirable on this basis the implemented procedure has the potential to be applied in urban semi urban and rural areas without any limitation related to spatial scale and model resolution the achievable results can be considered as a new tool to assist local government authorities and decision makers in addressing the problems deriving from gf e g supporting land planning and the design of mitigation measures and represent a first step toward gf risk assessment as

1906,preserving terminal lakes in arid inland basins by satisfying environmental water requirements is critical for sustainable watershed management a framework was proposed to assess environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions the framework incorporated water balance model construction time series analysis scenario simulation and dual objective optimization providing dynamic environmental management objectives for terminal lakes the dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical than the static ones because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions the framework was applied in the big aral sea in central asia a representative terminal lake suffering from a shortage of environmental water supply as a result of the compounding effect of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation the lake shrank dramatically from 1950 to 2001 with the water level decreasing from 52 90 m to 32 67 m the reduced runoff dominated the lake s shrinkage dropping the water level by 19 11 m the enhanced evaporation aggravated this process lowering the water level by 1 12 m the lake management objectives and associated environmental water requirements were obtained for wet normal and dry years given the impact of meteorological conditions on lake water budgets the environmental water requirement was indicated by river inflow into the lake in a wet normal and dry year the objective of preserving the water level to 33 96 32 34 and 30 82 m and the lake area to 21 94 17 53 and 13 37 thousand km2 required an environmental water supply of 13 10 and 7 km3 respectively results from this case study showed the rationality and practicality of the framework which would be an effective tool for environmental water assessment keywords lake preservation water budgets copula function dual objective optimization scenario simulation environmental management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction endorheic basins also known as closed basins are primarily situated in arid and semiarid regions covering approximately 11 4 of the global land li et al 2018 li et al 2017 the intrinsic scarcity of water resources rapid social and economic development and global warming have caused overexploitation of water resources and net water storage reductions in endorheic basins wang et al 2018 as a result endorheic basins have suffered from environmental and ecological crises such as land degradation and desertification biodiversity loss and ecosystem degeneration and the drying up of terminal lakes zhu et al 2016 the aral sea basin in central asia is a case in point the history of the aral sea which experienced a transition from prosperity to decline is one of the most classic ecological disasters of the 20th century induced by irrational water resource utilization beek et al 2011 the aral sea was formerly one of the world s largest lakes furnishing essential ecological and economic services including fisheries and shipping mcdermid and winter 2017 multiple human interferences particularly industrializing agricultural development and dam construction have modified the aral sea basin s hydrological processes and water budgets cretaux et al 2013 the most recent shrinkage initiated in the early 1960s the lake volume decreased by 90 and the water salinity increased from 10 g l to more than 100 g l micklin 2007 this situation triggered negative environmental ecological and economic impacts including the exposure of the lake bed that led to dust and salt storms degradation of deltaic and aquatic biodiversity and collapse of fisheries and shipping micklin 2007 sustainable watershed management requires an integrated effort to coordinate socio economic development and environmental preservation restraining overexploitation and reallocating water resources between natural and socio economic systems satisfy environmental water requirements and restore deteriorated ecosystems this strategy has successfully resurrected the juyan lake in the heihe river basin and the qingtu oasis in the shiyang river basin in northwest china huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 for designing the water resources allocation strategy a key is to assess environmental water requirements for terminal lakes which means the water regimes needed to maintain the lake in a certain water level and surface area to sustain the ecological values of lake ecosystems sajedipour et al 2017 shadkam et al 2016 from the perspective of terminal lakes water budgets the environmental water requirements are sensitive to meteorological conditions because precipitation is the important inflow component while evaporation is typically the primary outflow component hamzekhani et al 2016 previous studies have proposed methodologies to address this key by establishing terminal lakes optimum areas as management objectives and estimating environmental water requirements to achieve these objectives huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 one of the typical features of terminal lakes environmental and ecological crises is lake desiccation and surface area shrinkage a rational lake area is a vital management objective for curbing lake shrinkage and recovering degraded aquatic ecosystems optimization methodologies suggest the management objectives when assessing the terminal lakes optimum areas which balance the trade off between water cost and ecological benefit huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 larger lake areas require more water input experience more water loss through evaporation and restrain socio economic water use resulting in aggravated water conflicts between natural and socio economic systems it is usually unnecessary and unrealistic to restore terminal lakes to their original volumes and surface areas instead a reasonable restoration target has a solid practical guiding significance huang and ochoa 2022 in viewing evaporation as an essential factor affecting lakes water budgets terminal lakes optimum areas should be adjusted with varying meteorological conditions the environmental water requirements corresponding to management objectives are evaluated using water balance equations among which evaporation and precipitation are critical variables therefore the evaluation results are highly dependent on meteorological conditions however few studies have paid attention to the impact of meteorological conditions on estimating terminal lakes preservation objectives and the associated environmental water requirements a knowledge gap exists in adjusting the protected lake areas and the corresponding environmental water requirements in wet normal and dry years water resources are relatively abundant in wet years and provide the potential for restoring a terminal lake to a larger area in contrast the preservation objective in dry years should be adjusted to a lower level due to the limited water resources and more attention should be paid to ensuring human water needs this study aimed to develop a framework for estimating environmental water requirements of terminal lakes under varying meteorological conditions the framework incorporated copula functions to design wet normal and dry meteorological conditions and used dual objective optimization methods to evaluate environmental water requirements an environment weighted distance was suggested to identify the optimal solution this distance involves the relative importance of lake protection compared with socio economic development and varies with meteorological conditions the novelty was embodied in proposing dynamic management objectives which were adaptive to meteorological conditions the framework was applied in the big aral sea in central asia as a representative case study the application s results could provide vital implications for the countries in the aral sea basin to enhance collaboration in integrated water resources management to recover and preserve the big aral sea the framework proposed by this study would be a practical tool for evaluating the environmental water requirements of terminal lakes in worldwide endorheic basins 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area the aral sea lies in the arid continental monsoon climate zone fig 1 where the multi year mean temperature is 9 4 mu et al 2019 the aral sea basin covers 1 8 106 km2 within seven nations uzbekistan turkmenistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan afghanistan and iran micklin 2007 two main rivers flow through the basin and feed the aral sea the syrdarya or syr darya river and the amudarya or amu darya river accounting for nearly 80 of the total inflow before the 1950 s cretaux et al 2013 in the first half of the 20th century the aral sea volume and surface area varied moderately due to sufficient river inflow that compensated for evaporation loss and moderated annual variations in lake water budgets since the 1960 s the aral sea began shrinking and suffered from thirst because regional water requirements for irrigating cotton and wheat led to prominent river inflow reduction and negatively biased lake water budgets as a result the aral sea separated into two entities after 1986 one entity was the small aral sea in the north which mainly received streamflow from the syrdarya river the other entity was the big aral sea in the south fed primarily by the amudarya river micklin 2007 detailed information on meteorology geography hydrology and water resources of the aral sea basin can be found in the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia https www cawater info net it may be unrealistic to recover the aral sea in the foreseeable future completely but it is feasible to rehabilitate and preserve portions of the water body and deltas micklin 2007 the small aral sea has benefited from the restoration efforts of the world bank and the government of kazakhstan which jointly completed an 85 million usd project in the autumn of 2005 the project constructed a 13 km dike to block the flow from the small to big aral sea and the dam regulated the water level of the small aral sea at 42 m the water level regulation freshened the water body and improved the ecological and fishery prospects of the small aral sea by contrast more efforts are still necessary for the big aral sea to reduce the lake recession and partially recover its ecosystem services 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data precipitation and evaporation are two essential factors affecting the water budgets of terminal lakes this study collected meteorological data from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia which produced the datasets by interpolating observed data at monitoring stations https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg the cru gridded time series is a widely used climate dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 over all land domains except antarctica harris et al 2020 previous studies indicated that the datasets are suitable for central asia and applicable to the aral sea deng and chen 2017 harris et al 2020 the meteorological data spanned from 1901 to 2020 precipitation and evaporation over the aral sea region were extracted from the original high resolution gridded datasets the spatial mean values were calculated to characterize the lake s meteorological conditions analyzing lake water budgets also requires data for lake water level surface area and river inflow into the lake this study obtained hydrological data from the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia https www cawater info net the water level and surface area data of the aral sea spanned from 1911 to 2018 and the streamflow data of the amudarya and syrdarya rivers spanned from 1950 to 2001 3 methods 3 1 methodological framework fig 2 illustrates the flowchart for estimating the environmental water requirements of terminal lakes under varying meteorological conditions long term observations are essential for identifying environmental changes constructing a water balance model and assessing environmental water requirements the data includes critical water budget components such as river inflow groundwater inflow precipitation evaporation and water level to mention a few time series analysis helps unravel any trends and abrupt changes embedded in long term observations indicating climate hydrological and environmental alterations the water balance model is constructed based on the assumption that water inflow and outflow balance the change rate of lake storage the model acts as an effective tool to simulate the water level and the associated lake area under different meteorological scenarios combining the water balance model and time series analysis identifies critical factors driving the lake s environmental changes providing implications for lake restoration and preservation the copula function links marginal distributions of precipitation and evaporation resulting in a joint distribution for designing wet normal and dry meteorological scenarios coupled with scenario analysis the water balance model simulates water level and lake area under varying meteorological conditions providing data inputs for optimizing river inflow that indicates environmental water requirements dual objective optimization achieves an optimal solution for balancing water cost and lake benefit i e minimizing the river inflow into the lake while maximizing the lake area the results indicate the rational water level lake area and the associated environmental water requirements which can be incorporated into integrated water resources management given the uncertainty in data observation model structure and parameterization and objective optimization adaptive adjustment is necessary to refine the water balance model and re evaluate the environmental water requirements using the updated data 3 2 water balance model 3 2 1 model description terminal lakes mainly receive streamflow discharging into the lake precipitation is another water input though it is usually scarce a significant water loss of terminal lakes is evaporation caused by dry climate conditions besides river inflow precipitation and evaporation lake storage is also affected by subsurface water interactions the lake can be replenished by groundwater or the lake replenishes groundwater through seepage the exchanges between surface water and groundwater are complicated however it is usually challenging to quantify their interactions accurately due to low data availability previous studies suggested that the aral sea is fed by river and groundwater inflows gascoin and renard 2005 the aral sea received streamflow from the amudarya river and the syrdarya river before the lake separated into the big and small aral seas in 1986 after that the big aral sea mainly received streamflow from the amudarya river besides hydrological factors meteorological factors i e precipitation and evaporation are vital water budget components in this context the water balance equation of the aral sea can be simplified as follows 1 d z d t q r a q g a 10 3 p 10 3 e where z is the lake water level unit m a is the lake surface area unit thousand km2 t indicates the time step set as one year in this study q r is river inflow and q g is groundwater inflow unit km3 p represents precipitation and e represents evaporation respectively unit mm q r was the sum of the streamflow of the amudarya river and the syrdarya river when modeling the water level of the aral sea it was the streamflow of the amudarya river when modeling the water level of the big aral sea the surface area of the aral sea non linearly increases with the rising water level the curve fitting analysis using the long term lake area and water level data suggested two functions for quantifying the correlation between a and z of the aral sea and the big aral sea respectively 2 a as 2854 45 186 16 z 4 00 z 2 0 0288 z 3 a bas 281 77 30 29 z 1 03 z 2 0 0107 z 3 where a as is the surface area of the aral sea unit thousand km2 and a bas represents the surface area of the big aral sea unit thousand km2 hydrological data availability of the aral sea restrains the investigation into surface water and groundwater interactions the water budget is simplified by focusing on the net water flow replenished by groundwater instead of analyzing the exchanges between surface water and groundwater in the absence of groundwater data groundwater inflow into the lake is assumed to be positively correlated with the river inflow and is estimated using an empirical logarithmic function 3 q g a g ln b g q r 1 c g where a g b g and c g are three dimensionless parameters that need to be calibrated and verified using the observed data 3 2 2 model calibration and validation the simplified water balance model uses river inflow precipitation and evaporation as inputs and produces lake water level and the corresponding lake surface area the model has three parameters in the empirical function for estimating groundwater inflow the hydro meteorological data were separated into two parts one for calculating the parameters and the other for validating the model performance the model was calibrated using the data from 1950 to 1979 and validated using the data from 1980 to 2001 the model parameterization used the coupled bayesian inference and the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method which has been widely used in science and engineering to reconcile earth system models with data haario et al 2006 haario et al 2001 schaefli and kavetski 2017 vrugt 2016 the mcmcstat matlab package available from github https github com mjlaine mcmcstat git parameterized the aral sea water balance model because the mcmc approach initiated parameter estimation from non optimized values a trial and error process takes time for the chain to locate the optimal estimation of parameters therefore the model was parameterized using the chain with one hundred thousand samples the chain was conducted in three runs initiating from the values of the previous run and the last running chain s mean value resulted in the model parameter estimation the water balance model s performance was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse which are commonly used performance evaluators huang et al 2021a sadegh et al 2017 3 3 time series analysis 3 3 1 trend and abrupt change the trend of hydro meteorological series e g water level precipitation and evaporation were detected by linear regression analysis coupled with the mann kendall m k algorithm the fitted linear regression line illustrated the trend and the linear regression equation s slope quantified the tendency s magnitude the m k test ascertained whether the variation was significant at a significance level of 0 05 the python package pymannkendall https pypi org project pymannkendall supported the trend detection and the published literature introduced detailed information on the m k test s algorithms huang et al 2012 hussain and mahmud 2019 yue et al 2002 an abrupt change might exist in the hydro meteorological series except for the trend the heuristic segmentation algorithm was used to identify the change point given its successful application in previous studies huang et al 2020 huang et al 2012 detailed description on the heuristic segmentation algorithm can be found in published materials feng et al 2005 huang et al 2012 consistent with the significance level of the m k test that of the heuristic segmentation algorithm was also set to be 0 05 3 3 2 the impact of hydro meteorological changes the aral sea recession resulted from decreased runoff and increased evaporation the water balance model combined with scenario analysis helped identify the key driver and its corresponding contribution the simulated data were used to assess the impact of hydro meteorological changes considering the data s consistency and comparability two scenarios were simulated using the water balance model a the water level was modeled using the original river inflow precipitation and evaporation data the initial water level in 1950 was denoted as z 0 providing a benchmark for assessing the lake recession the simulated water level in 2001 was designated as z q r p e which was impacted by both hydrological and meteorological alterations b the water level was modeled using the detrended meteorological data instead of the original data the long term meteorological data were detrended by removing any trend in the original series the trend was analyzed using the linear regression method resulting in a one degree polynomial equation and was removed from the original data producing a stationary time series liu and yang 2010 mahmoud and gan 2020 the detrended evaporation of the aral sea was denoted as e d the water balance model driven by the original river inflow precipitation and detrended evaporation produced a water level series that was not affected by evaporation changes the simulated water level in 2001 in this series was denoted as z q r p e d the impact of hydro meteorological changes on the aral sea recession was evaluated by comparing the water levels in different scenarios 4 δ z h m z 0 z q r p e δ z h z 0 z q r p e d δ z m z q r p e d z q r p e where δ z h indicates the water level change caused by runoff reduction δ z m is the water level change impacted by the enhanced evaporation and δ z h m quantifies the combined impact of hydrological and meteorological changes 3 4 environmental water requirements 3 4 1 meteorological conditions the long term data from 1901 to 2020 were used to design the meteorological conditions of the aral sea the joint distribution of precipitation and evaporation was constructed using their marginal distributions the marginal distribution of precipitation was fitted using the gamma distribution and that of evaporation was fitted using the burr distribution the archimedean copula function was used when constructing the joint distribution because it has a simple form and does not need to have the same marginal distribution wong et al 2010 zhao et al 2020 the joint distribution of precipitation and evaporation was analyzed using the frank copula a typical archimedean copula function the marginal and joint distributions were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation the methods for estimating empirical probabilities can be found in published literature zhang 2005 zhang et al 2011 the goodness of fit between the theoretical and empirical probabilities was evaluated using nse r and rmse huang et al 2021a sadegh et al 2017 the marginal and joint distributions of precipitation and evaporation provided a crucial basis for designing various meteorological conditions a typical wet year was supposed to have abundant precipitation with less evaporation in contrast a typical dry year was supposed to have less precipitation with greater evaporation therefore the wet normal and dry meteorological conditions were designed as 5 f p p wet 0 75 f c e wet p wet f p p wet 0 25 6 f p p normal 0 50 f c e normal p normal f p p normal 0 50 7 f p p dry 0 25 f c e dry p dry f p p dry 0 75 where fp is the cumulative probability function of precipitation and fc is the cumulative joint probability of copula function of precipitation and evaporation p wet p normal and p dry indicates the precipitation in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions respectively correspondingly e wet e normal and e dry represents the evaporation in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions respectively the designed precipitation values of p wet p normal and p dry were calculated using the marginal distribution of precipitation f c f p calculates the conditional probability of evaporation under the designed precipitation the evaporation s probability under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions i e f e e wet f e e normal and f e e dry were analyzed using the copula function the designed evaporation values of e wet e normal and e dry were calculated using the marginal distribution of evaporation 3 4 2 dual objective optimization the heuristic segmentation algorithm detected an abrupt change point in the streamflow series of the amudarya river segmenting the original data into two sub series the pre impacted and post impacted ones the probability distribution of the pre impacted streamflow data was fitted using the birnbaum saunders function the approaches for estimating distribution parameters calculating empirical probabilities and testing goodness of fit were the same as analyzing the meteorological variables distributions based on the theoretical distribution the streamflow values corresponding to the probabilities of 0 75 0 50 and 0 25 were estimated as the total water resources in wet normal and dry years the total water resources minus environmental water requirements resulted in available water resources for socio economic systems the post impacted streamflow series of the amudarya river suggested that the water discharging into the big aral sea ranged from 0 to 24 km3 in case of intense water withdrawal for agricultural development therefore 25 scenarios under each meteorological condition were modeled to assess the big aral sea s response to altered river inflow the river inflow was set to be 0 1 2 22 23 and 24 km3 with a unique interval of 1 km3 each scenario was labeled by an integer i i 1 2 3 23 24 25 the lake water level in 2001 was used as the initial status and the water balance model was run until reaching a zero lake storage change and a stable water level for the stationary status of different scenarios under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions lake benefit and water cost were compared and the ideal point method ipm was used to analyze the appropriate target of lake recovery huang et al 2021a huang et al 2021b shang 2008 the lake s ecological benefit was indicated by the water surface area which is a critical objective for ecological restoration and preservation si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the increased water surface area would limit the exposed lake bed and mitigate dust and salt storms a larger water surface area would provide more aquatic habitat and benefit biodiversity recovery the water cost was measured by river inflow into the lake socio economic development requires more water availability and restrains river inflow into the lake however lake recovery and preservation need adequate river inflow therefore two competing objectives were considered a minimizing river inflow to increase water resources availability for socio economic systems and b maximizing lake area to enhance ecological benefit and resilience it is impossible to reduce the river inflow while enlarging the lake area dimensionless values were used to solve this dual objective optimization 8 q r n q r q r min q r max q r min a n a a min a max a min where q r n and a n is the normalized river inflow and the normalized lake area respectively the minimum and maximum river inflow into the big aral sea were 0 and 24 km3 the minimum and maximum areas of the big aral sea were 0 and 39 thousand km2 the objectives optimal values form a supposed point that usually has no option to reach namely the ideal point 9 q r n i 0 a n i 1 the ideal point is to have a normalized river inflow of 0 and a normalized lake area of 1 which minimizes water cost and maximizes ecological benefit the ipm ranks the options according to their distances to the ideal point following the normalized river inflow and lake area correspondence the option with a shorter distance to the ideal point has a better trade off between water cost and ecological benefit therefore the option with the minimum distance is closest to the ideal point and can be taken as the pareto solution to the dual objective problem shang 2008 the environment weighted distance d i between a scenario q r n i a n i to the supposed reference situation q r n i a n i is 10 d i q r n i 2 w 2 1 a n i 2 where w is the weight coefficient characterizing the importance of environmental preservation when the weight coefficient is 1 satisfying environmental and socio economic water requirements is equally important when the weight coefficient is greater than 1 satisfying environmental water requirements is more important than satisfying socio economic water requirements and vice versa meeting socio economic water requirements is a priority in a dry year because the drought would adversely affect agricultural production access to safe water and worker productivity by making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable the drought would force many people to become refugees levy and patz 2015 the total water resources vary with meteorological conditions given that the water resources are abundant in wet years it is suggested to allocate more water for lake recovery and restore the degraded lake ecosystems the weight coefficient is set to be greater than 1 enlarging water allocation for lake preservation on the contrary more effort is necessary to satisfy human beings water requirements in dry years when water resources are scarce the weight coefficient is suggested to be less than 1 enhancing the available water resources for socio economic systems therefore the weight coefficient is recommended to vary with meteorological conditions 11 w w max w min f p p w min where f p p is the probability of precipitation w max and w min are the maximum and minimum values of the weight coefficient respectively the weight coefficient is suggested to range from 0 5 to 1 5 correspondingly the weight coefficient in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions is 1 25 1 00 and 0 75 respectively for each river inflow scenario under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions q r n i and a n i was calculated respectively their distances to the supposed ideal point were measured using the environment weighted distance the river inflow with the minimum distance to the ideal point was taken as the optimal environmental water requirement the balanced water level and lake area responding to this river inflow were suggested to be the environmental management targets 4 results and discussion 4 1 water balance model of the aral sea the correlation between groundwater inflow and river inflow of the aral sea was quantified using the following logarithmic function obtained from data graphed in fig 3 a 12 q g 2 72 ln 0 90 q r 1 3 65 the performance evaluators of model calibration showed satisfying matches between the observed and simulated water levels indicating the reliable estimation of the model parameters fig 3b when validating the model performance the water level data were scattered alongside the 1 1 line resulting in good performance evaluators fig 3c the model performance during calibration and validation showed its efficacy in simulating the water level of the aral sea the long term water level of the aral sea was modeled from 1950 to 2001 fig 3d the simulated water level matched well with the observed one and successfully reproduced the hydrological processes as the lake water level declined when comparing the simulated water level with the observed one nse and r reached 0 99 and rmse was 0 37 m 4 2 hydrological and meteorological changes of the aral sea the heuristic segmentation algorithm identified significant abrupt changes in the river inflow into the aral sea fig 4 before the aral sea was separated into the two relatively big and small entities the river inflows into the lake was the total streamflow of the amudarya and syrdarya rivers the amudarya river fed the big aral sea after 1986 the river inflow and groundwater inflow into the aral sea sharply decreased in 1974 the analysis of the observed river inflow data suggested that from 1950 to 1973 the multi year mean value of river inflow was 50 75 km3 but it declined to 8 69 km3 from 1974 to 2001 given the empirical correlation between groundwater and river inflows the groundwater inflow was estimated using equation 12 corresponding to the significant reduction in river inflow the multi year mean value of groundwater inflow dropped from 13 97 km3 to 8 76 km3 as a result the total runoff feeding the aral sea decreased significantly in 1974 the multi year mean value from 1950 to 1973 was 64 72 km3 but it was 17 45 km3 from 1974 to 2001 dropping by 47 27 km3 the precipitation of the aral sea remained relatively stable from 1950 to 2001 despite a slight upward trend in yearly precipitation fig 5 a the m k algorithm did not detect a trend in the precipitation series that was statistically significant at the 0 05 level the temporal dynamic of evaporation was different from the precipitation with a statistically significant trend being observed the m k algorithm confirmed this significant upward trend in the evaporation series and the linear regression suggested that the rising slope reached 17 61 mm 10a for terminal lakes the water balance determines the equilibrium water level and is strongly forced by the total runoff precipitation and evaporation thus the dramatically reduced runoff and increased evaporation would significantly drop the lake water level since the small observed increase in precipitation was insufficient to compensate for the water loss the upward trend was removed from the actual evaporation of the aral sea resulting in a stationary evaporation series fig 6 a comparing the water level modeled using the actual evaporation with the water level modeled using the detrended evaporation shed light on the driving factors of lake recession fig 6b the initial water level of the aral sea in 1950 was 52 90 m corresponding to a lake area of 63 21 thousand km2 when simulated using the actual evaporation the water level of the big aral sea was 32 67 m in 2001 the water level was lowered by 20 23 m due to the coupled impact of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation when simulated using the detrended evaporation the influence of the evaporation increment was removed and the runoff reduction led to a water level of 33 79 m in 2001 dropping by 19 11 m the decreased runoff dominated the lake shrinkage and the increased evaporation aggravated this process lowering the water level of the big aral sea by 1 12 m the big aral sea s area in 2001 was 18 45 and 21 49 thousand km2 respectively when simulated using the actual and detrended evaporation the lake area shrank by 44 76 thousand km2 of which 41 72 thousand km2 was attributed to runoff reduction and the remainder 3 04 thousand km2 was due to evaporation increase the results suggested that feeding the big aral sea with a certain amount of river inflow was necessary to maintain the lake area 4 3 environmental water requirements of the big aral sea an abrupt change detected by the heuristic segmentation algorithm segmented the streamflow series of the amudarya river into two sub series fig 7 a the pre impacted streamflow series spanned from 1950 to 1973 with a multi year mean value of 39 89 km3 the post impacted streamflow series spanned from 1974 to 2001 with a multi year mean value of 8 30 km3 reduced by 31 59 km3 the pre impacted streamflow data were used to fit the probability distribution using the birnbaum saunders function providing the basis for estimating the total water resources in different water years fig 7b the theoretical probability matched well with the empirical probability resulting in good performance evaluators fig 7c the fitted birnbaum saunders function suggested the amudarya river streamflows of 47 38 and 31 km3 in wet normal and dry years the long term meteorological data from 1901 to 2020 were used to construct the marginal and joint probability distributions fig 8 the performance evaluators indicated that the gamma function fitted well with the precipitation probability distribution and the burr function fitted well with the evaporation probability distribution the data points were scattered closely alongside the 1 1 line indicating suitable matches between the theoretical and empirical probabilities fig 8a and fig 8b the frank copula function worked well to link the marginal distributions of precipitation and evaporation providing the solid basis for designing various meteorological conditions fig 8c in wet normal and dry years the precipitation was 152 133 and 116 mm the evaporation was 1226 1269 and 1317 mm respectively driven by the designed precipitation and evaporation in wet normal and dry years the water balance model predicted the water level of the big aral sea responding to various river inflows fig 9 a the simulated water levels in the wet year were distributed at the top because abundant precipitation and moderate evaporation positively contributed to the water budget conversely the simulated water levels in the dry year were located at the bottom because scarce precipitation and intense evaporation negatively affected the water budget the modeled water levels in wet normal and dry years rose with the increased river inflows resulting in expanded lake areas fig 9b and their associated ecological benefits the river inflows and the corresponding balanced water levels were normalized to analyze the trade off between water cost and lake benefit fig 10 a the distances to the ideal point suggested the optimal river inflow to maintain a proper water level and lake area fig 10b in a wet year the environmental water requirement was 13 km3 resulting in a water level of 33 96 m and a lake area of 21 94 thousand km2 given the total water resources of 47 km3 the available water resources for the socio economic system were 34 km3 in a normal year the environmental water requirement was lowered to 10 km3 corresponding to a water level of 32 34 m and a lake area of 17 53 thousand km2 the total water resources of 38 km3 in the normal year were also less than that in the wet year and the available water resources for the socio economic system were 28 km3 in a dry year the environmental water requirement was further reduced to 7 km3 preserving a water level of 30 82 m and a lake area of 13 37 thousand km2 the total water resources were 31 km3 and the available water resources for the socio economic system were 24 km3 4 4 implications for preserving terminal lakes the present study provided the big aral sea with dynamic environmental management objectives which varied with meteorological conditions and water resources compared with static management objectives e g a fixed lake area to recover dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions for the static management objective a fixed lake area to recover needed more river inflow to compensate for the evaporation loss in a dry year but less river inflow in a wet year it is unreasonable because guaranteeing human water needs should be a priority in a dry year and less water should be allocated for lake preservation the dynamic management objectives addressed this issue by preserving a smaller lake area in a dry year that restrained river inflow and satisfied human water demands while recovering a larger lake area in a wet year when more river inflow was available the dual objective optimization proposed restoration targets and the associated environmental water requirements which balanced the trade off between the water requirements of the lake and socio economic systems assessing environmental water requirements informed the water allocation strategy to preserve the lake the water allocations between the lake and socio economic systems could vary over time depending on meteorological conditions it meant that the lake could receive different amounts of water each year in the wet normal and dry years the environmental water requirements were 13 10 and 7 km3 and the allocated water resources for the socio economic system were 34 28 and 24 km3 respectively in a dry year a greater water allocation to the socio economic system ensured access to critical human water needs e g domestic and agricultural water demands the lake received a relatively less allocation of water until meteorological conditions improved if a wet year followed this dry year a greater allocation for environmental water requirements helped recover the lake and the critical human water needs were still guaranteed due to the increased total water resources given a certain meteorological status the lake s ecological benefit would suffer significant loss if the river inflow was less than the proposed environmental water requirement on the other hand an overly idealistic restoration target for the big aral sea is unrealistic due to water resources overexploitation the current big aral sea is far from the suggested restoration target due to the limited river inflow human activities especially damming and irrigation are the dominant factors influencing the long term variation of the aral sea wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 after the disintegration of the soviet union total runoff into the aral sea was negatively impacted by inefficient and unsustainable irrigation water use shi et al 2020 the increased use of advanced drip irrigation technology was suggested as a means to release more water into the big aral sea and ameliorate the ecological crisis shi et al 2020 the big aral sea represents an illustrative case for applying the proposed framework which is also practical for other terminal lakes when using this framework for estimating environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions the design probability of precipitation and evaporation can be set according to actual needs for example the precipitation probability of a wet year can be set to be 0 9 while that of a dry year can be 0 1 the marginal distribution functions of precipitation and evaporation and their joint distribution function are determined by meteorological statistical features likewise the probability distribution of streamflow is suggested by hydrological statistical characteristics the univariate distribution function candidates include gamma birnbaum saunders beta exponential extreme value and generalized extreme value functions to mention a few the copula function of bivariate joint probability distribution includes gaussian clayton frank gumbel and joe copula functions to mention a few some toolboxes help estimate the parameters of marginal and joint distribution functions like the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh et al 2017 when assessing the distance of a scenario to the ideal point in optimization analysis the weight coefficient can be higher given the priority of ecological preservation which is determined by watershed management policy initiatives 4 5 limitations and future research the big aral sea case study simulated the long term water level dynamics from 1950 to 2001 however the hydrological response of the big aral sea to climate change and anthropogenic interference in the recent two decades was not included due to limited data availability the data series length could raise some uncertainties in selecting empirical functions and estimating the water balance model s parameters as a result it could affect the accuracy of assessing the big aral sea s environmental water requirements when applying this preliminary assessment results in water resources allocation and lake restoration adaptive adjustment is necessary to achieve the management objectives future research will include efforts to collect more recent data these data will be used to update the parameters of the water balance model and probability distributions enhancing the accuracy of assessment results the refined model and updated assessment results will be applied in water resources allocation and lake restoration for further verification which provides feedback for improving environmental water assessments another limitation is that only one case study was implemented to test the proposed framework future research will further test this framework s applicability feasibility and reliability in other terminal lakes 5 conclusions the big aral sea shrank dramatically from 1950 to 2001 with the water level retreating from 52 90 m to 32 67 m dropping by 20 23 m the water balance model combined with the scenario analysis indicated that the lake shrinkage resulted from the coupled impact of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation the small observed increase in precipitation was insufficient to compensate for the water loss the reduction in runoff feeding the big aral sea dominated the water level declination reducing the water level by 19 11 m the enhanced evaporation aggravated the lake recession lowering the water level by 1 12 m preserving the big aral sea requires a certain amount of inflowing runoff to recover and maintain the lake water budget the proposed framework for estimating environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions suggested dynamic environmental management objectives for the big aral sea in a wet year with abundant water resources the preservation objective was to recover the water level to 33 96 m and the lake area to 21 94 thousand km2 with an environmental water requirement of 13 km3 in a normal year the preservation objective was adjusted to recover the water level to 32 34 m and the lake area to 17 53 thousand km2 correspondingly the environmental water requirement was lowered to 10 km3 in a dry year with scarce water resources the environmental water requirement was adjusted to 7 km3 aiming to preserve a water level of 30 82 m and a lake area of 13 37 thousand km2 dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical than static management objectives because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions the proposed framework which synthesized water balance model construction time series analysis scenario simulation and dual objective optimization showed its validity and rationality through the case study this framework can potentially be applied to other inland basins where long term hydro meteorological data are available and has implications

1906,preserving terminal lakes in arid inland basins by satisfying environmental water requirements is critical for sustainable watershed management a framework was proposed to assess environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions the framework incorporated water balance model construction time series analysis scenario simulation and dual objective optimization providing dynamic environmental management objectives for terminal lakes the dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical than the static ones because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions the framework was applied in the big aral sea in central asia a representative terminal lake suffering from a shortage of environmental water supply as a result of the compounding effect of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation the lake shrank dramatically from 1950 to 2001 with the water level decreasing from 52 90 m to 32 67 m the reduced runoff dominated the lake s shrinkage dropping the water level by 19 11 m the enhanced evaporation aggravated this process lowering the water level by 1 12 m the lake management objectives and associated environmental water requirements were obtained for wet normal and dry years given the impact of meteorological conditions on lake water budgets the environmental water requirement was indicated by river inflow into the lake in a wet normal and dry year the objective of preserving the water level to 33 96 32 34 and 30 82 m and the lake area to 21 94 17 53 and 13 37 thousand km2 required an environmental water supply of 13 10 and 7 km3 respectively results from this case study showed the rationality and practicality of the framework which would be an effective tool for environmental water assessment keywords lake preservation water budgets copula function dual objective optimization scenario simulation environmental management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction endorheic basins also known as closed basins are primarily situated in arid and semiarid regions covering approximately 11 4 of the global land li et al 2018 li et al 2017 the intrinsic scarcity of water resources rapid social and economic development and global warming have caused overexploitation of water resources and net water storage reductions in endorheic basins wang et al 2018 as a result endorheic basins have suffered from environmental and ecological crises such as land degradation and desertification biodiversity loss and ecosystem degeneration and the drying up of terminal lakes zhu et al 2016 the aral sea basin in central asia is a case in point the history of the aral sea which experienced a transition from prosperity to decline is one of the most classic ecological disasters of the 20th century induced by irrational water resource utilization beek et al 2011 the aral sea was formerly one of the world s largest lakes furnishing essential ecological and economic services including fisheries and shipping mcdermid and winter 2017 multiple human interferences particularly industrializing agricultural development and dam construction have modified the aral sea basin s hydrological processes and water budgets cretaux et al 2013 the most recent shrinkage initiated in the early 1960s the lake volume decreased by 90 and the water salinity increased from 10 g l to more than 100 g l micklin 2007 this situation triggered negative environmental ecological and economic impacts including the exposure of the lake bed that led to dust and salt storms degradation of deltaic and aquatic biodiversity and collapse of fisheries and shipping micklin 2007 sustainable watershed management requires an integrated effort to coordinate socio economic development and environmental preservation restraining overexploitation and reallocating water resources between natural and socio economic systems satisfy environmental water requirements and restore deteriorated ecosystems this strategy has successfully resurrected the juyan lake in the heihe river basin and the qingtu oasis in the shiyang river basin in northwest china huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 for designing the water resources allocation strategy a key is to assess environmental water requirements for terminal lakes which means the water regimes needed to maintain the lake in a certain water level and surface area to sustain the ecological values of lake ecosystems sajedipour et al 2017 shadkam et al 2016 from the perspective of terminal lakes water budgets the environmental water requirements are sensitive to meteorological conditions because precipitation is the important inflow component while evaporation is typically the primary outflow component hamzekhani et al 2016 previous studies have proposed methodologies to address this key by establishing terminal lakes optimum areas as management objectives and estimating environmental water requirements to achieve these objectives huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 one of the typical features of terminal lakes environmental and ecological crises is lake desiccation and surface area shrinkage a rational lake area is a vital management objective for curbing lake shrinkage and recovering degraded aquatic ecosystems optimization methodologies suggest the management objectives when assessing the terminal lakes optimum areas which balance the trade off between water cost and ecological benefit huang and ochoa 2022 huang et al 2021b si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 larger lake areas require more water input experience more water loss through evaporation and restrain socio economic water use resulting in aggravated water conflicts between natural and socio economic systems it is usually unnecessary and unrealistic to restore terminal lakes to their original volumes and surface areas instead a reasonable restoration target has a solid practical guiding significance huang and ochoa 2022 in viewing evaporation as an essential factor affecting lakes water budgets terminal lakes optimum areas should be adjusted with varying meteorological conditions the environmental water requirements corresponding to management objectives are evaluated using water balance equations among which evaporation and precipitation are critical variables therefore the evaluation results are highly dependent on meteorological conditions however few studies have paid attention to the impact of meteorological conditions on estimating terminal lakes preservation objectives and the associated environmental water requirements a knowledge gap exists in adjusting the protected lake areas and the corresponding environmental water requirements in wet normal and dry years water resources are relatively abundant in wet years and provide the potential for restoring a terminal lake to a larger area in contrast the preservation objective in dry years should be adjusted to a lower level due to the limited water resources and more attention should be paid to ensuring human water needs this study aimed to develop a framework for estimating environmental water requirements of terminal lakes under varying meteorological conditions the framework incorporated copula functions to design wet normal and dry meteorological conditions and used dual objective optimization methods to evaluate environmental water requirements an environment weighted distance was suggested to identify the optimal solution this distance involves the relative importance of lake protection compared with socio economic development and varies with meteorological conditions the novelty was embodied in proposing dynamic management objectives which were adaptive to meteorological conditions the framework was applied in the big aral sea in central asia as a representative case study the application s results could provide vital implications for the countries in the aral sea basin to enhance collaboration in integrated water resources management to recover and preserve the big aral sea the framework proposed by this study would be a practical tool for evaluating the environmental water requirements of terminal lakes in worldwide endorheic basins 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area the aral sea lies in the arid continental monsoon climate zone fig 1 where the multi year mean temperature is 9 4 mu et al 2019 the aral sea basin covers 1 8 106 km2 within seven nations uzbekistan turkmenistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan afghanistan and iran micklin 2007 two main rivers flow through the basin and feed the aral sea the syrdarya or syr darya river and the amudarya or amu darya river accounting for nearly 80 of the total inflow before the 1950 s cretaux et al 2013 in the first half of the 20th century the aral sea volume and surface area varied moderately due to sufficient river inflow that compensated for evaporation loss and moderated annual variations in lake water budgets since the 1960 s the aral sea began shrinking and suffered from thirst because regional water requirements for irrigating cotton and wheat led to prominent river inflow reduction and negatively biased lake water budgets as a result the aral sea separated into two entities after 1986 one entity was the small aral sea in the north which mainly received streamflow from the syrdarya river the other entity was the big aral sea in the south fed primarily by the amudarya river micklin 2007 detailed information on meteorology geography hydrology and water resources of the aral sea basin can be found in the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia https www cawater info net it may be unrealistic to recover the aral sea in the foreseeable future completely but it is feasible to rehabilitate and preserve portions of the water body and deltas micklin 2007 the small aral sea has benefited from the restoration efforts of the world bank and the government of kazakhstan which jointly completed an 85 million usd project in the autumn of 2005 the project constructed a 13 km dike to block the flow from the small to big aral sea and the dam regulated the water level of the small aral sea at 42 m the water level regulation freshened the water body and improved the ecological and fishery prospects of the small aral sea by contrast more efforts are still necessary for the big aral sea to reduce the lake recession and partially recover its ecosystem services 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data precipitation and evaporation are two essential factors affecting the water budgets of terminal lakes this study collected meteorological data from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia which produced the datasets by interpolating observed data at monitoring stations https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg the cru gridded time series is a widely used climate dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 over all land domains except antarctica harris et al 2020 previous studies indicated that the datasets are suitable for central asia and applicable to the aral sea deng and chen 2017 harris et al 2020 the meteorological data spanned from 1901 to 2020 precipitation and evaporation over the aral sea region were extracted from the original high resolution gridded datasets the spatial mean values were calculated to characterize the lake s meteorological conditions analyzing lake water budgets also requires data for lake water level surface area and river inflow into the lake this study obtained hydrological data from the portal of knowledge for water and environmental issues in central asia https www cawater info net the water level and surface area data of the aral sea spanned from 1911 to 2018 and the streamflow data of the amudarya and syrdarya rivers spanned from 1950 to 2001 3 methods 3 1 methodological framework fig 2 illustrates the flowchart for estimating the environmental water requirements of terminal lakes under varying meteorological conditions long term observations are essential for identifying environmental changes constructing a water balance model and assessing environmental water requirements the data includes critical water budget components such as river inflow groundwater inflow precipitation evaporation and water level to mention a few time series analysis helps unravel any trends and abrupt changes embedded in long term observations indicating climate hydrological and environmental alterations the water balance model is constructed based on the assumption that water inflow and outflow balance the change rate of lake storage the model acts as an effective tool to simulate the water level and the associated lake area under different meteorological scenarios combining the water balance model and time series analysis identifies critical factors driving the lake s environmental changes providing implications for lake restoration and preservation the copula function links marginal distributions of precipitation and evaporation resulting in a joint distribution for designing wet normal and dry meteorological scenarios coupled with scenario analysis the water balance model simulates water level and lake area under varying meteorological conditions providing data inputs for optimizing river inflow that indicates environmental water requirements dual objective optimization achieves an optimal solution for balancing water cost and lake benefit i e minimizing the river inflow into the lake while maximizing the lake area the results indicate the rational water level lake area and the associated environmental water requirements which can be incorporated into integrated water resources management given the uncertainty in data observation model structure and parameterization and objective optimization adaptive adjustment is necessary to refine the water balance model and re evaluate the environmental water requirements using the updated data 3 2 water balance model 3 2 1 model description terminal lakes mainly receive streamflow discharging into the lake precipitation is another water input though it is usually scarce a significant water loss of terminal lakes is evaporation caused by dry climate conditions besides river inflow precipitation and evaporation lake storage is also affected by subsurface water interactions the lake can be replenished by groundwater or the lake replenishes groundwater through seepage the exchanges between surface water and groundwater are complicated however it is usually challenging to quantify their interactions accurately due to low data availability previous studies suggested that the aral sea is fed by river and groundwater inflows gascoin and renard 2005 the aral sea received streamflow from the amudarya river and the syrdarya river before the lake separated into the big and small aral seas in 1986 after that the big aral sea mainly received streamflow from the amudarya river besides hydrological factors meteorological factors i e precipitation and evaporation are vital water budget components in this context the water balance equation of the aral sea can be simplified as follows 1 d z d t q r a q g a 10 3 p 10 3 e where z is the lake water level unit m a is the lake surface area unit thousand km2 t indicates the time step set as one year in this study q r is river inflow and q g is groundwater inflow unit km3 p represents precipitation and e represents evaporation respectively unit mm q r was the sum of the streamflow of the amudarya river and the syrdarya river when modeling the water level of the aral sea it was the streamflow of the amudarya river when modeling the water level of the big aral sea the surface area of the aral sea non linearly increases with the rising water level the curve fitting analysis using the long term lake area and water level data suggested two functions for quantifying the correlation between a and z of the aral sea and the big aral sea respectively 2 a as 2854 45 186 16 z 4 00 z 2 0 0288 z 3 a bas 281 77 30 29 z 1 03 z 2 0 0107 z 3 where a as is the surface area of the aral sea unit thousand km2 and a bas represents the surface area of the big aral sea unit thousand km2 hydrological data availability of the aral sea restrains the investigation into surface water and groundwater interactions the water budget is simplified by focusing on the net water flow replenished by groundwater instead of analyzing the exchanges between surface water and groundwater in the absence of groundwater data groundwater inflow into the lake is assumed to be positively correlated with the river inflow and is estimated using an empirical logarithmic function 3 q g a g ln b g q r 1 c g where a g b g and c g are three dimensionless parameters that need to be calibrated and verified using the observed data 3 2 2 model calibration and validation the simplified water balance model uses river inflow precipitation and evaporation as inputs and produces lake water level and the corresponding lake surface area the model has three parameters in the empirical function for estimating groundwater inflow the hydro meteorological data were separated into two parts one for calculating the parameters and the other for validating the model performance the model was calibrated using the data from 1950 to 1979 and validated using the data from 1980 to 2001 the model parameterization used the coupled bayesian inference and the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method which has been widely used in science and engineering to reconcile earth system models with data haario et al 2006 haario et al 2001 schaefli and kavetski 2017 vrugt 2016 the mcmcstat matlab package available from github https github com mjlaine mcmcstat git parameterized the aral sea water balance model because the mcmc approach initiated parameter estimation from non optimized values a trial and error process takes time for the chain to locate the optimal estimation of parameters therefore the model was parameterized using the chain with one hundred thousand samples the chain was conducted in three runs initiating from the values of the previous run and the last running chain s mean value resulted in the model parameter estimation the water balance model s performance was evaluated by the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse which are commonly used performance evaluators huang et al 2021a sadegh et al 2017 3 3 time series analysis 3 3 1 trend and abrupt change the trend of hydro meteorological series e g water level precipitation and evaporation were detected by linear regression analysis coupled with the mann kendall m k algorithm the fitted linear regression line illustrated the trend and the linear regression equation s slope quantified the tendency s magnitude the m k test ascertained whether the variation was significant at a significance level of 0 05 the python package pymannkendall https pypi org project pymannkendall supported the trend detection and the published literature introduced detailed information on the m k test s algorithms huang et al 2012 hussain and mahmud 2019 yue et al 2002 an abrupt change might exist in the hydro meteorological series except for the trend the heuristic segmentation algorithm was used to identify the change point given its successful application in previous studies huang et al 2020 huang et al 2012 detailed description on the heuristic segmentation algorithm can be found in published materials feng et al 2005 huang et al 2012 consistent with the significance level of the m k test that of the heuristic segmentation algorithm was also set to be 0 05 3 3 2 the impact of hydro meteorological changes the aral sea recession resulted from decreased runoff and increased evaporation the water balance model combined with scenario analysis helped identify the key driver and its corresponding contribution the simulated data were used to assess the impact of hydro meteorological changes considering the data s consistency and comparability two scenarios were simulated using the water balance model a the water level was modeled using the original river inflow precipitation and evaporation data the initial water level in 1950 was denoted as z 0 providing a benchmark for assessing the lake recession the simulated water level in 2001 was designated as z q r p e which was impacted by both hydrological and meteorological alterations b the water level was modeled using the detrended meteorological data instead of the original data the long term meteorological data were detrended by removing any trend in the original series the trend was analyzed using the linear regression method resulting in a one degree polynomial equation and was removed from the original data producing a stationary time series liu and yang 2010 mahmoud and gan 2020 the detrended evaporation of the aral sea was denoted as e d the water balance model driven by the original river inflow precipitation and detrended evaporation produced a water level series that was not affected by evaporation changes the simulated water level in 2001 in this series was denoted as z q r p e d the impact of hydro meteorological changes on the aral sea recession was evaluated by comparing the water levels in different scenarios 4 δ z h m z 0 z q r p e δ z h z 0 z q r p e d δ z m z q r p e d z q r p e where δ z h indicates the water level change caused by runoff reduction δ z m is the water level change impacted by the enhanced evaporation and δ z h m quantifies the combined impact of hydrological and meteorological changes 3 4 environmental water requirements 3 4 1 meteorological conditions the long term data from 1901 to 2020 were used to design the meteorological conditions of the aral sea the joint distribution of precipitation and evaporation was constructed using their marginal distributions the marginal distribution of precipitation was fitted using the gamma distribution and that of evaporation was fitted using the burr distribution the archimedean copula function was used when constructing the joint distribution because it has a simple form and does not need to have the same marginal distribution wong et al 2010 zhao et al 2020 the joint distribution of precipitation and evaporation was analyzed using the frank copula a typical archimedean copula function the marginal and joint distributions were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation the methods for estimating empirical probabilities can be found in published literature zhang 2005 zhang et al 2011 the goodness of fit between the theoretical and empirical probabilities was evaluated using nse r and rmse huang et al 2021a sadegh et al 2017 the marginal and joint distributions of precipitation and evaporation provided a crucial basis for designing various meteorological conditions a typical wet year was supposed to have abundant precipitation with less evaporation in contrast a typical dry year was supposed to have less precipitation with greater evaporation therefore the wet normal and dry meteorological conditions were designed as 5 f p p wet 0 75 f c e wet p wet f p p wet 0 25 6 f p p normal 0 50 f c e normal p normal f p p normal 0 50 7 f p p dry 0 25 f c e dry p dry f p p dry 0 75 where fp is the cumulative probability function of precipitation and fc is the cumulative joint probability of copula function of precipitation and evaporation p wet p normal and p dry indicates the precipitation in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions respectively correspondingly e wet e normal and e dry represents the evaporation in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions respectively the designed precipitation values of p wet p normal and p dry were calculated using the marginal distribution of precipitation f c f p calculates the conditional probability of evaporation under the designed precipitation the evaporation s probability under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions i e f e e wet f e e normal and f e e dry were analyzed using the copula function the designed evaporation values of e wet e normal and e dry were calculated using the marginal distribution of evaporation 3 4 2 dual objective optimization the heuristic segmentation algorithm detected an abrupt change point in the streamflow series of the amudarya river segmenting the original data into two sub series the pre impacted and post impacted ones the probability distribution of the pre impacted streamflow data was fitted using the birnbaum saunders function the approaches for estimating distribution parameters calculating empirical probabilities and testing goodness of fit were the same as analyzing the meteorological variables distributions based on the theoretical distribution the streamflow values corresponding to the probabilities of 0 75 0 50 and 0 25 were estimated as the total water resources in wet normal and dry years the total water resources minus environmental water requirements resulted in available water resources for socio economic systems the post impacted streamflow series of the amudarya river suggested that the water discharging into the big aral sea ranged from 0 to 24 km3 in case of intense water withdrawal for agricultural development therefore 25 scenarios under each meteorological condition were modeled to assess the big aral sea s response to altered river inflow the river inflow was set to be 0 1 2 22 23 and 24 km3 with a unique interval of 1 km3 each scenario was labeled by an integer i i 1 2 3 23 24 25 the lake water level in 2001 was used as the initial status and the water balance model was run until reaching a zero lake storage change and a stable water level for the stationary status of different scenarios under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions lake benefit and water cost were compared and the ideal point method ipm was used to analyze the appropriate target of lake recovery huang et al 2021a huang et al 2021b shang 2008 the lake s ecological benefit was indicated by the water surface area which is a critical objective for ecological restoration and preservation si et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the increased water surface area would limit the exposed lake bed and mitigate dust and salt storms a larger water surface area would provide more aquatic habitat and benefit biodiversity recovery the water cost was measured by river inflow into the lake socio economic development requires more water availability and restrains river inflow into the lake however lake recovery and preservation need adequate river inflow therefore two competing objectives were considered a minimizing river inflow to increase water resources availability for socio economic systems and b maximizing lake area to enhance ecological benefit and resilience it is impossible to reduce the river inflow while enlarging the lake area dimensionless values were used to solve this dual objective optimization 8 q r n q r q r min q r max q r min a n a a min a max a min where q r n and a n is the normalized river inflow and the normalized lake area respectively the minimum and maximum river inflow into the big aral sea were 0 and 24 km3 the minimum and maximum areas of the big aral sea were 0 and 39 thousand km2 the objectives optimal values form a supposed point that usually has no option to reach namely the ideal point 9 q r n i 0 a n i 1 the ideal point is to have a normalized river inflow of 0 and a normalized lake area of 1 which minimizes water cost and maximizes ecological benefit the ipm ranks the options according to their distances to the ideal point following the normalized river inflow and lake area correspondence the option with a shorter distance to the ideal point has a better trade off between water cost and ecological benefit therefore the option with the minimum distance is closest to the ideal point and can be taken as the pareto solution to the dual objective problem shang 2008 the environment weighted distance d i between a scenario q r n i a n i to the supposed reference situation q r n i a n i is 10 d i q r n i 2 w 2 1 a n i 2 where w is the weight coefficient characterizing the importance of environmental preservation when the weight coefficient is 1 satisfying environmental and socio economic water requirements is equally important when the weight coefficient is greater than 1 satisfying environmental water requirements is more important than satisfying socio economic water requirements and vice versa meeting socio economic water requirements is a priority in a dry year because the drought would adversely affect agricultural production access to safe water and worker productivity by making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable the drought would force many people to become refugees levy and patz 2015 the total water resources vary with meteorological conditions given that the water resources are abundant in wet years it is suggested to allocate more water for lake recovery and restore the degraded lake ecosystems the weight coefficient is set to be greater than 1 enlarging water allocation for lake preservation on the contrary more effort is necessary to satisfy human beings water requirements in dry years when water resources are scarce the weight coefficient is suggested to be less than 1 enhancing the available water resources for socio economic systems therefore the weight coefficient is recommended to vary with meteorological conditions 11 w w max w min f p p w min where f p p is the probability of precipitation w max and w min are the maximum and minimum values of the weight coefficient respectively the weight coefficient is suggested to range from 0 5 to 1 5 correspondingly the weight coefficient in wet normal and dry meteorological conditions is 1 25 1 00 and 0 75 respectively for each river inflow scenario under wet normal and dry meteorological conditions q r n i and a n i was calculated respectively their distances to the supposed ideal point were measured using the environment weighted distance the river inflow with the minimum distance to the ideal point was taken as the optimal environmental water requirement the balanced water level and lake area responding to this river inflow were suggested to be the environmental management targets 4 results and discussion 4 1 water balance model of the aral sea the correlation between groundwater inflow and river inflow of the aral sea was quantified using the following logarithmic function obtained from data graphed in fig 3 a 12 q g 2 72 ln 0 90 q r 1 3 65 the performance evaluators of model calibration showed satisfying matches between the observed and simulated water levels indicating the reliable estimation of the model parameters fig 3b when validating the model performance the water level data were scattered alongside the 1 1 line resulting in good performance evaluators fig 3c the model performance during calibration and validation showed its efficacy in simulating the water level of the aral sea the long term water level of the aral sea was modeled from 1950 to 2001 fig 3d the simulated water level matched well with the observed one and successfully reproduced the hydrological processes as the lake water level declined when comparing the simulated water level with the observed one nse and r reached 0 99 and rmse was 0 37 m 4 2 hydrological and meteorological changes of the aral sea the heuristic segmentation algorithm identified significant abrupt changes in the river inflow into the aral sea fig 4 before the aral sea was separated into the two relatively big and small entities the river inflows into the lake was the total streamflow of the amudarya and syrdarya rivers the amudarya river fed the big aral sea after 1986 the river inflow and groundwater inflow into the aral sea sharply decreased in 1974 the analysis of the observed river inflow data suggested that from 1950 to 1973 the multi year mean value of river inflow was 50 75 km3 but it declined to 8 69 km3 from 1974 to 2001 given the empirical correlation between groundwater and river inflows the groundwater inflow was estimated using equation 12 corresponding to the significant reduction in river inflow the multi year mean value of groundwater inflow dropped from 13 97 km3 to 8 76 km3 as a result the total runoff feeding the aral sea decreased significantly in 1974 the multi year mean value from 1950 to 1973 was 64 72 km3 but it was 17 45 km3 from 1974 to 2001 dropping by 47 27 km3 the precipitation of the aral sea remained relatively stable from 1950 to 2001 despite a slight upward trend in yearly precipitation fig 5 a the m k algorithm did not detect a trend in the precipitation series that was statistically significant at the 0 05 level the temporal dynamic of evaporation was different from the precipitation with a statistically significant trend being observed the m k algorithm confirmed this significant upward trend in the evaporation series and the linear regression suggested that the rising slope reached 17 61 mm 10a for terminal lakes the water balance determines the equilibrium water level and is strongly forced by the total runoff precipitation and evaporation thus the dramatically reduced runoff and increased evaporation would significantly drop the lake water level since the small observed increase in precipitation was insufficient to compensate for the water loss the upward trend was removed from the actual evaporation of the aral sea resulting in a stationary evaporation series fig 6 a comparing the water level modeled using the actual evaporation with the water level modeled using the detrended evaporation shed light on the driving factors of lake recession fig 6b the initial water level of the aral sea in 1950 was 52 90 m corresponding to a lake area of 63 21 thousand km2 when simulated using the actual evaporation the water level of the big aral sea was 32 67 m in 2001 the water level was lowered by 20 23 m due to the coupled impact of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation when simulated using the detrended evaporation the influence of the evaporation increment was removed and the runoff reduction led to a water level of 33 79 m in 2001 dropping by 19 11 m the decreased runoff dominated the lake shrinkage and the increased evaporation aggravated this process lowering the water level of the big aral sea by 1 12 m the big aral sea s area in 2001 was 18 45 and 21 49 thousand km2 respectively when simulated using the actual and detrended evaporation the lake area shrank by 44 76 thousand km2 of which 41 72 thousand km2 was attributed to runoff reduction and the remainder 3 04 thousand km2 was due to evaporation increase the results suggested that feeding the big aral sea with a certain amount of river inflow was necessary to maintain the lake area 4 3 environmental water requirements of the big aral sea an abrupt change detected by the heuristic segmentation algorithm segmented the streamflow series of the amudarya river into two sub series fig 7 a the pre impacted streamflow series spanned from 1950 to 1973 with a multi year mean value of 39 89 km3 the post impacted streamflow series spanned from 1974 to 2001 with a multi year mean value of 8 30 km3 reduced by 31 59 km3 the pre impacted streamflow data were used to fit the probability distribution using the birnbaum saunders function providing the basis for estimating the total water resources in different water years fig 7b the theoretical probability matched well with the empirical probability resulting in good performance evaluators fig 7c the fitted birnbaum saunders function suggested the amudarya river streamflows of 47 38 and 31 km3 in wet normal and dry years the long term meteorological data from 1901 to 2020 were used to construct the marginal and joint probability distributions fig 8 the performance evaluators indicated that the gamma function fitted well with the precipitation probability distribution and the burr function fitted well with the evaporation probability distribution the data points were scattered closely alongside the 1 1 line indicating suitable matches between the theoretical and empirical probabilities fig 8a and fig 8b the frank copula function worked well to link the marginal distributions of precipitation and evaporation providing the solid basis for designing various meteorological conditions fig 8c in wet normal and dry years the precipitation was 152 133 and 116 mm the evaporation was 1226 1269 and 1317 mm respectively driven by the designed precipitation and evaporation in wet normal and dry years the water balance model predicted the water level of the big aral sea responding to various river inflows fig 9 a the simulated water levels in the wet year were distributed at the top because abundant precipitation and moderate evaporation positively contributed to the water budget conversely the simulated water levels in the dry year were located at the bottom because scarce precipitation and intense evaporation negatively affected the water budget the modeled water levels in wet normal and dry years rose with the increased river inflows resulting in expanded lake areas fig 9b and their associated ecological benefits the river inflows and the corresponding balanced water levels were normalized to analyze the trade off between water cost and lake benefit fig 10 a the distances to the ideal point suggested the optimal river inflow to maintain a proper water level and lake area fig 10b in a wet year the environmental water requirement was 13 km3 resulting in a water level of 33 96 m and a lake area of 21 94 thousand km2 given the total water resources of 47 km3 the available water resources for the socio economic system were 34 km3 in a normal year the environmental water requirement was lowered to 10 km3 corresponding to a water level of 32 34 m and a lake area of 17 53 thousand km2 the total water resources of 38 km3 in the normal year were also less than that in the wet year and the available water resources for the socio economic system were 28 km3 in a dry year the environmental water requirement was further reduced to 7 km3 preserving a water level of 30 82 m and a lake area of 13 37 thousand km2 the total water resources were 31 km3 and the available water resources for the socio economic system were 24 km3 4 4 implications for preserving terminal lakes the present study provided the big aral sea with dynamic environmental management objectives which varied with meteorological conditions and water resources compared with static management objectives e g a fixed lake area to recover dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions for the static management objective a fixed lake area to recover needed more river inflow to compensate for the evaporation loss in a dry year but less river inflow in a wet year it is unreasonable because guaranteeing human water needs should be a priority in a dry year and less water should be allocated for lake preservation the dynamic management objectives addressed this issue by preserving a smaller lake area in a dry year that restrained river inflow and satisfied human water demands while recovering a larger lake area in a wet year when more river inflow was available the dual objective optimization proposed restoration targets and the associated environmental water requirements which balanced the trade off between the water requirements of the lake and socio economic systems assessing environmental water requirements informed the water allocation strategy to preserve the lake the water allocations between the lake and socio economic systems could vary over time depending on meteorological conditions it meant that the lake could receive different amounts of water each year in the wet normal and dry years the environmental water requirements were 13 10 and 7 km3 and the allocated water resources for the socio economic system were 34 28 and 24 km3 respectively in a dry year a greater water allocation to the socio economic system ensured access to critical human water needs e g domestic and agricultural water demands the lake received a relatively less allocation of water until meteorological conditions improved if a wet year followed this dry year a greater allocation for environmental water requirements helped recover the lake and the critical human water needs were still guaranteed due to the increased total water resources given a certain meteorological status the lake s ecological benefit would suffer significant loss if the river inflow was less than the proposed environmental water requirement on the other hand an overly idealistic restoration target for the big aral sea is unrealistic due to water resources overexploitation the current big aral sea is far from the suggested restoration target due to the limited river inflow human activities especially damming and irrigation are the dominant factors influencing the long term variation of the aral sea wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 after the disintegration of the soviet union total runoff into the aral sea was negatively impacted by inefficient and unsustainable irrigation water use shi et al 2020 the increased use of advanced drip irrigation technology was suggested as a means to release more water into the big aral sea and ameliorate the ecological crisis shi et al 2020 the big aral sea represents an illustrative case for applying the proposed framework which is also practical for other terminal lakes when using this framework for estimating environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions the design probability of precipitation and evaporation can be set according to actual needs for example the precipitation probability of a wet year can be set to be 0 9 while that of a dry year can be 0 1 the marginal distribution functions of precipitation and evaporation and their joint distribution function are determined by meteorological statistical features likewise the probability distribution of streamflow is suggested by hydrological statistical characteristics the univariate distribution function candidates include gamma birnbaum saunders beta exponential extreme value and generalized extreme value functions to mention a few the copula function of bivariate joint probability distribution includes gaussian clayton frank gumbel and joe copula functions to mention a few some toolboxes help estimate the parameters of marginal and joint distribution functions like the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh et al 2017 when assessing the distance of a scenario to the ideal point in optimization analysis the weight coefficient can be higher given the priority of ecological preservation which is determined by watershed management policy initiatives 4 5 limitations and future research the big aral sea case study simulated the long term water level dynamics from 1950 to 2001 however the hydrological response of the big aral sea to climate change and anthropogenic interference in the recent two decades was not included due to limited data availability the data series length could raise some uncertainties in selecting empirical functions and estimating the water balance model s parameters as a result it could affect the accuracy of assessing the big aral sea s environmental water requirements when applying this preliminary assessment results in water resources allocation and lake restoration adaptive adjustment is necessary to achieve the management objectives future research will include efforts to collect more recent data these data will be used to update the parameters of the water balance model and probability distributions enhancing the accuracy of assessment results the refined model and updated assessment results will be applied in water resources allocation and lake restoration for further verification which provides feedback for improving environmental water assessments another limitation is that only one case study was implemented to test the proposed framework future research will further test this framework s applicability feasibility and reliability in other terminal lakes 5 conclusions the big aral sea shrank dramatically from 1950 to 2001 with the water level retreating from 52 90 m to 32 67 m dropping by 20 23 m the water balance model combined with the scenario analysis indicated that the lake shrinkage resulted from the coupled impact of reduced runoff and enhanced evaporation the small observed increase in precipitation was insufficient to compensate for the water loss the reduction in runoff feeding the big aral sea dominated the water level declination reducing the water level by 19 11 m the enhanced evaporation aggravated the lake recession lowering the water level by 1 12 m preserving the big aral sea requires a certain amount of inflowing runoff to recover and maintain the lake water budget the proposed framework for estimating environmental water requirements under varying meteorological conditions suggested dynamic environmental management objectives for the big aral sea in a wet year with abundant water resources the preservation objective was to recover the water level to 33 96 m and the lake area to 21 94 thousand km2 with an environmental water requirement of 13 km3 in a normal year the preservation objective was adjusted to recover the water level to 32 34 m and the lake area to 17 53 thousand km2 correspondingly the environmental water requirement was lowered to 10 km3 in a dry year with scarce water resources the environmental water requirement was adjusted to 7 km3 aiming to preserve a water level of 30 82 m and a lake area of 13 37 thousand km2 dynamic environmental management objectives were more flexible and practical than static management objectives because they adjusted optimal solutions according to meteorological conditions the proposed framework which synthesized water balance model construction time series analysis scenario simulation and dual objective optimization showed its validity and rationality through the case study this framework can potentially be applied to other inland basins where long term hydro meteorological data are available and has implications

summarize singha s impact on the hydrologic sciences to date first we summarize her impact in four key areas of research non fickian transport and pore scale dynamics section 2 1 working across scales to constrain emergent transport behavior section 2 2 hydrogeophysical characterization of the critical zone section 2 3 and the study of coupled surface and groundwater systems on redox dynamics and contaminant transport section 2 4 taken together these topics represent a step change to our understanding of contaminant transport and transformation in earth s critical zone while presented as distinct topics these research advances integrated by common themes of an openness and excitement to work across disciplines a focus on systems that display multiscale spatial behaviors and the time domain analog problems with apparent non fickian transport dynamics leading to heavy tailed behaviors and thoughtful application of geophysical tools to hydrological and critical zone science next we summarize her role above and beyond research in which she has fostered a diverse and thriving hydrogeophsyics community finally we reflect on the underlying traits that have enabled her impact thus far and summarize her achievements and recognitions taken together singha s body of work has had an outsized impact on hydrologic science that is worthy of synthesis 2 research advances contributions 2 1 dr singha has advanced the theory that underpins non fickian transport and pore scale dynamics dr singha s fundamental research related to non fickian solute transport highlights her unique ability to develop geophysical theory and methodology in novel ways to inform elusive physical critical zone processes and interpret their biological implications over previous decades there have been numerous observations of extended tailing of conservative solutes at late time relative to initial concentration breakthrough along with pronounced solute concentration rebounds after groundwater pump and treat systems are shut down this type of behavior is not predicted by advection dispersion transport mechanics alone and has been often conceptually attributed to exchange with pore spaces of reduced connectivity compared to the more mobile connected matrix pores similar to transient storage models of stream solute transport non fickian transport dynamics in porous media are typically represented by at least one immobile or less mobile domain that exchanges via diffusion and or slow advection with better connected mobile porosity where advection and dispersion processes dominate although mass transfer dynamics between pores of varied connectivity have been theorized for decades e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 field scale observations were almost entirely based on mobile porosity solute breakthrough curve data alone rendering any observations of less mobile mobile solute exchange indirect in nature this is due to a simple experimental constraint of pumped water samples as the mobile domain is preferentially sampled when fluid is extracted even at flow rates similar to ambient advection the major methodological advance that dr singha and her co authors developed was to pair fluid sampling with co located measurements of electrical resistivity collected at comparable scales such that solute exchange with less mobile porosity could more directly be observed and quantified several early publications by dr singha and colleagues presented anomalous field data coupled with novel analysis and model development culkin et al 2008 day lewis and singha 2008 singha et al 2007 the anomalous data were discovered during an experimental evaluation of aquifer storage and recovery potential within a fractured limestone aquifer culkin et al 2008 singha et al 2007 the authors plotted co located fluid electrical conductivity and bulk electrical resistivity the inverse of conductivity data in concentration space and found unexpected pronounced hysteresis between the data types for example as fresh water was pumped into the saline aquifer and then extracted fluid electrical conductivity changed and reached equilibrium points substantially faster than the co located electrical resistivity data this hysteresis defies the simplified concepts presented by archie 1942 where changes in bulk resistivity over time reflect a scaled version of fluid conductivity changes when grain surface conductivity is neglected and the geologic matrix remains constant dr singha and her co authors realized that they could explain the observed fluid bulk electrical hysteresis by developing a bicontinuum version of archie s law that included rate limited mass transfer their hypothesis was that changes in less mobile porosity solute concentration would lag behind concentration shifts in the mobile domain as governed by the relative sizes of the two domains and the mass transfer rate between them i e rate limited simple manipulation of the governing bicontinuum model parameters showed that the shape of the fluid bulk electrical hysteresis loop was highly sensitive to these parameters indicating that their estimation via inverse methods was possible singha et al 2007 further numerical model experimentation by day lewis and singha 2008 supported the rate limited mass transfer explanation dr singha summarized this rapid advance in understanding of rate limited mass transfer for a general hydrologic audience in singha et al 2008 a few years later dr singha s research group conducted more complex numerical flow and transport modeling through heterogeneous porous media using comsol multiphysics where rate limited mass transfer was not assumed these modeling exercises indicated that observed electrical hysteresis patterns could still be accounted for by a simplified bicontinuum model which included both slow advection and diffusion dominated exchanges with pore water wheaton and singha 2010 while fundamental advances in aquifer fate and transport related to non fickian process are no doubt important throughout her research career dr singha also recognized biological implications of physical hydrologic processed particularly at the groundwater surface water interface following the concept that less mobile porosity by nature enhances localized water and solute residence times dr singha and others theorized that such enhanced reactive contact time within less mobile pores might explain other type of anomalous field observations such as biogeochemical signatures of anoxic redox reactions measured in apparently oxic pore waters of the hyporheic zone briggs et al 2015 dr singha and colleagues further explored these apparently anoxic zones nested in oxic hyporheic sediments by pairing controlled chamber hyporheic injections of conservative and reactive solutes with cm scale geoelectrical monitoring briggs et al 2018 dr singha and others found direct evidence of less mobile porosity dynamics in lake and streambed sandy interface sediments along with potential signatures of anoxic microsites embedded in bulk oxic more mobile flow briggs et al 2018 hampton et al 2019 further they found that both the exchange timescales of less mobile porosity and co located reactive processes such as nitrous oxide production were sensitive to flow rates hampton et al 2020 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2019 as with earlier ideas regarding rate limited mass transfer such flow sensitivity had been previously theorized but rarely directly measured taken together these theoretical and applied methodological advances form a basis for understanding the origin and impact of non fickian transport with applications to basic and applied problems in environmental transport and fate of solutes 2 2 dr singha has worked across scales to advance characterization of heterogeneous processes in the context of emergent dynamics dr singha s research has focused on identifying pore scale processes that affect or control macro scale measurements or properties as discussed above non fickian transport is a mechanism invoked to explain the non ideal behavior of chemical tracers and contaminants from pore to system scales at the aquifer scale tracers and or contaminants exhibit decreases in concentration through time with strong late time tailing that cannot be accurately modeled by only considering advection and dispersion this presents a practical problem when these models are used to develop remediation strategies for contaminated aquifers if a standard advective dispersive model systematically underpredicts contaminant concentration at later times then remediation efforts could be concluded too quickly to improve models that inform reach scale or aquifer scale processes swanson et al 2012 used fluid and bulk measurements of electrical conductivity in columns packed with zeolite or quartz sand to evaluate the pore scale processes that influence tracer transport this experimental modeling by dr singha and colleagues found that the volume and arrangement of pores space rather than grain size can mediate transport properties and measured geophysical parameters swanson et al 2015 2012 extending a deep understanding of non fickian transport to other problems and domains is a hallmark of singha s career for example she readily extended theory and conceptual models explaining non fickian transport in porous media to the hyporheic zone coupling pore scale behavior with emergent reach scale applications the same anomalous tailing that is found in aquifers due to non fickian transport also manifests in transport within the river corridor where transient storage is broadly understood to yield long tailing a host of applications focus on solute transport including developing tools for planning tracer injections gonzález pinzón et al 2022 flume and tank scale studies foster et al 2021 wilhelmsen et al 2021 interpretation of tracer data gonzález pinzón et al 2015 ward et al 2014 2013 modeling efforts ward et al 2010b and emerging integration of hydrogeophysical data with solute tracers to understand process dynamics pidlisecky et al 2011 singley et al 2022 dr singha s work across scales is further evident in her contributions to critical zone science discussed in the next section taken together these efforts link studies of anomalous tailing across multiple scales and approaches with scales spanning landforms and scales including pores flowpaths hillslopes stream reaches and aquifers 2 3 dr singha has brought hydrogeophysical tools to bear on critical zone structure and function dr singha s affinity for working across scales and disciplines found a natural fit in critical zone cz science work within the cz is interdisciplinary by nature as the cz contains complex interactions between water rock soil the atmosphere and living organisms richter and mobley 2009 as a consistent pioneer of new tools and applications that bridge disciplines dr singha leveraged her existing expertise in subsurface hydrology surface water groundwater interactions and near surface geophysical methods to explore dynamic processes within the cz dr singha and her collaborators played an important role in applying geophysical methods to investigate hyporheic exchange doughty et al 2020 hagarty et al 2010 singha et al 2008 ward et al 2010a 2010b saturated pore scale exchange mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2019 singha et al 2008 plant water uptake harmon et al 2021 mares et al 2016 voytek et al 2019 and the role of cz structure in hydrologic storage and routing e g kuntz et al 2011 voytek et al 2016 dr singha and others continued to demonstrate the value of near surface geophysical observations to new hydrologic problems by applying time lapse electrical resistivity surveys to the study of hyporheic exchange processes traditionally characterization of stream hyporheic zones relied on parameterizing numerical models to replicate tracer breakthrough curves measured within the stream e g bencala and walters 1983 stream solute workshop 1990 these measurements and models represent the aggregate response of the stream between the point of tracer injection and the measured breakthrough curve making the identification of spatial variations in hyporheic exchange challenging to identify choi et al 2000 kelleher et al 2019 2013 ward et al 2016 by conducting time lapse electrical resistivity surveys during conductive tracer injections dr singha and others were able to begin characterizing spatially variable processes within the hyporheic zone and start identifying areas of slower distributed exchange ward et al 2012 2010a in addition to novel applications of near surface geophysical methods to the hyporheic zone dr singha and her collaborators continued to advance associated theory singha et al 2011 while simultaneously synthesizing their advances for a broader hydrologic audience singha et al 2015 a consistent theme in dr singha s career is her work across disciplines and her contributions to cz science are not an exception dr singha and her collaborators have played an important role in applying near surface geophysical methods to help characterize ecological controls on subsurface storage and routing of water within the cz sullivan et al 2022 or controls of those flowpaths on ecology rey et al 2021 2019 dr singha mentored several students who utilized time lapse electrical resistivity surveys both of the surrounding soil and the tree itself to look at coupled tree soil systems harmon et al 2021 luo et al 2020 mares et al 2016 mares et al 2016 compared temporal patterns of tree sap flux and soil moisture with results from time lapse electrical resistivity surveys of the tree trunk and surrounding soils this study demonstrated the promise for the application of electrical methods to track spatially variable changes in soil moisture as a function of tree water uptake and potentially even hydrologic redistribution expanding on work from mares et al 2016 harmon et al 2021 used similar resistivity methods and wavelet analysis to examine the physical relationships between tree water storage and atmospheric and pedologic variables taken together singha has cemented the role of hydrogeophysical tools as an essential part of the critical zone toolkit 2 4 dr singha has worked across disciplines to constrain the influence of gw sw interactions on redox dynamics and contaminant transformations dr singha s research frequently relies upon interdisciplinary teams that integrate techniques from geophysics hydrology and bio geochemistry her interdisciplinary work has resulted in significant contributions to the scientific community s understanding of how groundwater surface water exchanges mediate solute fate and transport research by dr singha and colleagues that is focused on this topic has utilized a combination of field and lab methods including continuous salt injection tracer tests electrical resistivity tomography fine scale geoelectrical monitoring water sediment and porewater sampling and analysis as well as numerical modeling dr singha and colleagues have applied these techniques to explore metal redox chemistry in mine impacted hyporheic zones hoagland et al 2020 johnston et al 2017 larson et al 2013 rickel et al 2021 nitrogen cycling in urban streams hampton et al 2020 and kettle lakes briggs et al 2018 hampton et al 2019 arsenic and uranium fate and transport in groundwater on the pine ridge reservation swift bird et al 2020 and resazurin a reactive tracer oxidation in an engineered streambed herzog et al 2018 several key findings have emerged from the novel coupling and repeated application of diverse hydrogeophysical and bio geochemical techniques by dr singha and her colleagues first several studies have revealed that fluid exchange rates hydraulic conductivity and bio clogging in the hyporheic zone often mediate the distribution of biogeochemical microzones and may result in strong feedbacks on nutrient transport i e advection vs diffusion dominated in a series of iron oxide reduction experiments biofilms were found to form electrically conductive pathways occlude pore space and increase bulk electrical conductivity regberg et al 2011 later research that paired geoelectrical monitoring with porewater sampling revealed that anaerobic processes occurred in less mobile pore spaces in shallow sediments even though porewater sampling had indicated bulk oxic conditions briggs et al 2018 the concept of co located anoxic and oxic microzones in bulk porous media was explored further using computational models that evaluated different stream and sediment conditions such as variable hydraulic fluxes and nutrient concentrations as well as scenarios with and without biomass roy chowdhury et al 2020 from this modeling the roy chowdhury et al hypothesized that microbes were a key control on nutrient transformation in hyporheic sediment but their associated biomass growth can clog hyporheic pore spaces reduce hydraulic fluxes and lead to the formation of anoxic microzones these concepts have important implications for nutrient transformations for example intermediate residence times in hyporheic sediments were found to favor incomplete denitrification compared to shorter or longer residence times resulting in the release of the greenhouse gas n2o hampton et al 2020 dr singha s research characterizing redox conditions in response to dynamic mixing in the hyporheic zone has had important implications for our understanding of metal geochemistry in streams receiving acid mine drainage bethune et al 2015 hoagland et al 2020 johnston et al 2017 larson et al 2013 rickel et al 2021 a second key finding from her body of work is that groundwater stream exchanges and metal oxide precipitation in the hyporheic zone influence the attenuation or export of metals from acid mine drainage streams for example larson et al 2013 found that the rate of mass transfer between the stream and hyporheic zone controlled the location and depth of fe ii oxidizing niches where niches characterized by slower exchange rates promoted biotic fe ii oxidation and enhanced the precipitation of terraced iron formations and the sequestration of iron later work by dr singha and colleagues further established the link between iron oxide precipitation and hyporheic exchange where fe ii oxidation resulted in a physical barrier separating an acid mine drainage stream from underlying shallow groundwater rickel et al 2021 this physical disconnect resulted in a small hyporheic zone with steep hydrogeochemical gradients high concentrations of toxic metals and low microbial diversity dominated by fe ii oxidizing bacteria hoagland et al 2020 dr singha s multi disciplinary research also works to address environmental contamination and environmental justice issues in marginalized communities both domestically and internationally hagarty et al 2015 swift bird et al 2020 tschakert and singha 2007 for example dr singha and colleagues worked collaboratively with the oglala sioux tribe to delineate hydrogeologic and biogeochemical controls of arsenic and uranium dissolution into the arikaree aquifer on the pine ridge reservation where many people rely on domestic wells as their drinking water source elevated alkalinity and ph levels were found to be the driving factors of arsenic and uranium mobility in the arikaree aquifer downgradient sections of the aquifer in the northern portions of the pine ridge reservation were most likely to be impacted by metal loid contamination due to water rock reactions that increase ph and alkalinity i e groundwater evolution and proximity to volcanic ash that acts as a regional metal loid source swift bird et al 2020 tschakert and singha 2007 evaluated environmental and human health impacts of small scale galamsey i e illegal and unregulated gold mining in ghana through a pilot study working with galamsey miners to understand their perspectives on mining risks environmental hazards and research communication galamsey miners use manual rudimentary and often hazardous techniques to extract and process gold ores including amalgamation with mercury the use of mercury causes negative health impacts for miners and can contaminate water sources crops and soils near mining sites galamsey miners make up the majority of the mining labor force in ghana but they are considered outlaws and environmental criminals and are generally excluded from regulatory and policy considerations on mining tschakert and singha 2007 worked to quantify miner s understanding of mining risks and actively involved galamsey miners in mercury testing using indicator strips their approach found synergies between political ecology environmental justice and ecohealth and many galamsey participants advocated for similar outreach and education in other mining communities the researchers recommended recognition of galamsey miners and active involvement of mining communities as a first step out of the impasse in the ghanian mining sector taken together these research advances are directly transferable to addressing applied problems of contaminant transport and fate particularly for cases where redox dynamics and or coupled gw sw systems are essential to governing the success or failure of remediation 3 fostering an open inclusive hydrogeophysics community dr singha s contributions to the broader earth science community are not well captured by traditional academic metrics alone in addition to an active research program dr singha s contributions include both direct mentorship of individuals outside her immediate research

brilliant and excel in all aspects of their lives not just academic pursuits these mentorship traits are aptly reflected in the diversity of positions currently held by her former mentees which span multiple fields in academia environmental consulting national laboratories federal agencies e g usgs noaa or the private sector the successes of her advisees across a breath of applications disciplines and industries is a testament to the consistently strong mentoring she provides dr singha s support is not limited to her current students and postdocs as she eagerly provides support to her mentees across all stages of their career from the undergraduate level to graduate level to early career faculty members in a recent interview with the colorado school of mines newspaper dr singha noted that the students hands down are my favorite part of my job i ve always loved teaching and i also love working with new researchers to help them channel their talents to explore real world problems mines staff 2020 dr singha s passion for teaching and desire to provide students a supportive environment and curriculum in which they can grow is apparent in the fun and energetic nature of her courses dr singha s passion for teaching comes across in her determination to provide meaningful lectures that reach all students within the class this is personified in how dr singha solicits feedback on her courses not just from mid or end of the year reviews but from students directly and often dr singha may ask students to write down the main point of the lecture and or three questions that they had afterwards providing her immediate feedback on whether key concepts were effectively being communicated and allowing her to continually refine course material as a result her lectures provide students an experience that is undeniably engaging and has led to multiple teaching accolades from each of the institutions where she has been a professor at penn state university dr singha was awarded both the college wide wilson award for excellence in teaching as well as the university wide george w atherton award for teaching excellence subsequently in 2017 dr singha received the dean s faculty excellence award from the colorado school of mines given for significant and meritorious achievement in teaching and scholarship these peer nominated awards demonstrate a high regard amongst fellow faculty members for the quality of instruction that dr singha brings to her courses in addition to providing a high energy and engaging atmosphere during her lectures she also goes above and beyond the course syllabus teaching skills valuable to budding scientists that are not specific to the course material for example singha has created educational resources to support various hand on demonstrations and modeling applications for undergraduate education singha 2008 singha and loheide 2011 additionally she has authored an open access textbook to introduce hydrogeophysical techniques to budding hydrogeologists singha et al 2022 dr singha consistently strives to be a positive force for change within the earth science community for dr singha this is manifested in her continued work to provide support and resources for early career faculty as well as foster an inclusive culture that encourages historically underrepresented students to consider stem as a career path while at mines dr singha created an early career development program called launching your academic career aimed at providing early career faculty with the knowledge and tools they needed to succeed in their new academic environment for this program dr singha was awarded the mines w m keck mentorship award in addition to mentoring early career faculty dr singha has routinely recognized the need to improve inclusion and access for historically underrepresented groups in the earth science s singha et al 2020 while she was a professor at penn state university dr singha helped develop and run the penn state hydrogeophysics field experience this program provided undergraduate students from penn state and three historically black colleges and universities hbcus with a field experience that spanned the entire data collection and field experimental design through data analysis modeling and interpretation while under the guise of academic federal and private industry experts in addition to data collection and interpretation students learned to work in a team and effectively communicate their findings dr singha has previously alluded to time spent in the field collecting data as a key driver to her pursuit of hydrology and near surface geophysics now she continues to provide students with similar opportunities to discover their love and curiosity for earth science graduate students within her group often have a significant field component to their research further dr singha s research group often hosts summer interns from a host of institutions including many recruited via the m this program supports field intensive summer internships for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in stem from 2014 to 2022 dr singha s research group collaborated with 8 individual students through the unavco program as of august 2022 many of these students have gone on to pursue graduate studies both in dr singha s research group at mines and at other universities along with other colleagues in the critical zone rcn dr singha developed programming to integrate new researchers and expand diversity and inclusion in the field of critical zone science the initiative has included offering travel grants to conferences or meetings focused on diversity inclusion and access in stem hosting a critical zone meeting specifically for early career critical zone scientists and organizing virtual symposiums for critical conversations on critical zone science topics additionally singha s effort in the mining for talent program which in collaboration with the society for hispanic professional engineers brings in students from alameda international junior senior high school a latinx serving high school in lakewood co to date about 40 students and 5 teachers have visited mines for a tour that highlighted four cutting edge research labs at the school including hands on activity in these state of the science facilities 4 reflections singha s impact on the

the florence bascom lecturer at cuahsi s 2023 biennial these notable examples are only a few selected from her litany of accolades while additional recognitions for mentorship teaching and outstanding performance grace her vitae while these awards are visible and certainly well deserved we have taken the opportunity of this special issue to document the substance that underlies these metrics of success while we provide a review of dr singha s specific contributions to basic research section 2 and her role in fostering a hydrogeophysics community section 3 we reflect here on the traits that underpin her successes forming the foundation upon which a successful and impactful career research teaching and mentoring is built 1 dr singha is both a pioneer of new tools and applications

requisite theoretical underpinning to deploy them in novel applications ultimately pushing the limits of what is possible 2 dr singha s work is not esoteric but intentionally spans disciplines and both basic and applied research niches her advances in theory observation and modeling each contribute to societally relevant problems and the outcomes of her scientific advances are moving the needle in society s greatest challenges particularly in relation to groundwater 3 dr singha has a comfort and competence working across disciplines we have regularly heard her modestly remark i m a hydrologist at geophysics meetings and a geophysicist amongst hydrologists she has not shied away from expertise spanning disciplines and embodies the ideal of calls for increased interdisciplinary

dr singha mentors individuals to achieve their own goals putting her advisees first in a field where indices of productivity and individual accolades could motivate self interest dr singha instead chooses to invest in building the skills and success of her team yielding a network of motivated professionals who get the support they need to level up their subsequent careers she is fair in both praise and criticism of student research helping train productive and resilient natural scientists 5 dr singha values and proactively fosters a diverse community of scholars her advances include

solute tracer critical zone multidisciplinary research mentor data availability data from scopus were used these are publicy available and we do not have permission to reproduce these data in a separate repository 1 introduction the work of dr kamini singha in her career to date has already shaped the field of hydrologic science her body of work pioneers novel geophysical techniques and applications pressing the bounds of our observational abilities and the associated theoretical underpinnings to inform transport and transformation in aquifers and coupled surface and groundwater

specifically contributing to our ability to understand the critical zone the breadth and impact of her research has transformed the field of hydrologic science and the community of scientists practicing in private industry agency science and academia dr singha began her research career following completion of a bachelor s of science in geophysics at the university of connecticut in 1999 where she worked with the usgs branch of geophysics she then went on to receive a ph d in hydrogeology from stanford university in 2005 immediately following completion of her ph d she started as an assistant professor in the geosciences department at pennsylvania state university where over a period of 7 years she rapidly built a robust research program and broad network of students and colleagues in 2012 she continued her career at the department of geology and geological engineering at colorado school of mines where she is currently a university distinguished professor during her

578 other journals fig 1c d ultimately this analysis documents both a distinct impact on and relevance to not only hydrologic sciences but also to host of interdisciplinary applications here we summarize singha s impact on the hydrologic sciences to date first we summarize her impact in four key areas of research non fickian transport and pore scale dynamics section 2 1 working across scales to constrain emergent transport behavior section 2 2 hydrogeophysical characterization of the critical zone section 2 3 and the study of coupled surface and groundwater systems on redox dynamics and contaminant transport section 2 4 taken together these topics represent a step change to our understanding of contaminant transport and transformation in earth s critical zone while presented as distinct topics these research advances integrated by common themes of an openness and excitement to work across disciplines a focus on systems that display multiscale spatial behaviors and the time domain analog problems with apparent non fickian transport dynamics leading to heavy tailed behaviors and thoughtful application of geophysical tools to hydrological and critical zone science next we summarize her role above and beyond research in which she has fostered a diverse and thriving hydrogeophsyics community finally we reflect on the underlying traits that have enabled her impact thus far and summarize her achievements and recognitions taken together singha s body of work has had an outsized impact on hydrologic science that is worthy of synthesis 2 research advances contributions 2 1 dr singha has advanced the theory that underpins non fickian transport and pore scale dynamics dr singha s fundamental research related to non fickian solute transport highlights her unique ability to develop geophysical theory and methodology in novel ways to inform elusive physical critical zone processes and interpret their biological implications over previous decades there have been numerous observations of extended tailing of conservative solutes at late time relative to initial concentration breakthrough along with pronounced solute concentration rebounds after groundwater pump and treat systems are shut down this type of behavior is not predicted by advection dispersion transport mechanics alone and has been often conceptually attributed to exchange with pore spaces of reduced connectivity compared to the more mobile connected matrix pores similar to transient storage models of stream solute transport non fickian transport dynamics in porous media are typically represented by at least one immobile or less mobile domain that exchanges via diffusion and or slow advection with better connected mobile porosity where advection and dispersion processes dominate although mass transfer dynamics between pores of varied connectivity have been theorized for decades e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 field scale observations were almost entirely based on mobile porosity solute breakthrough curve data alone rendering any observations of less mobile mobile solute exchange indirect in nature this is due to a simple experimental constraint of pumped water samples as the mobile domain is preferentially sampled when fluid is extracted even at flow rates similar to ambient advection the major methodological advance that dr singha and her co authors developed was to pair fluid sampling with co located measurements of electrical resistivity collected at comparable scales such that solute exchange with less mobile porosity could more directly be observed and quantified several early publications by dr singha and colleagues presented anomalous field data coupled with novel analysis and model development culkin et al 2008 day lewis and singha 2008 singha et al 2007 the anomalous data were discovered during an experimental evaluation of aquifer storage and recovery potential within a fractured limestone aquifer culkin et al 2008 singha et al 2007 the authors plotted co located fluid electrical conductivity and bulk electrical resistivity the inverse of conductivity data in concentration space and found unexpected pronounced hysteresis between the data types for example as fresh water was pumped into the saline aquifer and then extracted fluid electrical conductivity changed and reached equilibrium points substantially faster than the co located electrical resistivity data this hysteresis defies the simplified concepts presented by archie 1942 where changes in bulk resistivity over time reflect a scaled version of fluid conductivity changes when grain surface conductivity is neglected and the geologic matrix remains constant dr singha and her co authors realized that they could explain the observed fluid bulk electrical hysteresis by developing a bicontinuum version of archie s law that included rate limited mass transfer their hypothesis was that changes in less mobile porosity solute concentration would lag behind concentration shifts in the mobile domain as governed by the relative sizes of the two domains and the mass transfer rate between them i e rate limited simple manipulation of the governing bicontinuum model parameters showed that the shape of the fluid bulk electrical hysteresis loop was highly sensitive to these parameters indicating that their estimation via inverse methods was possible singha et al 2007 further numerical model experimentation by day lewis and singha 2008 supported the rate limited mass transfer explanation dr singha summarized this rapid advance in understanding of rate limited mass transfer for a general hydrologic audience in singha et al 2008 a few years later dr singha s research group conducted more complex numerical flow and transport modeling through heterogeneous porous media using comsol multiphysics where rate limited mass transfer was not assumed these modeling exercises indicated that observed electrical hysteresis patterns could still be accounted for by a simplified bicontinuum model which included both slow advection and diffusion dominated exchanges with pore water wheaton and singha 2010 while fundamental advances in aquifer fate and transport related to non fickian process are no doubt important throughout her research career dr singha also recognized biological implications of physical hydrologic processed particularly at the groundwater surface water interface following the concept that less mobile porosity by nature enhances localized water and solute residence times dr singha and others theorized that such enhanced reactive contact time within less mobile pores might explain other type of anomalous field observations such as biogeochemical signatures of anoxic redox reactions measured in apparently oxic pore waters of the hyporheic zone briggs et al 2015 dr singha and colleagues further explored these apparently anoxic zones nested in oxic hyporheic sediments by pairing controlled chamber hyporheic injections of conservative and reactive solutes with cm scale geoelectrical monitoring briggs et al 2018 dr singha and others found direct evidence of less mobile porosity dynamics in lake and streambed sandy interface sediments along with potential signatures of anoxic microsites embedded in bulk oxic more mobile flow briggs et al 2018 hampton et al 2019 further they found that both the exchange timescales of less mobile porosity and co located reactive processes such as nitrous oxide production were sensitive to flow rates hampton et al 2020 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2019 as with earlier ideas regarding rate limited mass transfer such flow sensitivity had been previously theorized but rarely directly measured taken together these theoretical and applied methodological advances form a basis for understanding the origin and impact of non fickian transport with applications to basic and applied problems in environmental transport and fate of solutes 2 2 dr singha has worked across scales to advance characterization of heterogeneous processes in the context of emergent dynamics dr singha s research has focused on identifying pore scale processes that affect or control macro scale measurements or properties as discussed above non fickian transport is a mechanism invoked to explain the non ideal behavior of chemical tracers and contaminants from pore to system scales at the aquifer scale tracers and or contaminants exhibit decreases in concentration through time with strong late time tailing that cannot be accurately modeled by only considering advection and dispersion this presents a practical problem when these models are used to develop remediation strategies for contaminated aquifers if a standard advective dispersive model systematically underpredicts contaminant concentration at later times then remediation efforts could be concluded too quickly to improve models that inform reach scale or aquifer scale processes swanson et al 2012 used fluid and bulk measurements of electrical conductivity in columns packed with zeolite or quartz sand to evaluate the pore scale processes that influence tracer transport this experimental modeling by dr singha and colleagues found that the volume and arrangement of pores space rather than grain size can mediate transport properties and measured geophysical parameters swanson et al 2015 2012 extending a deep understanding of non fickian transport to other problems and domains is a hallmark of singha s career for example she readily extended theory and conceptual models explaining non fickian transport in porous media to the hyporheic zone coupling pore scale behavior with emergent reach scale applications the same anomalous tailing that is found in aquifers due to non fickian transport also manifests in transport within the river corridor where transient storage is broadly understood to yield long tailing a host of applications focus on solute transport including developing tools for planning tracer injections gonzález pinzón et al 2022 flume and tank scale studies foster et al 2021 wilhelmsen et al 2021 interpretation of tracer data gonzález pinzón et al 2015 ward et al 2014 2013 modeling efforts ward et al 2010b and emerging integration of hydrogeophysical data with solute tracers to understand process dynamics pidlisecky et al 2011 singley et al 2022 dr singha s work across scales is further evident in her contributions to critical zone science discussed in the next section taken together these efforts link studies of anomalous tailing across multiple scales and approaches with scales spanning landforms and scales including pores flowpaths hillslopes stream reaches and aquifers 2 3 dr singha has brought hydrogeophysical tools to bear on critical zone structure and function dr singha s affinity for working across scales and disciplines found a natural fit in critical zone cz science work within the cz is interdisciplinary by nature as the cz contains complex interactions between water rock soil the atmosphere and living organisms richter and mobley 2009 as a consistent pioneer of new tools and applications that bridge disciplines dr singha leveraged her existing expertise in subsurface hydrology surface water groundwater interactions and near surface geophysical methods to explore dynamic processes within the cz dr singha and her collaborators played an important role in applying geophysical methods to investigate hyporheic exchange doughty et al 2020 hagarty et al 2010 singha et al 2008 ward et al 2010a 2010b saturated pore scale exchange mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2019 singha et al 2008 plant water uptake harmon et al 2021 mares et al 2016 voytek et al 2019 and the role of cz structure in hydrologic storage and routing e g kuntz et al 2011 voytek et al 2016 dr singha and others continued to demonstrate the value of near surface geophysical observations to new hydrologic problems by applying time lapse electrical resistivity surveys to the study of hyporheic exchange processes traditionally characterization of stream hyporheic zones relied on parameterizing numerical models to replicate tracer breakthrough curves measured within the stream e g bencala and walters 1983 stream solute workshop 1990 these measurements and models represent the aggregate response of the stream between the point of tracer injection and the measured breakthrough curve making the identification of spatial variations in hyporheic exchange challenging to identify choi et al 2000 kelleher et al 2019 2013 ward et al 2016 by conducting time lapse electrical resistivity surveys during conductive tracer injections dr singha and others were able to begin characterizing spatially variable processes within the hyporheic zone and start identifying areas of slower distributed exchange ward et al 2012 2010a in addition to novel applications of near surface geophysical methods to the hyporheic zone dr singha and her collaborators continued to advance associated theory singha et al 2011 while simultaneously synthesizing their advances for a broader hydrologic audience singha et al 2015 a consistent theme in dr singha s career is her work across disciplines and her contributions to cz science are not an exception dr singha and her collaborators have played an important role in applying near surface geophysical methods to help characterize ecological controls on subsurface storage and routing of water within the cz sullivan et al 2022 or controls of those flowpaths on ecology rey et al 2021 2019 dr singha mentored several students who utilized time lapse electrical resistivity surveys both of the surrounding soil and the tree itself to look at coupled tree soil systems harmon et al 2021 luo et al 2020 mares et al 2016 mares et al 2016 compared temporal patterns of tree sap flux and soil moisture with results from time lapse electrical resistivity surveys of the tree trunk and surrounding soils this study demonstrated the promise for the application of electrical methods to track spatially variable changes in soil moisture as a function of tree water uptake and potentially even hydrologic redistribution expanding on work from mares et al 2016 harmon et al 2021 used similar resistivity methods and wavelet analysis to examine the physical relationships between tree water storage and atmospheric and pedologic variables taken together singha has cemented the role of hydrogeophysical tools as an essential part of the critical zone toolkit 2 4 dr singha has worked across disciplines to constrain the influence of gw sw interactions on redox dynamics and contaminant transformations dr singha s research frequently relies upon interdisciplinary teams that integrate techniques from geophysics hydrology and bio geochemistry her interdisciplinary work has resulted in significant contributions to the scientific community s understanding of how groundwater surface water exchanges mediate solute fate and transport research by dr singha and colleagues that is focused on this topic has utilized a combination of field and lab methods including continuous salt injection tracer tests electrical resistivity tomography fine scale geoelectrical monitoring water sediment and porewater sampling and analysis as well as numerical modeling dr singha and colleagues have applied these techniques to explore metal redox chemistry in mine impacted hyporheic zones hoagland et al 2020 johnston et al 2017 larson et al 2013 rickel et al 2021 nitrogen cycling in urban streams hampton et al 2020 and kettle lakes briggs et al 2018 hampton et al 2019 arsenic and uranium fate and transport in groundwater on the pine ridge reservation swift bird et al 2020 and resazurin a reactive tracer oxidation in an engineered streambed herzog et al 2018 several key findings have emerged from the novel coupling and repeated application of diverse hydrogeophysical and bio geochemical techniques by dr singha and her colleagues first several studies have revealed that fluid exchange rates hydraulic conductivity and bio clogging in the hyporheic zone often mediate the distribution of biogeochemical microzones and may result in strong feedbacks on nutrient transport i e advection vs diffusion dominated in a series of iron oxide reduction experiments biofilms were found to form electrically conductive pathways occlude pore space and increase bulk electrical conductivity regberg et al 2011 later research that paired geoelectrical monitoring with porewater sampling revealed that anaerobic processes occurred in less mobile pore spaces in shallow sediments even though porewater sampling had indicated bulk oxic conditions briggs et al 2018 the concept of co located anoxic and oxic microzones in bulk porous media was explored further using computational models that evaluated different stream and sediment conditions such as variable hydraulic fluxes and nutrient concentrations as well as scenarios with and without biomass roy chowdhury et al 2020 from this modeling the roy chowdhury et al hypothesized that microbes were a key control on nutrient transformation in hyporheic sediment but their associated biomass growth can clog hyporheic pore spaces reduce hydraulic fluxes and lead to the formation of anoxic microzones these concepts have important implications for nutrient transformations for example intermediate residence times in hyporheic sediments were found to favor incomplete denitrification compared to shorter or longer residence times resulting in the release of the greenhouse gas n2o hampton et al 2020 dr singha s research characterizing redox conditions in response to dynamic mixing in the hyporheic zone has had important implications for our understanding of metal geochemistry in streams receiving acid mine drainage bethune et al 2015 hoagland et al 2020 johnston et al 2017 larson et al 2013 rickel et al 2021 a second key finding from her body of work is that groundwater stream exchanges and metal oxide precipitation in the hyporheic zone influence the attenuation or export of metals from acid mine drainage streams for example larson et al 2013 found that the rate of mass transfer between the stream and hyporheic zone controlled the location and depth of fe ii oxidizing niches where niches characterized by slower exchange rates promoted biotic fe ii oxidation and enhanced the precipitation of terraced iron formations and the sequestration of iron later work by dr singha and colleagues further established the link between iron oxide precipitation and hyporheic exchange where fe ii oxidation resulted in a physical barrier separating an acid mine drainage stream from underlying shallow groundwater rickel et al 2021 this physical disconnect resulted in a small hyporheic zone with steep hydrogeochemical gradients high concentrations of toxic metals and low microbial diversity dominated by fe ii oxidizing bacteria hoagland et al 2020 dr singha s multi disciplinary research also works to address environmental contamination and environmental justice issues in marginalized communities both domestically and internationally hagarty et al 2015 swift bird et al 2020 tschakert and singha 2007 for example dr singha and colleagues worked collaboratively with the oglala sioux tribe to delineate hydrogeologic and biogeochemical controls of arsenic and uranium dissolution into the arikaree aquifer on the pine ridge reservation where many people rely on domestic wells as their drinking water source elevated alkalinity and ph levels were found to be the driving factors of arsenic and uranium mobility in the arikaree aquifer downgradient sections of the aquifer in the northern portions of the pine ridge reservation were most likely to be impacted by metal loid contamination due to water rock reactions that increase ph and alkalinity i e groundwater evolution and proximity to volcanic ash that acts as a regional metal loid source swift bird et al 2020 tschakert and singha 2007 evaluated environmental and human health impacts of small scale galamsey i e illegal and unregulated gold mining in ghana through a pilot study working with galamsey miners to understand their perspectives on mining risks environmental hazards and research communication galamsey miners use manual rudimentary and often hazardous techniques to extract and process gold ores including amalgamation with mercury the use of mercury causes negative health impacts for miners and can contaminate water sources crops and soils near mining sites galamsey miners make up the majority of the mining labor force in ghana but they are considered outlaws and environmental criminals and are generally excluded from regulatory and policy considerations on mining tschakert and singha 2007 worked to quantify miner s understanding of mining risks and actively involved galamsey miners in mercury testing using indicator strips their approach found synergies between political ecology environmental justice and ecohealth and many galamsey participants advocated for similar outreach and education in other mining communities the researchers recommended recognition of galamsey miners and active involvement of mining communities as a first step out of the impasse in the ghanian mining sector taken together these research advances are directly transferable to addressing applied problems of contaminant transport and fate particularly for cases where redox dynamics and or coupled gw sw systems are essential to governing the success or failure of remediation 3 fostering an open inclusive hydrogeophysics community dr singha s contributions to the broader earth science community are not well captured by traditional academic metrics alone in addition to an active research program dr singha s contributions include both direct mentorship of individuals outside her immediate research

techniques to budding hydrogeologists singha et al 2022 dr singha consistently strives to be a positive force for change within the earth science community for dr singha this is manifested in her continued work to provide support and resources for early career faculty as well as foster an inclusive culture that encourages historically underrepresented students to consider stem as a career path while at mines dr singha created an early career development program called launching your academic career aimed at providing early career faculty with the knowledge and tools they needed to succeed in their new academic environment for this program dr singha was awarded the mines w m keck mentorship award in addition to mentoring early career faculty dr singha has routinely recognized the need to improve inclusion and access for historically underrepresented groups in the earth science s singha et al 2020 while she was a professor at penn state university dr singha helped develop and run the penn state hydrogeophysics field experience this program provided undergraduate students from penn state and three historically black colleges and universities hbcus with a field experience that spanned the entire data collection and field experimental design through data analysis modeling and interpretation while under the guise of academic federal and private industry experts in addition to data collection and interpretation students learned to work in a team and effectively communicate their findings dr singha has previously alluded to time spent in the field collecting data as a key driver to her pursuit of hydrology and near surface geophysics now she continues to provide students with similar opportunities to discover their love and curiosity for earth science graduate students within her group often have a significant field component to their research further dr singha s research group often hosts summer interns from a host of institutions including many recruited via the m this program supports field intensive summer internships for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in stem from 2014 to 2022 dr singha s research group collaborated with 8 individual students through the unavco program as of august 2022 many of these students have gone on to pursue graduate studies both in dr singha s research group at mines and at other universities along with other colleagues in the critical zone rcn dr singha developed programming to integrate new researchers and expand diversity and inclusion in the field of critical zone science the initiative has included offering travel grants to conferences or meetings focused on diversity inclusion and access in stem hosting a critical zone meeting specifically for early career critical zone scientists and organizing virtual symposiums for critical conversations on critical zone science topics additionally singha s effort in the mining for talent program which in collaboration with the society for hispanic professional engineers brings in students from alameda international junior senior high school a latinx serving high school in lakewood co to date about 40 students and 5 teachers have visited mines for a tour that highlighted four cutting edge research labs at the school including hands on activity in these state of the science facilities 4 reflections singha s impact on the

including the american geophysical union s witherspoon lecturer 2022 being named a geological society of america fellow 2018 serving as the national ground water association s darcy lecturer 2017 and the florence bascom lecturer at cuahsi s 2023 biennial these notable examples are only a few selected from her litany of accolades while additional recognitions for mentorship teaching and outstanding performance grace her vitae while these awards are visible and certainly well deserved we have taken the opportunity of this special issue to document the substance that underlies these metrics of success while we provide a review of dr singha s specific contributions to basic research section 2 and her role in fostering a hydrogeophysics community section 3 we reflect here on the traits that underpin her successes forming the foundation upon which a successful and impactful career research teaching and mentoring is built 1 dr singha is both a pioneer of new tools and applications critically she also closes the loop to demonstrate how these technical innovations may advance our theoretical or conceptual models taken together dr singha is an inventor of approaches and the requisite theoretical underpinning to deploy them in novel applications ultimately pushing the limits of what is possible 2 dr singha s work is not esoteric but intentionally spans disciplines and both basic and applied research niches her advances in theory observation and modeling each contribute to societally relevant problems and the outcomes of her scientific advances are moving the needle in society s greatest challenges particularly in relation to groundwater 3 dr singha has a comfort and competence working across disciplines we have regularly heard her modestly remark i m a hydrologist at geophysics meetings and a geophysicist amongst hydrologists she has not shied away from expertise spanning disciplines and embodies the ideal of calls for increased interdisciplinary science and has an innate sense of good timing for developing diverse collaborations brantley et al 2017 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2020 singha and navarre sitchler 2022 4 dr singha mentors individuals to achieve their own goals putting her advisees first in a field where indices of productivity and individual accolades could motivate self interest dr singha instead chooses to invest in building the skills and success of her team yielding a network of motivated professionals who get the support they need to level up their subsequent careers she is fair in both praise and criticism of student research helping train productive and resilient natural scientists 5 dr singha values and proactively fosters a diverse community of scholars her advances include forward looking commentaries shaping the future of the field e g robinson et al 2008 singha and navarre sitchler 2022 engaging with the next generation of scientists e g her field school in partnership with hbcus and proactively opening doors for diverse scholars and welcoming them into new areas of research e g singha et al 2020 while each of these traits is admirable on its own we contend that the combination of these in one researcher particularly coupled with overwhelmingly positive energy and boundless enthusiasm positioned dr singha to have a disproportionately large impact

1908,water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the world in the 21st century the groundwater reserves are being depleted at a much faster rate than they can be replenished by precipitation this problem can be avoided through the proper identification of rainwater harvesting sites and management of the water resources kumari river basin is a semi arid hard rock landscape where water scarcity has been a serious concern for decades the main objective of this research is to identify suitable sites for surface rainwater harvesting srwh in kumari river basin using geographic information systems gis and the analytic hierarchy process ahp techniques to estimate the srwh sites in the kumari basin 12 factors are taken into consideration the suitability map is

of socioeconomic development globally population explosion has greatly affected water resources especially in developing countries like india worldwide 47 of the population lives in regions where there is a water shortage for at least one month per year boretti and rosa 2019 according to aayog 2019 composite water management index report within the year 2030 india s drinking water demand will become twice resulting in a severe water crisis and a 6 loss in gross domestic product gdp water shortages are common in drought prone arid and semi arid locations across the world resulting in low drinking water quality and quantity as well as a lack of water for agricultural and domestic consumption rockström et al 2002 chowdhury et al 2021 climate change has put a lot of strain on water resources in the last several years mote et al 2003 rainwater harvesting practices can be a good option for water management systems at the present time rainwater harvesting is a significant technique for preserving rainwater and reducing surface runoff it is a useful method to supply water for drinking irrigation and other sectors qadir et al 2007 qi et al 2019 in the ancient greek and roman civilization using groundwater and the method of rainwater harvesting prevalent antoniou et al 2014 angelakis 2016 yannopoulos et al 2019 in india the presence of large reservoirs in the cities of harappa and mohenjo daro of the indus civilization indicates the ancient practice of water conservation by indians khan et al 2021 selvaraj et al 2021 rainwater harvesting rwh method encourages self sufficiency while having low environmental consequences it helps to continue the water supply in the environment india is an agricultural country depending on the monsoonal waters for irrigation gadgil and rupa kumar 2006 the approaching or the onset of monsoonal seasons is quite uncertain at times which brings late monsoon waters with less rainfall disrupting agricultural practices banerjee 2015 singh et al 2019 bombardi et al 2020 at times less rainfall causes droughts in many regions so there is a higher necessity of introducing different irrigational water schemes throughout the country for the betterment of the livelihood the appropriate sites for rainwater collection must be identified using a set of criteria that take into consideration the geoenvironmental features of the watershed this research includes check dams percolation tanks earthen dams and farm ponds as surface rainwater harvesting structures the culture of dam construction is been practised since ancient periods and is increasing day by day it has been reported that 38 of the total stored water which is collected from the various rivers lakes and ponds is only used to perform various agricultural practices nciwrd 1999 the identification of optimal sites and the technical design of rwh systems are essential for success al adamat et al 2010 for the selection of suitable sites and approaches for rwh many methodologies have been established conducting field surveys is the most common technique for selecting acceptable sites for rwh buildings in small regions the identification of suitable sites for various rwh technologies across larger regions is a difficult task ammar et al 2016 gis and remote sensing techniques have been developed in recent decades to provide cost effective and time saving methods for determining appropriate rwh sites singh et al 2017 matomela et al 2020 various researchers conservationists and policymakers have discovered that gis and remote sensing techniques are more effective in assessing monitoring evaluating and managing several dimensions of water resources jha et al 2014 mahmoud and alazba 2015 ammar et al 2016 tiwari et al 2018 singhai et al 2019

investigation has yet been done in the kumari basin to identify potential zones for surface rainwater harvesting structures the findings of this study will help policymakers planners investors and other stakeholders in developing sustainable water resource management plans and scientific strategies to enhance the water security irrigational capacity and socioeconomic development in kumari river basin as well as in similar types of semi arid hard rock watershed in the future 2 location of the study area kumari river basin is one of the main sub basin of the kangsabati river basin which mostly flows over the district of purulia west bengal fig 1 kumari basin covers a total area of 1976 15 km2 which lies within the latitudes 22 42 37 n to 23 14 28 n and longitudes 86 9 27 e to 86 45 23 e the basin is bounded in the western and south western parts by the chotanagpur plateau and the dalma ranges and by the kangsabati reservoir in the eastern portion the kumari river has many small and large tributaries among which some are chaka nangasai jore hanumata sona totko jamuna lithologically the basin lies over the hard rock terrain comprising the granite gneissic complexes the hard and rocky terrain is incapable of serving as a potential groundwater reservoir since rainwater seepage is minimal the soil type of the kumari river basin is mainly residual in nature normally the hilly upland areas consist of the gravelly and sandy loamy type of soil which are of shallow depth the foothill regions contain a thick cover of fluvio colluvial deposits as carried down by the streams while the river valleys and the plain alluvial regions consist of thick alluvium deposits bera et al 2021 in the post monsoonal periods mostly during the months of july october the soils are mostly saturated with rainwater which helps for easy cultivation of the kharif crops whereas during the dry seasons scarcity of water causes a huge problem for the cultivation of the boro crops and water for irrigation can seldom be distributed in the marginal regions of the study area bera and das 2021 the crop cultivation in the study area is mainly dependent on the monsoonal rainwater the inhabitants of this region are accustomed to this type of arid environment yet they never lose hope and instead work hard to cultivate crops for food and living 3 methodology 3 1 thematic layer preparation multiple criteria decision analysis mcda techniques technique has been used for the identification of surface rainwater harvesting suitability zone srwhsz of the basin twelve physical and geoenvironmental factors were considered namely slope land use land cover surface runoff drainage density soil texture rainfall geology curvature lineament density geomorphology topographic wetness index twi and groundwater level the factors that were considered are interdependent with each other and correspond in determining the suitability of sites for srwhsz there is a correspondence between the scales of different geographic data in this study however this correspondence may not necessarily apply to other studies or contexts as different factors may play a more or less significant role in determining the suitability of sites for different purposes the importance of considering multiple physical and geoenvironmental factors at a considerable scale to make informed decisions about water management digital elevation model dem has been prepared by shuttle radar topography mission srtm global digital data with a spatial resolution of 30 m it is noteworthy that the study area encompasses a considerably large region 1976 15 km2 the spatial resolution of 30 m dem can be deemed satisfactory booij 2003 alwan et al 2020 mahmood et al 2020 as it strikes a balance between data availability and computational efficiency making it a reasonable choice for the study using a higher resolution dataset would result in a much larger amount of data which could be difficult to process and analyze carrara et al 1999 de winnaar et al 2007 yilmaz 2009 the slope map and curvature map have been prepared by surface tools of arcgis 10 5 environment for the drainage density map dem was used with hydrology tools twi map has been prepared with dem data in saga gis software with the help of basic terrain analysis tools for each map the dem was projected in wgs 1984 utm zone 45 n coordinate system for the land use land cover map landsat 8 data has been used and with the help of supervised classification land use has been classified this has been further validated with the help of ground truth points arc swat extension tool has been used for runoff map generation with the help of soil and water assessment tool swat model firstly yearly runoff has been calculated sub basin wise from the year 2003 2013 and then annual mean runoff has been calculated from the total runoff of 11 years rainfall data has been collected from the india meteorological department imd with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 this has been prepared from the mean annual rainfall data of 20 years 2001 2020 lineament density map has been generated from national remote sensing centre nrsc bhuvan thematic data with a scale of 1 50 000 soil map has been prepared with nbss and lup soil data which has been georeferenced and digitized geology and geomorphology maps have been collected from the geological survey of india gsi with a scale of 1 50 000 groundwater level map has been prepared using field data a total of 54 shallow tube wells were selected for the depth to water level data in different seasons then the annual mean water level map has been generated using the idw interpolation technique during the field survey a total of 52 check dams constructed with concrete materials were identified fig 2 3 2 ahp mcda technique and preparation of final suitability map the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a popular reliable mcda technique this helps with a pairwise comparison of multiple criteria analysis via weighted analysis saaty 1980 established this method for relative priority analysis in this ahp comparison matrix an equal number of columns and rows are present with their relative scores placed diagonally value 1 equal importance is placed through the middle corner diagonally the criteria are ranked from 1 to 9 depending on their relative importance in rainwater selection site the consistency ratio cr is calculated based on the principal eigenvalue and random index ri scale of the comparison matrix if the cr value is less than 0 1 then the matrix consistency is acceptable and eligible for weighted analysis the comparison matrix has been used for calculating the weighted value of the subclass of the thematic layers tables 1 3 the classified thematic layers of 30 30 m cell size have been reclassified based on their weighted values the final surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones srwhsz map of the study area has been prepared using the weighted overlay analysis of the 12 thematic layers the jenks natural breaks classification method jenks 1967 was used to classify the final srwhsz map into four different classes in this study a cr value of 0 066 was obtained which is less than 0 1 therefore the consistency is satisfactory for subsequent analysis for validation 52 existing check dam sites table s1 see supplementary file have been considered and receiver operating characteristic curve roc has been used fig 3 shows the methodological flowchart for the identification of surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones 3 3 thematic layers of rainwater harvesting conditioning factors 3 3 1 slope the steepness of the slope affects a basin s infiltration rate volume runoff velocity and direction chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 considering the degree of steepness the slope of kumari basin has been categorised into six classes fig 4 a which are 0 3 nearly levelled 3 5 gentle 5 10 moderate 10 15 moderately steep 15 30 steep and 30 very steep most of the area under study exhibits nearly levelled slopes whose spatial coverage is 41 84 and can be generally seen in valley fill regions and agriculture fields nearly 51 82 of the area has a moderate to gentle slope steep slopes are noticeable in the northwestern southwestern and southeastern parts this type of slope steepness can be found in only a small section 1 74 of the basin areas with steep slopes have higher runoff velocity and higher sedimentation rate and therefore srwh structures constructed in these areas suffer damage nyssen et al 2004 the implementation of srwh structures is not well suited for regions characterized by sharp inclines in contrast for such topographical features the contour bundh and nala bundh varieties of structures would be more suitable gully plugs and terracing are appropriate structures for regions that have moderately steep slopes ammar et al 2016 toosi et al 2020 structures such as farm ponds and check dams are suitable for areas with gentle to moderately steep slopes as they are capable of retaining water for extended periods 3 3 2 land use and land cover lulc the land use pattern of any area significantly influences the runoff rate infiltration rate and evapotranspiration rate fu et al 2003 change in the land use pattern of an area affects the hydrological response in the kumari basin five classes of land use and land cover lulc can be noticed which are forest agricultural land water bodies fallow land and settlement fig 4b agriculture is practised in the majority of the basin s areas 43 13 in the study area 16 13 of the terrain is fallow land which includes grassland shrub barren land and pasture land these areas can be considered appropriate for srwh structures where structures like percolation tanks check dams and farm ponds can be constructed building these types of structures close to agricultural lands help farmers irrigate their lands with a continuous supply of water during dry seasons which thus leads to sustainable utilization of fallow land moist deciduous kind of forest covers 21 71 of the surface area due to the lower runoff and higher infiltration rate observed in forest regions burch et al 1989 it is advisable to avoid using these terrains as sites for srwh waterbodies and settlements are found within 1 9 and 17 13 of the basin respectively 3 3 3 surface runoff the nature velocity and volume of runoff depend on certain factors of the concerned area such as soil type land use slope angle distribution and duration of rainfall the amount of surface runoff in the study area has been categorised into six different classes fig 4c i e very low 570 590 mm low 590 608 mm moderately low 608 623 mm moderate 623 643 mm high 643 687 mm and very high 687 774 mm in the maximum section 44 58 of the study area a high to very high runoff can be noticed in the chaka jore sub catchment a very high runoff has been observed in the uppermost sub catchment and in the southeastern portion of jamuna sub catchment moderate amount of surface runoff is seen which covers 17 65 of the study area low to very low runoff has been observed in the southwestern sub catchments of the basin which include runoff from nangasai and sona catchment low runoff areas are suitable for recharge based or subsurface rwh structures gully plug is considered suitable in areas where a high to very high amount of runoff is exhibited kadam et al 2012 check dams are found to be appropriate for areas where moderate to high runoff is present pourghasemi et al 2020 similarly the construction of farm ponds and percolation tank like structures is recommended in areas where low to moderately low runoff is observed rajasekhar et al 2020 3 3 4 drainage density lower runoff is generally exhibited by areas with low drainage density whereas higher runoff is observed in areas with higher drainage density bera et al 2020 drainage density of the study area has been categorised mainly into five classes fig 4d i e very low 0 0 52 km km2 low 0 52 0 83 km km2 moderate 0 83 1 08 km km2 high 1 08 1 34 km km2 and very high 1 34 1 96 km km2 moderate to high drainage density can be observed in major parts of the basin covering around 55 01 of the area while 14 97 of the basin area exhibits very high drainage density areas with high to very high drainage density are deemed appropriate for srwh structures as water from surface runoff can be promptly stored with the assistance of rwh structures the implementation of check dams within these regions has the potential to effectively store a substantial quantity of water but for areas with low to very low drainage density groundwater recharge based rwh structures are suitable a low to very low drainage density can be observed in 30 02 of the area of the basin 3 3 5 soil texture soil with a coarse texture is more permeable while soil having a finer texture shows lower permeability and thus lower infiltration rate leading to its higher capability to hold water on the soil surface for a longer duration cote et al 2003 fine loamy soil which covers 49 27 of the area is the dominant soil group in the study area fig 4e in the middle and southern portions of the basin which comprise banduan ranibandh and certain parts of the binpur ii block a silty clay soil type covering 10 52 of the area can be observed these fine loamy and silty clay soil types are considered appropriate for surface rainwater harvesting rwh since their infiltration rates are low and runoff amounts are higher hashim and sayl 2021 consequently high runoff depths can be observed after rainfall in these areas thus the soil surface is capable of retaining high amount of water and the accumulated water cannot easily leach underground through this fine loamy and silty clay type of soil in the southern and southwestern parts of the basin around 8 59 of the area is covered by loamy skeletal type of soil because of high porosity and permeability this type of soil exhibits higher infiltration rate consequently regions with this type of soil are appropriate for groundwater recharge as water gets easily drained under the soil cover singh et al 2013 in the upper catchment of the basin in few parts of balarampur block and in the northern and north eastern side in manbazar i manbazar ii and puncha block 31 62 of the area is covered by loamy soil this type of soil has medium infiltration rate and water holding capacity 3 3 6 distribution of rainfall rainfall is the primary source of water for srwh and therefore is an important hydroclimatic factor for srwh site selection since the kumari river basin receives the maximum amount of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season thus during the dry seasons because of lack of rain the local people suffer from water scarcity however considering annual mean rainfall the rainfall amount is high and is around 1350 2033 mm fig 4f so if water received during the monsoon season can be stored with the help of the srwh structure then during the dry season water requirement of people for agriculture and various domestic purposes can be fulfilled to some extent the annual rainfall amount of the study area has been divided into 5 different classes low 1350 1595 mm moderately low 1595 1671 mm moderate 1671 1766 mm high 1766 1884 mm and very high 1884 2033 mm a very high amount of rainfall can be observed at the lower catchment of the basin which covers only 8 97 of the basin area high amount of rainfall can be observed in the upper catchment south and southeastern portions of the basin covering 23 49 of the basin area a moderate amount of rainfall can be seen in 30 53 of the basin high and moderate amounts of rainfall are appropriate for surface water harvesting because to store an adequate amount of water in the srwh structures maximum water can be obtained from surface runoff mahmoud and alazba 2015 in the western and middle portions of the basin areas covering 15 05 of the total area are characterized by a low amount of rainfall while 21 96 of the basin area is marked by moderately low rainfall 3 3 7 geology the kumari river basin is mainly located in hard rock terrain the northern part of the basin is made of chotanagpur granite gneiss complex covering 34 87 of the basin area while the southern region is a part of singhbhum craton covering 46 82 of the basin where mica schist and shale can be seen fig 4 g quartzite a non foliated metamorphic rock with low permeability and porosity that inhibits easy water leaching can be observed primarily in certain areas of patamda block and a few small pockets in the southern part of the basin therefore this site is considered suitable for srwh in the upper catchment of the basin near bagmundi upland a very small percentage 0 5 of basalt phylite and mica schist is found epidiorite and hornblende schist make up 9 19 of the basin area the construction of srwh structures in this area is considered moderately suitable in the southern portion of the basin younger granite intrusive rock with a high concentration of alkali feldspar and low permeability is present making it suitable for srwh the rock is rich in alkali feldspar and has a lower permeability allowing it to be suitable for srwh covering 3 31 of the southern portion of the basin the presence of recent alluvium in the northern portion of the basin is indicated which is suitable as a groundwater storage zone however due to its higher porosity and permeability this area is deemed unsuitable for srwh 3 3 8 curvature curvature maps are used to understand the convexity and concavity of the land surface of any area a positive value of curvature indicates a convex surface whereas a negative value signifies a concave surface when the value approaches zero a flat surface is indicated the curvature map of the kumari basin has been divided into three classes convex 0 39 9 10 flat 0 60 to 0 30 and concave 9 to 0 60 fig 4h a concave curvature is observed in 15 98 of the basin and srwh structures can be deemed appropriate for these areas due to the ability of the concave slopes of the landforms to aid in water accumulation and storage convex surfaces are drained of water by runoff and subsequently relocated to other areas rendering these landforms unsuitable for srwh sites the majority of the region at 60 44 has a flat surface curvature making these places suitable for srwh structure development 3 3 9 lineament density lineament is the linear feature of any landscape which indicates the underlying geological structure of any landform such as fault and fracture joints solomon and quiel 2006 generally lineaments remain underlain by weathered materials which increase the secondary porosity and permeability of the media rajaveni et al 2017 the lineament density of kumari river has been categorised into 4 classes very high 0 53 0 72 high 0 35 0 53 moderate 0 17 0 35 and low 0 0 17 fig 4 i in 15 67 of the basin area a high to very high lineament density is observed rendering these zones unsuitable for srwh structures due to the ease with which water is drained through faults and cracks in the presence of lineaments as a consequence surface water does not have enough time to accumulate in these areas hence the construction of srwh structures should be avoided in these sites nevertheless groundwater recharge is suitable in these zones a moderate type of lineament density is observed in approximately 32 07 of the basin area however a low density of lineaments is predominant in the majority 52 26 of the basin these sites can be considered suitable for srwh 3 3 10 geomorphology geomorphic features of any region influence the surface runoff infiltration rate and hydrological control of the region in the kumari river basin mainly 4 types of geomorphic landforms can be observed fig 4 j almost 45 91 area of the basin has shallow buried pediment and 35 84 of the area shows the presence of medium buried pediment generally shallow buried pediments are landforms which are made of weathered materials showing moderate slope and having layers which are up to 0 5 m thick ghosh and jana 2018 these sites are suitable for srwh medium buried pediments show gentle slopes and are composed of moderately weathered complexes they are relatively thicker than shallow buried pediments these sites are moderately suitable for srwh construction valley fill features are observable in 5 92 of the basin area comprised of unconsolidated alluvial deposits along the river valley floor which are conducive to srwh due to their high infiltration rates as a result the potential for groundwater in these areas is also deemed high covering a very small area 1 45 scattered in some pockets in the basin there are low and moderately dissected denudational hills and valleys which have moderate to steep slopes in the uppermost catchment of the basin in the bagmundi hill region and the south east portion in the upper catchment of totko and jamuna rivers 7 91 highly and moderately dissected structural hills can be seen the steep sloped landforms consisting of rocky and skeletal soil are generally unsuitable for srwh besides 2 97 of the basin area is utilised for the construction of dams and reservoirs 3 3 11 topographic wetness index topographic wetness index twi is used for showing the spatial scale effect of hydrological processes of any region at the local level beven and kirkby 1979 with the help of twi water movement on any sloped terrain which is controlled by topography can be understood this also influences runoff generation therefore regions having high twi values also indicate a high amount of surface wetness twi in the kumari river basin has been divided into 5 classes very high 15 77 25 60 high 11 94 15 77 moderate 9 03 11 94 low 6 48 9 03 and very low 2 38 6 48 fig 4 k the major portion 41 97 of the basin shows a very low twi value and these sites are not suitable for srwh these areas have steep to moderately steep slopes and the surface is relatively dry and water gets easily drained towards the area of gentle slopes high to very high twi values are observed in 15 62 of the basin area typically a high twi value is observed along the stream path line these areas show water flow accumulation tendency and as a result availability of water in these areas is high and thus can be considered for srwh construction with a moderate twi value and a moderately gentle slope 16 87 of the basin area is fairly suited for srwh usually structures such as gully plugs and nala bundh are appropriate for these areas 3 3 12 groundwater level as kumari river basin is situated in hard rock terrain groundwater availability everywhere in the basin is not the same in some places depth of groundwater is considerably more so during dry seasons inhabitants of these places suffer from groundwater scarcity and difficulty to meet their domestic and agricultural needs an alternative source of surface water for people of these regions will therefore be beneficial and will help them to carry out their daily chores thus to select a suitable site for srwh construction groundwater depth of that region is an important factor mean annual groundwater depth in the kumari river basin has been categorised into six classes 2 3 mbgl very shallow 3 4 mbgl shallow 4 5 mbgl moderately shallow 5 6 mbgl moderately deep 6 7 mbgl deep and 7 9 mbgl very deep fig 4 l shallow groundwater levels can be observed in the major area 43 61 of the basin a shallow groundwater level can usually be seen in the maximum parts of boram patamda bunduan manbazar i and balarampur blocks deep to very deep groundwater levels are found in 4 15 of the basin area which includes nimdih purulia i and puncha blocks and few patches of the middle portion of the basin these areas are suitable for srwh and will be beneficial for the inhabitants as they will be able to meet a significant share of their needs using surface water instead of groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones with proposed structures the surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones srwhsz map has been classified into 4 different classes highly suitable moderately suitable less suitable and unsuitable fig 5 nearly 20 26 of the basin area is covered by highly suitable zones which include parts of the basin s northern noagarh kuruktopa dorodih northwestern jugidi gitting lahar western bareda moraidih chakulia and southwestern portions these regions are mostly riverine or related river bank areas with low to moderate slope steepness high runoff high drainage density high twi and predominate fine loamy to silty clayed soil texture moderately suitable zone is observed dominantly present in the study area covering 32 74 of the study area in the basin 17 60 of the area covers unsuitable zone and 29 40 of the area covers less suitable zones these regions show moderately steep 15 30 to steep slope 30 also many of this zone is covered with settlement and forest these aforesaid reasons make these regions unsuitable for srwh structure construction the relationship of 12 factors related to the final srwhs map is shown through scatter plots and bar graphs fig 6 the pearson correlation coefficient is examined between the quantitative parameters such as slope surface runoff drainage density rainfall curvature lineament density and twi and their relationship with srwhsz a moderately strong negative correlation r 0 42 between slope and srwhsz is noted sites with a gentle slope s steepness are more suited for srwh structures constructions prior research has mentioned that the slope of a given area plays a significant role in determining suitable sites for the construction of srwh structures mahmoud and tang 2015 balkhair and ur rahman 2021 khan et al 2022 the drainage density and twi exhibit moderately positive correlations with srwhsz with correlation values of 0 37 and 0 34 respectively these results are consistent with the conclusions of prior studies gómez plaza et al 2001 odiji et al 2021 ettazarini 2021 the correlation is relatively weak for rainfall r 0 12 curvature r 0 17 and lineament density r 0 16 the relation between srwhsz and the qualitative parameters is represented using the bar diagram the correlation indicates that srwh structures are better suited for agricultural land and fallow land tariqul islam et al 2017 tiwari et al 2018 additionally the appropriateness of silty clay and fine loamy soil for srwh structures is consistent with the results of prior research kahinda et al 2008 ibrahim et al 2019 granite and quartzite are more feasible for srwh structures based on geology mukherjee 2008 raju 2015 and through geomorphology moderately dissected denudational hills and valleys valley fill medium buried pediment and shallow buried pediment are more suitable for the check dam sites generally 5 15 slope angles are taken into consideration and in 2nd and 3rd order streams these check dam sites are selected padmavathy et al 1993 pandey et al 2011 ettazarini 2021 total of 32 suitable sites are proposed for the construction of the check dams in the basin fig 7 table s2 see supplementary file the sites for earthen dams are chosen based on the selection of 2nd 3rd and 4th order streams hashim and sayl 2021 it is a common water harvesting structure in the kumari basin area the farmers in this region by using locally available materials soil wood boulders constructed the check dam for temporary purposes a total of 17 earthen dam sites have been proposed fig 8 among which 3 each in balarampur and barabazar blocks 2 each in boram bandwan manbazar i and purulia i blocks whereas 1 each site has been proposed in binpur ii puncha manbazar ii blocks table s3 see supplementary file percolation tank sites are selected in the 1st and 2nd order stream jha et al 2014 rais and javed 2014 mainly in the agricultural land fallow land where moderately steep slopes are selected as the proposed sites a total of 35 sites have been proposed for percolation tanks table s4 see supplementary file a farm pond is an important sustainable structure for rainwater harvesting for the site selection of farm pond 1st order stream and its surrounding regions are selected kadam et al 2012 singh et al 2017 locations with 1 2 feeder channel have been considered for the farm pond sites so that surface runoff water can easily accumulate in it during monsoon a total of 24 locations have been proposed for the construction of farm ponds six of these proposed sites are located in the barabazar block while four sites each have been proposed in the balarampur patamda and manbazar ii blocks the remaining blocks have one or two proposed sites each table s5 see supplementary file for gulley plug structures steep to moderately steep slope areas mainly forest land shrub land and fallow land areas are considered the reel and gully regions before the 1st order stream are suitable for the construction of gulley plug structures varade et al 2013 kumar and jhariya 2017 a total of 19 sites are proposed for gulley plug structures among which 4 lies in balarampur block 3 in bandwan bock and 1 2 each for other blocks table s6 see supplementary file focusing on the problems of water shortage the cultivation of selective less water demanding crops can be practised in water scarce agricultural regions water saving irrigation systems such as overhead sprinklers and drip irrigation can be used which require less water for irrigation and production of higher yields of crops the usage of less amount of water for irrigation will help to accommodate the usual requirement of water for domestic purposes and less economic downfall during the summer season 4 2 validation the receiver operator characteristic roc curve analysis has been employed to validate the predictive accuracy of the model utilizing 52 pre existing check dam sites which were identified through field surveys a comparison was made between the existing check dam sites and the final srwhsz map in the high to moderately suitable zones the existing check dams are denoted as 1 whereas the less suitable and unsuitable zones are denoted as 0 if the value is 1 then the condition has been accepted whereas if the value is 0 then the conditions are refused roc curve is a very popular and acceptable scientific method using which many researchers have validated the mcda model mogaji et al 2016 rahmati et al 2019 ettazarini 2021 manaouch et al 2021 this is known as deterministic and probabilistic forecasting system the auc area under the curve ranges from 0 5 to 1 with a value close to 1 indicating a higher level of prediction accuracy the prediction accuracy rate of the accuracy value is divided into 5 range zones which are 0 5 0 6 low to poor 0 6 0 7 moderate average 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 very good 0 9 1 excellent generally auc indicates the percentage of prediction value the roc auc result for this study is 87 4 0 874 and its standard error value is 0 050 with an asymptotic significance value of 0 00 for this model fig 9 the roc auc value for this model indicates an excellent predictive accuracy rate the feasibility of the predicted rainwater harvesting sites has been confirmed through field investigations at the sites providing additional support for the validity of the model 5 conclusion kumari river basin is agriculture based hard rock dominated semi arid region where severe water crisis occurs during summer regional disparity in availability of water limited number of water reservoirs and acute depletion of water level are the big challenges for water resource management in this region the long term management of water resources is crucial because water security has become a primary challenge in regional economic and social development the surface rainwater harvesting suitability for the region has been described in terms of four different zones using the gis based mcda model in this study a total of 20 26 of the basin area are under high suitability zone where high surface runoff low to moderate slope fine loamy soil texture and high drainage density are observed whereas 17 60 area shows unsuitable zone with steep slopes forest cover and settlement areas the validation has been done by roc auc curve whose predictive accuracy value is 87 4 which indicates an excellent accuracy rate for the model through this study 32 suitable check dam sites 17 earthen dam sites 35 percolation tank sites 24 farm ponds and 19 gulley plug sites are been proposed for surface rainwater harvesting structures constructions in kumari river basin these proposed sites may be used for construction of the said types of structures which would play a vital role in water management and regional water resource development of the area similar types of study

1908,water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the world in the 21st century the groundwater reserves are being depleted at a much faster rate than they can be replenished by precipitation this problem can be avoided through the proper identification of rainwater harvesting sites and management of the water resources kumari river basin is a semi arid hard rock landscape where water scarcity has been a serious concern for decades the main objective of this research is to identify suitable sites for surface rainwater harvesting srwh in kumari river basin using geographic information systems gis and the analytic hierarchy process ahp techniques to estimate the srwh sites in the kumari basin 12 factors are taken into consideration the suitability map is classified into 4 classes of which 20 26 show high suitability zones 32 74 are moderately suitable zones 29 40 are less suitable zones and 17 60 are unsuitable zones the validation has been done by receiver operator characteristic roc curve using the 52 existing check dam sites whose predictive accuracy value is 87 4 which indicates an excellent accuracy rate of the model through this study sites for the construction of srwh structures including 32 suitable check dam sites 17 earthen dam sites 35 percolation tank sites 24 farm pond sites and 19 gulley plug sites have been proposed the

of socioeconomic development globally population explosion has greatly affected water resources especially in developing countries like india worldwide 47 of the population lives in regions where there is a water shortage for at least one month per year boretti and rosa 2019 according to aayog 2019 composite water management index report within the year 2030 india s drinking water demand will become twice resulting in a severe water crisis and a 6 loss in gross domestic product gdp water shortages are common in drought prone arid and semi arid locations across the world resulting in low drinking water quality and quantity as well as a lack of water for agricultural and domestic consumption rockström et al 2002 chowdhury et al 2021 climate change has put a lot of strain on water resources in the last several years mote et al 2003 rainwater harvesting practices can be a good option for water management systems at the present time rainwater harvesting is a significant technique for preserving rainwater and reducing surface runoff it is a useful method to supply water for drinking irrigation and other sectors qadir et al 2007 qi et al 2019 in the ancient greek and roman civilization using groundwater and the method of rainwater harvesting prevalent antoniou et al 2014 angelakis 2016 yannopoulos et al 2019 in india the presence of large reservoirs in the cities of harappa and mohenjo daro of the indus civilization indicates the ancient practice of water conservation by indians khan et al 2021 selvaraj et al 2021 rainwater harvesting rwh method encourages self sufficiency while having low environmental consequences it helps to continue the water supply in the environment india is an agricultural country depending on the monsoonal waters for irrigation gadgil and rupa kumar 2006 the approaching or the onset of monsoonal seasons is quite uncertain at times which brings late monsoon waters with less rainfall disrupting agricultural practices banerjee 2015 singh et al 2019 bombardi et al 2020 at times less rainfall causes droughts in many regions so there is a higher necessity of introducing different irrigational water schemes throughout the country for the betterment of the livelihood the appropriate sites for rainwater collection must be identified using a set of criteria that take into consideration the geoenvironmental features of the watershed this research includes check dams percolation tanks earthen dams and farm ponds as surface rainwater harvesting structures the culture of dam construction is been practised since ancient periods and is increasing day by day it has been reported that 38 of the total stored water which is collected from the various rivers lakes and ponds is only used to perform various agricultural practices nciwrd 1999 the identification of optimal sites and the technical design of rwh systems are essential for success al adamat et al 2010 for the selection of suitable sites and approaches for rwh many methodologies have been established conducting field surveys is the most common technique for selecting acceptable sites for rwh buildings in small regions the identification of suitable sites for various rwh technologies across larger regions is a difficult task ammar et al 2016 gis and remote sensing techniques have been developed in recent decades to provide cost effective and time saving methods for determining appropriate rwh sites singh et al 2017 matomela et al 2020 various researchers conservationists and policymakers have discovered that gis and remote sensing techniques are more effective in assessing monitoring evaluating and managing several dimensions of water resources jha et al 2014 mahmoud and alazba 2015 ammar et al 2016 tiwari et al 2018 singhai et al 2019 hashim and sayl 2021 yegizaw et al 2022 several researchers in various regions of the world have done studies on the identification of suitable rainwater harvesting sites and related harvesting structures kahinda et al 2009 ammar et al 2016 terêncio et al 2017 mugo and odera 2019 hashim and sayl 2021 sacolo and mkhandi 2021 the identification of the rwh sites is based on a variety of parameters including climate slope soil elevation hydrology agronomy and socioeconomic considerations fao 2003 in this study the determination of suitable sites for surface rainwater harvesting srwh can be done using gis based ahp weighted overlay process plenty of significant research has been done on groundwater potential zones groundwater quality and water resource management in chotanagpur gneissic complex region including kumari basin samal et al 2015 farooq et al 2018 ghosh and jana 2018 maity and mandal 2019 gupta and patel 2021 bera et al 2022 chowdhury et al 2022 but no extensive investigation has yet been done in the kumari basin to identify potential zones for surface rainwater harvesting structures the findings of this study will help policymakers planners investors and other stakeholders in developing sustainable water resource management plans and scientific strategies to enhance the water security irrigational capacity and socioeconomic development in kumari river basin as well as in similar types of semi arid hard rock watershed in the future 2 location of the study area kumari river basin is one of the main sub basin of the kangsabati river basin which mostly flows over the district of purulia west bengal fig 1 kumari basin covers a total area of 1976 15 km2 which lies within the latitudes 22 42 37 n to 23 14 28 n and longitudes 86 9 27 e to 86 45 23 e the basin is bounded in the western and south western parts by the chotanagpur plateau and the dalma ranges and by the kangsabati reservoir in the eastern portion the kumari river has many small and large tributaries among which some are chaka nangasai jore hanumata sona totko jamuna lithologically the basin lies over the hard rock terrain comprising the granite gneissic complexes the hard and rocky terrain is incapable of serving as a potential groundwater reservoir since rainwater seepage is minimal the soil type of the kumari river basin is mainly residual in nature normally the hilly upland areas consist of the gravelly and sandy loamy type of soil which are of shallow depth the foothill regions contain a thick cover of fluvio colluvial deposits as carried down by the streams while the river valleys and the plain alluvial regions consist of thick alluvium deposits bera et al 2021 in the post monsoonal periods mostly during the months of july october the soils are mostly saturated with rainwater which helps for easy cultivation of the kharif crops whereas during the dry seasons scarcity of water causes a huge problem for the cultivation of the boro crops and water for irrigation can seldom be distributed in the marginal regions of the study area bera and das 2021 the crop cultivation in the study area is mainly dependent on the monsoonal rainwater the inhabitants of this region are accustomed to this type of arid environment yet they never lose hope and instead work hard to cultivate crops for food and living 3 methodology 3 1 thematic layer preparation multiple criteria decision analysis mcda techniques technique has been used for the identification of surface rainwater harvesting suitability zone srwhsz of the basin twelve physical and geoenvironmental factors were considered namely slope land use land cover surface runoff drainage density soil texture rainfall geology curvature lineament density geomorphology topographic wetness index twi and groundwater level the factors that were considered are interdependent with each other and correspond in determining the suitability of sites for srwhsz there is a correspondence between the scales of different geographic data in this study however this correspondence may not necessarily apply to other studies or contexts as different factors may play a more or less significant role in determining the suitability of sites for different purposes the importance of considering multiple physical and geoenvironmental factors at a considerable scale to make informed decisions about water management digital elevation model dem has been prepared by shuttle radar topography mission srtm global digital data with a spatial resolution of 30 m it is noteworthy that the study area encompasses a considerably large region 1976 15 km2 the spatial resolution of 30 m dem can be deemed satisfactory booij 2003 alwan et al 2020 mahmood et al 2020 as it strikes a balance between data availability and computational efficiency making it a reasonable choice for the study using a higher resolution dataset would result in a much larger amount of data which could be difficult to process and analyze carrara et al 1999 de winnaar et al 2007 yilmaz 2009 the slope map and curvature map have been prepared by surface tools of arcgis 10 5 environment for the drainage density map dem was used with hydrology tools twi map has been prepared with dem data in saga gis software with the help of basic terrain analysis tools for each map the dem was projected in wgs 1984 utm zone 45 n coordinate system for the land use land cover map landsat 8 data has been used and with the help of supervised classification land use has been classified this has been further validated with the help of ground truth points arc swat extension tool has been used for runoff map generation with the help of soil and water assessment tool swat model firstly yearly runoff has been calculated sub basin wise from the year 2003 2013 and then annual mean runoff has been calculated from the total runoff of 11 years rainfall data has been collected from the india meteorological department imd with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 this has been prepared from the mean annual rainfall data of 20 years 2001 2020 lineament density map has been generated from national remote sensing centre nrsc bhuvan thematic data with a scale of 1 50 000 soil map has been prepared with nbss and lup soil data which has been georeferenced and digitized geology and geomorphology maps have been collected from the geological survey of india gsi with a scale of 1 50 000 groundwater level map has been prepared using field data a total of 54 shallow tube wells were selected for the depth to water level data in different seasons then the annual mean water level map has been generated using the idw interpolation technique during the field survey a total of 52 check dams constructed with concrete materials were identified fig 2 3 2 ahp mcda technique and preparation of final suitability map the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a popular reliable mcda technique this helps with a pairwise comparison of multiple criteria analysis via weighted analysis saaty 1980 established this method for relative priority analysis in this ahp comparison matrix an equal number of columns and rows are present with their relative scores placed diagonally value 1 equal importance is placed through the middle corner diagonally the criteria are ranked from 1 to 9 depending on their relative importance in rainwater selection site the consistency ratio cr is calculated based on the principal eigenvalue and random index ri scale of the comparison matrix if the cr value is less than 0 1 then the matrix consistency is acceptable and eligible for weighted analysis the comparison matrix has been used for calculating the weighted value of the subclass of the thematic layers tables 1 3 the classified thematic layers of 30 30 m cell size have been reclassified based on their weighted values the final surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones srwhsz map of the study area has been prepared using the weighted overlay analysis of the 12 thematic layers the jenks natural breaks classification method jenks 1967 was used to classify the final srwhsz map into four different classes in this study a cr value of 0 066 was obtained which is less than 0 1 therefore the consistency is satisfactory for subsequent analysis for validation 52 existing check dam sites table s1 see supplementary file have been considered and receiver operating characteristic curve roc has been used fig 3 shows the methodological flowchart for the identification of surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones 3 3 thematic layers of rainwater harvesting conditioning factors 3 3 1 slope the steepness of the slope affects a basin s infiltration rate volume runoff velocity and direction chaplot and le bissonnais 2003 considering the degree of steepness the slope of kumari basin has been categorised into six classes fig 4 a which are 0 3 nearly levelled 3 5 gentle 5 10 moderate 10 15 moderately steep 15 30 steep and 30 very steep most of the area under study exhibits nearly levelled slopes whose spatial coverage is 41 84 and can be generally seen in valley fill regions and agriculture fields nearly 51 82 of the area has a moderate to gentle slope steep slopes are noticeable in the northwestern southwestern and southeastern parts this type of slope steepness can be found in only a small section 1 74 of the basin areas with steep slopes have higher runoff velocity and higher sedimentation rate and therefore srwh structures constructed in these areas suffer damage nyssen et al 2004 the implementation of srwh structures is not well suited for regions characterized by sharp inclines in contrast for such topographical features the contour bundh and nala bundh varieties of structures would be more suitable gully plugs and terracing are appropriate structures for regions that have moderately steep slopes ammar et al 2016 toosi et al 2020 structures such as farm ponds and check dams are suitable for areas with gentle to moderately steep slopes as they are capable of retaining water for extended periods 3 3 2 land use and land cover lulc the land use pattern of any area significantly influences the runoff rate infiltration rate and evapotranspiration rate fu et al 2003 change in the land use pattern of an area affects the hydrological response in the kumari basin five classes of land use and land cover lulc can be noticed which are forest agricultural land water bodies fallow land and settlement fig 4b agriculture is practised in the majority of the basin s areas 43 13 in the study area 16 13 of the terrain is fallow land which includes grassland shrub barren land and pasture land these areas can be considered appropriate for srwh structures where structures like percolation tanks check dams and farm ponds can be constructed building these types of structures close to agricultural lands help farmers irrigate their lands with a continuous supply of water during dry seasons which thus leads to sustainable utilization of fallow land moist deciduous kind of forest covers 21 71 of the surface area due to the lower runoff and higher infiltration rate observed in forest regions burch et al 1989 it is advisable to avoid using these terrains as sites for srwh waterbodies and settlements are found within 1 9 and 17 13 of the basin respectively 3 3 3 surface runoff the nature velocity and volume of runoff depend on certain factors of the concerned area such as soil type land use slope angle distribution and duration of rainfall the amount of surface runoff in the study area has been categorised into six different classes fig 4c i e very low 570 590 mm low 590 608 mm moderately low 608 623 mm moderate 623 643 mm high 643 687 mm and very high 687 774 mm in the maximum section 44 58 of the study area a high to very high runoff can be noticed in the chaka jore sub catchment a very high runoff has been observed in the uppermost sub catchment and in the southeastern portion of jamuna sub catchment moderate amount of surface runoff is seen which covers 17 65 of the study area low to very low runoff has been observed in the southwestern sub catchments of the basin which include runoff from nangasai and sona catchment low runoff areas are suitable for recharge based or subsurface rwh structures gully plug is considered suitable in areas where a high to very high amount of runoff is exhibited kadam et al 2012 check dams are found to be appropriate for areas where moderate to high runoff is present pourghasemi et al 2020 similarly the construction of farm ponds and percolation tank like structures is recommended in areas where low to moderately low runoff is observed rajasekhar et al 2020 3 3 4 drainage density lower runoff is generally exhibited by areas with low drainage density whereas higher runoff is observed in areas with higher drainage density bera et al 2020 drainage density of the study area has been categorised mainly into five classes fig 4d i e very low 0 0 52 km km2 low 0 52 0 83 km km2 moderate 0 83 1 08 km km2 high 1 08 1 34 km km2 and very high 1 34 1 96 km km2 moderate to high drainage density can be observed in major parts of the basin covering around 55 01 of the area while 14 97 of the basin area exhibits very high drainage density areas with high to very high drainage density are deemed appropriate for srwh structures as water from surface runoff can be promptly stored with the assistance of rwh structures the implementation of check dams within these regions has the potential to effectively store a substantial quantity of water but for areas with low to very low drainage density groundwater recharge based rwh structures are suitable a low to very low drainage density can be observed in 30 02 of the area of the basin 3 3 5 soil texture soil with a coarse texture is more permeable while soil having a finer texture shows lower permeability and thus lower infiltration rate leading to its higher capability to hold water on the soil surface for a longer duration cote et al 2003 fine loamy soil which covers 49 27 of the area is the dominant soil group in the study area fig 4e in the middle and southern portions of the basin which comprise banduan ranibandh and certain parts of the binpur ii block a silty clay soil type covering 10 52 of the area can be observed these fine loamy and silty clay soil types are considered appropriate for surface rainwater harvesting rwh since their infiltration rates are low and runoff amounts are higher hashim and sayl 2021 consequently high runoff depths can be observed after rainfall in these areas thus the soil surface is capable of retaining high amount of water and the accumulated water cannot easily leach underground through this fine loamy and silty clay type of soil in the southern and southwestern parts of the basin around 8 59 of the area is covered by loamy skeletal type of soil because of high porosity and permeability this type of soil exhibits higher infiltration rate consequently regions with this type of soil are appropriate for groundwater recharge as water gets easily drained under the soil cover singh et al 2013 in the upper catchment of the basin in few parts of balarampur block and in the northern and north eastern side in manbazar i manbazar ii and puncha block 31 62 of the area is covered by loamy soil this type of soil has medium infiltration rate and water holding capacity 3 3 6 distribution of rainfall rainfall is the primary source of water for srwh and therefore is an important hydroclimatic factor for srwh site selection since the kumari river basin receives the maximum amount of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season thus during the dry seasons because of lack of rain the local people suffer from water scarcity however considering annual mean rainfall the rainfall amount is high and is around 1350 2033 mm fig 4f so if water received during the monsoon season can be stored with the help of the srwh structure then during the dry season water requirement of people for agriculture and various domestic purposes can be fulfilled to some extent the annual rainfall amount of the study area has been divided into 5 different classes low 1350 1595 mm moderately low 1595 1671 mm moderate 1671 1766 mm high 1766 1884 mm and very high 1884 2033 mm a very high amount of rainfall can be observed at the lower catchment of the basin which covers only 8 97 of the basin area high amount of rainfall can be observed in the upper catchment south and southeastern portions of the basin covering 23 49 of the basin area a moderate amount of rainfall can be seen in 30 53 of the basin high and moderate amounts of rainfall are appropriate for surface water harvesting because to store an adequate amount of water in the srwh structures maximum water can be obtained from surface runoff mahmoud and alazba 2015 in the western and middle portions of the basin areas covering 15 05 of the total area are characterized by a low amount of rainfall while 21 96 of the basin area is marked by moderately low rainfall 3 3 7 geology the kumari river basin is mainly located in hard rock terrain the northern part of the basin is made of chotanagpur granite gneiss complex covering 34 87 of the basin area while the southern region is a part of singhbhum craton covering 46 82 of the basin where mica schist and shale can be seen fig 4 g quartzite a non foliated metamorphic rock with low permeability and porosity that inhibits easy water leaching can be observed primarily in certain areas of patamda block and a few small pockets in the southern part of the basin therefore this site is considered suitable for srwh in the upper catchment of the basin near bagmundi upland a very small percentage 0 5 of basalt phylite and mica schist is found epidiorite and hornblende schist make up 9 19 of the basin area the construction of srwh structures in this area is considered moderately suitable in the southern portion of the basin younger granite intrusive rock with a high concentration of alkali feldspar and low permeability is present making it suitable for srwh the rock is rich in alkali feldspar and has a lower permeability allowing it to be suitable for srwh covering 3 31 of the southern portion of the basin the presence of recent alluvium in the northern portion of the basin is indicated which is suitable as a groundwater storage zone however due to its higher porosity and permeability this area is deemed unsuitable for srwh 3 3 8 curvature curvature maps are used to understand the convexity and concavity of the land surface of any area a positive value of curvature indicates a convex surface whereas a negative value signifies a concave surface when the value approaches zero a flat surface is indicated the curvature map of the kumari basin has been divided into three classes convex 0 39 9 10 flat 0 60 to 0 30 and concave 9 to 0 60 fig 4h a concave curvature is observed in 15 98 of the basin and srwh structures can be deemed appropriate for these areas due to the ability of the concave slopes of the landforms to aid in water accumulation and storage convex surfaces are drained of water by runoff and subsequently relocated to other areas rendering these landforms unsuitable for srwh sites the majority of the region at 60 44 has a flat surface curvature making these places suitable for srwh structure development 3 3 9 lineament density lineament is the linear feature of any landscape which indicates the underlying geological structure of any landform such as fault and fracture joints solomon and quiel 2006 generally lineaments remain underlain by weathered materials which increase the secondary porosity and permeability of the media rajaveni et al 2017 the lineament density of kumari river has been categorised into 4 classes very high 0 53 0 72 high 0 35 0 53 moderate 0 17 0 35 and low 0 0 17 fig 4 i in 15 67 of the basin area a high to very high lineament density is observed rendering these zones unsuitable for srwh structures due to the ease with which water is drained through faults and cracks in the presence of lineaments as a consequence surface water does not have enough time to accumulate in these areas hence the construction of srwh structures should be avoided in these sites nevertheless groundwater recharge is suitable in these zones a moderate type of lineament density is observed in approximately 32 07 of the basin area however a low density of lineaments is predominant in the majority 52 26 of the basin these sites can be considered suitable for srwh 3 3 10 geomorphology geomorphic features of any region influence the surface runoff infiltration rate and hydrological control of the region in the kumari river basin mainly 4 types of geomorphic landforms can be observed fig 4 j almost 45 91 area of the basin has shallow buried pediment and 35 84 of the area shows the presence of medium buried pediment generally shallow buried pediments are landforms which are made of weathered materials showing moderate slope and having layers which are up to 0 5 m thick ghosh and jana 2018 these sites are suitable for srwh medium buried pediments show gentle slopes and are composed of moderately weathered complexes they are relatively thicker than shallow buried pediments these sites are moderately suitable for srwh construction valley fill features are observable in 5 92 of the basin area comprised of unconsolidated alluvial deposits along the river valley floor which are conducive to srwh due to their high infiltration rates as a result the potential for groundwater in these areas is also deemed high covering a very small area 1 45 scattered in some pockets in the basin there are low and moderately dissected denudational hills and valleys which have moderate to steep slopes in the uppermost catchment of the basin in the bagmundi hill region and the south east portion in the upper catchment of totko and jamuna rivers 7 91 highly and moderately dissected structural hills can be seen the steep sloped landforms consisting of rocky and skeletal soil are generally unsuitable for srwh besides 2 97 of the basin area is utilised for the construction of dams and reservoirs 3 3 11 topographic wetness index topographic wetness index twi is used for showing the spatial scale effect of hydrological processes of any region at the local level beven and kirkby 1979 with the help of twi water movement on any sloped terrain which is controlled by topography can be understood this also influences runoff generation therefore regions having high twi values also indicate a high amount of surface wetness twi in the kumari river basin has been divided into 5 classes very high 15 77 25 60 high 11 94 15 77 moderate 9 03 11 94 low 6 48 9 03 and very low 2 38 6 48 fig 4 k the major portion 41 97 of the basin shows a very low twi value and these sites are not suitable for srwh these areas have steep to moderately steep slopes and the surface is relatively dry and water gets easily drained towards the area of gentle slopes high to very high twi values are observed in 15 62 of the basin area typically a high twi value is observed along the stream path line these areas show water flow accumulation tendency and as a result availability of water in these areas is high and thus can be considered for srwh construction with a moderate twi value and a moderately gentle slope 16 87 of the basin area is fairly suited for srwh usually structures such as gully plugs and nala bundh are appropriate for these areas 3 3 12 groundwater level as kumari river basin is situated in hard rock terrain groundwater availability everywhere in the basin is not the same in some places depth of groundwater is considerably more so during dry seasons inhabitants of these places suffer from groundwater scarcity and difficulty to meet their domestic and agricultural needs an alternative source of surface water for people of these regions will therefore be beneficial and will help them to carry out their daily chores thus to select a suitable site for srwh construction groundwater depth of that region is an important factor mean annual groundwater depth in the kumari river basin has been categorised into six classes 2 3 mbgl very shallow 3 4 mbgl shallow 4 5 mbgl moderately shallow 5 6 mbgl moderately deep 6 7 mbgl deep and 7 9 mbgl very deep fig 4 l shallow groundwater levels can be observed in the major area 43 61 of the basin a shallow groundwater level can usually be seen in the maximum parts of boram patamda bunduan manbazar i and balarampur blocks deep to very deep groundwater levels are found in 4 15 of the basin area which includes nimdih purulia i and puncha blocks and few patches of the middle portion of the basin these areas are suitable for srwh and will be beneficial for the inhabitants as they will be able to meet a significant share of their needs using surface water instead of groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones with proposed structures the surface rainwater harvesting suitability zones srwhsz map has been classified into 4 different classes highly suitable moderately suitable less suitable and unsuitable fig 5 nearly 20 26 of the basin area is covered by highly suitable zones which include parts of the basin s northern noagarh kuruktopa dorodih northwestern jugidi gitting lahar western bareda moraidih chakulia and southwestern portions these regions are mostly riverine or related river bank areas with low to moderate slope steepness high runoff high drainage density high twi and predominate fine loamy to silty clayed soil texture moderately suitable zone is observed dominantly present in the study area covering 32 74 of the study area in the basin 17 60 of the area covers unsuitable zone and 29 40 of the area covers less suitable zones these regions show moderately steep 15 30 to steep slope 30 also many of this zone is covered with settlement and forest these aforesaid reasons make these regions unsuitable for srwh structure construction the relationship of 12 factors related to the final srwhs map is shown through scatter plots and bar graphs fig 6 the pearson correlation coefficient is examined between the quantitative parameters such as slope surface runoff drainage density rainfall curvature lineament density and twi and their relationship with srwhsz a moderately strong negative correlation r 0 42 between slope and srwhsz is noted sites with a gentle slope s steepness are more suited for srwh structures constructions prior research has mentioned that the slope of a given area plays a significant role in determining suitable sites for the construction of srwh structures mahmoud and tang 2015 balkhair and ur rahman 2021 khan et al 2022 the drainage density and twi exhibit moderately positive correlations with srwhsz with correlation values of 0 37 and 0 34 respectively these results are consistent with the conclusions of prior studies gómez plaza et al 2001 odiji et al 2021 ettazarini 2021 the correlation is relatively weak for rainfall r 0 12 curvature r 0 17 and lineament density r 0 16 the relation between srwhsz and the qualitative parameters is represented using the bar diagram the correlation indicates that srwh structures are better suited for agricultural land and fallow land tariqul islam et al 2017 tiwari et al 2018 additionally the appropriateness of silty clay and fine loamy soil for srwh structures is consistent with the results of prior research kahinda et al 2008 ibrahim et al 2019 granite and quartzite are more feasible for srwh structures based on geology mukherjee 2008 raju 2015 and through geomorphology moderately dissected denudational hills and valleys valley fill medium buried pediment and shallow buried pediment are more suitable for the check dam sites generally 5 15 slope angles are taken into consideration and in 2nd and 3rd order streams these check dam sites are selected padmavathy et al 1993 pandey et al 2011 ettazarini 2021 total of 32 suitable sites are proposed for the construction of the check dams in the basin fig 7 table s2 see supplementary file the sites for earthen dams are chosen based on the selection of 2nd 3rd and 4th order streams hashim and sayl 2021 it is a common water harvesting structure in the kumari basin area the farmers in this region by using locally available materials soil wood boulders constructed the check dam for temporary purposes a total of 17 earthen dam sites have been proposed fig 8 among which 3 each in balarampur and barabazar blocks 2 each in boram bandwan manbazar i and purulia i blocks whereas 1 each site has been proposed in binpur ii puncha manbazar ii blocks table s3 see supplementary file percolation tank sites are selected in the 1st and 2nd order stream jha et al 2014 rais and javed 2014 mainly in the agricultural land fallow land where moderately steep slopes are selected as the proposed sites a total of 35 sites have been proposed for percolation tanks table s4 see supplementary file a farm pond is an important sustainable structure for rainwater harvesting for the site selection of farm pond 1st order stream and its surrounding regions are selected kadam et al 2012 singh et al 2017 locations with 1 2 feeder channel have been considered for the farm pond sites so that surface runoff water can easily accumulate in it during monsoon a total of 24 locations have been proposed for the construction of farm ponds six of these proposed sites are located in the barabazar block while four sites each have been proposed in the balarampur patamda and manbazar ii blocks the remaining blocks have one or two proposed sites each table s5 see supplementary file for gulley plug structures steep to moderately steep slope areas mainly forest land shrub land and fallow land areas are considered the reel and gully regions before the 1st order stream are suitable for the construction of gulley plug structures varade et al 2013 kumar and jhariya 2017 a total of 19 sites are proposed for gulley plug structures among which 4 lies in balarampur block 3 in bandwan bock and 1 2 each for other blocks table s6 see supplementary file focusing on the problems of water shortage the cultivation of selective less water demanding crops can be practised in water scarce agricultural regions water saving irrigation systems such as overhead sprinklers and drip irrigation can be used which require less water for irrigation and production of higher yields of crops the usage of less amount of water for irrigation will help to accommodate the usual requirement of water for domestic purposes and less economic downfall during the summer season 4 2 validation the receiver operator characteristic roc curve analysis has been employed to validate the predictive accuracy of the model utilizing 52 pre existing check dam sites which were identified through field surveys a comparison was made between the existing check dam sites and the final srwhsz map in the high to moderately suitable zones the existing check dams are denoted as 1 whereas the less suitable and unsuitable zones are denoted as 0 if the value is 1 then the condition has been accepted whereas if the value is 0 then the conditions are refused roc curve is a very popular and acceptable scientific method using which many researchers have validated the mcda model mogaji et al 2016 rahmati et al 2019 ettazarini 2021 manaouch et al 2021 this is known as deterministic and probabilistic forecasting system the auc area under the curve ranges from 0 5 to 1 with a value close to 1 indicating a higher level of prediction accuracy the prediction accuracy rate of the accuracy value is divided into 5 range zones which are 0 5 0 6 low to poor 0 6 0 7 moderate average 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 very good 0 9 1 excellent generally auc indicates the percentage of prediction value the roc auc result for this study is 87 4 0 874 and its standard error value is 0 050 with an asymptotic significance value of 0 00 for this model fig 9 the roc auc value for this model indicates an excellent predictive accuracy rate the feasibility of the predicted rainwater harvesting sites has been confirmed through field investigations at the sites providing additional support for the validity of the model 5 conclusion kumari river basin is agriculture based hard rock dominated semi arid region where severe water crisis occurs during summer regional disparity in availability of water limited number of water reservoirs and acute depletion of water level are the big challenges for water resource management in this region the long term management of water resources is crucial because water security has become a primary challenge in regional economic and social development the surface rainwater harvesting suitability for the region has been described in terms of four different zones using the gis based mcda model in this study a total of 20 26 of the basin area are under high suitability zone where high surface runoff low to moderate slope fine loamy soil texture and high drainage density are observed whereas 17 60 area shows unsuitable zone with steep slopes forest cover and settlement areas the validation has been done by roc auc curve whose predictive accuracy value is 87 4 which indicates an excellent accuracy rate for the model through this study 32 suitable check dam sites 17 earthen dam sites 35 percolation tank sites 24 farm ponds and 19 gulley plug sites are been proposed for surface rainwater harvesting structures constructions in kumari river basin these proposed sites may be used for construction of the said types of structures which would play a vital role in water management and regional water resource development of the area similar types of study

effective reservoirs are significant parameters for reserve evaluation and exploitation scheme formulation of hydrocarbon reservoirs however the existing llpp determination method is not applicable to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs with diverse reservoir space and strong heterogeneity therefore a systematic method for determining the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs was developed in this study first the geological setting and reservoir characteristics were briefly introduced and numerous cores were classified according to whether cavities and fractures were developed subsequently the test data of petrophysical property nmr high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi and fluid physical property were collected and a series of llpp values were obtained through static methods of cumulative frequency statistics porosity permeability relationship irreducible water saturation and minimum flowable pore throat radius rmin the llpp determined by static methods were then verified by dynamic methods of gas well testing productivity model prediction and productivity simulation experiment and the llpp of reservoirs that can form industrial gas flow were determined finally the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp was revealed the applicability of various llpp determination methods were summarized and the accuracy of the obtained llpp was confirmed by well testing interpretations the research results show that the reasonable classification of reservoir types is the prerequisite to accurately determine the llpp of carbonate reservoirs the lower limit of porosity is little affected by cavities while the lower limit of permeability is greatly affected by fractures rmin of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs obtained by hpmi test and water film thickness calculation is approximately 60 nm the significant heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs requires that effective reservoirs should reach the lower limit of porosity and permeability simultaneously llpp determined through static methods and dynamic methods can be applied to evaluate geological and dynamic reserves respectively the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas to accumulate migrate and form industrial gas production are 2 68 and 0 042 md keywords lower limits of petrophysical parameters ultradeep carbonate reservoir effective reservoir improved static and dynamic methods gas accumulation and migration industrial gas flow data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction lower limits of petrophysical parameters llpp of hydrocarbon reservoirs refer to the minimum porosity and minimum permeability that can make oil or natural gas accumulate and migrate under conventional formation conditions qi 1989 hydrocarbon reservoirs with porosity and permeability values higher than the llpp are usually classified as effective reservoirs the llpp of effective reservoirs are indispensable parameters for evaluating hydrocarbon resources reserve and their accuracy directly affects the formulation and adjustment of the reservoir development scheme the llpp are generally determined by combining various technical methods because these are affected by various aspects including reservoir characteristics fluid properties and exploitation strategies using a single method will inevitably bring some errors when determining the llpp of an effective reservoir llpp determination methods can be divided into static and dynamic methods guo 2004 lu et al 2016 static methods analyze the relationship between porosity permeability and other parameters through core test data and statistical principles to obtain multiple thresholds as llpp the results obtained by static methods are subjective because their accuracy is affected by the number characteristics and representativeness of the selected core samples therefore this type of method is often used in the exploration and initial exploitation stages when there are few dynamic testing and production data dynamic methods determine the gas production capacity of reservoirs with different petrophysical parameters through productivity prediction model productivity simulation experiment or gas well testing data and then calculate the llpp according to the relationship between gas production capacity and porosity permeability or other parameters lu et al 2017 the results obtained by dynamic methods are more objective but usually higher than the actual llpp of effective reservoirs liu et al 2012 dynamic methods are usually used in combination with static methods in the exploitation stage to improve the accuracy of the llpp previously determined gong et al 2015 currently the studies related to llpp determination methods are mostly focused on clastic rock reservoirs tang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 bai et al 2021 the pore throat structure of clastic rock reservoir is simple and mainly composed of pore throats of different sizes porosity and permeability are highly correlated because reservoir heterogeneity is weak cao et al 2013 therefore the lower limit of porosity llpo could be determined first and then the lower limit of permeability llpe could be calculated by referring to the correlation between porosity and permeability zhou et al 2019 ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs contribute significantly to global hydrocarbon resources garing et al 2014 and their huge exploration and development potential has attracted considerable attention from geologists and petroleum engineers zhang et al 2018 the accurate evaluation of llpp for ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs is helpful to accurately calculate the natural gas reserves which provides a theoretical foundation for the formulation of a rational exploitation scheme wang et al 2017a however ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs have gone through multiple periods of tectonic movement and diagenesis compared with hydrocarbon reservoirs of medium and shallow depth thus forming a co existence model of various types of reservoir spaces gao and li 2016 wang et al 2018b as a result ultradeep carbonate reservoirs are characterized by a complex pore structure diverse reservoir types obvious regional petrophysical property differences high difficulty in reserve evaluation and large differences in gas well productivity ronchi and cruciani 2015 matonti et al 2015 gundogar et al 2016 corbett et al 2017 these typical characteristics hinder the full application of conventional llpp determination methods to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs zheng et al 2020 the fundamental reason behind the formation of these typical characteristics is the strong heterogeneity of the reservoir at both macro and micro levels the heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs is the result of various sedimentary environments and the evolution of basins over time tavakoli 2019 clarifying the heterogeneity characteristics is an important prerequisite for obtaining accurate llpp as it has a significant impact on the reservoir storage and percolation capacities mohsin et al 2023 however previous studies have shown that the heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs is influenced by multiple factors which increase the difficulty of reservoir property evaluation and in situ hydrocarbon calculation zhang et al 2023 it is crucial to classify the carbonate reservoir type or pore type and conduct separate studies to reveal the heterogeneity characteristics of reservoirs jamalian and tavakoli 2022 therefore reservoir heterogeneity should be considered first when determining the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs as this is the dominant reason conventional llpp determination methods are not applicable at present there is no specialized research on the llpp determination method for this type of reservoir deng iv member reservoir of the sinian system in sichuan basin is widely accepted as an ultradeep carbonate gas reservoir with enormous reserves and production potential wang et al 2020 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 therefore the deng iv member was taken as the target reservoir for studying the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs the purpose of this study is to improve conventional llpp determination methods based on the typical characteristics of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs as well as summarize and analyze the applicability and application process of different methods in addition the impact of cavities and fractures developed in ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs on the llpo and llpe was revealed by analyzing the statistical and testing results of different types of cores or reservoirs pore type fracture type cavity type and fracture cavity type finally the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas accumulation and migration and can form industrial gas flow were determined providing a theoretical foundation for the accurate reserve evaluation and reasonable exploitation scheme formulation of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs 2 geological setting deng iv member gas reservoir of the sinian system in sichuan basin is located in suining city sichuan province and tongnan county chongqing city fig 1 the gaoshiti moxi area is located in the central part of the flat gentle paleouplift mesozoic slope belt in the central sichuan basin covering an area of 5 288 square kilometers with a total closure of 429 m the regional structure zone is situated in the weiyuan longnvsi structural group in the gentle structure area of the central sichuan paleouplift with a reservoir depth of 4500 5500 m yang et al 2016 horizontally the sedimentary microfacies of the lateral upper platform margin belt of the deng iv member are mainly algal ash silt mounds but some reservoirs are developed in the sandy beach and dolomite flat microfacies reservoir sedimentary microfacies in the intra platform zone are relatively complex mainly composed of sandy beaches followed by algal ash silt mounds dolomite flat and algal dolomite flat vertically the deng iv upper sub member mainly develops algal ash silt mounds and the deng iv lower sub member mainly develops sandy beaches du et al 2014 deng iv member mainly develops two types of fracture cavity type dolomite reservoirs namely the upper and lower sub members the reservoir is thick vertically and the layers are superimposed and connected in the horizontal direction with a wide and stable distribution this reservoir distribution pattern has established excellent storage conditions for the formation of large scale natural gas reservoirs li et al 2013 the exploration results show that deng iv member in this area contains a large gas bearing area as the strata in the west are denuded and pinched out to form a stratum barrier the gas bearing area exceeds the trap range of the gaoshiti buried and moxi buried structures and is not controlled by local structures the periphery of deng iv member has not been confirmed to have uniform edge water and bottom water and is controlled by lithological traps therefore deng iv member is a lithologic stratigraphic structural composite trap gas reservoir under a tectonic setting jin et al 2017 the detailed introduction to the tectonic and sedimentary settings of the deng iv member reservoir can be found in the first chapter of our monograph wang 2023 3 reservoir characteristics 3 1 reservoir lithology deng iv member reservoir is mainly composed of algal clotted dolomite algal stromatolite dolomite and doloarenite of the mound beach complex algal clotted dolomite is the most important reservoir rock type with an areal porosity of 3 6 the dominant reservoir space is the residual dissolution pores between clots and dissolution pores formed in the later stage the distribution frequency of algal stromatolite dolomite is only second to that of algal clotted dolomite the karst reformation is strong and the dissolution cavities are developed the area porosity is mainly 4 8 and some can reach more than 10 the dominant reservoir space is the bird s eye pores and cavities or the fenestriform pores and cavities formed by the decay of algal filaments and the bedding karstification is significant when the sedimentary interface is in the high energy zone above the wave base the early micrite or algal dolomite is broken to form doloarenite and the intergranular pores and intergranular dissolved pores form the dominant reservoir space 3 2 reservoir space deng iv member has experienced various diagenesis types of compaction cementation filling dissolution dolomitization and metasomatism in different stages and these diageneses have different impacts and contributions on reservoir space compaction cementation and filling are the diagenesis types that reduce sediment volume and worsen reservoir petrophysical properties by contrast multiple stages of karstification have formed a large number of dissolution pores and cavities with storage potential moreover dolomitization increased intergranular and intercrystalline pores and formed microscopic fractures a situation similar to the porosity evolution process of carbonate gas reservoirs in the permian triassic strata of the persian gulf tavakoli and jamalian 2019 however different types of pores cavities and fractures may be partially filled with dolomite under the action of overdolomitization thereby reducing reservoir space therefore the reservoir spaces of deng iv member not only includes intergranular dissolved pores intragranular dissolved pores lattice pores and intercrystalline dissolved pores controlled by fabric but also dissolved cavities and dissolved and structural fractures not affected by fabric among these spaces secondary pores mainly composed of intergranular and intercrystalline dissolved pores are the dominant reservoir space and multiple types of small and moderate sized dissolved cavities constitute another reservoir space type of carbonate rocks cavity density in the deng iv member is in the range of 11 37 per meter with an average of 25 per meter the extensively developed fractures have little contribution to reservoir spaces but effectively connect each reservoir space thus greatly enhancing the fluid percolation capacity fracture density in the deng iv member is in the range of 1 5 7 5 per meter with an average of 3 1 per meter which is similar to the south pars field in the persian gulf rafiei et al 2016 note that the interlaced network of microfractures not only increases permeability but also connects a large range of reservoir spaces and the bedding cavities provide dominant percolation channels while increasing reservoir space therefore these planar structures developed in carbonate rocks directly affect reservoir quality kaveh ahangar et al 2023 results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the target reservoir is dominated by necking throats and lamellar throats with tubular throats developed locally wang et al 2020 3 3 reservoir petrophysical property deng iv member is generally composed of low petrophysical property reservoirs but in locally developed high petrophysical property areas the permeability and porosity data of 318 cores from the target reservoir indicates that the porosity range is generally 1 10 concentrated in 1 6 with an average of 3 83 fig 2 the permeability range is 0 0001 10000 md concentrated in 0 01 1 00 md with an average of 1 02 md compared with the petrophysical property of the barremian aptian carbonate oil reservoirs in central persian gulf tavakoli et al 2022 the relationship between porosity and permeability of the deng iv member carbonate gas reservoir is more difficult to characterize and the distribution range of permeability is larger under the same porosity classifying reservoir data based on the petrophysical property ranges or pore structure characteristics is an important method for studying the related properties of strongly heterogeneous reservoirs therefore the relationship between porosity and permeability was classified based on the development of fractures the porosity permeability correlation of cores with fractures is extremely poor and they generally have high permeability at low porosity by contrast the porosity permeability correlation of cores without fractures is relatively strong the two parameters are still relevant when the porosity is high therefore the extensive developed fractures reduce the correlation between permeability and porosity whereas cavities increase permeability and porosity simultaneously which has little impact on the correlation between them this conclusion was also confirmed in our subsequent studies according to the core classification standard and petrophysical property distribution these cores can be bdivided into pore type cavity type fracture type and fracture cavity type the approximate distribution areas of the four types of reservoirs in the porosity permeability scatter diagram are marked in fig 2 some llpp determination methods require selecting cores from different types of reservoirs for testing and analysis the classification standard pore structure characteristics and petrophysical parameters of each type of reservoir can be found in our previous studies wang et al 2017b wang et al 2020 therefore the specific characteristics of various reservoirs were no longer introduced in this study 3 4 reservoir heterogeneity the heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs was formed by the combined effects of sedimentation diagenesis and tectonism tavakoli 2019 sedimentation not only controls the carbonate sedimentary body thickness and their internal rock combinations but also the distribution of favorable reservoir facies and petrophysical properties shang et al 2021 the differences in sedimentary structure sediment particle size sorting and mineral composition within different sedimentary facies zones in the same sedimentary system further lead to different heterogeneity characteristics sedimentation also affects the rock mechanics attributes of different formations by controlling the thickness lithology petrophysical properties and other related attributes of carbonate reservoirs resulting in the heterogeneity of natural fracture development in the subsequent structural evolution process from the quasi contemporaneous stage to the burial stage the compaction pressure dissolution cementation filling karst dolomitization and other diagenesis in carbonate rocks are superimposed on the sedimentary framework of heterogeneous reservoirs resulting in further uneven evolution in the reservoir and increasing the complexity of reservoir heterogeneity diagenesis can also affect the mechanical properties of carbonate reservoirs by changing rock composition particle size and particle arrangement thereby affecting the development of tectonic fracturing the subsequent filling action can seal the structural cracks which reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of fractures tectonic movements can further transform existing reservoirs causing deformation dislocation and fracture thereby exacerbating reservoir heterogeneity macroscopically faults and large scale fractures can alter reservoir connectivity microscopically fracture networks can greatly improve the percolation and storage capacity of local reservoirs mohsin et al 2023 furthermore the burial period of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is extremely long and the influence of abnormal high temperatures and pressures and hydrothermal fluids further increases the complexity of reservoir heterogeneity therefore the heterogeneity of this type of reservoir is significantly stronger than other types of reservoirs which greatly increases the difficulty of studying reservoir properties such as llpp 3 5 reservoir pressure and temperature pressure data from the tests of seven wells in the target reservoir were analyzed the reservoir pressure range is 56 50 57 09 mpa and the reservoir pressure difference is only 0 01 0 59 mpa with an average of 56 83 mpa fig 3 a these numbers indicate that the reservoir pressure of each layer is very close and could be considered to be in the same pressure system there is good connectivity between the upper and lower sub members as well therefore all layers could be considered as a whole to study the llpp of effective reservoirs temperature data from the tests of seven wells in the target reservoir were analyzed the average reservoir temperature converted to the elevation in the middle of the reservoir is 155 7 the reservoir temperature range is 149 5 164 2 c and the reservoir temperature difference is only 2 3 14 7 fig 3b these measurements also indicate that the difference of reservoir temperature in each layer is small the detailed reservoir characteristics of the deng iv member including lithologic characteristics mineral composition petrophysical properties pore throat structure fluid properties reservoir thickness distribution temperature and pressure conditions could be referred to the first chapter of our monograph wang 2023 4 materials and methods 4 1 empirical method empirical method refers to the approximate calculation of average reservoir permeability according to a great number of core analysis results obtained from the study area this average value is then multiplied by 5 as the llpe of the effective reservoir in the target reservoir this method was first proposed by the core lab of america and has been extensively applied in hydrocarbon fields around the world although the error of the obtained llpp cannot be ignored the empirical method as a simple and easy method can guide the subsequent exploration and development work in the absence of test data guo 2004 4 2 cumulative frequency statistics method the cumulative frequency method refers to the statistical method of determining llpp according to the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity and production capacity by collecting the petrophysical parameters of cores the premise of applying this method is to use the petrophysical property data of cores from all cored wells to make the frequency distribution histogram of porosity and permeability as well as establish the cumulative frequency curve cumulative storage capacity curve and cumulative production capacity curve cui et al 2017 the calculation formulas of gas storage capacity related to porosity and gas production capacity related to permeability are shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q φ i φ i h i i 1 n φ i h i 2 q ki k i h i i 1 n k i h i where q φ i is the gas storage capacity related to porosity q ki is the gas production capacity related to permeability φ i is the porosity of core with serial number i k i is the permeability of core with serial number i md and h i is the length of core with serial number i cm previous investigations on the pore structure of the target reservoir show that the effect of widely developed microfractures on reservoir porosity is insignificant and small sized cavities have little effect on reservoir permeability in pursuit of revealing the effect of cavities on the llpo and the effect of fractures on the llpe the llpo of all cores and cores without cavities pore type and fracture type cores as well as the llpe of all cores and cores without fractures pore type and cavity type cores were compared and analyzed in previous studies the llpp of clastic rock reservoirs usually refer to porosity and permeability when cumulative loss percentage of storage capacity and production capacity reaches 5 li et al 2012 considering that the petrophysical parameters of the ultradeep hydrocarbon reservoir is generally low the cumulative loss percentage standard of storage capacity and production capacity should be increased to 10 wang et al 2010 4 3 porosity permeability relationship method the porosity permeability relationship method refers to the creation of a porosity permeability relationship diagram according to the petrophysical property test results of cores in the study area and then determining the llpp of effective reservoirs by analyzing the porosity permeability relationship fitting curve jiang et al 2016 the widespread fractures in deng iv member lead to multiple permeability values of different orders of magnitude under the same porosity which is also the main reason for the weak correlation between permeability and porosity if this method is directly used to determine the llpp of all cores it will not only be difficult to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the fitting curve but also lead to a higher llpe therefore the porosity permeability scatter diagram should be made with the petrophysical property data of core samples without fractures 4 4 irreducible water saturation method when the porous medium in the reservoir is filled with irreducible water the effective storage space is zero and hydrocarbon cannot migrate to the reservoir and accumulate to form hydrocarbon reservoirs therefore the values of porosity and permeability corresponding to the irreducible water saturation swi of 100 are commonly used as the theoretical lower limit of gas migration and accumulation and can also be used as the prerequisite for determining reservoir effectiveness pang et al 2019 in other words if the swi of the reservoir is less than 100 then it can be considered as an effective reservoir however the llpp determined by this method are optimistic low this is because the swi of some reservoirs does not reach 100 but an excessively high irreducible water condition will lead to extremely low gas content and high gas flow resistance which is incapable of satisfying the needs of effective reservoirs for gas storage and percolation capacities therefore reservoirs with water saturation greater than 70 are considered as invalid layers water layers or gas bearing water layers according to the identification conclusion of gas layer and water layer from well logging data in addition the experimental results of gas percolation indicate that it is impossible to establish an effective gas phase percolation system within a certain pressure gradient range for cores with swi greater than 70 wang 2023 all these indicate that the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 centrifugation combined with nmr testing is usually used to determine the saturations of movable fluid and irreducible water in the core sample centrifuge experiments were conducted on cores at different rotating speeds and then the transverse relaxation time t2 spectrum after each centrifuge experiment was measured next the t2 spectra of cores completely saturated with water were used as reference standards for comparison when the rotating speed of the centrifuge was increased to 6000 8000 rpm the t2 spectrum basically remained unchanged which indicated that the irreducible water condition had been formed in the core swi is the proportion of the cumulative frequency of t2 spectrum in the irreducible water condition to that in the completely saturated water condition then the relationship between petrophysical property and swi could be established based on the nmr test results of multiple core samples the porosity and permeability corresponding to a irreducible water saturation of 70 could be regarded as llpp 4 5 minimum flowable pore throat radius method the formation of effective reservoirs requires hydrocarbon to enter the storage space and accumulate into reservoirs as well as the smooth migration of hydrocarbon between the reservoir spaces accordingly the reservoir should have certain capacities of storage and percolation simultaneously the pore structure and size directly affect the storage capacity of the hydrocarbon reservoir and the throat radius is the key parameter for whether hydrocarbon can migrate in the reservoir under a certain pressure differential therefore the minimum flowable pore throat radius rmin is the minimum channel radius that can not only store gas but also allow gas migration yang et al 2022 the rmin of the reservoir could be obtained by the water film thickness wft calculation xiao et al 2021 or high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi test data li et al 2014 dai and lin 2021 and then the llpp of effective reservoirs could be determined based on the relationship between petrophysical parameters and r 4 5 1 permeability contribution method the process of injected mercury displacing the wetting phase in the core during hpmi testing can reflect the process of hydrocarbon displacing water in the formation therefore the capillary pressure data could be applied to analyze the microscopic pore structure of the core and calculate the rmin of the reservoir hpmi test data can also be used to establish the relationship curve between average r and petrophysical parameters given that the sample used in the hpmi test is a 25 mm 25 mm square core each capillary pressure curve can only reflect the characteristics of a certain position in the reservoir not the entire reservoir consequently the j function method proposed by leverette was used to integrate and average the capillary pressure curve of the entire reservoir tao and mohan 2007 calculation formulas are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 j s wn p c p ref p c σ k φ 4 s wn s w s wi 1 s wc where j represents the dimensionless function p c represents the capillary pressure mpa p ref represents the reference capillary pressure mpa s wn and s wi represent the standardized and irreducible water saturations respectively σ represents the interfacial tension mn m k is the core permeability md and φ is the core porosity after the j function was calculated the average porosity and average permeability can be substituted into eq 5 to establish the capillary pressure curve representing the reservoir 5 p c j σ φ k subsequently the rmin of the reservoir could be calculated by the wall method gao et al 2011 the wall method calculates the contribution ratio of different r to permeability according to the relationship between mercury intrusion pressure and intrusion amount when the cumulative contribution ratio of permeability increases to 99 with the r from large to small the corresponding radius could be regarded as rmin calculation formulas are shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 i 1 n δ k i δ k 1 δ k 2 δ k n 7 δ k i 2 i 1 r i 2 i 1 n 2 i 1 r i 2 where i 1 n δ k i is the cumulative contribution ratio of permeability δ k i is the permeability contribution of pore throats in different radius ranges and r i is the pore throat radius μm 4 5 2 water film thickness method wft is the thickness when the water in the reservoir is evenly spread on the rock surface when the wft is greater than the r the storage space and percolation channel controlled by the pore throat are completely saturated with water resulting in the inability of hydrocarbon accumulation and migration to occur fig 4 the r corresponding to the wft is the rmin of the hydrocarbon reservoir therefore the critical wft on the rock surface under different geological conditions namely rmin can be determined next the llpp corresponding to the rmin can be determined according to the relationship curves between r and petrophysical properties the water film adsorbed on the medium surface is formed by solid liquid interaction yang et al 2022 water molecules are tightly adsorbed on the solid surface when polar molecules are close to one another their inherent dipoles repel one another in the same polarity attract one another in the different polarity and align directionally when the water film on the rock surface becomes thinner under the external force the top and bottom interfaces of the water film are close to each other and generate repulsive force which is called separation pressure p d the water film is also subjected to the formation pressure p i perpendicular to the rock wall and the capillary pressure p c in the opposite direction of the formation pressure the force analysis of water film in porous media that ignores gravity is shown in fig 5 when the water film is stable there is an equilibrium relationship between formation pressure separation pressure and capillary pressure as shown in eq 8 8 p i p d p c the separation pressure theoretically consists of electrostatic attraction intermolecular force and structural components the structural components include matrix suction and osmotic suction gee et al 1990 measured the wft of hydrophilic rock surface under multiple separation pressures using the elliptical polarization technique of light the relationship between separation pressure and wft obtained from measuring points is shown in eq 9 9 p d 2200 h 3 150 h 2 12 h where h is the wft μm the pressure difference between the gas phase and the water phase on both sides of the water film is the capillary pressure whose value is closely related to gas water interfacial tension capillary radius and medium wettability as shown in eq 10 10 p c 2 σ cos θ r where r represents the capillary radius μm θ represents the wetting angle of formation water on the carbonate rock surface and σ represents the gas water interfacial tension n m eq 11 can be obtained by combining eqs 8 10 it can be seen from eq 11 that the relationship between wft and r under formation pressure can be established as along as the interfacial tension and wetting angle are given 11 p i 2200 h 3 150 h 2 12 h 2 σ cos θ r 4 6 gas well testing method the gas well testing method refers to the statistical analysis of the average porosity and permeability and the gas productivity test results of tested layers it then makes the porosity permeability scatter diagram of the gas layer water layer and dry layer layer without fluid according to the test interpretation results jiang et al 2016 porosity and permeability corresponding to the boundary between gas layer and dry layer could be regarded as the llpp of effective reservoirs when the gas well testing data are complete and accurate the efficiently and intuitively llpp can be determined by this method 4 7 productivity prediction model method the premise of applying this method is to develop a productivity prediction model applicable to the target reservoir and determine the relationship between permeability and gas productivity under the condition that other parameters are constant the minimum productivity required for gas well production is determined based on the industrial hydrocarbon flow standard and the llpe to meet the productivity is finally calculated the trinomial productivity prediction model applicable to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs was presented in detail in our academic monograph wang 2023 as shown in eqs 12 16 this model comprehensively considers the multiple media stress sensitivity non darcy flow threshold pressure and well type of gas reservoirs and predicts and verifies the gas well production of different regions and types of reservoirs although the specific physical assumptions derivation process and parameter selection of the model are not introduced in this paper it is worth noting that appropriate models and parameters should be selected for gas productivity prediction and llpp determination 12 m e m w c a q sc b q sc 2 13 m p i p 2 p μ z σ s p σ s p i α d p 14 a p sc t π k i h z sc t sc ln r e r we 15 b β γ g p sc t ρ sc 2 π 2 h 2 t sc μ z

with different petrophysical properties under the simulated reservoir conditions is the basis of the productivity simulation experiment method during the experiment different displacement pressure differentials were set in the horizontal direction of the core to obtain the gas flowrates under unidirectional flow conditions which were then converted into daily gas productions of gas wells under radial flow conditions liu 2005 subsequently the relationship between petrophysical properties and gas well productivity can be established based on a series of productivity simulation experimental results the petrophysical properties corresponding to the lower limit of industrial gas flow lligf are the llpp of effective reservoirs the formula for converting experimental flowrate to gas well productivity is shown in eq 17 17 q 69 12 q r r w h d 2 where q represents the gas well productivity 104 m3 d q r represents the gas flowrate measured under laboratory conditions m3 s r w represents the wellbore radius m and d represents the core diameter m eq 17 is based on the equivalence between the gas flowrate in the core under experimental conditions and the gas flowrate in the well under field conditions thereby realizing the similarity conversion of production under different scales the traditional method approximately sets the production pressure differential of a single well as the experimental pressure differential of productivity simulation when determining the llpp however the size of the core is obviously different from that of the single well control area in scale resulting in a large difference between the fluid flowrate at the core outlet and the wellbore under the same pressure differential therefore the pressure differential setting of the traditional method makes the production prediction result on the high side wang et al 2017c the traditional productivity simulation experiment method needs to be improved in the setting of experimental pressure differential similarity conversion of pressure differential should be conducted before similarity conversion of gas productivity then the experimental pressure differential is set based on the converted pressure differential to ensure that the gas flowrates at the outlet of the two scales is equal the pressure differential conversion formula is derived as follows 18 ν sg k μ g d p d x k p e1 2 p w1 2 2 μ g l p 19 ν rg k μ g d p d x k p e2 2 p w2 2 2 μ g r p ln r e r w where ν sg represents the gas flowrate at the core outlet m s ν rg represents the gas flowrate at the wellbore of the gas well m s p e1 represents the pressure at the core inlet mpa p w1 represents the pressure at the core outlet mpa p e2 represents the supply pressure at the boundary of gas reservoir mpa p w2 represents the bottom hole pressure at the wellbore mpa l represents the core length m p represents the pressure at a certain location in the reservoir mpa and r represents the distance between a certain location in a reservoir and a well m to ensure that the gas flowrate at the core outlet is equal to that at the wellbore of the gas well ν sg ν rg setting p p w1 in eq 18 p p w2 and r r w in eq 19 besides the core inlet pressure should be equal to the supply pressure at the reservoir boundary p e1 p e2 and then the pressure differential conversion formulas are obtained as shown in eqs 20 and 21 20 p w1 1 2 p e 2 p w 2 l p w r w ln r e r w p e 2 p w 2 l p w r w ln r e r w 2 4 p e 2 21 δ p p e p w1 as long as the bottom hole pressure is determined the core outlet pressure required for productivity simulation experiments can be obtained according to eq 20 the difference between core length and well control radius determines the conversion relationship between experimental pressure differential and field production pressure differential single plunger core could be selected for productivity simulation experiment of homogeneous reservoir however the productivity simulation experiment should be conducted on the long core composed of multiple types of plunger cores to avoid the limitation that a single core cannot represent a strongly heterogeneous reservoir the conversion coefficient from production pressure differential to experimental pressure differential could be obtained from the long core length and the gas well control radius the device diagram of productivity simulation experiment is illustrated in fig 6 and the detailed experimental method and process could refer to our previous studies wang 2023 the temperature and pressure set in the experiment completely refer to the formation conditions fig 7 shows the similarity conversion results of pressure differential and gas productivity when the long core length and well control radius are 0 4 m and 500 m respectively according to the production pressure differential of 6 0 mpa commonly used in the target reservoir the pressure differential of the productivity simulation experiment should be set to 4 5 mpa by referring to the binomial relationship in fig 7a the gas well productivity is obtained by converting the gas flow rate measured in the productivity simulation experiment with reference to the linear relationship in fig 7b 5 results 5 1 empirical method the petrophysical property data of 319 core samples from the deng iv member reservoir were used for the empirical method the average permeability of these samples is 1 02 md and so the llpe determined by the empirical method is 0 051 md 5 2 cumulative frequency statistics method statistical results of porosity distribution and gas storage capacity indicate that the invalid sample proportion and the llpo are 20 and 2 4 respectively when all core samples are taken as statistical objects and the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity reaches 10 fig 8 a statistical results of permeability distribution and gas production capacity indicate that the invalid sample proportion and the llpe are 85 and 2 0 md respectively when all core samples are taken as statistical objects and the cumulative loss percentage of gas production capacity reaches 10 fig 9 a if 2 0 md is taken as the llpe the proportion of invalid samples is too high which will lead to a large number of target layers being misjudged as invalid reservoirs although some studies have forced the proportion of invalid samples to be limited to less than 20 to ensure that most reservoirs can be effectively exploitation the high proportion of invalid samples is a direct reflection of the strong heterogeneity of the study area artificially limiting the proportion of invalid samples will reduce the values of llpp which cannot reflect the actual reservoir situation therefore the conventional cumulative frequency statistics method is not suitable for ultradeep carbonate reservoirs and must be improved when core samples without cavities are taken as statistical objects the invalid sample proportion and llpo are 20 and 2 42 respectively when the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity reaches 10 fig 8b when core samples without fractures are taken as statistical objects the invalid sample proportion and llpe are 50 and 0 038 md respectively as the cumulative loss percentage of gas production capacity reaches 10 fig 9b note that the proportion of invalid samples to all samples is only 26 when 0 038 md is taken as the llpe of all core samples consequently it is appropriate to take 2 42 and 0 038 md as the llpp of the target reservoir and the proportion of invalid samples under this llpp is reasonable 5 3 porosity permeability relationship method the determination coefficient of the porosity permeability fitting curve reaches 0 84 indicating a strong correlation between the porosity and permeability of these core samples without fractures fig 10 in addition the relationship between porosity and permeability could be divided into three stages based on the characteristics of the fitting curve when the porosity is lower than 2 6 the permeability improves slightly as the porosity increases indicating that invalid pores are dominant in these samples when the porosity is higher than 2 6 the permeability improves obviously as the porosity increases indicating that these core samples are dominated by effective pores and have a certain percolation capacity when the porosity is greater than 3 5 the permeability improves sharply as the porosity increases and the production capacity of reservoirs in this range is strong and has reached a relatively stable state consequently 2 6 was taken as the llpo to judge the effectiveness of the reservoir and then the llpe 0 036 md was calculated based on the fitted porosity permeability relationship curve the permeability of cores with fractures is significantly greater than that of cores without fractures under the same porosity fig 2 therefore as long as the porosity of the reservoir with fractures reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures it could be determined as an effective reservoir without considering the llpe 5 4 irreducible water saturation method the nmr t2 spectra of four types of cores are illustrated in fig 11 as shown in the t2 spectrum of 100 saturated water the pore throat radius r distribution of the pore type core has a double peak structure of low right peak and high left peak the dividing points are distributed from 1 ms to 10 ms representing the distribution areas of micro and macro pores respectively the r distribution of fracture type core has a three peak structure with high left peak low middle peak and low right peak the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 and 10 50 ms respectively representing the distribution areas of micro pores macro pores and fractures respectively the r distribution of cavity type core has a double peak structure with little difference in the amplitude of the two peaks the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 ms but the maximum t2 values can reach 500 1000 ms representing the distribution areas of pores and cavities respectively the r distribution of the fracture cavity type core has a four peak structure the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 10 50 and 50 100 ms and the maximum t2 values are more than 1000 ms representing the distribution areas of small pores large pores fractures and cavities respectively the t2 spectra of irreducible water state show that the swi of fracture type and fracture cavity type cores are low and mainly occur in small pores by contrast the swi of the two other types of cores is high and distributed in pores and cavities with different sizes to evaluate the relationship between swi and petrophysical parameters 20 core samples were selected to conduct centrifuge and nmr tests the test results indicate that the correlation between porosity and swi is relatively poor with cases of high porosity but high swi and low porosity but low swi fig 12 a by contrast permeability is strongly correlated with swi the value of swi decreases logarithmically as the reservoir permeability increases fig 12b this indicates that the swi of the carbonate reservoir depends on reservoir permeability fractures can effectively connect various storage spaces and greatly reduce the residual water content by contrast the swi is less affected by the cavity when the cavity is controlled by small pore throats a large amount of water will be trapped in the cavity thereby increasing the residual water content for details about the formation process and occurrence characteristics of residual water in cavities and fractures please refer to our previous visualization investigations wang et al 2018a the llpe of effective reservoirs is 0 044 md by substituting the swi of 70 into the logarithmic relationship in fig 12b then the llpo could be calculated as 2 78 according to the fitted porosity permeability relationship curve of samples without fractures fig 10 note that the swi of samples without fractures is significantly greater than that of samples with fractures under the same porosity consequently the reservoir with fractures can be judged as an effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures 5 5 minimum flowable pore throat radius method 5 5 1 permeability contribution method the target reservoir was preliminarily subdivided into four classes to eliminate the effect of heterogeneity based on the quality classification criteria of carbonate reservoirs in sichuan basin and the hpmi test data of 19 cores the porosity and permeability of class i reservoirs are greater than 6 and 1 md respectively and fractures and cavities are developed which are usually classified as high quality reservoirs the porosity of class ii reservoirs is between 4 and 6 the permeability is higher than 0 1 md and fractures are locally developed which are generally classified as potential reservoirs the porosity and permeability of class iii reservoirs are distributed in 2 4 and 0 01 0 1 md respectively large pore throats are developed and reservoir effectiveness is usually difficult to judge the porosity and permeability of class iv reservoirs are lower than 2 and 0 01 md respectively and microscopic pore throats are developed which are generally classified as invalid reservoirs the average capillary pressure curve of different classes of reservoirs could be obtained after the hpmi test data are processed by eqs 3 5 and then the rmin of each type of reservoir was calculated by the wall method the normalized capillary pressure curves and permeability contribution ratios of four types of cores are shown in fig 13 the relationship curves between r and i 1 n δ k i calculated by the wall method indicate that the rmin of class i class ii class iii and class iv reservoirs are 28 8 35 7 46 2 and 69 0 nm respectively when the i 1 n δ k i reaches 99 fig 14 subsequently the correlation between r and porosity could be determined by analyzing the hpmi test results fig 15 the fitting curve in the figure could be used for all four types of reservoirs because the influence of microfractures on porosity and r is extremely small substituting the rmin into the fitting equation in fig 15 the llpo of the class i ii iii and iv reservoirs are 1 82 2 00 2 24 and 2 68 respectively finally the maximum value of 2 68 was regarded as the llpo to meet the minimum gas storage capacity requirements of all classes of reservoirs the class iv reservoir is the low petrophysical property reservoir without fractures and therefore the llpe could be calculated as 0 039 md according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting equation in fig 10 class iv reservoirs should be classified as invalid reservoirs according to the evaluation standards of llpo and llpe consistent with the existing classification standard of carbonate reservoirs quality in sichuan basin the petrophysical properties of some class iii reservoirs are also lower than the llpp therefore the class iii reservoir can be subdivided into class iii1 reservoir and class iii2 reservoir to represent effective reservoir and invalid reservoir respectively 5 5 2 water film thickness method the key to establishing the relationship between wft and r is to obtain accurate interfacial tension and wetting angle the wettability of 26 carbonate cores in the target reservoir was analyzed by suspension drop method on the contact angle meter the results show that the distribution of wetting angle of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is relatively concentrated mainly distributed between 34 2 and 38 6 this indicates that the gas reservoir has strong hydrophilicity the average wetting angle of 36 27 was adopted for the calculation of the wft in addition the methane brine interfacial tension at high temperature and pressure was measured with an interfacial tensiometer which always decreases as the pressure and temperature increase the interfacial tension measured under the ultradeep reservoir conditions is 0 03873 n m in previous studies 100 nm is generally regarded as the wft adsorbed on the surface of hydrophilic rock however this value is not applicable to all types of hydrocarbon reservoirs because wft is affected by the pressure temperature and wettability of the reservoir therefore the critical wft suitable for gas accumulation and migration in the target reservoir should be determined the values of wetting angle and gas water interfacial tension were substituted into eq 11 to establish the relationship curve between r and wft under formation pressure fig 16 the figure shows that the wft first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally tends to stabilize as the r increases it should be noted that the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 this means that when the water film occupies 70 of the space in porous media an invalid reservoir will be formed therefore it is assumed that the reservoir space is a tubular channel and the water film is adsorbed on the channel wall the wft at the water saturation of 70 is 45 23 of the channel radius the curve of the ratio of wft to r is also shown in fig 16 the corresponding rmin is 60 02 nm when the ratio value is 45 23 then the rmin obtained by the water film thickness method was substituted into the fitting formula in fig 15 and the llpo obtained is 2 52 finally the llpe can be calculated as 0 032 md according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting formula in fig 10 5 6 gas well testing method the porosity permeability scatter diagram of tested layers in the target reservoir was established according to the reservoir petrophysical property analysis and test interpretation results fig 17 this figure only shows the data of gas and dry layers because these test layers avoid areas with high water content the test results also show that the water produced by gas wells is small and mainly pore water there is a small overlap between the petrophysical property region of gas layers and that of dry layers which makes it difficult to draw the boundary line directly on fig 17 therefore the distribution frequencies of gas and dry layers with different porosity and permeability ranges were calculated to obtain accurate critical porosity and permeability for dividing dry and gas layers fig 18 when the porosity is lower than 2 5 the gas well test results show that the proportion of dry layer is significantly greater than that of gas layer although taking this porosity value as the llpp can improve the calculation result of hydrocarbon reserves it will also increase the probability of misjudgment of gas reservoirs when the porosity is in the range of 2 5 3 0 the gas layer and dry layer each account for half and the maximum porosity of the dry layer in this range is 2 78 and the minimum porosity of the gas layer is 2 84 basically the test layer with permeability higher than 0 05 md could be interpreted as a gas layer therefore the llpo and llpe are 2 84 and 0 05 md respectively finally the dry layer and gas layer can be divided into two regions by marking the gas well testing analysis results on fig 17 note that the llpp obtained by this method are slightly higher than those obtained by static methods this is because the layers with relatively high petrophysical properties were selected preferentially on site so as to ensure the success rate of gas well testing resulting in relatively conservative large llpp determined by this method 5 7 productivity prediction model method the relationship between the predicted productivity and permeability of six gas wells according to the trinomial productivity prediction model is shown in table 1 more importantly the prediction results of the model are similar to the test results of gas wells table 2 summarizes the industrial hydrocarbon flow standard of china the lower limit of industrial hydrocarbon flow increases as the reservoir depth increases the lligf standard for reservoirs with depth greater than 4 0 km is 2 0 104 m3 d therefore the llpe is calculated as 0 046 md by substituting the lligf into the trinomial productivity model however the production stress sensitivity and non darcy flow considered in the productivity prediction model are parameters related to permeability therefore porosity is not reflected in the model to ensure that the reservoir with fractures also has a certain storage capacity the porosity of reservoirs without fractures under this permeability was taken as the lower limit therefore the llpo could be calculated as 2 81 according to the fitting formula of the porosity permeability relationship in fig 10 5 8 productivity simulation experiment method the relationship between gas well productivity and petrophysical properties was obtained through productivity simulation experiments under a pressure differential of 4 5 mpa fig 19 shows that the correlation between gas productivity and permeability is significantly better than that between gas productivity and porosity the daily gas production can reach lligf when the permeability is higher than 0 044 md therefore 0 044 md can be used as llpe and then llpo can be calculated as 2 78 according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting formula in fig 10 if the production pressure differential of 6 0 mpa is directly used as the experimental pressure differential the obtained llpe and llpo are 0 018 md and 2 03 respectively therefore the llpp obtained by the improved productivity simulation experiment method are relatively high which explains why the llpp determined by the conventional productivity simulation experiment method are optimistic low 6 discussion 6 1 effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp the heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is the dominant reason for the inapplicability of conventional llpp determination methods and the difficulty in determining llpp while the development of cavities and fractures is the main factor causing reservoir heterogeneity it is necessary to reveal the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp the results of the cumulative frequency statistics method show that the llpo and the invalid sample proportion obtained using samples without cavities are basically unchanged compared to the conventional statistical method using all core samples as statistical objects this results indicates that the effect of cavities on llpo is minimal however the llpe and the invalid sample proportion obtained using samples without fractures are significantly lower than those obtained using all samples this outcome indicates that the effect of fractures on llpe is too great to be ignored this is because the permeability of cores with fractures is significantly greater than that of cores without fractures which leads to the former contributing most of the gas production capacity and thereby misjudging a large number of reservoirs without fractures as invalid reservoirs the fact is that some reservoirs without fractures still have certain development potential and economic productivity therefore the cumulative frequency statistics method could only be conducted after the ultradeep carbonate reservoir is reasonably classified core samples without fractures must be selected as the research object when determining the llpe and core samples without cavities could be selected as the research object when determining the llpo in addition the results of the porosity permeability relationship method and the irreducible water saturation method both indicate that the reservoir with fractures can be judged as an effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures the results of the gas well testing method show that some high porosity or high permeability layers were still interpreted as dry layers as illustrated in fig 17 these layers have the characteristics of high porosity but low permeability or low porosity but high permeability the petrophysical parameters of these layers cannot reach both llpo and llpe simultaneously in other words these layers cannot simultaneously meet the dual requirements of gas storage capacity and percolation capacity this is an important difference in determining the llpp of effective reservoirs between ultradeep carbonate reservoirs and conventional clastic rock reservoirs the results of the productivity simulation experiment method also indicate that gas productivity is not directly dependent on porosity some low porosity reservoirs still have high gas production but cannot maintain long term stable production while some high porosity reservoirs have significantly lower gas productivity than lligf therefore to eliminate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp an effective reservoir of ultradeep carbonate rocks requires its permeability and porosity to reach llpe and llpo respectively 6 2 applicability of llpp determination methods multiple llpp values of the ultradeep carbonate reservoir were determined through various static and dynamic methods the results and applicability analysis of these methods are summarized in table 3 the static method is based on the assumption that an effective reservoir for hydrocarbon accumulation and migration can be formed the static data and related parameters used are collected from a large number of reservoirs with random petrophysical properties and the productivity of effective reservoirs is usually lower than the lligf therefore the llpp obtained by the static method are generally lower than those obtained by the dynamic method and could be used to evaluate the geological reserves the average value of llpo and llpe determined by static methods are 2 60 and 0 040 md respectively these values reflect that the gas in the reservoir with petrophysical properties lower than 2 60 and 0 040 md cannot effectively accumulate and migrate and these reservoirs should be excluded when calculating geological reserves by contrast the dynamic method is based on the assumption that industrial gas flow can be formed in the reservoir however most of the dynamic data and related parameters are collected from reservoirs with relatively high quality consequently the llpp obtained by dynamic methods are usually greater than the llpp of effective reservoirs which can be used not only to verify the rationality of the llpp obtained by the static method but also to evaluate the dynamic reserves the average value of llpo and llpe determined by dynamic methods are 2 81 and 0 047 md respectively which are slightly higher than the results of static methods these figures also reflect that the gas in reservoirs with porosity and permeability lower than 2 81 and 0 047 md cannot form industrial gas flow and so these reservoirs should be excluded when calculating dynamic reserves the llpp obtained by static methods and dynamic methods can also be put together to calculate the average value as the llpp of effective reservoir this average llpp can not only ensure the effective accumulation and migration of gas in the reservoir but also form gas productivity close to the industrial gas flow as well as balance the error caused by these two types of methods tang et al 2019 bai et al 2021 the llpp of the study area after averaging the values obtained by all methods are 2 68 and 0 042 md 6 3 application and verification of llpp the well logging and testing results of five newly drilled well sections were used as data to verify the correctness and applicability of the obtained llpp table 4 the verification results show that the logging permeability of well g103 and the logging porosity of well g16 are lower than the llpp the test production of well gs103 only reached 247 m3 d and dropped to 0 within a few days the test interval was dominated by the reservoir with poor petrophysical properties therefore the test results show that this well section does not form an effective reservoir and cannot produce industrial gas flow a small amount of gas produced by well gs103 only came from a very small range of effective areas near the wellbore by contrast the test production of well gs16 reached 4 63 104 m3 d significantly higher than the lligf nevertheless the numerical well test results indicate that the effective exploitation stage of this well section is only four months and the productivity decreases rapidly which reflects that the test well section of well gs16 is dominated by fracture type reservoirs with poor storage capacity therefore the reservoir in this well section was still classified as an invalid reservoir because although it has a certain gas production capacity in the short term it has not formed a certain scale of reserves furthermore the petrophysical parameters of the other three well sections are higher than the llpp showing good gas test results thereby verifying the accuracy of the obtained llpp and the applicability of the llpp determination method in this type of strongly heterogeneous gas reservoir 7 conclusions 1 the characteristics of diverse reservoir types and significant heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs greatly increase the difficulty of determining the llpp of effective reservoirs resulting in the poor application effect of conventional determination methods the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas accumulation and migration in the study area are 2 60 and 0 04 md which are determined by improved static methods including empirical cumulative frequency statistical porosity permeability relationship irreducible water saturation and minimum flow pore throat radius methods the llpp obtained by static methods were verified by improved dynamic methods including gas well testing productivity prediction model and productivity simulation experiment methods furthermore the llpp that can form industrial gas flow in the reservoir obtained by dynamic methods are 2 81 and 0 047 md 2 the determination of llpp by static methods is based on whether hydrocarbon can accumulate and migrate in the reservoir the empirical method is applicable to the initial stage of exploration lacking test and production data the application of cumulative frequency statistics method and porosity permeability relationship method in ultradeep carbonate reservoirs requires a reasonable classification of core types and a great number of petrophysical property data when determining the llpe cores without fractures must be selected as the statistical objects of these two methods the premise of using the irreducible water saturation method is that the swi data are sufficient and the classification criteria of gas and water layers in the target area should be taken as the critical swi limit to judge the effectiveness of the reservoir the rmin determination method can be conducted by hpmi test and wft calculation the former is applicable to reservoirs with sufficient hpmi data and reservoir quality classification criteria while the latter is applicable to reservoirs with accurate high pressure physical property of fluid and classification criteria of gas and water layers 3 the determination of llpp by dynamic methods is based on whether industrial gas flow can be formed the gas well testing method is applicable to the initial stage of reservoir exploitation with sufficient and accurate test results but the llpp obtained are relatively high because the layer with relatively high petrophysical properties is preferred for testing the productivity prediction model method needs to establish a productivity prediction model with strong adaptability and select accurate parameters when determining llpp the established trinomial productivity prediction model considering multiple factors is applicable to ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs the productivity simulation experiment method is applicable to reservoirs with sufficient experimental data and clear production conditions however the similarity conversion of pressure differential should be conducted before the similarity conversion of gas productivity to eliminate the scale difference between core and reservoir 4 the results of static methods show that cavities in the carbonate reservoir have little influence on the llpo whereas the effect of fractures on the llpe is significant the reservoir with fractures could be regarded as the effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures because the permeability of the former is obviously greater than that of the latter under the same porosity fractures can effectively connect various storage spaces and greatly reduce the residual water content but the effect of cavities on swi is small the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 the rmin of the ultradeep carbonate reservoir obtained by hpmi test and wft is approximately 60 nm 5 the results of dynamic methods show that the effective reservoir of ultradeep carbonate rock needs to reach llpe and llpo simultaneously which is different from homogeneous clastic rock reservoirs with high porosity but low permeability or high permeability but low porosity are still interpreted as invalid reservoirs because they cannot meet the requirements of both storage and production capacities the correlation between porosity and gas production is weak although the production of some low porosity reservoirs is considerable the decay rate is fast by contrast the correlation between permeability and gas production is strong the llpp obtained by static methods and dynamic methods can be used to calculate geological reserves and dynamic reserves respectively the average value of several llpp obtained by the two types of methods 2 68 0 042 md can ensure that the gas can effectively accumulate and migrate and form a gas production close to industrial gas flow credit authorship contribution statement lu wang conceptualization

effective reservoirs are significant parameters for reserve evaluation and exploitation scheme formulation of hydrocarbon reservoirs however the existing llpp determination method is not applicable to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs with diverse reservoir space and strong heterogeneity therefore a systematic method for determining the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs was developed in this study first the geological setting and reservoir characteristics were briefly introduced and numerous cores were classified according to whether cavities and fractures were developed subsequently the test data of petrophysical property nmr high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi and fluid physical property were collected and a series of llpp values were obtained through static methods of cumulative frequency statistics porosity permeability relationship irreducible water saturation and minimum flowable pore throat radius rmin the llpp determined by static methods were then verified by dynamic methods of gas well testing productivity model prediction and productivity simulation experiment and the llpp of reservoirs that can form industrial gas flow were determined finally the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp was revealed the applicability of various llpp determination methods were summarized and the accuracy of the obtained llpp was confirmed by well testing interpretations the research results show that the reasonable classification of reservoir types is the prerequisite to accurately determine the llpp of carbonate reservoirs the lower limit of porosity is little affected by cavities while the lower limit of permeability is greatly affected by fractures rmin of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs obtained by hpmi test and water film thickness calculation is approximately 60 nm the significant heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs requires that effective reservoirs should reach the lower limit of porosity and permeability simultaneously llpp determined through static methods and dynamic methods can be applied to evaluate geological and dynamic reserves respectively the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas to accumulate migrate and form industrial gas production are 2 68 and 0 042 md keywords lower limits of petrophysical parameters ultradeep carbonate reservoir effective reservoir improved static and dynamic methods gas accumulation and migration industrial gas flow data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction lower limits of petrophysical parameters llpp of hydrocarbon reservoirs refer to the minimum porosity and minimum permeability that can make oil or natural gas accumulate and migrate under conventional formation conditions qi 1989 hydrocarbon reservoirs with porosity and permeability values higher than the llpp are usually classified as effective reservoirs the llpp of effective reservoirs are indispensable parameters for evaluating hydrocarbon resources reserve and their accuracy directly affects the formulation and adjustment of the reservoir development scheme the llpp are generally determined by combining various technical methods because these are affected by various aspects including reservoir characteristics fluid properties and exploitation strategies using a single method will inevitably bring some errors when determining the llpp of an effective reservoir llpp determination methods can be divided into static and dynamic methods guo 2004 lu et al 2016 static methods analyze the relationship between porosity permeability and other parameters through core test data and statistical principles to obtain multiple thresholds as llpp the results obtained by static methods are subjective because their accuracy is affected by the number characteristics and representativeness of the selected core samples therefore this type of method is often used in the exploration and initial exploitation stages when there are few dynamic testing and production data dynamic methods determine the gas production capacity of reservoirs with different petrophysical parameters through productivity prediction model productivity simulation experiment or gas well testing data and then calculate the llpp according to the relationship between gas production capacity and porosity permeability or other parameters lu et al 2017 the results obtained by dynamic methods are more objective but usually higher than the actual llpp of effective reservoirs liu et al 2012 dynamic methods are usually used in combination with static methods in the exploitation stage to improve the accuracy of the llpp previously determined gong et al 2015 currently the studies related to llpp determination methods are mostly focused on clastic rock reservoirs tang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 bai et al 2021 the pore throat structure of clastic rock reservoir is simple and mainly composed of pore throats of different sizes porosity and permeability are highly correlated because reservoir heterogeneity is weak cao et al 2013 therefore the lower limit of porosity llpo could be determined first and then the lower limit of permeability llpe could be calculated by referring to the correlation between porosity and permeability zhou et al 2019 ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs contribute significantly to global hydrocarbon resources garing et al 2014 and their huge exploration and development potential has attracted considerable attention from geologists and petroleum engineers zhang et al 2018 the accurate evaluation of llpp for ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs is helpful to accurately calculate the natural gas reserves which provides a theoretical foundation for the formulation of a rational exploitation scheme wang et al 2017a however ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs have gone through multiple periods of tectonic movement and diagenesis compared with hydrocarbon reservoirs of medium and shallow depth thus forming a co existence model of various types of reservoir spaces gao and li 2016 wang et al 2018b as a result ultradeep carbonate reservoirs are characterized by a complex pore structure diverse reservoir types obvious regional petrophysical property differences high difficulty in reserve evaluation and large differences in gas well productivity ronchi and cruciani 2015 matonti et al 2015 gundogar et al 2016 corbett et al 2017 these typical characteristics hinder the full application of conventional llpp determination methods to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs zheng et al 2020 the fundamental reason behind the formation of these typical characteristics is the strong heterogeneity of the reservoir at both macro and micro levels the heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs is the result of various sedimentary environments and the evolution of basins over time tavakoli 2019 clarifying the heterogeneity characteristics is an important prerequisite for obtaining accurate llpp as it has a significant impact on the reservoir storage and percolation capacities mohsin et al 2023 however previous studies have shown that the heterogeneity of carbonate reservoirs is influenced by multiple factors which increase the difficulty of reservoir property evaluation and in situ hydrocarbon calculation zhang et al 2023 it is crucial to classify the carbonate reservoir type or pore type and conduct separate studies to reveal the heterogeneity characteristics of reservoirs jamalian and tavakoli 2022 therefore reservoir heterogeneity should be considered first when determining the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs as this is the dominant reason conventional llpp determination methods are not applicable at present there is no specialized research on the llpp determination method for this type of reservoir deng iv member reservoir of the sinian system in sichuan basin is widely accepted as an ultradeep carbonate gas reservoir with enormous reserves and production potential wang et al 2020 yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 therefore the deng iv member was taken as the target reservoir for studying the llpp of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs the purpose of this study is to improve conventional llpp determination methods based on the typical characteristics of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs as well as summarize and analyze the applicability and application process of different methods in addition the impact of cavities and fractures developed in ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs on the llpo and llpe was revealed by analyzing the statistical and testing results of different types of cores or reservoirs pore type fracture type cavity type and fracture cavity type finally the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas accumulation and migration and can form industrial gas flow were determined providing a theoretical foundation for the accurate reserve evaluation and reasonable exploitation scheme formulation of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs 2 geological setting deng iv member gas reservoir of the sinian system in sichuan basin is located in suining city sichuan province and tongnan county chongqing city fig 1 the gaoshiti moxi area is located in the central part of the flat gentle paleouplift mesozoic slope belt in the central sichuan basin covering an area of 5 288 square kilometers with a total closure of 429 m the regional structure zone is situated in the weiyuan longnvsi structural group in the gentle structure area of the central sichuan paleouplift with a reservoir depth of 4500 5500 m yang et al 2016 horizontally the sedimentary microfacies of the lateral upper platform margin belt of the deng iv member are mainly algal ash silt mounds but some reservoirs are developed in the sandy beach and dolomite flat microfacies reservoir sedimentary microfacies in the intra platform zone are relatively complex mainly composed of sandy beaches followed by algal ash silt mounds dolomite flat and algal dolomite flat vertically the deng iv upper sub member mainly develops algal ash silt mounds and the deng iv lower sub member mainly develops sandy beaches du et al 2014 deng iv member mainly develops two types of fracture cavity type dolomite reservoirs namely the upper and lower sub members the reservoir is thick vertically and the layers are superimposed and connected in the horizontal direction with a wide and stable distribution this reservoir distribution pattern has established excellent storage conditions for the formation of large scale natural gas reservoirs li et al 2013 the exploration results show that deng iv member in this area contains a large gas bearing area as the strata in the west are denuded and pinched out to form a stratum barrier the gas bearing area exceeds the trap range of the gaoshiti buried and moxi buried structures and is not controlled by local structures the periphery of deng iv member has not been confirmed to have uniform edge water and bottom water and is controlled by lithological traps therefore deng iv member is a lithologic stratigraphic structural composite trap gas reservoir under a tectonic setting jin et al 2017 the detailed introduction to the tectonic and sedimentary settings of the deng iv member reservoir can be found in the first chapter of our monograph wang 2023 3 reservoir characteristics 3 1 reservoir lithology deng iv member reservoir is mainly composed of algal clotted dolomite algal stromatolite dolomite and doloarenite of the mound beach complex algal clotted dolomite is the most important reservoir rock type with an areal porosity of 3 6 the dominant reservoir space is the residual dissolution pores between clots and dissolution pores formed in the later stage the distribution frequency of algal stromatolite dolomite is only second to that of algal clotted dolomite the karst reformation is strong and the dissolution cavities are developed the area porosity is mainly 4 8 and some can reach more than 10 the dominant reservoir space is the bird s eye pores and cavities or the fenestriform pores and cavities formed by the decay of algal filaments and the bedding karstification is significant when the sedimentary interface is in the high energy zone above the wave base the early micrite or algal dolomite is broken to form doloarenite and the intergranular pores and intergranular dissolved pores form the dominant reservoir space 3 2 reservoir space deng iv member has experienced various diagenesis types of compaction cementation filling dissolution dolomitization and metasomatism in different stages and these diageneses have different impacts and contributions on reservoir space compaction cementation and filling are the diagenesis types that reduce sediment volume and worsen reservoir petrophysical properties by contrast multiple stages of karstification have formed a large number of dissolution pores and cavities with storage potential moreover dolomitization increased intergranular and intercrystalline pores and formed microscopic fractures a situation similar to the porosity evolution process of carbonate gas reservoirs in the permian triassic strata of the persian gulf tavakoli and jamalian 2019 however different types of pores cavities and fractures may be partially filled with dolomite under the action of overdolomitization thereby reducing reservoir space therefore the reservoir spaces of deng iv member not only includes intergranular dissolved pores intragranular dissolved pores lattice pores and intercrystalline dissolved pores controlled by fabric but also dissolved cavities and dissolved and structural fractures not affected by fabric among these spaces secondary pores mainly composed of intergranular and intercrystalline dissolved pores are the dominant reservoir space and multiple types of small and moderate sized dissolved cavities constitute another reservoir space type of carbonate rocks cavity density in the deng iv member is in the range of 11 37 per meter with an average of 25 per meter the extensively developed fractures have little contribution to reservoir spaces but effectively connect each reservoir space thus greatly enhancing the fluid percolation capacity fracture density in the deng iv member is in the range of 1 5 7 5 per meter with an average of 3 1 per meter which is similar to the south pars field in the persian gulf rafiei et al 2016 note that the interlaced network of microfractures not only increases permeability but also connects a large range of reservoir spaces and the bedding cavities provide dominant percolation channels while increasing reservoir space therefore these planar structures developed in carbonate rocks directly affect reservoir quality kaveh ahangar et al 2023 results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the target reservoir is dominated by necking throats and lamellar throats with tubular throats developed locally wang et al 2020 3 3 reservoir petrophysical property deng iv member is generally composed of low petrophysical property reservoirs but in locally developed high petrophysical property areas the permeability and porosity data of 318 cores from the target reservoir indicates that the porosity range is generally 1 10 concentrated in 1 6 with an average of 3 83 fig 2 the permeability range is 0 0001 10000 md concentrated in 0 01 1 00 md with an average of 1 02 md compared with the petrophysical property of the barremian aptian carbonate oil reservoirs in central persian gulf tavakoli et al 2022 the relationship between porosity and permeability of the deng iv member carbonate gas reservoir is more difficult to characterize and the distribution range of permeability is larger under the same porosity classifying reservoir data based on the petrophysical property ranges or pore structure characteristics is an important method for studying the related properties of strongly heterogeneous reservoirs therefore the relationship between porosity and permeability was classified based on the development of fractures the porosity permeability correlation of cores with fractures is extremely poor and they generally have high permeability at low porosity by contrast the porosity permeability correlation of cores without fractures is relatively strong the two parameters are still relevant when the porosity is high therefore the extensive developed fractures reduce the correlation between permeability and porosity whereas cavities increase permeability and porosity simultaneously which has little impact on the correlation between them this conclusion was also confirmed in our subsequent studies according to the core classification standard and petrophysical property distribution these cores can be bdivided into pore type cavity type fracture type and fracture cavity type the approximate distribution areas of the four types of reservoirs in the porosity permeability scatter diagram are marked in fig 2 some llpp determination methods require selecting cores from different types of reservoirs for testing and analysis the classification standard pore structure characteristics and petrophysical parameters of each type of reservoir can be found in our previous studies wang et al 2017b wang et al 2020 therefore the specific characteristics of various reservoirs were no longer introduced in this study 3 4 reservoir heterogeneity the heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs was formed by the combined effects of sedimentation diagenesis and tectonism tavakoli 2019 sedimentation not only controls the carbonate sedimentary body thickness and their internal rock combinations but also the distribution of favorable reservoir facies and petrophysical properties shang et al 2021 the differences in sedimentary structure sediment particle size sorting and mineral composition within different sedimentary facies zones in the same sedimentary system further lead to different heterogeneity characteristics sedimentation also affects the rock mechanics attributes of different formations by controlling the thickness lithology petrophysical properties and other related attributes of carbonate reservoirs resulting in the heterogeneity of natural fracture development in the subsequent structural evolution process from the quasi contemporaneous stage to the burial stage the compaction pressure dissolution cementation filling karst dolomitization and other diagenesis in carbonate rocks are superimposed on the sedimentary framework of heterogeneous reservoirs resulting in further uneven evolution in the reservoir and increasing the complexity of reservoir heterogeneity diagenesis can also affect the mechanical properties of carbonate reservoirs by changing rock composition particle size and particle arrangement thereby affecting the development of tectonic fracturing the subsequent filling action can seal the structural cracks which reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of fractures tectonic movements can further transform existing reservoirs causing deformation dislocation and fracture thereby exacerbating reservoir heterogeneity macroscopically faults and large scale fractures can alter reservoir connectivity microscopically fracture networks can greatly improve the percolation and storage capacity of local reservoirs mohsin et al 2023 furthermore the burial period of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is extremely long and the influence of abnormal high temperatures and pressures and hydrothermal fluids further increases the complexity of reservoir heterogeneity therefore the heterogeneity of this type of reservoir is significantly stronger than other types of reservoirs which greatly increases the difficulty of studying reservoir properties such as llpp 3 5 reservoir pressure and temperature pressure data from the tests of seven wells in the target reservoir were analyzed the reservoir pressure range is 56 50 57 09 mpa and the reservoir pressure difference is only 0 01 0 59 mpa with an average of 56 83 mpa fig 3 a these numbers indicate that the reservoir pressure of each layer is very close and could be considered to be in the same pressure system there is good connectivity between the upper and lower sub members as well therefore all layers could be considered as a whole to study the llpp of effective reservoirs temperature data from the tests of seven wells in the target reservoir were analyzed the average reservoir temperature converted to the elevation in the middle of the reservoir is 155 7 the reservoir temperature range is 149 5 164 2 c and the reservoir temperature difference is only 2 3 14 7 fig 3b these measurements also indicate that the difference of reservoir temperature in each layer is small the detailed reservoir characteristics of the deng iv member including lithologic characteristics mineral composition petrophysical properties pore throat structure fluid properties reservoir thickness distribution temperature and pressure conditions could be referred to the first chapter of our monograph wang 2023 4 materials and methods 4 1 empirical method empirical method refers to the approximate calculation of average reservoir permeability according to a great number of core analysis results obtained from the study area this average value is then multiplied by 5 as the llpe of the effective reservoir in the target reservoir this method was first proposed by the core lab of america and has been extensively applied in hydrocarbon fields around the world although the error of the obtained llpp cannot be ignored the empirical method as a simple and easy method can guide the subsequent exploration and development work in the absence of test data guo 2004 4 2 cumulative frequency statistics method the cumulative frequency method refers to the statistical method of determining llpp according to the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity and production capacity by collecting the petrophysical parameters of cores the premise of applying this method is to use the petrophysical property data of cores from all cored wells to make the frequency distribution histogram of porosity and permeability as well as establish the cumulative frequency curve cumulative storage capacity curve and cumulative production capacity curve cui et al 2017 the calculation formulas of gas storage capacity related to porosity and gas production capacity related to permeability are shown in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q φ i φ i h i i 1 n φ i h i 2 q ki k i h i i 1 n k i h i where q φ i is the gas storage capacity related to porosity q ki is the gas production capacity related to permeability φ i is the porosity of core with serial number i k i is the permeability of core with serial number i md and h i is the length of core with serial number i cm previous investigations on the pore structure of the target reservoir show that the effect of widely developed microfractures on reservoir porosity is insignificant and small sized cavities have little effect on reservoir permeability in pursuit of revealing the effect of cavities on the llpo and the effect of fractures on the llpe the llpo of all cores and cores without cavities pore type and fracture type cores as well as the llpe of all cores and cores without fractures pore type and cavity type cores were compared and analyzed in previous studies the llpp of clastic rock reservoirs usually refer to porosity and permeability when cumulative loss percentage of storage capacity and production capacity reaches 5 li et al 2012 considering that the petrophysical parameters of the ultradeep hydrocarbon reservoir is generally low the cumulative loss percentage standard of storage capacity and production capacity should be increased to 10 wang et al 2010 4 3 porosity permeability relationship method the porosity permeability relationship method refers to the creation of a porosity permeability relationship diagram according to the petrophysical property test results of cores in the study area and then determining the llpp of effective reservoirs by analyzing the porosity permeability relationship fitting curve jiang et al 2016 the widespread fractures in deng iv member lead to multiple permeability values of different orders of magnitude under the same porosity which is also the main reason for the weak correlation between permeability and porosity if this method is directly used to determine the llpp of all cores it will not only be difficult to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the fitting curve but also lead to a higher llpe therefore the porosity permeability scatter diagram should be made with the petrophysical property data of core samples without fractures 4 4 irreducible water saturation method when the porous medium in the reservoir is filled with irreducible water the effective storage space is zero and hydrocarbon cannot migrate to the reservoir and accumulate to form hydrocarbon reservoirs therefore the values of porosity and permeability corresponding to the irreducible water saturation swi of 100 are commonly used as the theoretical lower limit of gas migration and accumulation and can also be used as the prerequisite for determining reservoir effectiveness pang et al 2019 in other words if the swi of the reservoir is less than 100 then it can be considered as an effective reservoir however the llpp determined by this method are optimistic low this is because the swi of some reservoirs does not reach 100 but an excessively high irreducible water condition will lead to extremely low gas content and high gas flow resistance which is incapable of satisfying the needs of effective reservoirs for gas storage and percolation capacities therefore reservoirs with water saturation greater than 70 are considered as invalid layers water layers or gas bearing water layers according to the identification conclusion of gas layer and water layer from well logging data in addition the experimental results of gas percolation indicate that it is impossible to establish an effective gas phase percolation system within a certain pressure gradient range for cores with swi greater than 70 wang 2023 all these indicate that the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 centrifugation combined with nmr testing is usually used to determine the saturations of movable fluid and irreducible water in the core sample centrifuge experiments were conducted on cores at different rotating speeds and then the transverse relaxation time t2 spectrum after each centrifuge experiment was measured next the t2 spectra of cores completely saturated with water were used as reference standards for comparison when the rotating speed of the centrifuge was increased to 6000 8000 rpm the t2 spectrum basically remained unchanged which indicated that the irreducible water condition had been formed in the core swi is the proportion of the cumulative frequency of t2 spectrum in the irreducible water condition to that in the completely saturated water condition then the relationship between petrophysical property and swi could be established based on the nmr test results of multiple core samples the porosity and permeability corresponding to a irreducible water saturation of 70 could be regarded as llpp 4 5 minimum flowable pore throat radius method the formation of effective reservoirs requires hydrocarbon to enter the storage space and accumulate into reservoirs as well as the smooth migration of hydrocarbon between the reservoir spaces accordingly the reservoir should have certain capacities of storage and percolation simultaneously the pore structure and size directly affect the storage capacity of the hydrocarbon reservoir and the throat radius is the key parameter for whether hydrocarbon can migrate in the reservoir under a certain pressure differential therefore the minimum flowable pore throat radius rmin is the minimum channel radius that can not only store gas but also allow gas migration yang et al 2022 the rmin of the reservoir could be obtained by the water film thickness wft calculation xiao et al 2021 or high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi test data li et al 2014 dai and lin 2021 and then the llpp of effective reservoirs could be determined based on the relationship between petrophysical parameters and r 4 5 1 permeability contribution method the process of injected mercury displacing the wetting phase in the core during hpmi testing can reflect the process of hydrocarbon displacing water in the formation therefore the capillary pressure data could be applied to analyze the microscopic pore structure of the core and calculate the rmin of the reservoir hpmi test data can also be used to establish the relationship curve between average r and petrophysical parameters given that the sample used in the hpmi test is a 25 mm 25 mm square core each capillary pressure curve can only reflect the characteristics of a certain position in the reservoir not the entire reservoir consequently the j function method proposed by leverette was used to integrate and average the capillary pressure curve of the entire reservoir tao and mohan 2007 calculation formulas are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 j s wn p c p ref p c σ k φ 4 s wn s w s wi 1 s wc where j represents the dimensionless function p c represents the capillary pressure mpa p ref represents the reference capillary pressure mpa s wn and s wi represent the standardized and irreducible water saturations respectively σ represents the interfacial tension mn m k is the core permeability md and φ is the core porosity after the j function was calculated the average porosity and average permeability can be substituted into eq 5 to establish the capillary pressure curve representing the reservoir 5 p c j σ φ k subsequently the rmin of the reservoir could be calculated by the wall method gao et al 2011 the wall method calculates the contribution ratio of different r to permeability according to the relationship between mercury intrusion pressure and intrusion amount when the cumulative contribution ratio of permeability increases to 99 with the r from large to small the corresponding radius could be regarded as rmin calculation formulas are shown in eqs 6 and 7 6 i 1 n δ k i δ k 1 δ k 2 δ k n 7 δ k i 2 i 1 r i 2 i 1 n 2 i 1 r i 2 where i 1 n δ k i is the cumulative contribution ratio of permeability δ k i is the permeability contribution of pore throats in different radius ranges and r i is the pore throat radius μm 4 5 2 water film thickness method wft is the thickness when the water in the reservoir is evenly spread on the rock surface when the wft is greater than the r the storage space and percolation channel controlled by the pore throat are completely saturated with water resulting in the inability of hydrocarbon accumulation and migration to occur fig 4 the r corresponding to the wft is the rmin of the hydrocarbon reservoir therefore the critical wft on the rock surface under different geological conditions namely rmin can be determined next the llpp corresponding to the rmin can be determined according to the relationship curves between r and petrophysical properties the water film adsorbed on the medium surface is formed by solid liquid interaction yang et al 2022 water molecules are tightly adsorbed on the solid surface when polar molecules are close to one another their inherent dipoles repel one another in the same polarity attract one another in the different polarity and align directionally when the water film on the rock surface becomes thinner under the external force the top and bottom interfaces of the water film are close to each other and generate repulsive force which is called separation pressure p d the water film is also subjected to the formation pressure p i perpendicular to the rock wall and the capillary pressure p c in the opposite direction of the formation pressure the force analysis of water film in porous media that ignores gravity is shown in fig 5 when the water film is stable there is an equilibrium relationship between formation pressure separation pressure and capillary pressure as shown in eq 8 8 p i p d p c the separation pressure theoretically consists of electrostatic attraction intermolecular force and structural components the structural components include matrix suction and osmotic suction gee et al 1990 measured the wft of hydrophilic rock surface under multiple separation pressures using the elliptical polarization technique of light the relationship between separation pressure and wft obtained from measuring points is shown in eq 9 9 p d 2200 h 3 150 h 2 12 h where h is the wft μm the pressure difference between the gas phase and the water phase on both sides of the water film is the capillary pressure whose value is closely related to gas water interfacial tension capillary radius and medium wettability as shown in eq 10 10 p c 2 σ cos θ r where r represents the capillary radius μm θ represents the wetting angle of formation water on the carbonate rock surface and σ represents the gas water interfacial tension n m eq 11 can be obtained by combining eqs 8 10 it can be seen from eq 11 that the relationship between wft and r under formation pressure can be established as along as the interfacial tension and wetting angle are given 11 p i 2200 h 3 150 h 2 12 h 2 σ cos θ r 4 6 gas well testing method the gas well testing method refers to the statistical analysis of the average porosity and permeability and the gas productivity test results of tested layers it then makes the porosity permeability scatter diagram of the gas layer water layer and dry layer layer without fluid according to the test interpretation results jiang et al 2016 porosity and permeability corresponding to the boundary between gas layer and dry layer could be regarded as the llpp of effective reservoirs when the gas well testing data are complete and accurate the efficiently and intuitively llpp can be determined by this method 4 7 productivity prediction model method the premise of applying this method is to develop a productivity prediction model applicable to the target reservoir and determine the relationship between permeability and gas productivity under the condition that other parameters are constant the minimum productivity required for gas well production is determined based on the industrial hydrocarbon flow standard and the llpe to meet the productivity is finally calculated the trinomial productivity prediction model applicable to ultradeep carbonate reservoirs was presented in detail in our academic monograph wang 2023 as shown in eqs 12 16 this model comprehensively considers the multiple media stress sensitivity non darcy flow threshold pressure and well type of gas reservoirs and predicts and verifies the gas well production of different regions and types of reservoirs although the specific physical assumptions derivation process and parameter selection of the model are not introduced in this paper it is worth noting that appropriate models and parameters should be selected for gas productivity prediction and llpp determination 12 m e m w c a q sc b q sc 2 13 m p i p 2 p μ z σ s p σ s p i α d p 14 a p sc t π k i h z sc t sc ln r e r we 15 b β γ g p sc t ρ sc 2 π 2 h 2 t sc μ z

with different petrophysical properties under the simulated reservoir conditions is the basis of the productivity simulation experiment method during the experiment different displacement pressure differentials were set in the horizontal direction of the core to obtain the gas flowrates under unidirectional flow conditions which were then converted into daily gas productions of gas wells under radial flow conditions liu 2005 subsequently the relationship between petrophysical properties and gas well productivity can be established based on a series of productivity simulation experimental results the petrophysical properties corresponding to the lower limit of industrial gas flow lligf are the llpp of effective reservoirs the formula for converting experimental flowrate to gas well productivity is shown in eq 17 17 q 69 12 q r r w h d 2 where q represents the gas well productivity 104 m3 d q r represents the gas flowrate measured under laboratory conditions m3 s r w represents the wellbore radius m and d represents the core diameter m eq 17 is based on the equivalence between the gas flowrate in the core under experimental conditions and the gas flowrate in the well under field conditions thereby realizing the similarity conversion of production under different scales the traditional method approximately sets the production pressure differential of a single well as the experimental pressure differential of productivity simulation when determining the llpp however the size of the core is obviously different from that of the single well control area in scale resulting in a large difference between the fluid flowrate at the core outlet and the wellbore under the same pressure differential therefore the pressure differential setting of the traditional method makes the production prediction result on the high side wang et al 2017c the traditional productivity simulation experiment method needs to be improved in the setting of experimental pressure differential similarity conversion of pressure differential should be conducted before similarity conversion of gas productivity then the experimental pressure differential is set based on the converted pressure differential to ensure that the gas flowrates at the outlet of the two scales is equal the pressure differential conversion formula is derived as follows 18 ν sg k μ g d p d x k p e1 2 p w1 2 2 μ g l p 19 ν rg k μ g d p d x k p e2 2 p w2 2 2 μ g r p ln r e r w where ν sg represents the gas flowrate at the core outlet m s ν rg represents the gas flowrate at the wellbore of the gas well m s p e1 represents the pressure at the core inlet mpa p w1 represents the pressure at the core outlet mpa p e2 represents the supply pressure at the boundary of gas reservoir mpa p w2 represents the bottom hole pressure at the wellbore mpa l represents the core length m p represents the pressure at a certain location in the reservoir mpa and r represents the distance between a certain location in a reservoir and a well m to ensure that the gas flowrate at the core outlet is equal to that at the wellbore of the gas well ν sg ν rg setting p p w1 in eq 18 p p w2 and r r w in eq 19 besides the core inlet pressure should be equal to the supply pressure at the reservoir boundary p e1 p e2 and then the pressure differential conversion formulas are obtained as shown in eqs 20 and 21 20 p w1 1 2 p e 2 p w 2 l p w r w ln r e r w p e 2 p w 2 l p w r w ln r e r w 2 4 p e 2 21 δ p p e p w1 as long as the bottom hole pressure is determined the core outlet pressure required for productivity simulation experiments can be obtained according to eq 20 the difference between core length and well control radius determines the conversion relationship between experimental pressure differential and field production pressure differential single plunger core could be selected for productivity simulation experiment of homogeneous reservoir however the productivity simulation experiment should be conducted on the long core composed of multiple types of plunger cores to avoid the limitation that a single core cannot represent a strongly heterogeneous reservoir the conversion coefficient from production pressure differential to experimental pressure differential could be obtained from the long core length and the gas well control radius the device diagram of productivity simulation experiment is illustrated in fig 6 and the detailed experimental method and process could refer to our previous studies wang 2023 the temperature and pressure set in the experiment completely refer to the formation conditions fig 7 shows the similarity conversion results of pressure differential and gas productivity when the long core length and well control radius are 0 4 m and 500 m respectively according to the production pressure differential of 6 0 mpa commonly used in the target reservoir the pressure differential of the productivity simulation experiment should be set to 4 5 mpa by referring to the binomial relationship in fig 7a the gas well productivity is obtained by converting the gas flow rate measured in the productivity simulation experiment with reference to the linear relationship in fig 7b 5 results 5 1 empirical method the petrophysical property data of 319 core samples from the deng iv member reservoir were used for the empirical method the average permeability of these samples is 1 02 md and so the llpe determined by the empirical method is 0 051 md 5 2 cumulative frequency statistics method statistical results of porosity distribution and gas storage capacity indicate that the invalid sample proportion and the llpo are 20 and 2 4 respectively when all core samples are taken as statistical objects and the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity reaches 10 fig 8 a statistical results of permeability distribution and gas production capacity indicate that the invalid sample proportion and the llpe are 85 and 2 0 md respectively when all core samples are taken as statistical objects and the cumulative loss percentage of gas production capacity reaches 10 fig 9 a if 2 0 md is taken as the llpe the proportion of invalid samples is too high which will lead to a large number of target layers being misjudged as invalid reservoirs although some studies have forced the proportion of invalid samples to be limited to less than 20 to ensure that most reservoirs can be effectively exploitation the high proportion of invalid samples is a direct reflection of the strong heterogeneity of the study area artificially limiting the proportion of invalid samples will reduce the values of llpp which cannot reflect the actual reservoir situation therefore the conventional cumulative frequency statistics method is not suitable for ultradeep carbonate reservoirs and must be improved when core samples without cavities are taken as statistical objects the invalid sample proportion and llpo are 20 and 2 42 respectively when the cumulative loss percentage of gas storage capacity reaches 10 fig 8b when core samples without fractures are taken as statistical objects the invalid sample proportion and llpe are 50 and 0 038 md respectively as the cumulative loss percentage of gas production capacity reaches 10 fig 9b note that the proportion of invalid samples to all samples is only 26 when 0 038 md is taken as the llpe of all core samples consequently it is appropriate to take 2 42 and 0 038 md as the llpp of the target reservoir and the proportion of invalid samples under this llpp is reasonable 5 3 porosity permeability relationship method the determination coefficient of the porosity permeability fitting curve reaches 0 84 indicating a strong correlation between the porosity and permeability of these core samples without fractures fig 10 in addition the relationship between porosity and permeability could be divided into three stages based on the characteristics of the fitting curve when the porosity is lower than 2 6 the permeability improves slightly as the porosity increases indicating that invalid pores are dominant in these samples when the porosity is higher than 2 6 the permeability improves obviously as the porosity increases indicating that these core samples are dominated by effective pores and have a certain percolation capacity when the porosity is greater than 3 5 the permeability improves sharply as the porosity increases and the production capacity of reservoirs in this range is strong and has reached a relatively stable state consequently 2 6 was taken as the llpo to judge the effectiveness of the reservoir and then the llpe 0 036 md was calculated based on the fitted porosity permeability relationship curve the permeability of cores with fractures is significantly greater than that of cores without fractures under the same porosity fig 2 therefore as long as the porosity of the reservoir with fractures reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures it could be determined as an effective reservoir without considering the llpe 5 4 irreducible water saturation method the nmr t2 spectra of four types of cores are illustrated in fig 11 as shown in the t2 spectrum of 100 saturated water the pore throat radius r distribution of the pore type core has a double peak structure of low right peak and high left peak the dividing points are distributed from 1 ms to 10 ms representing the distribution areas of micro and macro pores respectively the r distribution of fracture type core has a three peak structure with high left peak low middle peak and low right peak the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 and 10 50 ms respectively representing the distribution areas of micro pores macro pores and fractures respectively the r distribution of cavity type core has a double peak structure with little difference in the amplitude of the two peaks the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 ms but the maximum t2 values can reach 500 1000 ms representing the distribution areas of pores and cavities respectively the r distribution of the fracture cavity type core has a four peak structure the dividing points are distributed in 1 10 10 50 and 50 100 ms and the maximum t2 values are more than 1000 ms representing the distribution areas of small pores large pores fractures and cavities respectively the t2 spectra of irreducible water state show that the swi of fracture type and fracture cavity type cores are low and mainly occur in small pores by contrast the swi of the two other types of cores is high and distributed in pores and cavities with different sizes to evaluate the relationship between swi and petrophysical parameters 20 core samples were selected to conduct centrifuge and nmr tests the test results indicate that the correlation between porosity and swi is relatively poor with cases of high porosity but high swi and low porosity but low swi fig 12 a by contrast permeability is strongly correlated with swi the value of swi decreases logarithmically as the reservoir permeability increases fig 12b this indicates that the swi of the carbonate reservoir depends on reservoir permeability fractures can effectively connect various storage spaces and greatly reduce the residual water content by contrast the swi is less affected by the cavity when the cavity is controlled by small pore throats a large amount of water will be trapped in the cavity thereby increasing the residual water content for details about the formation process and occurrence characteristics of residual water in cavities and fractures please refer to our previous visualization investigations wang et al 2018a the llpe of effective reservoirs is 0 044 md by substituting the swi of 70 into the logarithmic relationship in fig 12b then the llpo could be calculated as 2 78 according to the fitted porosity permeability relationship curve of samples without fractures fig 10 note that the swi of samples without fractures is significantly greater than that of samples with fractures under the same porosity consequently the reservoir with fractures can be judged as an effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures 5 5 minimum flowable pore throat radius method 5 5 1 permeability contribution method the target reservoir was preliminarily subdivided into four classes to eliminate the effect of heterogeneity based on the quality classification criteria of carbonate reservoirs in sichuan basin and the hpmi test data of 19 cores the porosity and permeability of class i reservoirs are greater than 6 and 1 md respectively and fractures and cavities are developed which are usually classified as high quality reservoirs the porosity of class ii reservoirs is between 4 and 6 the permeability is higher than 0 1 md and fractures are locally developed which are generally classified as potential reservoirs the porosity and permeability of class iii reservoirs are distributed in 2 4 and 0 01 0 1 md respectively large pore throats are developed and reservoir effectiveness is usually difficult to judge the porosity and permeability of class iv reservoirs are lower than 2 and 0 01 md respectively and microscopic pore throats are developed which are generally classified as invalid reservoirs the average capillary pressure curve of different classes of reservoirs could be obtained after the hpmi test data are processed by eqs 3 5 and then the rmin of each type of reservoir was calculated by the wall method the normalized capillary pressure curves and permeability contribution ratios of four types of cores are shown in fig 13 the relationship curves between r and i 1 n δ k i calculated by the wall method indicate that the rmin of class i class ii class iii and class iv reservoirs are 28 8 35 7 46 2 and 69 0 nm respectively when the i 1 n δ k i reaches 99 fig 14 subsequently the correlation between r and porosity could be determined by analyzing the hpmi test results fig 15 the fitting curve in the figure could be used for all four types of reservoirs because the influence of microfractures on porosity and r is extremely small substituting the rmin into the fitting equation in fig 15 the llpo of the class i ii iii and iv reservoirs are 1 82 2 00 2 24 and 2 68 respectively finally the maximum value of 2 68 was regarded as the llpo to meet the minimum gas storage capacity requirements of all classes of reservoirs the class iv reservoir is the low petrophysical property reservoir without fractures and therefore the llpe could be calculated as 0 039 md according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting equation in fig 10 class iv reservoirs should be classified as invalid reservoirs according to the evaluation standards of llpo and llpe consistent with the existing classification standard of carbonate reservoirs quality in sichuan basin the petrophysical properties of some class iii reservoirs are also lower than the llpp therefore the class iii reservoir can be subdivided into class iii1 reservoir and class iii2 reservoir to represent effective reservoir and invalid reservoir respectively 5 5 2 water film thickness method the key to establishing the relationship between wft and r is to obtain accurate interfacial tension and wetting angle the wettability of 26 carbonate cores in the target reservoir was analyzed by suspension drop method on the contact angle meter the results show that the distribution of wetting angle of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is relatively concentrated mainly distributed between 34 2 and 38 6 this indicates that the gas reservoir has strong hydrophilicity the average wetting angle of 36 27 was adopted for the calculation of the wft in addition the methane brine interfacial tension at high temperature and pressure was measured with an interfacial tensiometer which always decreases as the pressure and temperature increase the interfacial tension measured under the ultradeep reservoir conditions is 0 03873 n m in previous studies 100 nm is generally regarded as the wft adsorbed on the surface of hydrophilic rock however this value is not applicable to all types of hydrocarbon reservoirs because wft is affected by the pressure temperature and wettability of the reservoir therefore the critical wft suitable for gas accumulation and migration in the target reservoir should be determined the values of wetting angle and gas water interfacial tension were substituted into eq 11 to establish the relationship curve between r and wft under formation pressure fig 16 the figure shows that the wft first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally tends to stabilize as the r increases it should be noted that the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 this means that when the water film occupies 70 of the space in porous media an invalid reservoir will be formed therefore it is assumed that the reservoir space is a tubular channel and the water film is adsorbed on the channel wall the wft at the water saturation of 70 is 45 23 of the channel radius the curve of the ratio of wft to r is also shown in fig 16 the corresponding rmin is 60 02 nm when the ratio value is 45 23 then the rmin obtained by the water film thickness method was substituted into the fitting formula in fig 15 and the llpo obtained is 2 52 finally the llpe can be calculated as 0 032 md according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting formula in fig 10 5 6 gas well testing method the porosity permeability scatter diagram of tested layers in the target reservoir was established according to the reservoir petrophysical property analysis and test interpretation results fig 17 this figure only shows the data of gas and dry layers because these test layers avoid areas with high water content the test results also show that the water produced by gas wells is small and mainly pore water there is a small overlap between the petrophysical property region of gas layers and that of dry layers which makes it difficult to draw the boundary line directly on fig 17 therefore the distribution frequencies of gas and dry layers with different porosity and permeability ranges were calculated to obtain accurate critical porosity and permeability for dividing dry and gas layers fig 18 when the porosity is lower than 2 5 the gas well test results show that the proportion of dry layer is significantly greater than that of gas layer although taking this porosity value as the llpp can improve the calculation result of hydrocarbon reserves it will also increase the probability of misjudgment of gas reservoirs when the porosity is in the range of 2 5 3 0 the gas layer and dry layer each account for half and the maximum porosity of the dry layer in this range is 2 78 and the minimum porosity of the gas layer is 2 84 basically the test layer with permeability higher than 0 05 md could be interpreted as a gas layer therefore the llpo and llpe are 2 84 and 0 05 md respectively finally the dry layer and gas layer can be divided into two regions by marking the gas well testing analysis results on fig 17 note that the llpp obtained by this method are slightly higher than those obtained by static methods this is because the layers with relatively high petrophysical properties were selected preferentially on site so as to ensure the success rate of gas well testing resulting in relatively conservative large llpp determined by this method 5 7 productivity prediction model method the relationship between the predicted productivity and permeability of six gas wells according to the trinomial productivity prediction model is shown in table 1 more importantly the prediction results of the model are similar to the test results of gas wells table 2 summarizes the industrial hydrocarbon flow standard of china the lower limit of industrial hydrocarbon flow increases as the reservoir depth increases the lligf standard for reservoirs with depth greater than 4 0 km is 2 0 104 m3 d therefore the llpe is calculated as 0 046 md by substituting the lligf into the trinomial productivity model however the production stress sensitivity and non darcy flow considered in the productivity prediction model are parameters related to permeability therefore porosity is not reflected in the model to ensure that the reservoir with fractures also has a certain storage capacity the porosity of reservoirs without fractures under this permeability was taken as the lower limit therefore the llpo could be calculated as 2 81 according to the fitting formula of the porosity permeability relationship in fig 10 5 8 productivity simulation experiment method the relationship between gas well productivity and petrophysical properties was obtained through productivity simulation experiments under a pressure differential of 4 5 mpa fig 19 shows that the correlation between gas productivity and permeability is significantly better than that between gas productivity and porosity the daily gas production can reach lligf when the permeability is higher than 0 044 md therefore 0 044 md can be used as llpe and then llpo can be calculated as 2 78 according to the porosity permeability relationship fitting formula in fig 10 if the production pressure differential of 6 0 mpa is directly used as the experimental pressure differential the obtained llpe and llpo are 0 018 md and 2 03 respectively therefore the llpp obtained by the improved productivity simulation experiment method are relatively high which explains why the llpp determined by the conventional productivity simulation experiment method are optimistic low 6 discussion 6 1 effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp the heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs is the dominant reason for the inapplicability of conventional llpp determination methods and the difficulty in determining llpp while the development of cavities and fractures is the main factor causing reservoir heterogeneity it is necessary to reveal the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp the results of the cumulative frequency statistics method show that the llpo and the invalid sample proportion obtained using samples without cavities are basically unchanged compared to the conventional statistical method using all core samples as statistical objects this results indicates that the effect of cavities on llpo is minimal however the llpe and the invalid sample proportion obtained using samples without fractures are significantly lower than those obtained using all samples this outcome indicates that the effect of fractures on llpe is too great to be ignored this is because the permeability of cores with fractures is significantly greater than that of cores without fractures which leads to the former contributing most of the gas production capacity and thereby misjudging a large number of reservoirs without fractures as invalid reservoirs the fact is that some reservoirs without fractures still have certain development potential and economic productivity therefore the cumulative frequency statistics method could only be conducted after the ultradeep carbonate reservoir is reasonably classified core samples without fractures must be selected as the research object when determining the llpe and core samples without cavities could be selected as the research object when determining the llpo in addition the results of the porosity permeability relationship method and the irreducible water saturation method both indicate that the reservoir with fractures can be judged as an effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures the results of the gas well testing method show that some high porosity or high permeability layers were still interpreted as dry layers as illustrated in fig 17 these layers have the characteristics of high porosity but low permeability or low porosity but high permeability the petrophysical parameters of these layers cannot reach both llpo and llpe simultaneously in other words these layers cannot simultaneously meet the dual requirements of gas storage capacity and percolation capacity this is an important difference in determining the llpp of effective reservoirs between ultradeep carbonate reservoirs and conventional clastic rock reservoirs the results of the productivity simulation experiment method also indicate that gas productivity is not directly dependent on porosity some low porosity reservoirs still have high gas production but cannot maintain long term stable production while some high porosity reservoirs have significantly lower gas productivity than lligf therefore to eliminate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on llpp an effective reservoir of ultradeep carbonate rocks requires its permeability and porosity to reach llpe and llpo respectively 6 2 applicability of llpp determination methods multiple llpp values of the ultradeep carbonate reservoir were determined through various static and dynamic methods the results and applicability analysis of these methods are summarized in table 3 the static method is based on the assumption that an effective reservoir for hydrocarbon accumulation and migration can be formed the static data and related parameters used are collected from a large number of reservoirs with random petrophysical properties and the productivity of effective reservoirs is usually lower than the lligf therefore the llpp obtained by the static method are generally lower than those obtained by the dynamic method and could be used to evaluate the geological reserves the average value of llpo and llpe determined by static methods are 2 60 and 0 040 md respectively these values reflect that the gas in the reservoir with petrophysical properties lower than 2 60 and 0 040 md cannot effectively accumulate and migrate and these reservoirs should be excluded when calculating geological reserves by contrast the dynamic method is based on the assumption that industrial gas flow can be formed in the reservoir however most of the dynamic data and related parameters are collected from reservoirs with relatively high quality consequently the llpp obtained by dynamic methods are usually greater than the llpp of effective reservoirs which can be used not only to verify the rationality of the llpp obtained by the static method but also to evaluate the dynamic reserves the average value of llpo and llpe determined by dynamic methods are 2 81 and 0 047 md respectively which are slightly higher than the results of static methods these figures also reflect that the gas in reservoirs with porosity and permeability lower than 2 81 and 0 047 md cannot form industrial gas flow and so these reservoirs should be excluded when calculating dynamic reserves the llpp obtained by static methods and dynamic methods can also be put together to calculate the average value as the llpp of effective reservoir this average llpp can not only ensure the effective accumulation and migration of gas in the reservoir but also form gas productivity close to the industrial gas flow as well as balance the error caused by these two types of methods tang et al 2019 bai et al 2021 the llpp of the study area after averaging the values obtained by all methods are 2 68 and 0 042 md 6 3 application and verification of llpp the well logging and testing results of five newly drilled well sections were used as data to verify the correctness and applicability of the obtained llpp table 4 the verification results show that the logging permeability of well g103 and the logging porosity of well g16 are lower than the llpp the test production of well gs103 only reached 247 m3 d and dropped to 0 within a few days the test interval was dominated by the reservoir with poor petrophysical properties therefore the test results show that this well section does not form an effective reservoir and cannot produce industrial gas flow a small amount of gas produced by well gs103 only came from a very small range of effective areas near the wellbore by contrast the test production of well gs16 reached 4 63 104 m3 d significantly higher than the lligf nevertheless the numerical well test results indicate that the effective exploitation stage of this well section is only four months and the productivity decreases rapidly which reflects that the test well section of well gs16 is dominated by fracture type reservoirs with poor storage capacity therefore the reservoir in this well section was still classified as an invalid reservoir because although it has a certain gas production capacity in the short term it has not formed a certain scale of reserves furthermore the petrophysical parameters of the other three well sections are higher than the llpp showing good gas test results thereby verifying the accuracy of the obtained llpp and the applicability of the llpp determination method in this type of strongly heterogeneous gas reservoir 7 conclusions 1 the characteristics of diverse reservoir types and significant heterogeneity of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs greatly increase the difficulty of determining the llpp of effective reservoirs resulting in the poor application effect of conventional determination methods the llpp of effective reservoirs that allow gas accumulation and migration in the study area are 2 60 and 0 04 md which are determined by improved static methods including empirical cumulative frequency statistical porosity permeability relationship irreducible water saturation and minimum flow pore throat radius methods the llpp obtained by static methods were verified by improved dynamic methods including gas well testing productivity prediction model and productivity simulation experiment methods furthermore the llpp that can form industrial gas flow in the reservoir obtained by dynamic methods are 2 81 and 0 047 md 2 the determination of llpp by static methods is based on whether hydrocarbon can accumulate and migrate in the reservoir the empirical method is applicable to the initial stage of exploration lacking test and production data the application of cumulative frequency statistics method and porosity permeability relationship method in ultradeep carbonate reservoirs requires a reasonable classification of core types and a great number of petrophysical property data when determining the llpe cores without fractures must be selected as the statistical objects of these two methods the premise of using the irreducible water saturation method is that the swi data are sufficient and the classification criteria of gas and water layers in the target area should be taken as the critical swi limit to judge the effectiveness of the reservoir the rmin determination method can be conducted by hpmi test and wft calculation the former is applicable to reservoirs with sufficient hpmi data and reservoir quality classification criteria while the latter is applicable to reservoirs with accurate high pressure physical property of fluid and classification criteria of gas and water layers 3 the determination of llpp by dynamic methods is based on whether industrial gas flow can be formed the gas well testing method is applicable to the initial stage of reservoir exploitation with sufficient and accurate test results but the llpp obtained are relatively high because the layer with relatively high petrophysical properties is preferred for testing the productivity prediction model method needs to establish a productivity prediction model with strong adaptability and select accurate parameters when determining llpp the established trinomial productivity prediction model considering multiple factors is applicable to ultradeep carbonate gas reservoirs the productivity simulation experiment method is applicable to reservoirs with sufficient experimental data and clear production conditions however the similarity conversion of pressure differential should be conducted before the similarity conversion of gas productivity to eliminate the scale difference between core and reservoir 4 the results of static methods show that cavities in the carbonate reservoir have little influence on the llpo whereas the effect of fractures on the llpe is significant the reservoir with fractures could be regarded as the effective reservoir as long as its porosity reaches the llpo of the reservoir without fractures because the permeability of the former is obviously greater than that of the latter under the same porosity fractures can effectively connect various storage spaces and greatly reduce the residual water content but the effect of cavities on swi is small the gas in the reservoir has neither migration capacity nor accumulation potential when the swi is greater than 70 the rmin of the ultradeep carbonate reservoir obtained by hpmi test and wft is approximately 60 nm 5 the results of dynamic methods show that the effective reservoir of ultradeep carbonate rock needs to reach llpe and llpo simultaneously which is different from homogeneous clastic rock reservoirs with high porosity but low permeability or high permeability but low porosity are still interpreted as invalid reservoirs because they cannot meet the requirements of both storage and production capacities the correlation between porosity and gas production is weak although the production of some low porosity reservoirs is considerable the decay rate is fast by contrast the correlation between permeability and gas production is strong the llpp obtained by static methods and dynamic methods can be used to calculate geological reserves and dynamic reserves respectively the average value of several llpp obtained by the two types of methods 2 68 0 042 md can ensure that the gas can effectively accumulate and migrate and form a gas production close to industrial gas flow credit authorship contribution statement lu wang conceptualization
