size flow rate water content and is on fmps transport in saturated and unsaturated conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media and fmps suspension quartz sand unimin corporation unimin le sueur mn u s a was used to create the porous media which was firstly sieved into 0 75 0 85 mm coarse and 0 35 0 45 mm fine separately the sieved sand was washed with tap water to remove dust further cleaned by 20 nitric acid v v and deionized di water and then dried under 40 c for later use the zeta potentials of sand under different is conditions were determined via measuring the colloidal sand suspensions by the zetapals brookhaven instruments corporation usa the colloidal sand suspensions were prepared by sonicating the sand in each background solution for 5 min dong et al 2016 the polyethylene glycol terephthalate pet chips were used to prepare the fmps following the procedures in our previous studies dong et al 2021a 2021b to prepare the suspension the mixture of 10 mg fmps and 100 ml di water was sonicated for 1 h for dispersion the fmps concentration was selected in order to better visualize and demonstrate their motion and retention behaviors in porous media under various conditions according to our previous studies dong et al 2021b jiang et al 2021 nacl was used as the background electrolyte at three different concentrations 0 1 1 0 and 10 mm the ph of all suspensions and background solutions was adjusted to 5 6 via dilute hcl 10 mm or naoh 10 mm solution the fmps suspensions prepared under such is and ph conditions were stable dong et al 2021a the fmps concentration was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer d8 fila instrument co china at 245 nm the maximum absorption wavelength determined using the wavelength scanning zeta potential of the fmps was determined by zetapals the average diameter of the fmps was about 1 5 µm which was determined by a particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments u k 2 2 visualized flow cell experiments the real time pore scale visualization system including flow cell microscope and ccd microscope camera were employed to conduct the visualized flow cell experiments flow cell 10 cm length 3 cm height and 0 2 cm width comprised two quartz glass walls was used in this study which was vertical set for both the saturated and unsaturated experiments two pieces of stainless steel meshes 100 μm pore size were set at the inlet and outlet of the flow cell to distribute flow evenly for the unsaturated experiments four vent holes were drilled on both sides for the flow cell which were sealed with gas permeable ptfe membranes milliseal disk millipore for air exchange a microscope yj 2016 ningbo yujie optical instruments co ltd china coupled with a ccd microscope camera 41 megapixel ningbo yujie optical instruments co ltd china was used to observe the transport and retention patterns of fmps before each experiment the flow cell was tied onto the microscope stage and the microscope objective was adjusted to appropriately observe the moving and retaining behaviors of the fmps the videos and images were captured with the ccd microscope camera the peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump china was used to maintain steady state down flow 0 1 ml min 1 0 25 ml min 1 or 0 5 ml min 1 of the flow cell the fraction collector dbs 160 shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china was used to continuously collect the effluents from the outlet of the flow cell the sand 0 75 0 85 mm or 0 35 0 45 mm size was wet packed into the flow cell to build the saturated porous media two peristaltic pumps were connected to the inlet and outlet of the unsaturated flow cell to prepare the unsaturated porous media the flow cell was firstly drained by increasing the outflow rate by 5 compared to the inflow rate following the method in our previous study dong et al 2016 after reaching the target water content the two peristaltic pumps were equalized to the same flow rate before each experiment the flow cell was flushed with about 5 pore volumes pvs of di water and 10 pvs of background solution to reach hydrochemical equilibrium then about 3 pvs pulse of the fmps suspension was injected into the flow cell following with the injection of about 3 pvs background solution to flush out the free fmps the effluent concentrations were measured promptly via the uv vis spectrophotometer which was then normalized c c0 as the function of pvs to plot btcs the tracer tests under the specific grain size flow rate and water content conditions were applied following the procedures of dong et al 2016 fig s1 all the experimental conditions were summarized in table 1 2 3 numerical simulations and dlvo theory multiple numerical models have been successfully used to simulate the transport of micro nanoparticles in porous media katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 2019 simunek et al 2008 in this study the btcs of the fmps were fitted using a modified form of the advection dispersion equation cde with one site and first order kinetic expressions while simple this model has been commonly and successfully applied in various studies to advance the knowledge of micro nanoparticles transport in porous media dong et al 2021b jiang et al 2021 sun et al 2015 the details of the numerical simulations were detailed in supporting information s1 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the interaction energies between fmps and sand surface and fmps and air water interface the details of dlvo theory were shown in the supporting information s2 all the interaction energies were normalized by kt the product of boltzmann constant k and the absolute temperature t 3 results and discussion 3 1 the transport patterns of fmps in porous media the motion behaviors of fmps during transport in porous media were visualized in videos 1 3 i e in saturated coarse sand under 1 mm nacl at 0 25 ml min 1 and the schematics of transport patterns were provided in fig 1 the video observations demonstrated that the fmps can move freely along with the bulk flow in porous media but also move around the sand surfaces via three kinds of patterns including sliding video 1 rolling video 1 and saltating video 3 fig 1 the migration of suspended fmps was dominated by the bulk flow and the dispersivity of the suspended fmps may be affected by particle size chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the fmps density about 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 could approach the media surface via collision or attractive forces e g gravity and van der waals attraction and move due to hydrodynamic drag force of flow sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 according to bernoulli s theory the velocity difference between the top high velocity and bottom low velocity of the fmps leads to the uplift force lin and lin 2014 electrostatic repulsion and friction resistance also acted on the fmps moving on the sand surface in addition the fmps also could obtain the motion energy from turbulent flow in pore scale gruy 2012 hauns et al 2001 all the forces mentioned above showed combined effect on the moving process of fmps on the sand surface the tem observations showed the fractured edges and irregular shape of fmps as well as the cracks on the surface fig s2 the sem images showed wrinkles and pits on the quartz sand indicating the rough surface fig s3 when attractive forces and flow drag force were the main forces fmps could slide around the sand surfaces however the stress state of fmps may be variable due to the disorder of turbulent flow and the irregular shape of fmps resulting in the rolling of fmps on sand surface lazouskaya et al 2013 in addition the rugged sand surface and turbulent flow would result in the centrifugal force on fmps during the forward moving which may lead to the saltating of fmps during the moving process lee and hsu 1996 on the other hand the changing stress state also may lead to the exchange of suspended moving and surface moving of fmps fig 1 shape has also been found to be a significant factor in affecting the transport behaviors of micro nanoparticles xu et al 2008 revealed that the peanut shaped colloids adopted the preferred orientation during the transport process via tending the major axis to align with the local flow direction the dlvo energy profiles between fmps and sand surface showed strong primary energy barriers 2 40 103 kt for all the is conditions fig s4 indicating the unfavorable conditions for fmps deposition onto sand surface all the dlvo energy profiles between fmps and sand surface showed remarkable secondary minimum wells ranged around 5 1 10 2 kt at 10 mm table s1 implying the deposition of fmps into the secondary minima dong et al 2021b the videos showed that while some fmps were retained onto the sand surface under 10 mm is condition part of the fmps could also move along with the sand surface and exchanged with the suspended moving fmps video 4 when hydrodynamic drag force was greater than the resisting adhesive dlvo forces in the secondary minimum fmps possibly kept moving or detached from the sand surface bai et al 2018 this result indicated that deposition of fmps on sand surface was not instantaneous or inevitable during the collision process even under favorable conditions on the other hand the collision efficiency of the fmps onto sand surface may increase with the aspect ratio due to the reduced water contact angle salerno et al 2006 3 2 effect of grain size on fmps transport in saturated porous media as exhibited by btcs fig 2 a c the mobility of fmps decreased with the increasing is and the decreasing grain size in saturated porous media and the increasing is showed tiny further effect on the decreasing efficiency caused by grain size variation with the grain size decreasing from 0 75 0 85 mm to 0 35 0 45 mm the mass recovery percentage of fmps decreased from 66 7 to 56 8 under 0 1 mm is from 56 3 to 49 0 under 1 mm is and from 44 6 to 34 8 under 10 mm is table 1 zeta potentials of fmps and two kinds of used sands were all negative under the experimental conditions table s1 their zeta potentials became less negative with increasing is due to the compressed electrical double layer leading to the improved deposition of fmps as mentioned above the fmps may be trapped into the secondary minimum wells under 10 mm is condition according to the dlvo results fig s5 the selected micrograph also showed that compared to 0 1 mm is fig 2d more fmps were deposited on sand surface under 10 mm is condition fig 2e in this study the grain size showed a similar impact on fmps transport in the saturated porous media under unfavorable deposition conditions however grain size was found to have a more significant impact in reducing fmps mobility under favorable deposition condition 10 mm is when the grain size decreased from 0 75 0 85 mm to 0 35 0 45 mm the reduction rate of total mass recovery barely changed around 13 0 14 8 under 0 1 or 1 mm is conditions but remarkably increased to 22 0 under 10 mm is fig 2 f showed the deposition of fmps near the contact surface of sands video 5 also illustrated that the fmps deposited in slits generated by sand contact during the transport process porous media with finer sand has more slits and smaller pore throats fig s5 which were more effective to retain fmps under both favorable and unfavorable deposition conditions bai et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that the larger specific area of finer sand would provide more deposition sites for micro nanoparticles under the favorable deposition conditions and thus reduce their transport kamrani et al 2018 on the other hand the deposition of fmps also increased with the decreasing grain size due to the increasing mass transfer rate which inhibited transport sun et al 2015 in conclusion the fmps showed two retention patterns in saturated porous media 1 surface deposition and 2 straining numerical simulations well presented the breakthrough behaviors btcs of fmps in saturated porous media with r2 0 93 table 1 when the is was increased from 0 1 to 10 mm the fitted k increased from 0 043 to 0 085 min 1 for coarse sand and increased from 0 060 to 0 106 min 1 for fine sand table 1 the increasing tendency of k was corresponded to the experimental data implying the impacts of is and grain size on fmps transport in saturated porous media 3 3 effect of flow rate on fmps transport in saturated porous media flow rate showed various effects on fmps transport under different is conditions in saturated porous media fig 3 a c the increasing flow rate negligibly influenced the transport of fmps under 0 1 mm is as well as the mass recovery rate ranged from 65 8 to 67 5 when flow rate increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 table 1 in contrast mass recovery of fmps remarkably decreased from 55 0 to 35 3 with the flow rate increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 under 10 mm is table 1 compared to 0 5 ml min 1 video 6 the moving of fmps on sand surface obviously became slower at 0 1 ml min 1 flow rate video 7 due to the reduced drag force of the flow the slower moving improved the delay duration of fmps on sand surface which contributed to mps deposition under unfavorable is conditions and thus inhibited the transport in addition according to the reduction of the velocity difference between the top and bottom of fmps at low flow rate the uplift force on the fmps would decrease consequently lin and lin 2014 for this reason more fmps were dragged close to the sand surface at 0 1 ml min 1 fig 3d compared to 0 5 ml min 1 fig 3e which may improve the possibility of fmps deposition moreover hydrodynamic shear stresses could be increased with increasing flow rate which may promote the detachment of the deposited fmps under high is condition li et al 2019 similar to this study qi et al 2014 also found that flow rate had little effect on graphene oxide transport at relatively low is 10 mm nacl but was evident at high is 35 mm nacl which was attributed to the lack of effective deposition mechanisms under unfavorable conditions while increasing flow rate may promote the detachment of deposited fmps under 10 mm is most of the deposited fmps remained on sand surface at 0 5 ml min 1 flow rate fig 3f this result indicated the complicated interactions between the fmps and media which may not be simply elucidated with one theory for this reason dlvo theory alone has the limitation in predicting deposition mechanism of fmps on media under diversified chemical physical and even biological conditions the best fit values of k also were enhanced with the is conditions for the given flow rate table 1 for example k increased from 0 019 to 0 042 min 1 with is increased from 0 1 to 10 mm at 0 1 ml min 1 flow rate the model results also implied the significant effect of is on fmps transport in saturated porous media at various flow rate conditions 3 4 effect of saturation on fmps transport in porous media compared to the saturated porous media fig 2a c the mobility of fmps was decreased in unsaturated porous media fig 4 a c the mass recover rate of the fmps was ranged from 34 3 to 59 4 for coarse sand and ranged from 19 5 to 38 5 for fine sand in unsaturated porous media which were all lower than that in saturated porous media under the same other conditions table 1 the dlvo energy profiles between the fmps and air water interface showed quiet high energy barriers without the presence of secondary energy minimum under all the is conditions fig s6 demonstrating the unfavorable conditions for fmps deposition corresponding to the dlvo results most of the fmps suspended in flow would not deposit onto the air water interface even under 10 mm is but remain moving with flow video 8 in this study rare fmps were found to overcome the energy barriers and be captured with the air water interface fig 4d which partly increased their retention possibility in unsaturated porous media the captured fmps kept reciprocating moving along with the fluctuation of air bubble video 9 capillary force and interfacial tension were considered as the major forces accounting for the retention of fmps at the air water interface sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 previous studies found that the air water interface showed different effects on micro nano particle deposition sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 demonstrated that ps microspheres could be attracted and accumulated at the air water interface via collision or attractive forces on the contrary liu et al 2013 found graphene oxide did not attach to the air water interface during the transport process on the other hand the introduction of air bubbles increased the number of slits and small pores in unsaturated porous media which may improve the straining of fmps and thus inhibited transport bai et al 2018 to sum up the fmps had three kinds of retention patterns in unsaturated 1 deposited onto media surface 2 strained by slits and small pores and 3 captured by air water interface fig 4e the is and grain size showed a more significant effect on the transport of fmps in unsaturated porous media fig 2a c the decrease of mass recovery with increasing is or decreasing grain size also was more obviously in unsaturated porous media table 1 due to the flow region for pore water reduced with the presence of air bubbles more fmps were dragged closely to the sand surface which improved the deposition under high is condition 10 mm fine sand usually has smaller pore throat than coarse sand resulting in more slits and small pores with the presence of air bubble fig s7 as mentioned above the straining efficiency would be more significant with the decreasing grain size in unsaturated porous media with increasing is from 0 1 to 10 mm the fitted k increased from 0 077 to 0 166 min 1 for coarse sand and increased from 0 144 to 0 241 min 1 for fine sand table 1 implying the increased deposition fmps transport in unsaturated porous media the simulations well described the btcs of fmps in unsaturated porous media with r 2 higher than 0 90 table 1 nonetheless the used one site kinetic deposition model has some limitations particularly with respect to the description of the transport patterns i e sliding rolling and saltating of the dense micro nano particles in porous media the analytical formulations developed by katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 contributed to account for the transport of dense colloids in porous media future effort should be devoted to better simulating the transport patterns of micro nano particles 4 conclusion this is the first study to investigate the transport and retention patterns of fragmental microplastics fmps in saturated and unsaturated porous media on pore scale the real time pore scale visualization system was employed to visualize the moving and retaining behaviors of fmps the fmps showed suspended moving and surface moving during the transport process and the interchange occurred between these two patterns in particular the fmps moved on the sand surface via sliding rolling and saltating even under unfavorable deposition conditions the fmps can retain in porous media via different patterns in saturated and unsaturated porous media such as deposition straining and air water interface capturing the various transport and retention patterns controlled the transport process of fmps in porous media the transport of fmps decreased with the increasing is decreasing grain size and water content in porous media the deposition of fmps increased with the increasing is and the straining was enhanced with the decreasing grain size and water content the moving rate of the fmps was decreased at the low flow rate leading to the increased deposition at favorable is conditions the impacts of is and grain size on fmps transport were more remarkable in unsaturated porous media while the one site kinetic deposition model well described the transported behaviors of the fmps in porous media the complicated transport and retention patterns of fmps on pore scale implied the limitation of one site kinetic deposition models in addition it was insufficient to predict the deposition mechanism of fmps on media only via dlvo theory under complex environmental conditions the visualization technique employed in this study can be used to eliminate the limitations of commonly used black box methodology furthering our current knowledge of the environmental behaviors of microplastics with diverse

objective was adjusted to appropriately observe the moving and retaining behaviors of the fmps the videos and images were captured with the ccd microscope camera the peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump china was used to maintain steady state down flow 0 1 ml min 1 0 25 ml min 1 or 0 5 ml min 1 of the flow cell the fraction collector dbs 160 shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china was used to continuously collect the effluents from the outlet of the flow cell the sand 0 75 0 85 mm or 0 35 0 45 mm size was wet packed into the flow cell to build the saturated porous media two peristaltic pumps were connected to the inlet and outlet of the unsaturated flow cell to prepare the unsaturated porous media the flow cell was firstly drained by increasing the outflow rate by 5 compared to the inflow rate following the method in our previous study dong et al 2016 after reaching the target water content the two peristaltic pumps were equalized to the same flow rate before each experiment the flow cell was flushed with about 5 pore volumes pvs of di water and 10 pvs of background solution to reach hydrochemical equilibrium then about 3 pvs pulse of the fmps suspension was injected into the flow cell following with the injection of about 3 pvs background solution to flush out the free fmps the effluent concentrations were measured promptly via the uv vis spectrophotometer which was then normalized c c0 as the function of pvs to plot btcs the tracer tests under the specific grain size flow rate and water content conditions were applied following the procedures of dong et al 2016 fig s1 all the experimental conditions were summarized in table 1 2 3 numerical simulations and dlvo theory multiple numerical models have been successfully used to simulate the transport of micro nanoparticles in porous media katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 2019 simunek et al 2008 in this study the btcs of the fmps were fitted using a modified form of the advection dispersion equation cde with one site and first order kinetic expressions while simple this model has been commonly and successfully applied in various studies to advance the knowledge of micro nanoparticles transport in porous media dong et al 2021b jiang et al 2021 sun et al 2015 the details of the numerical simulations were detailed in supporting information s1 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the interaction energies between fmps and sand surface and fmps and air water interface the details of dlvo theory were shown in the supporting information s2 all the interaction energies were normalized by kt the product of boltzmann constant k and the absolute temperature t 3 results and discussion 3 1 the transport patterns of fmps in porous media the motion behaviors of fmps during transport in porous media were visualized in videos 1 3 i e in saturated coarse sand under 1 mm nacl at 0 25 ml min 1 and the schematics of transport patterns were provided in fig 1 the video observations demonstrated that the fmps can move freely along with the bulk flow in porous media but also move around the sand surfaces via three kinds of patterns including sliding video 1 rolling video 1 and saltating video 3 fig 1 the migration of suspended fmps was dominated by the bulk flow and the dispersivity of the suspended fmps may be affected by particle size chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 the fmps density about 1 3 1 4 g cm 3 could approach the media surface via collision or attractive forces e g gravity and van der waals attraction and move due to hydrodynamic drag force of flow sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 according to bernoulli s theory the velocity difference between the top high velocity and bottom low velocity of the fmps leads to the uplift force lin and lin 2014 electrostatic repulsion and friction resistance also acted on the fmps moving on the sand surface in addition the fmps also could obtain the motion energy from turbulent flow in pore scale gruy 2012 hauns et al 2001 all the forces mentioned above showed combined effect on the moving process of fmps on the sand surface the tem observations showed the fractured edges and irregular shape of fmps as well as the cracks on the surface fig s2 the sem images showed wrinkles and pits on the quartz sand indicating the rough surface fig s3 when attractive forces and flow drag force were the main forces fmps could slide around the sand surfaces however the stress state of fmps may be variable due to the disorder of turbulent flow and the irregular shape of fmps resulting in the rolling of fmps on sand surface lazouskaya et al 2013 in addition the rugged sand surface and turbulent flow would result in the centrifugal force on fmps during the forward moving which may lead to the saltating of fmps during the moving process lee and hsu 1996 on the other hand the changing stress state also may lead to the exchange of suspended moving and surface moving of fmps fig 1 shape has also been found to be a significant factor in affecting the transport behaviors of micro nanoparticles xu et al 2008 revealed that the peanut shaped colloids adopted the preferred orientation during the transport process via tending the major axis to align with the local flow direction the dlvo energy profiles between fmps and sand surface showed strong primary energy barriers 2 40 103 kt for all the is conditions fig s4 indicating the unfavorable conditions for fmps deposition onto sand surface all the dlvo energy profiles between fmps and sand surface showed remarkable secondary minimum wells ranged around 5 1 10 2 kt at 10 mm table s1 implying the deposition of fmps into the secondary minima dong et al 2021b the videos showed that while some fmps were retained onto the sand surface under 10 mm is condition part of the fmps could also move along with the sand surface and exchanged with the suspended moving fmps video 4 when hydrodynamic drag force was greater than the resisting adhesive dlvo forces in the secondary minimum fmps possibly kept moving or detached from the sand surface bai et al 2018 this result indicated that deposition of fmps on sand surface was not instantaneous or inevitable during the collision process even under favorable conditions on the other hand the collision efficiency of the fmps onto sand surface may increase with the aspect ratio due to the reduced water contact angle salerno et al 2006 3 2 effect of grain size on fmps transport in saturated porous media as exhibited by btcs fig 2 a c the mobility of fmps decreased with the increasing is and the decreasing grain size in saturated porous media and the increasing is showed tiny further effect on the decreasing efficiency caused by grain size variation with the grain size decreasing from 0 75 0 85 mm to 0 35 0 45 mm the mass recovery percentage of fmps decreased from 66 7 to 56 8 under 0 1 mm is from 56 3 to 49 0 under 1 mm is and from 44 6 to 34 8 under 10 mm is table 1 zeta potentials of fmps and two kinds of used sands were all negative under the experimental conditions table s1 their zeta potentials became less negative with increasing is due to the compressed electrical double layer leading to the improved deposition of fmps as mentioned above the fmps may be trapped into the secondary minimum wells under 10 mm is condition according to the dlvo results fig s5 the selected micrograph also showed that compared to 0 1 mm is fig 2d more fmps were deposited on sand surface under 10 mm is condition fig 2e in this study the grain size showed a similar impact on fmps transport in the saturated porous media under unfavorable deposition conditions however grain size was found to have a more significant impact in reducing fmps mobility under favorable deposition condition 10 mm is when the grain size decreased from 0 75 0 85 mm to 0 35 0 45 mm the reduction rate of total mass recovery barely changed around 13 0 14 8 under 0 1 or 1 mm is conditions but remarkably increased to 22 0 under 10 mm is fig 2 f showed the deposition of fmps near the contact surface of sands video 5 also illustrated that the fmps deposited in slits generated by sand contact during the transport process porous media with finer sand has more slits and smaller pore throats fig s5 which were more effective to retain fmps under both favorable and unfavorable deposition conditions bai et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that the larger specific area of finer sand would provide more deposition sites for micro nanoparticles under the favorable deposition conditions and thus reduce their transport kamrani et al 2018 on the other hand the deposition of fmps also increased with the decreasing grain size due to the increasing mass transfer rate which inhibited transport sun et al 2015 in conclusion the fmps showed two retention patterns in saturated porous media 1 surface deposition and 2 straining numerical simulations well presented the breakthrough behaviors btcs of fmps in saturated porous media with r2 0 93 table 1 when the is was increased from 0 1 to 10 mm the fitted k increased from 0 043 to 0 085 min 1 for coarse sand and increased from 0 060 to 0 106 min 1 for fine sand table 1 the increasing tendency of k was corresponded to the experimental data implying the impacts of is and grain size on fmps transport in saturated porous media 3 3 effect of flow rate on fmps transport in saturated porous media flow rate showed various effects on fmps transport under different is conditions in saturated porous media fig 3 a c the increasing flow rate negligibly influenced the transport of fmps under 0 1 mm is as well as the mass recovery rate ranged from 65 8 to 67 5 when flow rate increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 table 1 in contrast mass recovery of fmps remarkably decreased from 55 0 to 35 3 with the flow rate increased from 0 1 to 0 5 ml min 1 under 10 mm is table 1 compared to 0 5 ml min 1 video 6 the moving of fmps on sand surface obviously became slower at 0 1 ml min 1 flow rate video 7 due to the reduced drag force of the flow the slower moving improved the delay duration of fmps on sand surface which contributed to mps deposition under unfavorable is conditions and thus inhibited the transport in addition according to the reduction of the velocity difference between the top and bottom of fmps at low flow rate the uplift force on the fmps would decrease consequently lin and lin 2014 for this reason more fmps were dragged close to the sand surface at 0 1 ml min 1 fig 3d compared to 0 5 ml min 1 fig 3e which may improve the possibility of fmps deposition moreover hydrodynamic shear stresses could be increased with increasing flow rate which may promote the detachment of the deposited fmps under high is condition li et al 2019 similar to this study qi et al 2014 also found that flow rate had little effect on graphene oxide transport at relatively low is 10 mm nacl but was evident at high is 35 mm nacl which was attributed to the lack of effective deposition mechanisms under unfavorable conditions while increasing flow rate may promote the detachment of deposited fmps under 10 mm is most of the deposited fmps remained on sand surface at 0 5 ml min 1 flow rate fig 3f this result indicated the complicated interactions between the fmps and media which may not be simply elucidated with one theory for this reason dlvo theory alone has the limitation in predicting deposition mechanism of fmps on media under diversified chemical physical and even biological conditions the best fit values of k also were enhanced with the is conditions for the given flow rate table 1 for example k increased from 0 019 to 0 042 min 1 with is increased from 0 1 to 10 mm at 0 1 ml min 1 flow rate the model results also implied the significant effect of is on fmps transport in saturated porous media at various flow rate conditions 3 4 effect of saturation on fmps transport in porous media compared to the saturated porous media fig 2a c the mobility of fmps was decreased in unsaturated porous media fig 4 a c the mass recover rate of the fmps was ranged from 34 3 to 59 4 for coarse sand and ranged from 19 5 to 38 5 for fine sand in unsaturated porous media which were all lower than that in saturated porous media under the same other conditions table 1 the dlvo energy profiles between the fmps and air water interface showed quiet high energy barriers without the presence of secondary energy minimum under all the is conditions fig s6 demonstrating the unfavorable conditions for fmps deposition corresponding to the dlvo results most of the fmps suspended in flow would not deposit onto the air water interface even under 10 mm is but remain moving with flow video 8 in this study rare fmps were found to overcome the energy barriers and be captured with the air water interface fig 4d which partly increased their retention possibility in unsaturated porous media the captured fmps kept reciprocating moving along with the fluctuation of air bubble video 9 capillary force and interfacial tension were considered as the major forces accounting for the retention of fmps at the air water interface sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 previous studies found that the air water interface showed different effects on micro nano particle deposition sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 demonstrated that ps microspheres could be attracted and accumulated at the air water interface via collision or attractive forces on the contrary liu et al 2013 found graphene oxide did not attach to the air water interface during the transport process on the other hand the introduction of air bubbles increased the number of slits and small pores in unsaturated porous media which may improve the straining of fmps and thus inhibited transport bai et al 2018 to sum up the fmps had three kinds of retention patterns in unsaturated 1 deposited onto media surface 2 strained by slits and small pores and 3 captured by air water interface fig 4e the is and grain size showed a more significant effect on the transport of fmps in unsaturated porous media fig 2a c the decrease of mass recovery with increasing is or decreasing grain size also was more obviously in unsaturated porous media table 1 due to the flow region for pore water reduced with the presence of air bubbles more fmps were dragged closely to the sand surface which improved the deposition under high is condition 10 mm fine sand usually has smaller pore throat than coarse sand resulting in more slits and small pores with the presence of air bubble fig s7 as mentioned above the straining efficiency would be more significant with the decreasing grain size in unsaturated porous media with increasing is from 0 1 to 10 mm the fitted k increased from 0 077 to 0 166 min 1 for coarse sand and increased from 0 144 to 0 241 min 1 for fine sand table 1 implying the increased deposition fmps transport in unsaturated porous media the simulations well described the btcs of fmps in unsaturated porous media with r 2 higher than 0 90 table 1 nonetheless the used one site kinetic deposition model has some limitations particularly with respect to the description of the transport patterns i e sliding rolling and saltating of the dense micro nano particles in porous media the analytical formulations developed by katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 contributed to account for the transport of dense colloids in porous media future effort should be devoted to better simulating the transport patterns of micro nano particles 4 conclusion this is the first study to investigate the transport and retention patterns of fragmental microplastics fmps in saturated and unsaturated porous media on pore scale the real time pore scale visualization system was employed to visualize the moving and retaining behaviors of fmps the fmps showed suspended moving and surface moving during the transport process and the interchange occurred between these two patterns in particular the fmps moved on the sand surface via sliding rolling and saltating even under unfavorable deposition conditions the fmps can retain in porous media via different patterns in saturated and unsaturated porous media such as deposition straining and air water interface capturing the various transport and retention patterns controlled the transport process of fmps in porous media the transport of fmps decreased with the increasing is decreasing grain size and water content in porous media the deposition of fmps increased with the increasing is and the straining was enhanced with the decreasing grain size and water content the moving rate of the fmps was decreased at the low flow rate leading to the increased deposition at favorable is conditions the impacts of is and grain size on fmps transport were more remarkable in unsaturated porous media while the one site kinetic deposition model well described the transported behaviors of the fmps in porous media the complicated transport and retention patterns of fmps on pore scale implied the limitation of one site kinetic deposition models in addition it was insufficient to predict the deposition mechanism of fmps on media only via dlvo theory under complex environmental conditions the visualization technique employed in this study can be used to eliminate the limitations of commonly used black box methodology furthering our current knowledge of the environmental behaviors of microplastics with diverse

plate reactors operated in sequential batch mode ppb biofilm was recovered from reactor walls at a total solid ts content 90 g l 1 and the harvested biomass depending on the wastewater had a consistent quality with high protein contents 50 65 and low ash potentially applicable as scp the cod n and p removal efficiencies were 71 5 3 22 6 6 65 5 6 for pww and 78 1 8 67 2 7 and 37 4 0 for cww respectively with biofilm areal productivities up to 14 g ts m 2 d 1 this was achieved at ammonium n concentrations over 1 0 g l 1 and temperatures up to 55 c and down to 6 c daily fluctuations of 20 30 c the removal performances and biomass productivities were mostly dependent on the bioavailable cod in the form of volatile fatty acids vfa at sufficient vfa availability the irradiance became limiting capping biofilm formation harvesting of the suspended fraction resulted in increased productivities and recovery efficiencies but lowered the product quality e g containing undesired inerts the optimum between quantity and quality of product is dependent on the wastewater characteristics i e organic degradable fraction and potential pre treatment this study shows the potential to utilise sunlight to treat agri industrial wastewaters while generating protein rich ppb biomass to be used as a feed feed additive or feed supplement keywords purple phototrophic bacteria wastewater photobioreactor resource recovery agri industrial 1 introduction intensive animal farming and processing generates large volumes of wastewater with very high nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon loads requiring intensive treatment for example in australia up to 550 million chicken are processed in abattoirs annually producing on average 12 l wastewater per bird chainetr et al 2020 this offers a huge recovery potential of resources e g around 20 000 1650 200 tonnes of cod tn and tp from chicken processing in australia alone even greater considering that there is a general trend of centralisation of animal processing activities in addition to abattoirs processing intensive centralised animal rearing also generates large amounts of manure which also contains substantial amounts of resources that can potentially be recovered orner et al 2021 potter et al 2010 the recovery of organics nitrogen and phosphorus from these waste streams via established technologies such as anaerobic digestion ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation is a common practice applied worldwide mehta et al 2015 however these technologies generate low value products e g biogas and fertilisers such as ammonium sulphate and struvite and are hence challenged economically in this context the biological up concentration of soluble organics and nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorous via assimilative and or accumulative partitioning is receiving increased attention batstone et al 2015 the transformation of resources in the wastewater into single cell protein scp and or biological fertiliser could be a major step towards minimising resource losses in a circular economy when grown in wastewater microorganisms can partition up to 100 of organics and nutrients into microbial protein rich biomass this is particularly applicable for phototrophic mediators such as microalgae or purple phototrophic bacteria ppb hülsen et al 2016b matassa et al 2015 shi et al 2007 phototrophic organisms can assimilate organics ammonia and phosphate using light as energy source rather than organics which minimises carbon and nutrient dissipation e g as co2 or n2 when scp is generated in a

et al 2021b delamare deboutteville et al 2019 however besides obvious regulatory health and safety concerns largely depending on the wastewater source and the production process there are several other barriers preventing widespread scp generation from wastewater for phototrophs these include economic constraints high total ammonia n concentrations 1 0 g l 1 with high ph resulting in high free

is partly caused by low biomass concentrations e g 0 35 and 2 g l 1 in open and closed photobioreactors pbrs respectively jorquera et al 2010 especially in open ponds these challenges reduce the volumetric and areal productivities brennan and owende 2010 davis et al 2011 jorquera et al 2010 recent developments in the field of mixed culture ppb might offer solutions for some of the barriers encountered in phototrophic systems ppb are photoheterotrophs utilising light in the infra red ir spectrum for atp generation and organic carbon as anabolic substrate they offer the potential for shortened hydraulic retention times hrt due to faster growth rates than microalgae and for combined secondary and tertiary treatment due to the simultaneous removal of organics and nutrients hülsen et al 2018b the technological feasibility of this approach has been proven at laboratory scale under artificial illumination both using batch reactors hülsen et al 2018a marín et al 2019 continuous pbrs sepúlveda muñoz et al 2020 and raceways ponds alloul et al 2021a the utilisation of native organics as carbon source avoids issues with co2 addition which is limiting for microalgae and is commonly added park and craggs 2010 ppb have also been reported to grow at low light intensities dalaei et al 2020 adapt to low temperatures hülsen et al 2016a and maintain dominance under non axenic conditions i e no sterile influent media hülsen et al 2016a altogether these capabilities can provide some independence from varying environmental conditions e g light intensity and availability and temperature infra red ir driven anoxygenic photosynthesis by ppb as opposed to oxygenic photosynthesis driven by ultraviolet visible uv vis light under anaerobic conditions allows effective enrichment and further eliminates common aerobic grazers the high organic content of industrial wastewater tolerance of ppb towards ammonia puyol et al 2020 and ability to use outdoor systems make ppb a good potential match for agri industrial wastewaters illumination has been previously identified as the critical cost factor effectively prohibiting economic ppb wastewater treatment systems capson tojo et al 2020 particularly for industrial systems with higher organic loads using sunlight filtered or natural as energy source appears as a straight forward solution to reduce production costs however outdoor studies utilising sunlight are scarce and none of the research performed to date has dealt with real wastewater mixed ppb cultures or biofilms adessi et al 2012 carlozzi et al 2010 carlozzi et al 2006 carlozzi and sacchi 2001 consequently the results from these studies cannot be directly extrapolated to real wastewater treatment systems which are non sterile and require an enriched robust non axenic ppb culture and sufficient biomass retention capson tojo et al 2020 the use of non sterile inputs and the requirement to use natural light introduce the need to consider interactions and competitions between ppb and other microbes including other phototrophs e g microalgae and cyanobacteria using real wastewater as substrate will also impact the harvested biomass quality and its application as feed e g as supplement additive for aquaculture where the potential applicability of ppb biomass as aqua feed has already been demonstrated banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 delamare deboutteville et al 2019 loo et al 2013 to retain and concentrate biomass photo anaerobic membrane bioreactors have been effectively used for both microalgae and ppb based processes hülsen et

to use biofilm based reactors where phototrophic biomass is retained as biofilm attached onto an illuminated surface e g reactor walls biofilm based systems also enable the exclusion of undesired wastewater components e g inert compounds which enhances the quality of the produced biomass hülsen et al 2020 this approach can also facilitate biomass harvesting this step known to be particularly challenging in microalgae based systems accounting for over 30 of the total production costs is often done via centrifugation flocculation or filtration kadir et al 2018 in a biofilm reactor biomass can be directly harvested from the walls potentially reducing costs and achieving biomass concentrations of 10 dm hülsen et al 2020 here we applied mixed ppb cultures in outdoor flat plate photobioreactors fppbrs for growth and resource recovery from piggery pww and chicken processing wastewaters cww in two separate tests the experiments using piggery wastewater were followed by those using chicken processing wastewater over a period of 1 5 years the systems were run in sequential batch mode at two different locations to assess the impacts of varying outdoor conditions e g day night cycles of sunlight and temperature on the wastewater treatment and resource recovery performance biofilm formation and the microbial community the effects of filtered ir vs non filtered sunlight full spectrum were also studied and compared the attached and suspended biomass characteristics and its consistency were assessed in view of their potential application as scp or fertilisers 2 materials and methods the piggery pww and chicken wastewater cww tests are two different sets of experiments separated in space and time the pww tests took place first and were followed months later by the cww tests utilising the same equipment with minor modifications the pww test served as a basis to expand and confirm the observed behaviours treating cww which makes the presented results complementary rather than strictly comparable the experiments were accompanied by several uncontrollable factors including varying light intensities and temperatures but also other non weather dependant factors which complicated the comparison of data sets the wastewaters were different cww contained fats proteins and high contents of organic matter while pww was almost fully degraded in the pit containing much less bioavailable organic matter nevertheless the objective was not to test the influence of these variables over ppb growth and performance under perfectly controlled conditions but rather to prove the technical feasibility of an outdoors larger scale ppb system able to withstand natural weather and thus working conditions variations 2 1 piggery wastewater pww pww from a piggery located in queensland australia was used to feed the pbrs the selected piggery is an intensive indoor pig farm using pressurised town water fed via valves in the bottom of the pit the pig confinement area contains slotted floors and a shallow static pit underfoot where the piggery waste accumulates before it is pumped into the wastewater treatment pond system a portion of sediments is removed bi or tri monthly during the operational period the pits were completely flushed on january 9th day 73 prior to batch 7 and march 16th of 2018 day 139 batch 11 which drastically affected the wastewater compositions the wastewater for this study was taken directly from the grower shed pit pumped into a 1000 l intermediate bulk container ibc and pre settled for 30 min before being used as reactor influent the pre settled wastewater contained on average 4130 1560 mg tcod l 1 total chemical oxygen demand 1590 610 mg scod l 1 soluble chemical oxygen demand 1160 284 mg tkn l 1 total kjeldahl nitrogen 160 68 mg tp l 1 total phosphorous 2420 1340 mg tss l 1 total suspended solids and 1880 325 mg vss l 1 volatile suspended solids numbers in brackets are standard deviations the detailed characteristics of the wastewater can be found in supplementary materials table s1 particularly after pit flushes the vfa and scod concentrations in pww were low see table 1 in some of these periods glacial acetic acid was added to certain wastewater batches as stated in table 1 to determine the maximum removal rates and nutrient removal efficiencies without vfa limitations 2 2 meat chicken processing wastewater cww wastewater from a meat chicken processing facility in brisbane australia was used the pbrs were installed on site pumping the wastewater directly from its source grit trap effluent when needed the raw wastewater was a mixture of water streams resulting from feather removal bird degutting and general cleaning water on average the wastewater contained 3332 418 mg tcod l 1 1614 260 mg scod l 1 189 30 mg tkn l 1 39 13 mg tp l 1 2713 430 mg ts l 1 and 1799 279 mg vs l 1 the detailed characteristics of the wastewater can be found in supplementary materials table s1 2 3 purple phototrophic bacteria inoculum no external inoculum was used at either site ppbs were directly enriched from either pre settled piggery wastewater or chicken processing wastewater 2 4 flat plate photobioreactor fppbr set up for the experiments with pww the set up consisted of six custom made acrylic fppbr operated in parallel secured at the base by custom stands three different dimensions were used 2 reactors with a total volume of 100 l 1 1 0 1 m 2 of 80 l 1 1 0 08 m and 2 of 60 l 1 1 0 06 m each reactor had a wall thickness of 0 015 m and had a detachable lid to cover the top the lids were fastened via six metal clamps but were not gas tight the illuminated reactor wall surface area was 0 85 m2 per wall 1 7 m2 per pbr as some illuminated area was lost due to the reactor stands resulting in 17 21 and 28 illuminated m2 m 3 for the 100 80 and 60 l reactors respectively mixing was provided by intermittent recirculation pulse pause 30 30 min of the reactor content from a port in the centre of the reactor to four ports at the reactor bottom all with a diameter of 1 inch mixing occurred only during daytime between 05 00 18 00 working a total of 6 5 h d 1 or 9750 l d 1 24 kwh m 3 d 1 we note this constitutes excessive mixing and requires optimisation this was carried out by the centrifuge pump p 2 fig 1 p 1 and p 2 were 25 l min 1 mono pumps 0 37 kw cp00251c1r8c nov australia pty ltd the 100 l and an 80 l fppbrs described above were later used for the tests with cww in these experiments a small flow was diverted from the mixing line to the top of the reactor where it was sprayed through a perforated tube to disperse floating fat see dotted tube in fig 1 a similar pumping system was used to feed the reactors with pww the reactors were placed in open fields available at the piggery and the chicken abattoir and were illuminated naturally with sunlight under natural light dark cycles with or without being covered with uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 lee filter absorbing over 90 of wavelengths below 790 nm depending on the desired illumination conditions table 1 and table 2 the reactors stood vertically without inclination with the illuminated surfaces facing the east west plane for both set ups thus maximising light availability the dissolved oxygen do concentrations temperatures and ph in the reactors were monitored continuously 2 5 reactor operation 2 5 1 piggery wastewater pww reactor operation six fppbrs were installed and operated on site between october 2017 and april 2018 the operation was divided into 3 phases the controllable parameters were reactor volume mixing batch length and vfa availability where vfa availability via external acetic acid addition varied from phase 1 to 3 and batch lengths was shortened during phase 3 mixing and reactor volume remained constant the impact of these changes which were characterised by varying batch lengths and by acetic acid addition as well as by natural variations in the temperature and received irradiance were assessed to test ppb biofilm attachment the impact of the reactor width on attachment treatment performance and the biofilm characteristics phases 1 oct dec and 2 jan mar took place during spring and summer months vfa content was varied while phase 3 took place during autumn months apr may batch length and vfa was increased this is further detailed in table 1 the reactors were operated in sequential batches with batch lengths between 4 5 6 6 d resulting in an average organic loading rate olr of 0 71 0 12 g cod l 1 d 1 at the start of the batch t0 each reactor was filled with pww from the ibc usually between 3 and 4 pm 30 volume of reactor content from the previous batch was re added to the tank as ppb inoculum at the end of each batch the reactor liquid was drained collecting the 30 required for the next batch and the attached biofilm was removed from the reactor walls by manual upward scraping with a 30 cm squeegee the collected biomass i e biofilm was weighed and put on ice for transport before storage in a freezer at 4 c inoculum and fresh pww were then re introduced in the fppbrs to start the next batch

total solids ts and volatile solids vs in the harvested biomass were analysed at tend amino acid and pigment contents of the wet biomass were also analysed at various time points 2 5 2 chicken processing wastewater cww reactor operation two fppbrs one of 100 l and another of 80 l were installed and operated on site between march 2019 and december 2019 to confirm the biofilm attachment and characteristics as well as the impact on the treatment performance for the cww tests higher degradable cod concentrations were tested and batches started with shorter batch length as determined in the pww tests which changed the feeding regime the reactors were fed twice per week with batch cycles of 3 4 d average cycle length of 3 5 0 6 d resulting in an average olr of 0 94 0 23 g cod l 1 d 1 a total of 61 batch cycles were run with the 100 l reactor the 80 l reactor was run for 26 batches during this time a period of full light spectrum illumination was studied in the 100 l reactor by removing the uv vis absorbing foil from batches 13 to 37 see table 2 this allowed to study the influence of full light illumination on the performance and stability of a ppb enriched system during this period the 80 l reactor was kept as ir illuminated control we note the reactor volume and the illuminated surface to volume ratio differed by 20 the batch inoculation and reactor restart occurred as described in section 2 5 1 the produced biofilm was collected via vacuum from the walls using a 1250 w 20 l wet vacuum with a stainless steel collection drum ozito for each batch samples of the raw wastewater initial suspended phase final biofilm and final suspended phase were collected for analysis in addition two detailed follow up studies were carried out in batches 33 and 53 taking samples every 3 4 h during the whole batch duration this allowed to study the kinetics of the process and to assess the fluctuations during day night cycles 2 6 analytical methods tcod and scod nh4 n nox n

bacteriochlorophyll bchl contents of the harvested biomass were determined as described in delamare deboutteville et al 2019 and hülsen et al 2020 for the pww tests irradiance and temperature data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology webpage for the university of queensland gatton station 2 3 km away from the reactor location the brisbane port control station located 3 0 km away from the cww industrial site was used to get the irradiance values for these experiments 2 7 microbial analysis microbial samples were harvested from the reactor liquid or directly from the

analysis was performed following hülsen et al 2018b 2 8 data processing and statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the software r 3 5 0 2019 when the distributions of the presented values were normal verified with shapiro wilk tests and the homogeneities of variance were confirmed using bartlett s tests anova tests were used to assess significant differences applying post hoc tukey hsd tests for comparisons otherwise non parametric tests were applied using a kruskal wallis test and dunn s tests for pairwise comparisons a significance threshold of p 0 05 was applied the same software was also used to determine correlations and linear regressions between variables this analysis was performed using the results from the experiments with cww as the amount of data generated was sufficient the package corrplot was used to create correlation matrices the boxplots provide the values for the lowest datum within 1 5 iqr interquartile range of the first quartile the first quartile the median the third quartile and the highest datum within 1 5 iqr of the third quartile values below and above the lowest and highest data used for the boxplots were considered as

biofilm formation without inoculum and mixing ppb growth had fully covered the walls after 25 d this demonstrates selection and enrichment of native ppb from high n concentration pww nh4 n 1000 mg l 1 as well as slow light driven attached biofilm formation thickness 2 4 mm fig 2 a with mixing biofilm formation and enrichment of ppb from pww was reduced to 6 days indicating the relevance of substrate supply and the possibility of fast start up as previously reported for suspended ppb cultures hülsen et al 2018a the same was observed for cww fig 2b where start up with mixing occurred in 6 days forming thick purple biofilm on the inner reactor walls fig 2c 3 2 wastewater treatment performance 3 2 1 piggery wastewater cod n p removals and biomass productivities the attached biofilm formation of ppb and the associated tcod tn and tp removals were impacted by cod bioavailability particularly vfa and light supply shading both limiting the maximum achievable removal rates this was observed in the 80 l and 100 l pbrs with different surface volume ratios but similar organic and nutrient removal efficiencies p 0 24 and 0 19 over the periods see fig 3 an overall increase in performance cod n and p removals efficiencies from phase 1 to 3 coincided with increased in vfa content naturally and due to acetic acid addition in the wastewater fig 3a d both pbrs slightly increased the tcod removals at increased vfa concentrations while the scod removal doubled to around 40 during phase 2 this was also observed for the 60 l unit which however removed less tcod and scod with substantial fluctuations during phase 1 24 5 12 and 10 1 10 8 and phase 2 30 33 and 41 65 similarly a shortening of the batch lengths from 6 6 d to 4 5 d in phase 3 did not impact the cod removal efficiencies indicating that the vfa cod availability rather than batch length determined the removal performances in the reactors naturally improved scod assimilation resulted in increased n and p uptake due to the high solid contents in pww particulate tkn tp cod and ts concentrations of 260 372 90 70 2540 1675 and 2420 1340 mg l 1 respectively release of soluble species and their uptake occurred simultaneously particulate tkn and tp was mobilised as nh4 n and po4 3 p while both species were also assimilated therefore tn and tp removal efficiencies are provided rather than ammonia phosphate removal efficiency the ph in the 100 l reactor at tfinal similar for the 80 l reactor decreased from phase 1 to 3 phase 1 8 1 0 23 phase 2 7 7 0 28 and phase 3 7 0 0 32 but remained above the critical lower ph of 6 0 for ppb puyol et al 2020 with increased vfa cod concentrations and shorter batch lengths during phase 3 the attached ppb biofilm formation as areal productivities also increased the tfinal vfa cod excess during this phase further indicated oversupply fig 3b d as well as light limitations results from phase 3 under non limited vfa cod conditions give an indication of the capacity of the system with cod removal rates up to 0 52 and 0 45 g cod l 1 d 1 for the 100 l and the 80 l pbrs respectively peak areal productivities reached 13 and 8 5 g ts m 2 d 1 or 9 5 and 6 2 g vs m 2 d 1 in the 100 l and 80 l pbrs these values are comparable to attached productivities achieved in continuous artificial illumination studies and on synthetic wastewater delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 the enhanced performance of the 100 l over the 80 l reactor can be attributed to the higher reactor volume which increased the cod availability per illuminated surface unit the results indicate that the performance was not impacted by high ammonium concentrations peak global horizontal irradiance batch length and reactor temperature ppb were enriched at ammonium concentrations over 1 0 g nh4 n l 1 250 mg l 1 of free ammonia at ph 8 2 and 45 c and maintained the performance throughout phase 1 without any effect on ppb growth and biofilm formation noting that productivity was limited by vfa availability this indicates an adaptation to high nh4 n concentrations as opposed to a culture of non adapted ppb where a 5 fold decrease in specific activity was observed at 1300 mgnh4 n l 1 relative to 100 500 mg l 1 puyol et al 2020 regarding temperatures the ppb culture routinely withstood liquid temperatures higher than 50 c up to 55 c in phases 2 and 3 during summer and autumn during the night the temperatures decreased to 20 c resulting in day night temperature fluctuations between 20 and 30 c in the liquid as shown in figure s1a and figure s2 the resistance of ppb to high temperatures and wide daily variations implies that cooling considerations and related equipment can very likely be omitted in ppb reactors opposed to algal systems the areal productivities in both fppbrs increased despite a decrease in average peak global horizontal irradiances over the phases phase 1 23 8 mj m 2 phase 2 20 5 mj m 2 and phase 3 16 9 mj m 2 respectively this confirmed that vfa cod availability was the limiting factor as previously reported hülsen et al 2016b until there is an excess of available cod which makes light supply rate limiting in terms of reactor design the results indicate that 100 mm wide flat plate reactors modules 100 l 50 mm of average light path considering illumination from both sides can be used effectively to produce ppb biomass e g highest peak productivity and reduce the number of required reactor modules due to an increased reactor volume by 20 and 40 comparing the 100 l with the 80 l and 60 l pbrs with widths of 80 and 60 mm which is desirable for wastewater treatment applications this does not necessarily translate into capital savings but implies that the mixing energy can be considerably reduced as the same recycle flow rate was used for the 100 l 80 l and 60 l reactors in fact at 60 mm reactor width 60 l pbr the excessive shear due to mixing was counterproductive for biofilm formation substantially lowering the attached areal productivities in the 60 l fppbr average of 2 0 0 7 g ts m 2 d 1 by 25 and 43 compared to the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs see figure s3 albeit an increased illuminated surface to volume ratio we note that the mixing cost has to be reduced substantially to achieve feasible full scale applications this might also enable the use of 60 mm wide fppbrs which however is less desirable for wastewater treatment applications due to the volume 3 2 2 chicken processing wastewater cod n p removals and biomass productivities the treatment performance of the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs treating cww wastewater improved moderately compared to the pww tests the tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies in the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs treating cww were on average 45 2 5 26 2 7 and 20 2 9 respectively fig 4 a c compared to tcod tn and tp removals of 18 5 3 7 6 0 1 9 23 5 6 4 in the pww tests as for pww the removal performance in the 80 l and 100 l fppbr treating cww were not significantly different p values 0 57 the performances actually were slightly improved in the 100 l reactor although not statistically significant due to high deviations this confirms the benefit in increasing reactor width to 100 mm to increase the volume by 20 this was confirmed during phase 1 where both fppbrs were illuminated with filtered sunlight ir spectra and achieved similar performances batches 1 12 p values 0 23 the similarity persisted after removing the uv vis absorbing foil for 86 days batches 13 37 from the 100 l reactor using the 80 l as ir control p values 0 23 this suggests that the removal performances can be maintained when full spectrum sunlight is used as energy source see section 3 2 2 1 for detailed cycle studies albeit a 20 volume increase and a 20 illuminated surface to volume ratio decrease however green colour indicating the presence of chlorophylls from cyanobacteria and microalgae developed over the course of phase 2 in the 100 l fppbr starting after 2 weeks see figure s4a b despite the intense green coloration ppb were still present in considerable proportions in the reactors see section 3 4 microalgae might have acted as biological vis light filter causing a layered biofilm structure only visual evidence and mutualistic commensalistic relationships between ppb and algae e g algae consuming co2 produced by ppb light measurements were not possible due to absence of submergible ir vis sensors see figure s4a c for a scheme of the proposed layered biofilm as for the pww wastewater tests vfa cod appeared to be limiting in the cww tests the t0 vfa cod concentrations were generally below 100 mg l 1 with tfinal concentrations below 50 mg l 1 fig 4b d the main difference in these experiments is that cww was more biodegradable than pww and while containing similar amounts of solids 2 7 0 4 g ts l 1 and 1 8 0 3 g vs l 1 hydrolysable fats and proteins were mobilised in situ in the reactor over the batch period as opposed to pww anaerobically stored for weeks in the pit and still low on vfas as the cww was directly fed in the fppbrs the released vfa cod was not measured but it likely provided a constant source of bioavailable cod where hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis was performed by an established anaerobic consortium formed by pbb and anaerobic hydrolysers fermenters see section 3 4 for a more detailed discussion of the microbial communities the higher cod availability with cww is also suggested by the attached areal productivities which were comparable or higher than those from the pww tests with acetic acid addition in phase 3 fig 4b d and higher than those achieved in vfa limited phases 1 and 2 of the pww tests over the course of the experiment the average attached biofilm and suspended biomass productivities differed significantly between the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs p 0 0006 the 80 l reactor only phase 1 generated on average 5 7 0 9 g vs m 2 d 1 and 11 1 4 g vs m 2 d 1 for attached and suspended biomass while the 100 l reactor produced 8 7 1 2 g vs m 2 d 1 and 14 1 7 g vs m 2 d 1 phases 1 3 interestingly the productivities were similar during phase 2 batches 13 37 when the uv vis absorbing foil was removed from the 100 l reactor p values 0 1 during this phase the productivities decreased in both reactors which was probably related to decreasing solar irradiances winter started in cycle 16 fig 4b d this was further underlined by an increase of the attached productivities during phase 3 in the 100 l when the irradiance increased again due to seasonal changes see table 2 figures s1 and s2 correlation analysis of inputs and performance metrics could be done across the 80 cycles for this number of observations a pearson correlation of 0 27 represents a weakly significant relationship p 0 05 0 34 a significant relationship p 0 01 and 0 4 a strong relationship p 0 001 the corresponding correlation matrix is shown in fig 5 for the cycle length d this variable was negatively correlated with the olr by definition considering constant influent composition and with the productivities suspended and total removal efficiencies were not correlated with the cycle length or the olr which indicates that the batch duration could have been further reduced allowing for a higher substrate load in agreement with this the biomass productivities suspended attached and total were positively correlated with the olr indicating that higher values can be achieved by simply increasing the substrate load the irradiance and the temperature were also correlated as both depend on the weather conditions and the incident sunlight more importantly the irradiance was positively correlated with the scod removal the tcod removal and the attached productivity indicating that it had a significant effect on both ppb growth and biofilm attachment this suggests that light limited biofilm formation which would imply the occurrence of a light driven biofilm instead of the common shear driven considerations we reported similar observations in earlier works hülsen et al 2020 to identify if the correlation between temperature irradiance and productivity was due to thermal effects or irradiance a separate correlation analysis due to lower number of data available n 30 using the reactor liquid temperature was performed this identified that removal efficiencies and productivities were not correlated with liquid temperature ρ 0 2 and hence irradiance was the primary factor low temperatures have been previously identified as not substantially influencing the viability ppb enriched cultures hülsen et al 2016a generally temperature fluctuations are expected to impose additional selection pressures across the microbial community in outdoor environments selecting for temperature resilient microbes considering the minimum and maximum liquid temperatures during the treatment period ranging between 6 0 c night during winter and 47 c daytime during summer see figure s1b the results confirm the resilience of ppb to temperature fluctuations as described for the pww tests other than being positively correlated to the olr both the attached and suspended productivities were correlated with the removal efficiencies in the case of the attached productivity a positive correlation was found with the tcod and scod removal efficiencies which is logical as the removal in the system occurred due to biomass growth and attachment the suspended productivities were negatively correlated to the removal efficiencies tcod tn and tp this might be partly due to biofilm formation and subsequent reduced light penetration but mainly due to the dependence of total removal and biofilm attachment this implies that other than biomass growth the removal efficiencies were limited by biomass attachment i e light attenuation due to the biofilm in other words more suspended biomass implied less attachment and lower removal efficiencies without biomass recovery further research should focus on maximizing biofilm formation which appears to be limited by light 3 2 2 1 day night cycle studies to study the kinetics of the process and to assess the fluctuations during day night cycles three sequential day night periods were studied in detail in cycles 33 and 53 both were done to evaluate and compare the kinetics under filtered and non filtered illumination only the study starting in cycle 33 is shown here cycle 53 is provided in figure s5 the 80 l reactor served as uv vis filtered control while the 100 l reactor was illuminated with full spectrum unfiltered light the results are presented in fig 6 the behaviour of both reactors was similar p 0 05 both reactors were impacted by the day night cycles during the day scod mainly in the form of vfas was consumed by ppb leading to an increase in the ph and a concomitant tn and tp drop assimilation of nh4 n and po4 3 p the maximum scod removal rates were 810 and 880 mg cod l 1 d 1 for the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs the scod tn tp ratios over the course of the batch were 100 5 0 6 and 100 7 5 1 1 for the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs respectively which are well in line with those from the literature capson tojo et al 2020 during the night phototrophic activity ceased due to the lack of light and vfas were produced by fermentative bacteria and to some extent also by ppb leading to a ph drop and a decrease in the scod uptake rates or even mobilisation fig 6c f we note that continuous day and night cod mobilisation likely took place resulting in continued vfa mobilisation and immediate uptake by ppb during the day which also resulted in continuous scod removal over the batch length the tcod removal rates mostly due to biomass attachment and fermentative losses varied substantially fig 6c f over time despite the high variability the scod and tcod removal rates suggest that scod removal was mainly caused by assimilation and subsequent biomass attachment to the walls the daytime tcod removal rates serve as indicative rates of biomass attachment a lower tcod removal rate during the night is indicative of the rates of fermentative cod removal and residual biomass attachment nevertheless ppb consumed these compounds at a far higher rate during daytime this mix of anaerobic fermenters and ppb as dominant clades is consistent with the identified microbial communities see section 3 4 the illumination with full spectrum light and the presence of microalgae did not significantly affect the removal kinetics nor the ph trend in the 100 l reactor when compared to the 80 l reactor acting as control pbr illuminated with filtered light in addition the do concentrations were always below detection limits in both systems indicating that the oxygen produced by microalgae was consumed immediately by facultative aerobes or ppb this also agrees with the microbial data showing that aerobes appeared in small proportions in the 100 l reactor e g pseudomonas sp on average 0 5 relative abundance during this period section 3 4 this further excludes an effect of the spraying system on the presence of oxygen the reason for the final tn and tp decreases in the 100 l days 2 4 3 0 is unknown but chemoautotrophic removal can be excluded as nox n was not found in the system 3 2 3 resource recovery potential and biomass characteristics from pww and cww the results indicate that in both cases resources could be effectively recovered but was substrate vfa limited in the case of pww and illumination limited in the case of cww recovery of cod tn and tp in the pww could be improved by acetate addition in phase 3 in this phase the 100 l pbr recovered around 30 of the total cod and 75 of removed cod as attached ppb biofilm fig 7 a this shows that bioavailable cod can be effectively partitioned from the bulk liquid into the biofilm at the same time the tn and tp recovery naturally increased with increasing cod recovery but remained below 15 and 40 of the total tn and tp respectively fig 7c tn is particularly low due to the high n influent concentration this acts as a guide for the ideal substrate choice optimal cod n p ratios and identifies the need to preferment high nitrogen particulate wastewaters the cod n and p recovery data for each batch in the 100 l and 80 l pbrs are shown in figure s6 and s7 for the cww tests the average total cod recovery was 30 40 similar to phase 3 from the pww test not vfa limited fig 7b the recovery efficiencies based on removed cod were also similar the tn and tp recoveries were around 40 and 20 consistent over the phases the scod recovery based on harvested ppb biomass i e biofilm was between 68 and 88 and 132 180 based on removed cod the latter confirming consistent scod release from particulate organics and non measured uptake the attached recoveries account only for the harvested biofilm excluding the separation retention harvesting of the suspended fraction harvesting the suspended fraction would drastically improve the recovery efficiencies and would be suitable for wastewaters with low native solids concentrations the increased recovery efficiencies when also harvesting the suspended fraction are obvious when looking at the attached and total biomass productivities in the reactors fed with cww increasing from 10 g ts m 2 d 1 attached to over 30 g ts m 2 d 1 total attached and suspended figure s8 the biomass characteristics of the ppb biofilm harvested from the pww and the cww are shown in fig 8 ppb biofilm from the pww was harvested at average ts and vs contents of 99 5 1 g l 1 and 71 4 0 g l 1 resulting in an ash content of around 30 dm dry matter the ts vs and ash contents of the harvested ppb biofilm varied significantly over time p 0 05 the main reasons for that were the varying ts vs ratios 0 77 0 45 in the wastewater and the harvesting procedure after draining the reactor particulates remained at the bottom when harvesting the biofilm this remaining layer had to be avoided manually as it contained high amounts of ash especially for pww it is possible that we occasionally harvested fractions of that layer which might explain some of the variations the variations in the ts and vs contents also contributed significantly varying cp tn tp and heavy metal contents p 0 05 the elemental composition of the dried and wet ppb biomass is presented in table s2 which shows copper and zinc contents of 917 134 and 825 109 mg kg ts 1 in the dried biomass overall consistent biomass quality of the biofilm was not achieved over time and the zn and cu contents would only enable restricted agricultural use in australia government 2018 despite the high ash and heavy metal contents the cp and amino acid contents of 670 27 mg g vs 1 and 497 g kg vs 1 were high and well in range with reported literature values hülsen et al 2018a kobayashi et al 1995 ponsano et al 2004 shipman et al 1975 see table s3 for the amino acid profiles of the harvested biofilms the harvested biomass further contained 8 7 2 7 mgcarotenoids g vs 1 and 19 5 6 0 mgbchl g vs 1 which was higher compared to the pigment contents in the suspended biomass 5 0 3 5 mgcarotenoids g vs 1 and 10 7 4 6 mgbchl g vs 1 confirming the ppb up concentration in the biofilm the relatively high concentrations of carotenoids and bchl in the harvested biofilm of 618 192 and 1385 426 mg l 1 show potential for pigment production in a fppbr in general overall the pigment contents are well in line with those from mixed ppb culture biofilms in indoor artificially illuminated pbrs delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 and on the higher end of reported suspended carotenoid and bchl ranges capson tojo et al 2020 for the cww test the harvested ppb biomass showed a much better and more consistent quality mainly due to the lower mineral solid contents in the wastewater the biofilm was harvested at average ts and vs contents of 88 3 6 g l 1 and 81 3 5 g l 1 respectively consistent with the pww biofilm however the ash contents were 8 0 dm substantially lower than in the pww trials and practically constant over the experiment this also applies to the cp contents 0 5 g gdry 1 for 70 of the data as shown in fig 8 a crucial advantage of the biofilm based system is the high vs content in the biofilm when compared to the suspended biomass fraction average values of 0 91 0 92 vs 0 50 0 53 g gdry 1 the high vs content in the biofilm might enable the application as high value added product particularly if already clean streams are used as influents hülsen et al 2020 this is not possible with the recovered suspended biomass i e via centrifugation at least not for the here tested wastewaters ash contents would be 50 overall the attached biofilm productivities in the here described system are comparable to average yearly productivities in algal ponds and closed pbrs 6 8 3 0 and 9 3 2 0 g vs m 2 d 1 richardson et al 2014 volumetric productivities in our ppb system are higher compared to algal raceway ponds 0 035 g ts l 1 d 1 but similar to algal flat plate and potentially tubular pbrs 0 27 and 0 56 g ts l 1 d 1 jorquera et al 2010 and also in line with other published works apel et al 2017 arbib et al 2017 eustance et al 2016 jorquera et al 2010 lee et al 2014 min et al 2014 slade and bauen 2013 tang and hu 2016 we note that the values for annual averages have to be confirmed with long term ppb system operations no available data in literature yet in comparison with attached productivities in algal biofilm systems 1 3 7 6 g ts m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 gross et al 2015 johnson and wen 2010 the areal productivities achieved with ppb are on the higher end of the reported range 3 3 microbial analysis of cww and pww tests the microbial analyses confirmed the presence of a dominant ppb communities in the attached biofilm for pww and cww tests fig 9 the main ppb genus in the pww tests were rhodopseudomonas sp up to 57 and blastochloris sp up to 11 while the cww was dominated by rhodobacter sp up to 27 and rhodopseudomonas sp up to 28 a direct link to the wastewater cannot be made and it seems more likely that the extended batch length in the pww trials lead to the dominance of rhodopseudomonas sp this species has been found to dominate at long solid retention times srts in continuous reactors alloul et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 for the pww tests the consistent presence of rhodopseudomonas sp in the attached biofilm and the suspension indicates its ability to adjust to prolonged exposure to thermophilic conditions while comfortably switching to mesophilic conditions while garcía et al 2019 observed a steady decline of this genus when treating pww in an open pbr lab scale indoors our results indicate that rhodopseudomonas sp seems well suited for outdoor applications the presence of ppb in the suspended phase clearly shows the potential to improve the productivities when also harvesting this fraction fig 9b this agrees with the pigment contents in the attached and suspended biomass vector plots and principal component analyses did not show sample clustering or significant microbial shifts over time data not shown the flanking communities involved a mixture of common phyla in anaerobic digesters as expected for an anaerobically digested influent the vfa degrading firmicutes e g clostridia ruminococcaceae bacteroidetes e g anaerobic fermenter porphyromonadaceae euryarchaeota synergistetes etc these fermenters likely acted in a synergetic relationship with ppb generating the vfas to be consumed by the latter on their side ppb avoided ph drops and product induced thermodynamic inhibitions for the cww tests the microbial analysis confirmed a dominant ppb culture in the harvested biofilm suspension also had purple colour but was not analysed the relative abundance of ppb in the 80 l and 100 l reactors ranged between 15 and 46 and 27 63 with rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp as predominant genera in agreement with the decrease in biomass productivities the abundance of ppb decreased during the periods of lower irradiance samples from batches 17 33 interestingly while at the end of this period the ppb abundance in the 80 l reactor increased to 44 cycle 33 this was not observed in the 100 l reactor this is a consequence of the continuous decrease in ppb abundance that could be observed during the period illuminated with full spectrum sunlight as shown in fig 9a the ppb abundance decreased from 63 to 26 while this decrease can be partially related to the lower irradiances lower light availability cannot explain by itself why the proportion did not increase at the end of the winter period as in cycle 33 in the 80 l reactor and more importantly it cannot explain why the ppb abundance increased to 48 after only 2 batches when the uv vis filter was placed again on the reactor see fig 9a it is also striking that the dominant ppb genera changed from batch 33 to 35 from a mix of rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp to allochromatium sp in batch 50 this dominance changed back to rhodopseudomonas sp and it can be expected that the previous distribution would establish itself is the coming batches it can thus be concluded that the change from filtered to full spectrum light resulted in lower ppb abundances this was likely caused by a progressive out competition of ppb by microalgae as uv vis light was made available e g due to small amounts of oxygen which might lead to ppb outcompetition by aerobes capson tojo et al 2021 we exclude an effect of the surface spraying as this was done for both reactors over the course of the cww tests surprisingly for the authors the results of the microbial analysis did not show the increase in microalgae abundance the primer sets used for amplification cover over 91 of the members in the phylum chlorophyta most common microalgae species and have been previously used in similar studies hülsen et al 2018b so this was totally unexpected nevertheless the intense green colour in the 100 l reactor at the end of the period illuminated with full sunlight clearly showed that microalgae were present in the pbr in considerable proportions figure s4 3 4 significance for industrial application this study shows the technical feasibility of mixed ppb cultures in outdoor fppbrs to treat two completely different complex wastewaters under real conditions cod tn and tp were removed via biofilm attachment achieving removal efficiencies of up to 50 30 and 30 respectively these removals could be realised in a flow through cell e g plug flow without additional biomass retention this might enable shorter hrts and result in biomass attachment while suspended biomass is washed out a fraction of the resources could be recovered as ppb biofilm while reducing the discharge costs e g when discharging to the sewer this would save both capital and operational costs e g no membranes needed but would minimise the overall removal and recovery assuming a retention step allowing the harvesting of suspended biomass such as membrane filtration e g 0 45 µm hülsen et al 2016b or centrifugation the removal efficiencies of tcod tn and tp could be increased to 71 78 22 67 and 37 65 it is important to consider that ppb do not remove total cod tn and tp but merely assimilate soluble components into biomass a harvesting step would consequently increase the areal productivities from 10 attached to over 30 g ts m 2 d 1 total or 0 6 g ts m 3 d 1 however a large fraction would not necessarily be ppb biomass especially for wastewaters such as the ones tested here with high solid contents the lower quality biomass from the suspended fraction could be used as fertiliser but not for scp applications as the ash content would be around 50 and the heavy metals contents would limit its application especially for pww while the quality of the attached biomass i e biofilm can be consistent over time with high cp contents over 50 its harvesting would require an automated system which would add complexity and costs however this might be justified to enable consistent product quality in high value added applications such as scp for fishmeal substitution in fish or prawn feed alloul et al 2021b delamare deboutteville et al 2019 which currently sells at 1400 usd tonne 1 alternatively improved product consistency and protein contents in a suspended or hybrid system could be achieved via a combination of wastewater pre fermentation and solids separation using off the shelf technologies e g via dissolved air flotation it is clear that an optimised ppb process requires vfas and constant vfa availability will also increase the ppb abundance relative to in situ fermentation comparison of the pww vs cww operation emphasises that this technology best fits readily degradable or fermented wastewaters food processing including meat processing is a ready target particularly in combination of pre fermentation production wastewater with a significant manure component is less optimal but ppb could have a role in a combined system where organic acids are produced in a leach bed and ppb produced in a liquid side stream bayrakdar et al 2018 minimising solids in the feed would also enhance the quality of the suspended fraction depending on the local legislation food grade substrates might be required to consider any application as scp in feed which e g in european union depends on the category of the feed material eu 2002 also see regulation ec no 429 2008 application of wastewater derived biological material especially for feed is not a straightforward process and requires a carefully considered legislative framework smedley 2013 dedicated wastewater pretreatment might enable continuous operation during the day rather than batch operation likely with shorter hrts e g 1 d during 12 h as previously reported in lab reactors hülsen et al 2016a hülsen et al 2016b hülsen et al 2018b in combination with biomass retention and continuous harvesting this would enable srt control and potentially improve volumetric removals the goal for future research should be continuous operation however the here reported cod removal rates of around 0 8 0 9 g cod l 1 d 1 are likely to be close to the theoretical possible rates assuming day night cycles and outdoor conditions in sunny brisbane australia at given design parameters biofilm 5 cm light path 10 cm width 20 illuminated m2 m 3 we expect a suspended system to realise higher rates due to reduced shading on the walls over time the inherently higher recovery efficiencies and biomass productivities are another major advantage of suspended processes another major conclusion from this study is the general robustness of the ppb pbrs ppb withstood temperature and light variations seemingly unaffected while light in the subtropical brisbane australia is favourable this also leads to system overheating during hot weather e g in summer with regular temperature peaks over 50 c we can conclude that cooling would not be required to maintain a functioning ppb culture this is a major advantage compared to microalgae systems that have been reported to collapse around these temperatures mata et al 2010 tredici and materassi 1992 this removes a major barrier to adoption by eliminating significant capital and operational costs and water consumption previously associated with algae pbr systems béchet et al 2010 schenk et al 2008 temperatures ranging between 6 0 c and 55 c throughout the year did not have an observable effect on the performance this robustness also to low temperatures was previously shown in lab scale studies hülsen et al 2016a and are now confirmed in outdoor systems the process robustness is further underlined by the fact that we did not rely on process controls the reactors were deliberately left open to atmosphere which saves costs in a potential full scale plant as opposed to ponds the surface for air diffusion is very small in fppbrs which reduces the oxygen transfer also considering high cod concentrations this is highly relevant for a stable functioning ppb community capson tojo et al 2021 in this context the attenuation of ir light as opposed to vis light is also different due to the increased absorption of ir wavelengths by water light attenuation in ppb cultures requires further research to determine the optimal light path at given biomass concentrations besides the batch operation at relatively long hrts the main operating costs of this system are the mixing energy the biomass harvesting and dewatering and the lack of light during night time complicating continuous operation low cost mixing has to be realised focussing either on the reduction of the liquid recycle ratio e g via nozzles or on the implementation of static impellers or similar with recirculating liquid mixing ppb production is prohibitively expensive we note that low energy mechanical mixing solutions exist but need to be optimised for narrow long and tall reactor systems an automated harvesting system is also required and manual harvesting is excessively labour intensive even in countries where costs are low the dewatering of the harvested biofilm is a lesser issue but any harvesting of the suspended biomass will encounter problems similar to microalgae systems research using outdoors reactors has to focus on these aspects applying reasonable sized pbrs 4 conclusions three reactor sizes 60 80 and 100 l were operated in aggregate over 1 5 years on piggery production pww and chicken wastewater cww with a goal of resource recovery as biofilm and demonstration using natural light outdoors and at relevant scale the system could be operated stably on both wastewaters in temperature ranges from 6 c 50 c and with daily fluctuations of 20 c 30 c performance was limited generally by availability of vfas with light being less of a limitation therefore performance was generally better on the cww feed which had a higher degradability the larger 100 l reactor generally performed best with the 60 l reactor performing poorly due to a lower volumetric capacity and to intense mixing biofilm could be recovered at a high solids concentration 90 g ts kg 1 and had a much lower ash and protein content 50 but the majority of biomass remained in suspension and had poorer properties particularly for pww this means that a ppb system is better suited to highly degradable feeds and or combination with

16196,resource recovery from wastewater preferably as high value products has become an integral part of modern wastewater treatment this work presents the potential to produce single cell protein scp from pre settled piggery wastewater pww and meat chicken processing wastewater cww utilising anaerobic purple phototrophic bacteria ppb ppb were grown as biofilm in outdoors 60 l 80 l and 100 l flat plate reactors operated in sequential batch mode ppb biofilm was recovered from reactor walls at a total solid ts content 90 g l 1 and the harvested biomass depending on the wastewater had a consistent quality with high protein contents 50 65 and low ash potentially applicable as scp the cod n and p removal efficiencies were 71 5 3 22 6 6 65 5 6 for pww and 78 1 8 67 2 7 and 37 4 0 for cww respectively with biofilm areal productivities up to 14 g ts m 2 d 1 this was achieved at ammonium n concentrations over 1 0 g l 1 and temperatures up to 55 c and down to 6 c daily fluctuations of 20 30 c the removal performances and biomass productivities were mostly dependent on the bioavailable cod in the form of volatile fatty acids vfa at sufficient vfa availability the irradiance became limiting capping biofilm formation harvesting of the suspended fraction resulted in increased productivities and recovery efficiencies but lowered the product quality e g containing undesired inerts the optimum between quantity and quality of product is dependent on the wastewater characteristics i e organic degradable fraction and potential pre treatment this study shows the potential to utilise sunlight to treat agri industrial wastewaters while generating protein rich ppb biomass to be used as a feed feed additive or feed supplement keywords purple phototrophic bacteria wastewater photobioreactor resource recovery agri industrial 1 introduction intensive animal farming and processing generates large volumes of wastewater with very high nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon loads requiring intensive treatment for example in australia up to 550 million chicken are processed in abattoirs annually producing on average 12 l wastewater per bird chainetr et al 2020 this offers a huge recovery potential of resources e g around 20 000 1650 200 tonnes of cod tn and tp from chicken processing in australia alone even greater considering that there is a general trend of centralisation of animal processing activities in addition to abattoirs processing intensive centralised animal rearing also generates large amounts of manure which also contains substantial amounts of resources that can potentially be recovered orner et al 2021 potter et al 2010 the recovery of organics nitrogen and phosphorus from these waste streams via established technologies such as anaerobic digestion ammonia stripping and struvite precipitation is a common practice applied worldwide mehta et al 2015 however these technologies generate low value products e g biogas and fertilisers such as ammonium sulphate and struvite and are hence challenged economically in this context the biological up concentration of soluble organics and nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorous via assimilative and or accumulative partitioning is receiving increased attention batstone et al 2015 the transformation of resources in the wastewater into single cell protein scp and or biological fertiliser could be a major step towards minimising resource losses in a circular economy when grown in wastewater microorganisms can partition up to 100 of organics and nutrients into microbial protein rich biomass this is particularly applicable for phototrophic mediators such as microalgae or purple phototrophic bacteria ppb hülsen et al 2016b matassa et al 2015 shi et al 2007 phototrophic organisms can assimilate organics ammonia and phosphate using light as energy source rather than organics which minimises carbon and nutrient dissipation e g as co2 or n2 when scp is generated in a closed intensive animal production facility e g pig farms or an abattoir it can be used to effectively recycle nutrients in the form of protein rich biomass this can substantially increase whole system feed conversion ratios while enhancing on farm profitability through reduced discharge costs and the creation of additional revenue streams e g fishmeal substitution in aquaculture feeds alloul et al 2021b delamare deboutteville et al 2019 however besides obvious regulatory health and safety concerns largely depending on the wastewater source and the production process there are several other barriers preventing widespread scp generation from wastewater for phototrophs these include economic constraints high total ammonia n concentrations 1 0 g l 1 with high ph resulting in high free

and economic feasibility is further impacted by i seasonal weather variations e g dilution during rain period evaporation during hot weather resulting in increased salinity high or low temperatures and illumination ii by natural day night cycles kumar et al 2015 iii by microbial contamination e g grazers and iv by high biomass harvesting costs alabi et al 2009 molina grima et al 2003 the latter is partly caused by low biomass concentrations e g 0 35 and 2 g l 1 in open and closed photobioreactors pbrs respectively jorquera et al 2010 especially in open ponds these challenges reduce the volumetric and areal productivities brennan and owende 2010 davis et al 2011 jorquera et al 2010 recent developments in the field of mixed culture ppb might offer solutions for some of the barriers encountered in phototrophic systems ppb are photoheterotrophs utilising light in the infra red ir spectrum for atp generation and organic carbon as anabolic substrate they offer the potential for shortened hydraulic retention times hrt due to faster growth rates than microalgae and for combined secondary and tertiary treatment due to the simultaneous removal of organics and nutrients hülsen et al 2018b the technological feasibility of this approach has been proven at laboratory scale under artificial illumination both using batch reactors hülsen et al 2018a marín et al 2019 continuous pbrs sepúlveda muñoz et al 2020 and raceways ponds alloul et al 2021a the utilisation of native organics as carbon source avoids issues with co2 addition which is limiting for microalgae and is commonly added park and craggs 2010 ppb have also been reported to grow at low light intensities dalaei et al 2020 adapt to low temperatures hülsen et al 2016a and maintain dominance under non axenic conditions i e no sterile influent media hülsen et al 2016a altogether these capabilities can provide some independence from varying environmental conditions e g light intensity and availability and temperature infra red ir driven anoxygenic photosynthesis by ppb as opposed to oxygenic photosynthesis driven by ultraviolet visible uv vis light under anaerobic conditions allows effective enrichment and further eliminates common aerobic grazers the high organic content of industrial wastewater tolerance of ppb towards ammonia puyol et al 2020 and ability to use outdoor systems make ppb a good potential match for agri industrial wastewaters illumination has been previously identified as the critical cost factor effectively prohibiting economic ppb wastewater treatment systems capson tojo et al 2020 particularly for industrial systems with higher organic loads using sunlight filtered or natural as energy source appears as a straight forward solution to reduce production costs however outdoor studies utilising sunlight are scarce and none of the research performed to date has dealt with real wastewater mixed ppb cultures or biofilms adessi et al 2012 carlozzi et al 2010 carlozzi et al 2006 carlozzi and sacchi 2001 consequently the results from these studies cannot be directly extrapolated to real wastewater treatment systems which are non sterile and require an enriched robust non axenic ppb culture and sufficient biomass retention capson tojo et al 2020 the use of non sterile inputs and the requirement to use natural light introduce the need to consider interactions and competitions between ppb and other microbes including other phototrophs e g microalgae and cyanobacteria using real wastewater as substrate will also impact the harvested biomass quality and its application as feed e g as supplement additive for aquaculture where the potential applicability of ppb biomass as aqua feed has already been demonstrated banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 delamare deboutteville et al 2019 loo et al 2013 to retain and concentrate biomass photo anaerobic membrane bioreactors have been effectively used for both microalgae and ppb based processes hülsen et al 2016 viruela et al 2018 however this is expensive and adds additional capital e g 183 645 usd m 3 d 1 and operational costs e g 0 13 0 27 usd m 3treated gao et al 2021 a lower cost option might be to use biofilm based reactors where phototrophic biomass is retained as biofilm attached onto an illuminated surface e g reactor walls biofilm based systems also enable the exclusion of undesired wastewater components e g inert compounds which enhances the quality of the produced biomass hülsen et al 2020 this approach can also facilitate biomass harvesting this step known to be particularly challenging in microalgae based systems accounting for over 30 of the total production costs is often done via centrifugation flocculation or filtration kadir et al 2018 in a biofilm reactor biomass can be directly harvested from the walls potentially reducing costs and achieving biomass concentrations of 10 dm hülsen et al 2020 here we applied mixed ppb cultures in outdoor flat plate photobioreactors fppbrs for growth and resource recovery from piggery pww and chicken processing wastewaters cww in two separate tests the experiments using piggery wastewater were followed by those using chicken processing wastewater over a period of 1 5 years the systems were run in sequential batch mode at two different locations to assess the impacts of varying outdoor conditions e g day night cycles of sunlight and temperature on the wastewater treatment and resource recovery performance biofilm formation and the microbial community the effects of filtered ir vs non filtered sunlight full spectrum were also studied and compared the attached and suspended biomass characteristics and its consistency were assessed in view of their potential application as scp or fertilisers 2 materials and methods the piggery pww and chicken wastewater cww tests are two different sets of experiments separated in space and time the pww tests took place first and were followed months later by the cww tests utilising the same equipment with minor modifications the pww test served as a basis to expand and confirm the observed behaviours treating cww which makes the presented results complementary rather than strictly comparable the experiments were accompanied by several uncontrollable factors including varying light intensities and temperatures but also other non weather dependant factors which complicated the comparison of data sets the wastewaters were different cww contained fats proteins and high contents of organic matter while pww was almost fully degraded in the pit containing much less bioavailable organic matter nevertheless the objective was not to test the influence of these variables over ppb growth and performance under perfectly controlled conditions but rather to prove the technical feasibility of an outdoors larger scale ppb system able to withstand natural weather and thus working conditions variations 2 1 piggery wastewater pww pww from a piggery located in queensland australia was used to feed the pbrs the selected piggery is an intensive indoor pig farm using pressurised town water fed via valves in the bottom of the pit the pig confinement area contains slotted floors and a shallow static pit underfoot where the piggery waste accumulates before it is pumped into the wastewater treatment pond system a portion of sediments is removed bi or tri monthly during the operational period the pits were completely flushed on january 9th day 73 prior to batch 7 and march 16th of 2018 day 139 batch 11 which drastically affected the wastewater compositions the wastewater for this study was taken directly from the grower shed pit pumped into a 1000 l intermediate bulk container ibc and pre settled for 30 min before being used as reactor influent the pre settled wastewater contained on average 4130 1560 mg tcod l 1 total chemical oxygen demand 1590 610 mg scod l 1 soluble chemical oxygen demand 1160 284 mg tkn l 1 total kjeldahl nitrogen 160 68 mg tp l 1 total phosphorous 2420 1340 mg tss l 1 total suspended solids and 1880 325 mg vss l 1 volatile suspended solids numbers in brackets are standard deviations the detailed characteristics of the wastewater can be found in supplementary materials table s1 particularly after pit flushes the vfa and scod concentrations in pww were low see table 1 in some of these periods glacial acetic acid was added to certain wastewater batches as stated in table 1 to determine the maximum removal rates and nutrient removal efficiencies without vfa limitations 2 2 meat chicken processing wastewater cww wastewater from a meat chicken processing facility in brisbane australia was used the pbrs were installed on site pumping the wastewater directly from its source grit trap effluent when needed the raw wastewater was a mixture of water streams resulting from feather removal bird degutting and general cleaning water on average the wastewater contained 3332 418 mg tcod l 1 1614 260 mg scod l 1 189 30 mg tkn l 1 39 13 mg tp l 1 2713 430 mg ts l 1 and 1799 279 mg vs l 1 the detailed characteristics of the wastewater can be found in supplementary materials table s1 2 3 purple phototrophic bacteria inoculum no external inoculum was used at either site ppbs were directly enriched from either pre settled piggery wastewater or chicken processing wastewater 2 4 flat plate photobioreactor fppbr set up for the experiments with pww the set up consisted of six custom made acrylic fppbr operated in parallel secured at the base by custom stands three different dimensions were used 2 reactors with a total volume of 100 l 1 1 0 1 m 2 of 80 l 1 1 0 08 m and 2 of 60 l 1 1 0 06 m each reactor had a wall thickness of 0 015 m and had a detachable lid to cover the top the lids were fastened via six metal clamps but were not gas tight the illuminated reactor wall surface area was 0 85 m2 per wall 1 7 m2 per pbr as some illuminated area was lost due to the reactor stands resulting in 17 21 and 28 illuminated m2 m 3 for the 100 80 and 60 l reactors respectively mixing was provided by intermittent recirculation pulse pause 30 30 min of the reactor content from a port in the centre of the reactor to four ports at the reactor bottom all with a diameter of 1 inch mixing occurred only during daytime between 05 00 18 00 working a total of 6 5 h d 1 or 9750 l d 1 24 kwh m 3 d 1 we note this constitutes excessive mixing and requires optimisation this was carried out by the centrifuge pump p 2 fig 1 p 1 and p 2 were 25 l min 1 mono pumps 0 37 kw cp00251c1r8c nov australia pty ltd the 100 l and an 80 l fppbrs described above were later used for the tests with cww in these experiments a small flow was diverted from the mixing line to the top of the reactor where it was sprayed through a perforated tube to disperse floating fat see dotted tube in fig 1 a similar pumping system was used to feed the reactors with pww the reactors were placed in open fields available at the piggery and the chicken abattoir and were illuminated naturally with sunlight under natural light dark cycles with or without being covered with uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 lee filter absorbing over 90 of wavelengths below 790 nm depending on the desired illumination conditions table 1 and table 2 the reactors stood vertically without inclination with the illuminated surfaces facing the east west plane for both set ups thus maximising light availability the dissolved oxygen do concentrations temperatures and ph in the reactors were monitored continuously 2 5 reactor operation 2 5 1 piggery wastewater pww reactor operation six fppbrs were installed and operated on site between october 2017 and april 2018 the operation was divided into 3 phases the controllable parameters were reactor volume mixing batch length and vfa availability where vfa availability via external acetic acid addition varied from phase 1 to 3 and batch lengths was shortened during phase 3 mixing and reactor volume remained constant the impact of these changes which were characterised by varying batch lengths and by acetic acid addition as well as by natural variations in the temperature and received irradiance were assessed to test ppb biofilm attachment the impact of the reactor width on attachment treatment performance and the biofilm characteristics phases 1 oct dec and 2 jan mar took place during spring and summer months vfa content was varied while phase 3 took place during autumn months apr may batch length and vfa was increased this is further detailed in table 1 the reactors were operated in sequential batches with batch lengths between 4 5 6 6 d resulting in an average organic loading rate olr of 0 71 0 12 g cod l 1 d 1 at the start of the batch t0 each reactor was filled with pww from the ibc usually between 3 and 4 pm 30 volume of reactor content from the previous batch was re added to the tank as ppb inoculum at the end of each batch the reactor liquid was drained collecting the 30 required for the next batch and the attached biofilm was removed from the reactor walls by manual upward scraping with a 30 cm squeegee the collected biomass i e biofilm was weighed and put on ice for transport before storage in a freezer at 4 c inoculum and fresh pww were then re introduced in the fppbrs to start the next batch wastewater and treated effluent were sampled from one 100 80 and 60 l fppbr at t0 and at the end of the batch tend samples were kept on ice before being measured concentrations of tcod scod nh4 n no2 n nox n po4 3 p vfas trace elements tkn tp ph tss and vss were analysed do and temperature were continuously recorded between january and april batches 7 18 the contents of tcod tkn tp trace elements total solids ts and volatile solids vs in the harvested biomass were analysed at tend amino acid and pigment contents of the wet biomass were also analysed at various time points 2 5 2 chicken processing wastewater cww reactor operation two fppbrs one of 100 l and another of 80 l were installed and operated on site between march 2019 and december 2019 to confirm the biofilm attachment and characteristics as well as the impact on the treatment performance for the cww tests higher degradable cod concentrations were tested and batches started with shorter batch length as determined in the pww tests which changed the feeding regime the reactors were fed twice per week with batch cycles of 3 4 d average cycle length of 3 5 0 6 d resulting in an average olr of 0 94 0 23 g cod l 1 d 1 a total of 61 batch cycles were run with the 100 l reactor the 80 l reactor was run for 26 batches during this time a period of full light spectrum illumination was studied in the 100 l reactor by removing the uv vis absorbing foil from batches 13 to 37 see table 2 this allowed to study the influence of full light illumination on the performance and stability of a ppb enriched system during this period the 80 l reactor was kept as ir illuminated control we note the reactor volume and the illuminated surface to volume ratio differed by 20 the batch inoculation and reactor restart occurred as described in section 2 5 1 the produced biofilm was collected via vacuum from the walls using a 1250 w 20 l wet vacuum with a stainless steel collection drum ozito for each batch samples of the raw wastewater initial suspended phase final biofilm and final suspended phase were collected for analysis in addition two detailed follow up studies were carried out in batches 33 and 53 taking samples every 3 4 h during the whole batch duration this allowed to study the kinetics of the process and to assess the fluctuations during day night cycles 2 6 analytical methods tcod and scod nh4 n nox n

bacteriochlorophyll bchl contents of the harvested biomass were determined as described in delamare deboutteville et al 2019 and hülsen et al 2020 for the pww tests irradiance and temperature data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology webpage for the university of queensland gatton station 2 3 km away from the reactor location the brisbane port control station located 3 0 km away from the cww industrial site was used to get the irradiance values for these experiments 2 7 microbial analysis microbial samples were harvested from the reactor liquid or directly from the

presented values were normal verified with shapiro wilk tests and the homogeneities of variance were confirmed using bartlett s tests anova tests were used to assess significant differences applying post hoc tukey hsd tests for comparisons otherwise non parametric tests were applied using a kruskal wallis test and dunn s tests for pairwise comparisons a significance threshold of p 0 05 was applied the same software was also used to determine correlations and linear regressions between variables this analysis was performed using the results from the experiments with cww as the amount of data generated was sufficient the package corrplot was used to create correlation matrices the boxplots provide the values for the lowest datum within 1 5 iqr interquartile range of the first quartile the first quartile the median the third quartile and the highest datum within 1 5 iqr of the third quartile values below and above the lowest and highest data used for the boxplots were considered as

as well as slow light driven attached biofilm formation thickness 2 4 mm fig 2 a with mixing biofilm formation and enrichment of ppb from pww was reduced to 6 days indicating the relevance of substrate supply and the possibility of fast start up as previously reported for suspended ppb cultures hülsen et al 2018a the same was observed for cww fig 2b where start up with mixing occurred in 6 days forming thick purple biofilm on the inner reactor walls fig 2c 3 2 wastewater treatment performance 3 2 1 piggery wastewater cod n p removals and biomass productivities the attached biofilm formation of ppb and the associated tcod tn and tp removals were impacted by cod bioavailability particularly vfa and light supply shading both limiting the maximum achievable removal rates this was observed in the 80 l and 100 l pbrs with different surface volume ratios but similar organic and nutrient removal efficiencies p 0 24 and 0 19 over the periods see fig 3 an overall increase in performance cod n and p removals efficiencies from phase 1 to 3 coincided with increased in vfa content naturally and due to acetic acid addition in the wastewater fig 3a d both pbrs slightly increased the tcod removals at increased vfa concentrations while the scod removal doubled to around 40 during phase 2 this was also observed for the 60 l unit which however removed less tcod and scod with substantial fluctuations during phase 1 24 5 12 and 10 1 10 8 and phase 2 30 33 and 41 65 similarly a shortening of the batch lengths from 6 6 d to 4 5 d in phase 3 did not impact the cod removal efficiencies indicating that the vfa cod availability rather than batch length determined the removal performances in the reactors naturally improved scod assimilation resulted in increased n and p uptake due to the high solid contents in pww particulate tkn tp cod and ts concentrations of 260 372 90 70 2540 1675 and 2420 1340 mg l 1 respectively release of soluble species and their uptake occurred simultaneously particulate tkn and tp was mobilised as nh4 n and po4 3 p while both species were also assimilated therefore tn and tp removal efficiencies are provided rather than ammonia phosphate removal efficiency the ph in the 100 l reactor at tfinal similar for the 80 l reactor decreased from phase 1 to 3 phase 1 8 1 0 23 phase 2 7 7 0 28 and phase 3 7 0 0 32 but remained above the critical lower ph of 6 0 for ppb puyol et al 2020 with increased vfa cod concentrations and shorter batch lengths during phase 3 the attached ppb biofilm formation as areal productivities also increased the tfinal vfa cod excess during this phase further indicated oversupply fig 3b d as well as light limitations results from phase 3 under non limited vfa cod conditions give an indication of the capacity of the system with cod removal rates up to 0 52 and 0 45 g cod l 1 d 1 for the 100 l and the 80 l pbrs respectively peak areal productivities reached 13 and 8 5 g ts m 2 d 1 or 9 5 and 6 2 g vs m 2 d 1 in the 100 l and 80 l pbrs these values are comparable to attached productivities achieved in continuous artificial illumination studies and on synthetic wastewater delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 the enhanced performance of the 100 l over the 80 l reactor can be attributed to the higher reactor volume which increased the cod availability per illuminated surface unit the results indicate that the performance was not impacted by high ammonium concentrations peak global horizontal irradiance batch length and reactor temperature ppb were enriched at ammonium concentrations over 1 0 g nh4 n l 1 250 mg l 1 of free ammonia at ph 8 2 and 45 c and maintained the performance throughout phase 1 without any effect on ppb growth and biofilm formation noting that productivity was limited by vfa availability this indicates an adaptation to high nh4 n concentrations as opposed to a culture of non adapted ppb where a 5 fold decrease in specific activity was observed at 1300 mgnh4 n l 1 relative to 100 500 mg l 1 puyol et al 2020 regarding temperatures the ppb culture routinely withstood liquid temperatures higher than 50 c up to 55 c in phases 2 and 3 during summer and autumn during the night the temperatures decreased to 20 c resulting in day night temperature fluctuations between 20 and 30 c in the liquid as shown in figure s1a and figure s2 the resistance of ppb to high temperatures and wide daily variations implies that cooling considerations and related equipment can very likely be omitted in ppb reactors opposed to algal systems the areal productivities in both fppbrs increased despite a decrease in average peak global horizontal irradiances over the phases phase 1 23 8 mj m 2 phase 2 20 5 mj m 2 and phase 3 16 9 mj m 2 respectively this confirmed that vfa cod availability was the limiting factor as previously reported hülsen et al 2016b until there is an excess of available cod which makes light supply rate limiting in terms of reactor design the results indicate that 100 mm wide flat plate reactors modules 100 l 50 mm of average light path considering illumination from both sides can be used effectively to produce ppb biomass e g highest peak productivity and reduce the number of required reactor modules due to an increased reactor volume by 20 and 40 comparing the 100 l with the 80 l and 60 l pbrs with widths of 80 and 60 mm which is desirable for wastewater treatment applications this does not necessarily translate into capital savings but implies that the mixing energy can be considerably reduced as the same recycle flow rate was used for the 100 l 80 l and 60 l reactors in fact at 60 mm reactor width 60 l pbr the excessive shear due to mixing was counterproductive for biofilm formation substantially lowering the attached areal productivities in the 60 l fppbr average of 2 0 0 7 g ts m 2 d 1 by 25 and 43 compared to the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs see figure s3 albeit an increased illuminated surface to volume ratio we note that the mixing cost has to be reduced substantially to achieve feasible full scale applications this might also enable the use of 60 mm wide fppbrs which however is less desirable for wastewater treatment applications due to the volume 3 2 2 chicken processing wastewater cod n p removals and biomass productivities the treatment performance of the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs treating cww wastewater improved moderately compared to the pww tests the tcod tn and tp removal efficiencies in the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs treating cww were on average 45 2 5 26 2 7 and 20 2 9 respectively fig 4 a c compared to tcod tn and tp removals of 18 5 3 7 6 0 1 9 23 5 6 4 in the pww tests as for pww the removal performance in the 80 l and 100 l fppbr treating cww were not significantly different p values 0 57 the performances actually were slightly improved in the 100 l reactor although not statistically significant due to high deviations this confirms the benefit in increasing reactor width to 100 mm to increase the volume by 20 this was confirmed during phase 1 where both fppbrs were illuminated with filtered sunlight ir spectra and achieved similar performances batches 1 12 p values 0 23 the similarity persisted after removing the uv vis absorbing foil for 86 days batches 13 37 from the 100 l reactor using the 80 l as ir control p values 0 23 this suggests that the removal performances can be maintained when full spectrum sunlight is used as energy source see section 3 2 2 1 for detailed cycle studies albeit a 20 volume increase and a 20 illuminated surface to volume ratio decrease however green colour indicating the presence of chlorophylls from cyanobacteria and microalgae developed over the course of phase 2 in the 100 l fppbr starting after 2 weeks see figure s4a b despite the intense green coloration ppb were still present in considerable proportions in the reactors see section 3 4 microalgae might have acted as biological vis light filter causing a layered biofilm structure only visual evidence and mutualistic commensalistic relationships between ppb and algae e g algae consuming co2 produced by ppb light measurements were not possible due to absence of submergible ir vis sensors see figure s4a c for a scheme of the proposed layered biofilm as for the pww wastewater tests vfa cod appeared to be limiting in the cww tests the t0 vfa cod concentrations were generally below 100 mg l 1 with tfinal concentrations below 50 mg l 1 fig 4b d the main difference in these experiments is that cww was more biodegradable than pww and while containing similar amounts of solids 2 7 0 4 g ts l 1 and 1 8 0 3 g vs l 1 hydrolysable fats and proteins were mobilised in situ in the reactor over the batch period as opposed to pww anaerobically stored for weeks in the pit and still low on vfas as the cww was directly fed in the fppbrs the released vfa cod was not measured but it likely provided a constant source of bioavailable cod where hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis was performed by an established anaerobic consortium formed by pbb and anaerobic hydrolysers fermenters see section 3 4 for a more detailed discussion of the microbial communities the higher cod availability with cww is also suggested by the attached areal productivities which were comparable or higher than those from the pww tests with acetic acid addition in phase 3 fig 4b d and higher than those achieved in vfa limited phases 1 and 2 of the pww tests over the course of the experiment the average attached biofilm and suspended biomass productivities differed significantly between the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs p 0 0006 the 80 l reactor only phase 1 generated on average 5 7 0 9 g vs m 2 d 1 and 11 1 4 g vs m 2 d 1 for attached and suspended biomass while the 100 l reactor produced 8 7 1 2 g vs m 2 d 1 and 14 1 7 g vs m 2 d 1 phases 1 3 interestingly the productivities were similar during phase 2 batches 13 37 when the uv vis absorbing foil was removed from the 100 l reactor p values 0 1 during this phase the productivities decreased in both reactors which was probably related to decreasing solar irradiances winter started in cycle 16 fig 4b d this was further underlined by an increase of the attached productivities during phase 3 in the 100 l when the irradiance increased again due to seasonal changes see table 2 figures s1 and s2 correlation analysis of inputs and performance metrics could be done across the 80 cycles for this number of observations a pearson correlation of 0 27 represents a weakly significant relationship p 0 05 0 34 a significant relationship p 0 01 and 0 4 a strong relationship p 0 001 the corresponding correlation matrix is shown in fig 5 for the cycle length d this variable was negatively correlated with the olr by definition considering constant influent composition and with the productivities suspended and total removal efficiencies were not correlated with the cycle length or the olr which indicates that the batch duration could have been further reduced allowing for a higher substrate load in agreement with this the biomass productivities suspended attached and total were positively correlated with the olr indicating that higher values can be achieved by simply increasing the substrate load the irradiance and the temperature were also correlated as both depend on the weather conditions and the incident sunlight more importantly the irradiance was positively correlated with the scod removal the tcod removal and the attached productivity indicating that it had a significant effect on both ppb growth and biofilm attachment this suggests that light limited biofilm formation which would imply the occurrence of a light driven biofilm instead of the common shear driven considerations we reported similar observations in earlier works hülsen et al 2020 to identify if the correlation between temperature irradiance and productivity was due to thermal effects or irradiance a separate correlation analysis due to lower number of data available n 30 using the reactor liquid temperature was performed this identified that removal efficiencies and productivities were not correlated with liquid temperature ρ 0 2 and hence irradiance was the primary factor low temperatures have been previously identified as not substantially influencing the viability ppb enriched cultures hülsen et al 2016a generally temperature fluctuations are expected to impose additional selection pressures across the microbial community in outdoor environments selecting for temperature resilient microbes considering the minimum and maximum liquid temperatures during the treatment period ranging between 6 0 c night during winter and 47 c daytime during summer see figure s1b the results confirm the resilience of ppb to temperature fluctuations as described for the pww tests other than being positively correlated to the olr both the attached and suspended productivities were correlated with the removal efficiencies in the case of the attached productivity a positive correlation was found with the tcod and scod removal efficiencies which is logical as the removal in the system occurred due to biomass growth and attachment the suspended productivities were negatively correlated to the removal efficiencies tcod tn and tp this might be partly due to biofilm formation and subsequent reduced light penetration but mainly due to the dependence of total removal and biofilm attachment this implies that other than biomass growth the removal efficiencies were limited by biomass attachment i e light attenuation due to the biofilm in other words more suspended biomass implied less attachment and lower removal efficiencies without biomass recovery further research should focus on maximizing biofilm formation which appears to be limited by light 3 2 2 1 day night cycle studies to study the kinetics of the process and to assess the fluctuations during day night cycles three sequential day night periods were studied in detail in cycles 33 and 53 both were done to evaluate and compare the kinetics under filtered and non filtered illumination only the study starting in cycle 33 is shown here cycle 53 is provided in figure s5 the 80 l reactor served as uv vis filtered control while the 100 l reactor was illuminated with full spectrum unfiltered light the results are presented in fig 6 the behaviour of both reactors was similar p 0 05 both reactors were impacted by the day night cycles during the day scod mainly in the form of vfas was consumed by ppb leading to an increase in the ph and a concomitant tn and tp drop assimilation of nh4 n and po4 3 p the maximum scod removal rates were 810 and 880 mg cod l 1 d 1 for the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs the scod tn tp ratios over the course of the batch were 100 5 0 6 and 100 7 5 1 1 for the 80 l and 100 l fppbrs respectively which are well in line with those from the literature capson tojo et al 2020 during the night phototrophic activity ceased due to the lack of light and vfas were produced by fermentative bacteria and to some extent also by ppb leading to a ph drop and a decrease in the scod uptake rates or even mobilisation fig 6c f we note that continuous day and night cod mobilisation likely took place resulting in continued vfa mobilisation and immediate uptake by ppb during the day which also resulted in continuous scod removal over the batch length the tcod removal rates mostly due to biomass attachment and fermentative losses varied substantially fig 6c f over time despite the high variability the scod and tcod removal rates suggest that scod removal was mainly caused by assimilation and subsequent biomass attachment to the walls the daytime tcod removal rates serve as indicative rates of biomass attachment a lower tcod removal rate during the night is indicative of the rates of fermentative cod removal and residual biomass attachment nevertheless ppb consumed these compounds at a far higher rate during daytime this mix of anaerobic fermenters and ppb as dominant clades is consistent with the identified microbial communities see section 3 4 the illumination with full spectrum light and the presence of microalgae did not significantly affect the removal kinetics nor the ph trend in the 100 l reactor when compared to the 80 l reactor acting as control pbr illuminated with filtered light in addition the do concentrations were always below detection limits in both systems indicating that the oxygen produced by microalgae was consumed immediately by facultative aerobes or ppb this also agrees with the microbial data showing that aerobes appeared in small proportions in the 100 l reactor e g pseudomonas sp on average 0 5 relative abundance during this period section 3 4 this further excludes an effect of the spraying system on the presence of oxygen the reason for the final tn and tp decreases in the 100 l days 2 4 3 0 is unknown but chemoautotrophic removal can be excluded as nox n was not found in the system 3 2 3 resource recovery potential and biomass characteristics from pww and cww the results indicate that in both cases resources could be effectively recovered but was substrate vfa limited in the case of pww and illumination limited in the case of cww recovery of cod tn and tp in the pww could be improved by acetate addition in phase 3 in this phase the 100 l pbr recovered around 30 of the total cod and 75 of removed cod as attached ppb biofilm fig 7 a this shows that bioavailable cod can be effectively partitioned from the bulk liquid into the biofilm at the same time the tn and tp recovery naturally increased with increasing cod recovery but remained below 15 and 40 of the total tn and tp respectively fig 7c tn is particularly low due to the high n influent concentration this acts as a guide for the ideal substrate choice optimal cod n p ratios and identifies the need to preferment high nitrogen particulate wastewaters the cod n and p recovery data for each batch in the 100 l and 80 l pbrs are shown in figure s6 and s7 for the cww tests the average total cod recovery was 30 40 similar to phase 3 from the pww test not vfa limited fig 7b the recovery efficiencies based on removed cod were also similar the tn and tp recoveries were around 40 and 20 consistent over the phases the scod recovery based on harvested ppb biomass i e biofilm was between 68 and 88 and 132 180 based on removed cod the latter confirming consistent scod release from particulate organics and non measured uptake the attached recoveries account only for the harvested biofilm excluding the separation retention harvesting of the suspended fraction harvesting the suspended fraction would drastically improve the recovery efficiencies and would be suitable for wastewaters with low native solids concentrations the increased recovery efficiencies when also harvesting the suspended fraction are obvious when looking at the attached and total biomass productivities in the reactors fed with cww increasing from 10 g ts m 2 d 1 attached to over 30 g ts m 2 d 1 total attached and suspended figure s8 the biomass characteristics of the ppb biofilm harvested from the pww and the cww are shown in fig 8 ppb biofilm from the pww was harvested at average ts and vs contents of 99 5 1 g l 1 and 71 4 0 g l 1 resulting in an ash content of around 30 dm dry matter the ts vs and ash contents of the harvested ppb biofilm varied significantly over time p 0 05 the main reasons for that were the varying ts vs ratios 0 77 0 45 in the wastewater and the harvesting procedure after draining the reactor particulates remained at the bottom when harvesting the biofilm this remaining layer had to be avoided manually as it contained high amounts of ash especially for pww it is possible that we occasionally harvested fractions of that layer which might explain some of the variations the variations in the ts and vs contents also contributed significantly varying cp tn tp and heavy metal contents p 0 05 the elemental composition of the dried and wet ppb biomass is presented in table s2 which shows copper and zinc contents of 917 134 and 825 109 mg kg ts 1 in the dried biomass overall consistent biomass quality of the biofilm was not achieved over time and the zn and cu contents would only enable restricted agricultural use in australia government 2018 despite the high ash and heavy metal contents the cp and amino acid contents of 670 27 mg g vs 1 and 497 g kg vs 1 were high and well in range with reported literature values hülsen et al 2018a kobayashi et al 1995 ponsano et al 2004 shipman et al 1975 see table s3 for the amino acid profiles of the harvested biofilms the harvested biomass further contained 8 7 2 7 mgcarotenoids g vs 1 and 19 5 6 0 mgbchl g vs 1 which was higher compared to the pigment contents in the suspended biomass 5 0 3 5 mgcarotenoids g vs 1 and 10 7 4 6 mgbchl g vs 1 confirming the ppb up concentration in the biofilm the relatively high concentrations of carotenoids and bchl in the harvested biofilm of 618 192 and 1385 426 mg l 1 show potential for pigment production in a fppbr in general overall the pigment contents are well in line with those from mixed ppb culture biofilms in indoor artificially illuminated pbrs delamare deboutteville et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 and on the higher end of reported suspended carotenoid and bchl ranges capson tojo et al 2020 for the cww test the harvested ppb biomass showed a much better and more consistent quality mainly due to the lower mineral solid contents in the wastewater the biofilm was harvested at average ts and vs contents of 88 3 6 g l 1 and 81 3 5 g l 1 respectively consistent with the pww biofilm however the ash contents were 8 0 dm substantially lower than in the pww trials and practically constant over the experiment this also applies to the cp contents 0 5 g gdry 1 for 70 of the data as shown in fig 8 a crucial advantage of the biofilm based system is the high vs content in the biofilm when compared to the suspended biomass fraction average values of 0 91 0 92 vs 0 50 0 53 g gdry 1 the high vs content in the biofilm might enable the application as high value added product particularly if already clean streams are used as influents hülsen et al 2020 this is not possible with the recovered suspended biomass i e via centrifugation at least not for the here tested wastewaters ash contents would be 50 overall the attached biofilm productivities in the here described system are comparable to average yearly productivities in algal ponds and closed pbrs 6 8 3 0 and 9 3 2 0 g vs m 2 d 1 richardson et al 2014 volumetric productivities in our ppb system are higher compared to algal raceway ponds 0 035 g ts l 1 d 1 but similar to algal flat plate and potentially tubular pbrs 0 27 and 0 56 g ts l 1 d 1 jorquera et al 2010 and also in line with other published works apel et al 2017 arbib et al 2017 eustance et al 2016 jorquera et al 2010 lee et al 2014 min et al 2014 slade and bauen 2013 tang and hu 2016 we note that the values for annual averages have to be confirmed with long term ppb system operations no available data in literature yet in comparison with attached productivities in algal biofilm systems 1 3 7 6 g ts m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 gross et al 2015 johnson and wen 2010 the areal productivities achieved with ppb are on the higher end of the reported range 3 3 microbial analysis of cww and pww tests the microbial analyses confirmed the presence of a dominant ppb communities in the attached biofilm for pww and cww tests fig 9 the main ppb genus in the pww tests were rhodopseudomonas sp up to 57 and blastochloris sp up to 11 while the cww was dominated by rhodobacter sp up to 27 and rhodopseudomonas sp up to 28 a direct link to the wastewater cannot be made and it seems more likely that the extended batch length in the pww trials lead to the dominance of rhodopseudomonas sp this species has been found to dominate at long solid retention times srts in continuous reactors alloul et al 2019 hülsen et al 2020 for the pww tests the consistent presence of rhodopseudomonas sp in the attached biofilm and the suspension indicates its ability to adjust to prolonged exposure to thermophilic conditions while comfortably switching to mesophilic conditions while garcía et al 2019 observed a steady decline of this genus when treating pww in an open pbr lab scale indoors our results indicate that rhodopseudomonas sp seems well suited for outdoor applications the presence of ppb in the suspended phase clearly shows the potential to improve the productivities when also harvesting this fraction fig 9b this agrees with the pigment contents in the attached and suspended biomass vector plots and principal component analyses did not show sample clustering or significant microbial shifts over time data not shown the flanking communities involved a mixture of common phyla in anaerobic digesters as expected for an anaerobically digested influent the vfa degrading firmicutes e g clostridia ruminococcaceae bacteroidetes e g anaerobic fermenter porphyromonadaceae euryarchaeota synergistetes etc these fermenters likely acted in a synergetic relationship with ppb generating the vfas to be consumed by the latter on their side ppb avoided ph drops and product induced thermodynamic inhibitions for the cww tests the microbial analysis confirmed a dominant ppb culture in the harvested biofilm suspension also had purple colour but was not analysed the relative abundance of ppb in the 80 l and 100 l reactors ranged between 15 and 46 and 27 63 with rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp as predominant genera in agreement with the decrease in biomass productivities the abundance of ppb decreased during the periods of lower irradiance samples from batches 17 33 interestingly while at the end of this period the ppb abundance in the 80 l reactor increased to 44 cycle 33 this was not observed in the 100 l reactor this is a consequence of the continuous decrease in ppb abundance that could be observed during the period illuminated with full spectrum sunlight as shown in fig 9a the ppb abundance decreased from 63 to 26 while this decrease can be partially related to the lower irradiances lower light availability cannot explain by itself why the proportion did not increase at the end of the winter period as in cycle 33 in the 80 l reactor and more importantly it cannot explain why the ppb abundance increased to 48 after only 2 batches when the uv vis filter was placed again on the reactor see fig 9a it is also striking that the dominant ppb genera changed from batch 33 to 35 from a mix of rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp to allochromatium sp in batch 50 this dominance changed back to rhodopseudomonas sp and it can be expected that the previous distribution would establish itself is the coming batches it can thus be concluded that the change from filtered to full spectrum light resulted in lower ppb abundances this was likely caused by a progressive out competition of ppb by microalgae as uv vis light was made available e g due to small amounts of oxygen which might lead to ppb outcompetition by aerobes capson tojo et al 2021 we exclude an effect of the surface spraying as this was done for both reactors over the course of the cww tests surprisingly for the authors the results of the microbial analysis did not show the increase in microalgae abundance the primer sets used for amplification cover over 91 of the members in the phylum chlorophyta most common microalgae species and have been previously used in similar studies hülsen et al 2018b so this was totally unexpected nevertheless the intense green colour in the 100 l reactor at the end of the period illuminated with full sunlight clearly showed that microalgae were present in the pbr in considerable proportions figure s4 3 4 significance for industrial application this study shows the technical feasibility of mixed ppb cultures in outdoor fppbrs to treat two completely different complex wastewaters under real conditions cod tn and tp were removed via biofilm attachment achieving removal efficiencies of up to 50 30 and 30 respectively these removals could be realised in a flow through cell e g plug flow without additional biomass retention this might enable shorter hrts and result in biomass attachment while suspended biomass is washed out a fraction of the resources could be recovered as ppb biofilm while reducing the discharge costs e g when discharging to the sewer this would save both capital and operational costs e g no membranes needed but would minimise the overall removal and recovery assuming a retention step allowing the harvesting of suspended biomass such as membrane filtration e g 0 45 µm hülsen et al 2016b or centrifugation the removal efficiencies of tcod tn and tp could be increased to 71 78 22 67 and 37 65 it is important to consider that ppb do not remove total cod tn and tp but merely assimilate soluble components into biomass a harvesting step would consequently increase the areal productivities from 10 attached to over 30 g ts m 2 d 1 total or 0 6 g ts m 3 d 1 however a large fraction would not necessarily be ppb biomass especially for wastewaters such as the ones tested here with high solid contents the lower quality biomass from the suspended fraction could be used as fertiliser but not for scp applications as the ash content would be around 50 and the heavy metals contents would limit its application especially for pww while the quality of the attached biomass i e biofilm can be consistent over time with high cp contents over 50 its harvesting would require an automated system which would add complexity and costs however this might be justified to enable consistent product quality in high value added applications such as scp for fishmeal substitution in fish or prawn feed alloul et al 2021b delamare deboutteville et al 2019 which currently sells at 1400 usd tonne 1 alternatively improved product consistency and protein contents in a suspended or hybrid system could be achieved via a combination of wastewater pre fermentation and solids separation using off the shelf technologies e g via dissolved air flotation it is clear that an optimised ppb process requires vfas and constant vfa availability will also increase the ppb abundance relative to in situ fermentation comparison of the pww vs cww operation emphasises that this technology best fits readily degradable or fermented wastewaters food processing including meat processing is a ready target particularly in combination of pre fermentation production wastewater with a significant manure component is less optimal but ppb could have a role in a combined system where organic acids are produced in a leach bed and ppb produced in a liquid side stream bayrakdar et al 2018 minimising solids in the feed would also enhance the quality of the suspended fraction depending on the local legislation food grade substrates might be required to consider any application as scp in feed which e g in european union depends on the category of the feed material eu 2002 also see regulation ec no 429 2008 application of wastewater derived biological material especially for feed is not a straightforward process and requires a carefully considered legislative framework smedley 2013 dedicated wastewater pretreatment might enable continuous operation during the day rather than batch operation likely with shorter hrts e g 1 d during 12 h as previously reported in lab reactors hülsen et al 2016a hülsen et al 2016b hülsen et al 2018b in combination with biomass retention and continuous harvesting this would enable srt control and potentially improve volumetric removals the goal for future research should be continuous operation however the here reported cod removal rates of around 0 8 0 9 g cod l 1 d 1 are likely to be close to the theoretical possible rates assuming day night cycles and outdoor conditions in sunny brisbane australia at given design parameters biofilm 5 cm light path 10 cm width 20 illuminated m2 m 3 we expect a suspended system to realise higher rates due to reduced shading on the walls over time the inherently higher recovery efficiencies and biomass productivities are another major advantage of suspended processes another major conclusion from this study is the general robustness of the ppb pbrs ppb withstood temperature and light variations seemingly unaffected while light in the subtropical brisbane australia is favourable this also leads to system overheating during hot weather e g in summer with regular temperature peaks over 50 c we can conclude that cooling would not be required to maintain a functioning ppb culture this is a major advantage compared to microalgae systems that have been reported to collapse around these temperatures mata et al 2010 tredici and materassi 1992 this removes a major barrier to adoption by eliminating significant capital and operational costs and water consumption previously associated with algae pbr systems béchet et al 2010 schenk et al 2008 temperatures ranging between 6 0 c and 55 c throughout the year did not have an observable effect on the performance this robustness also to low temperatures was previously shown in lab scale studies hülsen et al 2016a and are now confirmed in outdoor systems the process robustness is further underlined by the fact that we did not rely on process controls the reactors were deliberately left open to atmosphere which saves costs in a potential full scale plant as opposed to ponds the surface for air diffusion is very small in fppbrs which reduces the oxygen transfer also considering high cod concentrations this is highly relevant for a stable functioning ppb community capson tojo et al 2021 in this context the attenuation of ir light as opposed to vis light is also different due to the increased absorption of ir wavelengths by water light attenuation in ppb cultures requires further research to determine the optimal light path at given biomass concentrations besides the batch operation at relatively long hrts the main operating costs of this system are the mixing energy the biomass harvesting and dewatering and the lack of light during night time complicating continuous operation low cost mixing has to be realised focussing either on the reduction of the liquid recycle ratio e g via nozzles or on the implementation of static impellers or similar with recirculating liquid mixing ppb production is prohibitively expensive we note that low energy mechanical mixing solutions exist but need to be optimised for narrow long and tall reactor systems an automated harvesting system is also required and manual harvesting is excessively labour intensive even in countries where costs are low the dewatering of the harvested biofilm is a lesser issue but any harvesting of the suspended biomass will encounter problems similar to microalgae systems research using outdoors reactors has to focus on these aspects applying reasonable sized pbrs 4 conclusions three reactor sizes 60 80 and 100 l were operated in aggregate over 1 5 years on piggery production pww and chicken wastewater cww with a goal of resource recovery as biofilm and demonstration using natural light outdoors and at relevant scale the system could be operated stably on both wastewaters in temperature ranges from 6 c 50 c and with daily fluctuations of 20 c 30 c performance was limited generally by availability of vfas with light being less of a limitation therefore performance was generally better on the cww feed which had a higher degradability the larger 100 l reactor generally performed best with the 60 l reactor performing poorly due to a lower volumetric capacity and to intense mixing biofilm could be recovered at a high solids concentration 90 g ts kg 1 and had a much lower ash and protein content 50 but the majority of biomass remained in suspension and had poorer properties particularly for pww this means that a ppb system is better suited to highly degradable feeds and or combination with pretreatment particularly prefermentation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements sincere thanks go to the uq gatton campus piggery team for support during the experiment providing the

16197,to improve h2o2 generation and fe3 fe2 cycle simultaneously for enhancing electro fenton performance the electrode aeration ea and hydroxylamine sulfate ha were coupled with dimethyl phthalate dmp as main target contaminant combination of ha and ea greatly accelerated the degradation of dmp and exhibited a synergy in the ph of 2 0 6 9 through promoting the key reactions including electrochemical two electron reduction of o2 into h2o2 and redox cycles of fe3 fe2 which then improved the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh the coupling ea and ha reduced the use of ha and converted most of ha into environment friendly n2 60 1 62 1 of ha products while ha solution aeration sa system consumed ha rapidly and the generated n2 only accounted for 5 8 6 7 of ha products furthermore compared with ha sa and ea electro fenton systems enhancement degree of dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton process was higher in actual waterbody than in ultrapure water the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton process could solve the low fe3 fe2 cycle efficiency and low h2o2 production simultaneously and improve the n2 selectivity of ha transformation which advanced its application in practical environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords the electro fenton process fe3 fe2 cycle hydroxylamine sulphate h2o2 electrode aeration 1 introduction the electro fenton advanced oxidation process has been widely used for water treatment plakas et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2021 during this process h2o2 and fe2 are generated by cathodic reduction of o2 and fe3 eqs 1 and 2 respectively and then fe2 activates h2o2 to form reactive oxidants such as oh and ferryl eqs 3 and 4 for degradation of organic pollutants li et al 2020a brillas et al 2009 karatas et al 2022 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 fe3 e fe2 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 fe2 h2o2 feivo2 h2o among them highly reactive oh can degrade and mineralize non selectively a wide range of refractory organics wang et al 2016 this process can overcome the defects of the traditional fenton process such as the risk derived from the storage and transportation of the concentrated h2o2 and the generation of large quantities of iron sludge wang et al 2015 2012 however the application of the electro fenton process is restricted by the low h2o2 production low transformation efficiency from fe3 to fe2 and narrow ph range liu et al 2019 li et al 2020a recently an electrode aeration ea was proposed in the electro fenton process li et al 2020a 2020b by using ea oxygen containing gas is aerated into the inside of the electrode and then diffuses to the outside of the electrode without additional pressure or specific reactor compared with conventional solution aeration sa ea is easier to transport gas inside the electrode to form the effective solid liquid gas triple phase boundaries which is beneficial to improving the formation of h2o2 li et al 2020a 2020b additionally ea can result in turbulent motion of electrolyte between the inside and outside of the electrode which enhances the mass transfer of the system and accelerate the reduction of fe3 to fe2 at cathode li et al 2020a 2020b the hydroxylamine ha is added into the iron based advanced oxidation processes to accelerate the redox cycles of fe3 to fe2 eqs 5 7 and then improve the removal of organic pollutants zou et al 2013 li et al 2020c 2019 the ha reacts with fe3 to form n2 n2o no3 and no2 via eqs 5 13 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 5 fe3 nh3oh nh2o fe2 2h 6 fe3 nh2o fe2

otherwise nitrogen content in the water will increase which may cause other water environmental problems such as eutrophication when concentration of ha is in large excess or fe3 in less content more ha will undergo eqs 5 and 9 to transform into n2 bengtsson et al 2002 li et al 2020c to reduce side reactions and facilitate n2 formation enhancing transformation of fe3 to fe2 is more environment friendly and economical than increasing ha concentration typically in the electro fenton process the cathode can reduce fe3 to fe2 to decrease the concentration of fe3 and addition of ha in this process promotes the transformation of ha to n2 li et al 2022 considering that ea accelerates the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and enhances the generation of h2o2 the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton process may display a higher removal of organic pollutant and better control the nitrogen content in water hence in this work adding ha into ea ha ea electro fenton process for degradation of organic contaminant were studied dimethyl phthalate dmp a widespread refractory endocrine disrupter was chosen as the main target contaminant and rhodamine b benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a and ciprofloxacin were also degraded major parameters including fe2 concentration initial solution ph ha concentration that affect the property of ha ea electro fenton were investigated the degradation rates of different concentration of dmp by different systems were compared effects of coupling ea and ha on generation of h2o2 and concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron were explored the mechanism of dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton system was proposed and the degradation products of dmp and ha were determined finally degradation of dmp in actual waterbody were investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals graphite felt was purchased from the shanghai qijie carbon material co ltd all chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and supplied by commercial suppliers methanol and acetonitrile of chromatographic grade were purchased from the tedia co ltd the reaction solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 2 2 experiments the electro production of h2o2 and the electro fenton degradation of organic contaminant were performed in a diaphragm free glass reactor at 25 c water bath the commercial ti iro2 ruo2 mesh 4 cm 3 cm and graphite felt 4 cm 3 cm 1 7 cm were used as the anode and cathode respectively which were both immersed in 470 ml na2so4 0 05 m aqueous solution with a distance of 3 cm the ea was constructed according to previous study and sa directly aerated pure o2 into the solution li et al 2020a the feso4 was used as catalyst the h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust solution ph the magnetic stirring was used throughout the experiments to mix solution an itech dc power was used to provide constant current for electrochemical experiments the reaction solution was sampled at given time intervals and filtered through filtration membrane of 0 22 μm pore size to remove the impurity the collected sample was injected into a glass vial and quenched by methanol all reactions were carried out in duplicates or triplicates the average values and their standard deviations were calculated 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of h2o2 was determined by potassium titanium iv oxalate method yu et al 2014 the dmp benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a ciprofloxacin and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography waters 2695 with a symmetry c18 column waters 150 4 6 mm 5 μm and the detection parameters were provided in table s1 the rhodamine b was detected with t6 uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 553 nm the degradation products of dmp were identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7000c 7890b agilent according to the method reported by wang et al 2018 the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen of solution were quantified on multi n c 3100 toc analyzer the solution ph was measured on ph meter phs 3c leici the fp 6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco japan was used to record the fluorescence spectra and the excitation wavelength was 303 nm the reactive oxidant was identified with electron spin resonance esr spectrometer bruker a200 the concentration of total dissolved iron was determined with o phenanthroline colorimetric method li et al 2020b the fe3 concentration was measured by spectrophotometric method at 300 nm scharf 1971 to avoid the interferences of dmp and its degradation products at 300 nm 20 mm methanol no absorption at 300 nm was used as the radical probe to capture reactive oxidants zou et al 2013 the ha concentration was determined by measuring the concentration of acetone oxime formed by the reaction of ha and acetone li et al 2020c in which acetone oxime was quantified with ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity and the parameter was shown in table s1 the concentrations of no2 and no3 were detected with ion chromatograph dionex ics 3000 the indophenol method was used to determine the concentration of kjeldahl nitrogen scheiner 1976 the dissolved n2o was quantified on gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n with the method of static headspace gas chromatography butler and elkins 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of dmp in ha ea electro fenton process the degradations of dmp in different systems were investigated fig 1 both sa and ea electrolysis with aeration electro generation h2o2 system only removed around 6 of dmp within 20 min and after addition of 0 5 mm ha dmp removal efficiencies were improved to 14 4 and 28 7 respectively the ha could react with h2o2 in a low reaction rate k 2 2 0 2 10 4 mol 1 s 1 to form oh for oxidizing dmp chen et al 2015 however their removal efficiencies were lower than that of sa electro fenton 15 3 and ea electro fenton 59 5 systems respectively additionally adding 0 5 mm ha into sa electro fenton resulted in a certain increase of dmp removal 38 2 but compared with ea electro fenton it failed to remove dmp remarkably which indirectly indicated advantage of ea when 0 5 mm ha was added into ea electro fenton dmp removal efficiency increased from 59 5 to over 99 99 the dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton was higher than the summation 97 7 of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha sa electro fenton 38 2 and also higher than the summation 88 2 of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha ea electro production h2o2 system 28 7 the ha ea electro fenton could degrade organic pollutants more effectively due to the synergy of ha and ea the dmp degradation fitted approximately the pseudo first order reaction kinetics fig s1 the sa electro fenton showed two stage reaction and low rate constant owing to slow fe3 fe2 cycle while using ea or adding ha in the electro fenton avoided two stage reaction and improved the reaction rate the coupling ha and ea significantly improved degradation rate of the electro fenton and rate constant 0 27923 min 1 was found to be 6 5 times and 11 7 times that in ea electro fenton 0 04296 min 1 and ha sa electro fenton 0 02381 min 1 respectively the removal of solution toc was investigated fig s1 almost no toc was removed in sa electro fenton which was not consistent with the previous reports wang et al 2015 2021 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2019 this could be attributed to the fact that fe2 concentration in this study was far less than in previous reports 0 2 10 mm wang et al 2015 2021 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2019 and fe2 ions was almost entirely precipitated on cathode due to the local alkalinization fig 6 an et al 2020 the ha sa electro fenton and ea electro fenton exhibited limited toc removal around 7 7 and 9 4 within 600 min respectively the coupling ea and ha elevated continuously the mineralization efficiency to 27 2 which improved by 250 and 185 compared to ha sa electro fenton and ea electro fenton respectively 3 2 effect of reaction conditions on dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton process 3 2 1 fe2 concentration fig 2 shows effect of fe2 concentration on dmp removal using ea or adding ha alone also enhanced dmp degradation of the electro fenton process at other fe2 concentrations 5 0 60 0 μm while using ea exhibited a much higher degradation efficiency compared with adding ha system after coupling ea and ha dmp degradation efficiency was further enhanced fig 2b d furthermore dmp degradation efficiency 96 7 by ha ea electro fenton with 5 μm fe2 was almost 0 1 fold and 1 6 fold higher relative to ea electro fenton with 40 μm fe2 92 9 and ha sa electro fenton with 60 μm fe2 61 0 respectively these results indicated that coupling ea and ha not only enhanced the removal of dmp but also reduced the usage of fe2 seen from fig 2 that dmp degradation in the electro fenton also showed the characteristic of two stage reaction in other fe2 concentrations when adding ha and or using ea this phenomenon disappeared which was due to rapid reduction of fe3 to fe2 3 2 2 solution ph solution ph affects the form and interaction of fe2 fe3 and ha in water so effect of initial solution ph on dmp degradation was studied fig 3 all the electro fenton processes had the best performance at ph 3 0 the fe oh 2 formed at ph 3 0 was reported to be more reactive than fe2 at ph 2 0 for fenton reaction pignatello et al 2006 with increasing ph from 4 0 to 6 92 removal of dmp was gradually inhibited the fe3 began to precipitate in the form of fe oh 3 above ph 3 7 which are less fenton reactive liu et al 2007 moreover it has been reported that ha gradually transformed from nh3oh to nh2oh with ph above 4 0 which consumed oxidants in a higher rate constant k 9 5 109 m 1 s 1 than nh3oh k 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 zou et al 2013 neta et al 1988 buxton et al 1988 these were the major causes to the variation of degradation efficiency of dmp with ph this variation was independent of h2o2 yield since addition of ha did not affect h2o2 generation fig s6 it should be noted that dmp degradation efficiencies of ha ea electro fenton process were remarkably improved in the ph range of 2 0 6 92 in addition to ph 3 0 fig 1 the synergy was also observed in other ph the coupling ea and ha also expanded the effective ph range for instance dmp degradation efficiency of ha ea electro fenton at ph 6 5 63 4 even surpassed that of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha sa electro fenton at ph 3 0 38 2 the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by ea only occurred at the cathode in limited ph range adding ha into ea electro fenton accelerated the recovery of fe2 in bulk solution and other ph via complexing fe3 to go through the reversible redox reactions eqs 14 and 15 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 additionally with ea replacing sa improved dramatically production of h2o2 fig s6 the coupling ea and ha could make up for their respective shortcoming thus resulting in the synergy and widening the ph range 14 fe3 nh3oh fe nh2oh 3 h k 14 6 88 107 k 14 9 42 1010 15 fe nh2oh 3 nh2o fe2 h k 15 5 97 105 k 15 1 67 1011 3 2 3 ha concentration effects of ha concentration on dmp degradation were shown in fig 4 both the degradation efficiencies of sa and ea electro fenton systems were improved with increase of ha dosage increase of ha concentration improved the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 and enhanced generation of radicals in the system eqs 14 and 15 compared with ha sa electro fenton ha ea electro fenton could promote more dmp removal with a small amount of ha with increase of ha concentration from 0 0 to 0 5 mm dmp degradation efficiency in ea electro fenton was increased from 32 3 to 87 4 within 5 min while was only improved from 8 6 to 14 7 in sa electro fenton beside dmp removal in 0 2 mm ha ea electro fenton 94 1 exceeded that of 2 0 mm ha sa electro fenton 86 0 within 20 min a small amount of ha effectively enhanced the performance of ea electro fenton and ea reduced the use of ha in traditional electro fenton which would control the nitrogen content in water in eqs 14 and 15 the reversed rate constants were considered larger than the forward rate constants li et al 2020c the coupling ea and ha might promote the transformation of complex fe nh2oh 3 to fe2 and nh2oh eq 16 which accelerated the recovery of fe2 and reduced the dosage of ha hence coupling ha and ea to enhance the electro fenton performance would have better application prospects 16 fe nh2oh 3 e fe2 nh2oh 3 2 4 degradation of different concentrations of dmp figs s2 and s3 exhibit degradation of different concentrations of dmp in sa ea electro fenton systems with or without ha the dmp removal efficiencies in all systems gradually decreased when concentration increased from 5 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 degradation of high concentration of dmp required more oxidants the amount of oxidants in each system within a certain period was constant which would not increase with pollutant concentration so dmp removal efficiency gradually decreased with concentration the removal efficiencies of dmp were ordered as follows ha ea electro fenton ea electro fenton ha sa electro fenton sa electro fenton adding ha or using ea still improved the degradation of different concentrations of dmp and coupling ha and ea further promoted this result in addition to analyzing degradation normalization curve the degradation rate is also an important index to evaluate the degradation performance solís et al 2020 therefore dmp degradation rates in different systems were compared fig 5 with increase of dmp concentration the degradation rate gradually decreased in sa electro fenton but increased significantly in adding ha and or using ea systems which was positive correlation with dmp concentration decrease of degradation rate was due to the gradual precipitation of iron ions fig 6 a which reduced the generation of radicals while increase of degradation rate was mainly because increasing dmp concentration improved the probability of collision with radicals which utilized radicals more efficiently through linear fitting of rate constants it was found that increase degree k 0 03669 slope of the fitted line of degradation rate in ha ea electro fenton was greater than that of ea electro fenton k 0 00895 and ha sa electro fenton k 0 00356 which suggested that ha ea electro fenton system conferred a higher capacity for removing organics 3 3 degradation of other pollutants in ha ea electro fenton process the ha ea electro fenton process was applied for degradation of other organic pollutants including dye aromatic acid herbicide environmental hormone and pharmaceutical fig s4 the degradation of rhodamine b benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a and ciprofloxacin also followed apparent first order kinetics with degradation efficiencies all over 99 9 after 10 20 min of reaction and rate constants of 0 4573 0 2489 0 2680 0 3040 and 0 4828 min 1 respectively fig s5 moreover the results of ha ea electro fenton process were compared with other reports as shown in table s2 by using much less fe2 a few one tenth of other systems ha ea electro fenton system exhibited several to tens of times higher pollutant removal amount at unit time relative to other electro fenton systems and various complex modified cathodes and or iron based catalysts were not required 3 4 mechanism of enhanced dmp removal by coupling ea and ha 3 4 1 effect of coupling ea and ha on electro generation of h2o2 the electro generation of h2o2 after adding ha and or using ea was studied fig s6 in the ph 2 0 7 0 h2o2 yield in ea system reached approximately 89 mg l 1 while around 56 mg l 1 and 28 mg l 1 h2o2 were produced in sa system at ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 7 0 respectively the ea improved the mass transfer between inside and outside of graphite felt electrode and provided more catalysis site to enhance h2o2 generation li et al 2020a however yields of h2o2 with ha were basically the same as that without ha implying that ha had no effect on electro generation of h2o2 although ha was a reducing agent and o2 was an oxidant ha in the form of nh3oh at ph 4 0 did not react with o2 choudhary and jana 2007 as proved in fig 9a within ph 4 0 7 0 ha in the form of nh2oh could reduce o2 to h2o2 in a low reaction rate k 0 1261 mol 1 s 1 tomat et al 1975 meanwhile the produced h2o2 was decomposed at cathode and anode via side reactions li et al 2018 and ha consumed h2o2 to generate h2o n2 nox and oh chen et al 2015 thus it could be inferred that the formation and consumption of h2o2 were in dynamic equilibrium 3 4 2 variations of concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron based on the above analyses coupling ea and ha could accelerate dramatically the transformation of fe3 to fe2 to verify this concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron were measured fig 6 around 76 and 86 of fe2 were oxidized to fe3 in sa and ea electro fenton systems within the initial 6 min respectively the high concentration of h2o2 was formed with ea thus oxidizing more fe2 to fe3 subsequently concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ea electro fenton decreased gradually after 60 min while nearly disappeared in sa electro fenton compared with sa electro fenton the higher concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ea electro fenton were attributed to the enhanced fe3 fe2 cycle with ea the decrease disappearance of iron ions was ascribed to the transformation from fe3 to fe oh 3 precipitation qiu et al 2015 and an et al 2020 also found this phenomenon ideally fe3 was reduced to fe2 by cathode nevertheless part of fe3 generated iron precipitation because of the local alkalinization at cathode an et al 2020 after addition of ha concentration of fe3 in both sa and ea electro fenton systems were decreased during the initial reaction and then kept relatively steady with a certain time it was worth noting that 10 μm fe3 was almost reduced to fe2 within 10 s when mixed with 0 5 mm ha data not shown the addition of ha promoted the conversion from fe3 to fe2 through eqs 5 7 and reduced the concentration of fe3 the stable fe3 concentration indicated that the conversion between fe2 and fe3 was in dynamic equilibrium zou et al 2013 beside concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ha sa system decreased slowly after 30 min which was interpreted with the rapid consumption of ha fig 9a however within 60 min concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ha ea system changed little indicating that the enhanced mass transfer of ea and the strong reducibility of ha jointly promoted the regeneration of fe2 3 4 3 generation of reactive oxidant in iron based fenton processes the o2 ferryl and oh were responsible for degradation of organics brillas et al 2009 when 10 mm benzoquinone was added to capture o2 degradation of dmp was suppressed fig s7 implying that o2 was involved in dmp removal the o2 might be the intermediate during reduction of o2 to h2o2 o2 o2 ho2 h2o2 zhao et al 2018 li et al 2020a and did not directly involved in dmp removal because electrolysis with aeration displayed slight dmp removal the presence of ferryl could be demonstrated by oxidation of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to the methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 however pmso was also oxidized to pmso2 during the electrochemical reduction of oxygen sharon et al 2013 if ferryl formed in the electro fenton pmso2 yield should increase to avoiding pmso2 degradation by oh benzoic acid was used to capture oh ferryl did not react with benzoic acid fig s8 showed that pmso2 yield did not increase in both ha systems thus no ferryl was formed moreover even if ferryl was formed ha could quickly reduce it to fe2 chen et al 2011 the addition of 10 20 mm tert butyl alcohol oh scavenger almost completely inhibited dmp degradation fig 7 so oh was the main reactive oxidant for dmp removal in esr spectra all the systems exhibited four 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo oh peaks jia et al 2020 and peak intensity of dmpooh in ha ea electro fenton was the highest implying that oh was produced in all systems and oh production in ha ea electro fenton was the highest fig 8 a in fluorescence spectra using benzoic acid as probe liu et al 2018 adding ha or using ea increased the fluorescence intensity of hydroxybenzoic acid in the electro fenton and the fluorescence intensity of ha ea electro fenton was much higher than that of ea and ha sa electro fenton fig 8b the fluorescence intensity was proportional to the oh concentration hence coupling ea and ha promoted the production of oh in the system the variation trend of fluorescence spectra corresponded to the dmp degradation trend and toc removal trend 3 4 4 degradation of dmp in ha sa fe3 and ha ea fe3 electro fenton systems to further verify the role of ha and advantage of coupling ea and ha dmp degradation in ha sa fe3 and ha ea fe3 electro fenton systems was studied fig s9 compared with fe2 electro fenton fe3 electro fenton showed the lower dmp removal efficiencies the addition of ha improved dmp degradation from 12 1 to 32 6 in sa fe3 electro fenton and elevated dmp removal from 37 8 to 92 4 in ea fe3 electro fenton the dmp removal in ha ea fe3 electro fenton was much higher than the summation 66 5 of ea fe3 electro fenton 37 8 and ha ea electro production h2o2 system 28 7 these further proved that ha accelerated reduction of fe3 into fe2 to enhance dmp removal and coupling ha and ea also showed a synergy in fe3 electro fenton system according to the above analyses the enhanced dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton system was attributed to following three reasons first the highly reductive ha combined with fe3 to form a complex fe nh3oh 3 and then converted to fe2 eqs 14 and 15 secondly ea enhanced the mass transfer of the system further promoting the transformation of fe3 fe nh3oh 3 to fe2 eqs 2 and 16 thirdly ea effectively accelerated the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 eq 1 therefore high concentration of fe2 catalyzed the decomposition of high concentration of h2o2 to generate a large amount of oh eq 3 which enhanced the removal of dmp the coupling ha and ea could solve the disadvantages of low h2o2 yield and slow fe3 fe2 cycle in traditional electro fenton process 3 5 n2 selectivity of ha transformation by coupling ea and ha the variations of ha and its transformation products were investigated as shown in fig 9 a ha had no reactivity with o2 at ph 3 0 in ha sa electro fenton system ha was completely consumed after 90 min while ha needed 600 min to be completely consumed in ha ea electro fenton system the ea reduced the use of ha which corresponded well with the results in 3 2 3 section fig 9b and c revealed the degradation products of ha the kjeldahl nitrogen was not detected indicating that no ammonia or organic nitrogen generated or their concentrations were too low to detect the n2o no3 and no2 were all detected and due to their high water solubility reduction of total nitrogen in water was thought to be caused by the formation of n2 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the sum of residual ha n2o n2 no2 and no3 concentrations was basically equal to the initial concentration of ha indicating that transformation products of ha were n2o n2 no2 and no3 in ha sa electro fenton n2o and no3 accounted for 88 9 94 2 of ha products while n2 only occupied 5 8 6 7 in ha ea electro fenton ha products consisted of 60 1 62 1 n2 and 29 6 39 9 n2o and no3 the coupling ea and ha could transform degrade most of ha into environment friendly n2 considering that high concentration of reactive oxidants formed but ha slowly decomposed in ha ea electro fenton it could be inferred that less reaction between reactive oxidants and ha occurred thus ha byproducts mainly derived from the reaction of ha and fe3 the conversion processes of ha were shown in eqs 5 13 bengtsson et al 2002 chen et al 2011 2015 zou et al 2013 in this study only 10 μm fe3 was obtained when 10 μm fe2 was completely oxidized which was far less than ha concentration 0 5 mm however o2 aeration and the produced h2o2 could oxidize continuously fe2 to fe3 which resulted in a high cumulative concentration of fe3 in ha sa electro fenton only ha could effectively reduce fe3 to fe2 while in ha ea electro fenton in addition to ha reduction the enhanced mass transfer by ea also accelerated the recovery of fe2 and reduced the use of ha compared with ha ea system more ha would be needed to reduce fe3 in ha sa system 3 4 2 section proved this thus it was likely that concentration of ha was greater than that of fe3 in ha ea system ha was mainly transformed to n2 and the actual cumulative concentration of fe3 in ha sa system was in large excess leading to excessive generation of n2o and no3 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 the ha ea electro fenton not only exhibited a better pollutant removal but also controlled transformation of ha to n2 beside continuous generation of h2o2 via prolonging electrolytic time could eliminate the residual ha gradually which would be more convenient for practical operation 3 6 dmp degradation products and effects of common anions and humic acid on degradation of dmp 3 6 1 dmp degradation products the degradation intermediates of dmp in ea and ha ea electro fenton systems were detected two hydroxylated intermediates of dmp m z 210 and m z 226 including isomers were found and the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring was considered as the pathways for dmp degradation in both systems figs s10 and s11 which was consistent with the oh based reaction process yuan et al 2008 li et al 2021 in previous studies nitration intermediates of dmp were found via dmp and no2 reaction with the presence of no2 ho no2 no2 oh and some of nitration intermediates of dmp showed higher toxicity than dmp li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however no nitration intermediates were found in ha ea system which might be due to the low content of no2 the hydroxylated intermediates of dmp also displayed more toxic and estrogenic activity to aquatic organisms li et al 2020b gao et al 2015 considering that ha ea electro fenton exhibited the higher oh production and toc removal more toxic intermediates would be destroyed with time li et al 2020b 3 6 2 effects of common anions and humic acid on degradation of dmp fig s12 presents effects of cl co3 2 no3 and humic acid on dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton system the co3 2 and no3 had no effect on dmp degradation while cl exhibited an inhibitory effect with increasing cl concentration from 0 to 2 0 mm dmp removal efficiency decreased from 99 9 to 87 9 the cl could scavenge oh to produce active chlorine species of low reactivity such as cl2 hocl cl2 hocl clo3 and clo4 which did not effectively degrade dmp souza et al 2014 at ph 3 0 most of co3 2 were converted to co2 and escaped from the solution via aeration the no3 neither combined with fe3 fe2 nor reacted with oh therefore the presence of co3 2 and no3 affected hardly dmp degradation the low concentration of humic acid showed negligible influence on dmp removal and inhibitory effect was observed in the presence of high concentration of humic acid a small amount of humic acid could combine with the dissolved iron to generate complexes that continued to participate in the catalytic reaction miller et al 2013 the moieties of humic acid molecules were prone to react with oh thus the competitive consumption of oh by overmuch humic acid was responsible for the inhibition of dmp removal 3 7 dmp degradation in practical waterbody fig 10 shows the degradation of dmp in tap water groundwater and river water by different systems the addition of ha improved dmp removal in actual waterbody and degradation followed the order of ha ea electro fenton ea electro fenton ha sa electro fenton sa electro fenton nevertheless the actual water backgrounds had different inhibition effects on dmp degradation the inhibitory effects were basically in the following order groundwater river water tap water ultrapure water which was consistent with the cl content in water table s3 detailedly river water had a certain inhibitory effect on sa and ea electro fenton but almost had no effect on ha sa and ha ea electro fenton this might be because a small amount of organic matter in river water could combine with fe3 fe2 miller et al 2013 enabling it better participate in ha enhanced redox cycles tap water exerted no inhibitory effect on ha ea electro fenton but showed a slight inhibitory effect on ha sa and ea electro fenton groundwater showed a slight inhibitory effect on ha ea electro fenton while showed an obvious inhibitory effect on ha sa and ea electro fenton compared with ha sa and ea electro fenton the enhancement degree of dmp degradation by ha ea electro fenton was higher in actual waterbody than in ultrapure water 4 conclusions in summary coupling ea and ha was applied to the electro fenton process it exhibited a synergy for degradation of dmp and the application range of ph was expanded to 6 5 these can be attributable to prominent promotion of the fe3 fe2 redox cycles and h2o2 generation simultaneously which accelerated the generation of oh additionally coupling ha and ea reduced the consumption of ha and its degradation had better n2 selectivity which accounted for 60 1 62 1 of ha products while ha sa system rapidly consumed ha and the generated n2 only occupied 5 8 6 7 of ha products the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring was proposed as the dmp degradation pathways river water and tap water had no effect on dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton system and groundwater showed a slight inhibition effect the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton system

16197,to improve h2o2 generation and fe3 fe2 cycle simultaneously for enhancing electro fenton performance the electrode aeration ea and hydroxylamine sulfate ha were coupled with dimethyl phthalate dmp as main target contaminant combination of ha and ea greatly accelerated the degradation of dmp and exhibited a synergy in the ph of 2 0 6 9 through promoting the key reactions including electrochemical two electron reduction of o2 into h2o2 and redox cycles of fe3 fe2 which then improved the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh the coupling ea and ha reduced the use of ha and converted most of ha into environment friendly n2 60 1 62 1 of ha products while ha solution aeration sa system consumed ha rapidly and the generated n2 only accounted for 5 8 6 7 of ha products furthermore compared with ha sa and ea electro fenton systems enhancement degree of dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton process was higher in actual waterbody than in ultrapure water the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton process could solve the low fe3 fe2 cycle efficiency and low h2o2 production simultaneously and improve the n2 selectivity of ha transformation which advanced its application in practical environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords the electro fenton process fe3 fe2 cycle hydroxylamine sulphate h2o2 electrode aeration 1 introduction the electro fenton advanced oxidation process has been widely used for water treatment plakas et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2018 olvera vargas et al 2021 during this process h2o2 and fe2 are generated by cathodic reduction of o2 and fe3 eqs 1 and 2 respectively and then fe2 activates h2o2 to form reactive oxidants such as oh and ferryl eqs 3 and 4 for degradation of organic pollutants li et al 2020a brillas et al 2009 karatas et al 2022 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 fe3 e fe2 3 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 4 fe2 h2o2 feivo2 h2o among them highly reactive oh can degrade and mineralize non selectively a wide range of refractory organics wang et al 2016 this process can overcome the defects of the traditional fenton process such as the risk derived from the storage and transportation of the concentrated h2o2 and the generation of large quantities of iron sludge wang et al 2015 2012 however the application of the electro fenton process is restricted by the low h2o2 production low transformation efficiency from fe3 to fe2 and narrow ph range liu et al 2019 li et al 2020a recently an electrode aeration ea was proposed in the electro fenton process li et al 2020a 2020b by using ea oxygen containing gas is aerated into the inside of the electrode and then diffuses to the outside of the electrode without additional pressure or specific reactor compared with conventional solution aeration sa ea is easier to transport gas inside the electrode to form the effective solid liquid gas triple phase boundaries which is beneficial to improving the formation of h2o2 li et al 2020a 2020b additionally ea can result in turbulent motion of electrolyte between the inside and outside of the electrode which enhances the mass transfer of the system and accelerate the reduction of fe3 to fe2 at cathode li et al 2020a 2020b the hydroxylamine ha is added into the iron based advanced oxidation processes to accelerate the redox cycles of fe3 to fe2 eqs 5 7 and then improve the removal of organic pollutants zou et al 2013 li et al 2020c 2019 the ha reacts with fe3 to form n2 n2o no3 and no2 via eqs 5 13 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 5 fe3 nh3oh nh2o fe2 2h 6 fe3 nh2o fe2

otherwise nitrogen content in the water will increase which may cause other water environmental problems such as eutrophication when concentration of ha is in large excess or fe3 in less content more ha will undergo eqs 5 and 9 to transform into n2 bengtsson et al 2002 li et al 2020c to reduce side reactions and facilitate n2 formation enhancing transformation of fe3 to fe2 is more environment friendly and economical than increasing ha concentration typically in the electro fenton process the cathode can reduce fe3 to fe2 to decrease the concentration of fe3 and addition of ha in this process promotes the transformation of ha to n2 li et al 2022 considering that ea accelerates the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and enhances the generation of h2o2 the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton process may display a higher removal of organic pollutant and better control the nitrogen content in water hence in this work adding ha into ea ha ea electro fenton process for degradation of organic contaminant were studied dimethyl phthalate dmp a widespread refractory endocrine disrupter was chosen as the main target contaminant and rhodamine b benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a and ciprofloxacin were also degraded major parameters including fe2 concentration initial solution ph ha concentration that affect the property of ha ea electro fenton were investigated the degradation rates of different concentration of dmp by different systems were compared effects of coupling ea and ha on generation of h2o2 and concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron were explored the mechanism of dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton system was proposed and the degradation products of dmp and ha were determined finally degradation of dmp in actual waterbody were investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals graphite felt was purchased from the shanghai qijie carbon material co ltd all chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and supplied by commercial suppliers methanol and acetonitrile of chromatographic grade were purchased from the tedia co ltd the reaction solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 2 2 experiments the electro production of h2o2 and the electro fenton degradation of organic contaminant were performed in a diaphragm free glass reactor at 25 c water bath the commercial ti iro2 ruo2 mesh 4 cm 3 cm and graphite felt 4 cm 3 cm 1 7 cm were used as the anode and cathode respectively which were both immersed in 470 ml na2so4 0 05 m aqueous solution with a distance of 3 cm the ea was constructed according to previous study and sa directly aerated pure o2 into the solution li et al 2020a the feso4 was used as catalyst the h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust solution ph the magnetic stirring was used throughout the experiments to mix solution an itech dc power was used to provide constant current for electrochemical experiments the reaction solution was sampled at given time intervals and filtered through filtration membrane of 0 22 μm pore size to remove the impurity the collected sample was injected into a glass vial and quenched by methanol all reactions were carried out in duplicates or triplicates the average values and their standard deviations were calculated 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of h2o2 was determined by potassium titanium iv oxalate method yu et al 2014 the dmp benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a ciprofloxacin and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography waters 2695 with a symmetry c18 column waters 150 4 6 mm 5 μm and the detection parameters were provided in table s1 the rhodamine b was detected with t6 uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 553 nm the degradation products of dmp were identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7000c 7890b agilent according to the method reported by wang et al 2018 the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen of solution were quantified on multi n c 3100 toc analyzer the solution ph was measured on ph meter phs 3c leici the fp 6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer jasco japan was used to record the fluorescence spectra and the excitation wavelength was 303 nm the reactive oxidant was identified with electron spin resonance esr spectrometer bruker a200 the concentration of total dissolved iron was determined with o phenanthroline colorimetric method li et al 2020b the fe3 concentration was measured by spectrophotometric method at 300 nm scharf 1971 to avoid the interferences of dmp and its degradation products at 300 nm 20 mm methanol no absorption at 300 nm was used as the radical probe to capture reactive oxidants zou et al 2013 the ha concentration was determined by measuring the concentration of acetone oxime formed by the reaction of ha and acetone li et al 2020c in which acetone oxime was quantified with ultra performance liquid chromatography waters acquity and the parameter was shown in table s1 the concentrations of no2 and no3 were detected with ion chromatograph dionex ics 3000 the indophenol method was used to determine the concentration of kjeldahl nitrogen scheiner 1976 the dissolved n2o was quantified on gas chromatograph agilent 6890 n with the method of static headspace gas chromatography butler and elkins 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of dmp in ha ea electro fenton process the degradations of dmp in different systems were investigated fig 1 both sa and ea electrolysis with aeration electro generation h2o2 system only removed around 6 of dmp within 20 min and after addition of 0 5 mm ha dmp removal efficiencies were improved to 14 4 and 28 7 respectively the ha could react with h2o2 in a low reaction rate k 2 2 0 2 10 4 mol 1 s 1 to form oh for oxidizing dmp chen et al 2015 however their removal efficiencies were lower than that of sa electro fenton 15 3 and ea electro fenton 59 5 systems respectively additionally adding 0 5 mm ha into sa electro fenton resulted in a certain increase of dmp removal 38 2 but compared with ea electro fenton it failed to remove dmp remarkably which indirectly indicated advantage of ea when 0 5 mm ha was added into ea electro fenton dmp removal efficiency increased from 59 5 to over 99 99 the dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton was higher than the summation 97 7 of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha sa electro fenton 38 2 and also higher than the summation 88 2 of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha ea electro production h2o2 system 28 7 the ha ea electro fenton could degrade organic pollutants more effectively due to the synergy of ha and ea the dmp degradation fitted approximately the pseudo first order reaction kinetics fig s1 the sa electro fenton showed two stage reaction and low rate constant owing to slow fe3 fe2 cycle while using ea or adding ha in the electro fenton avoided two stage reaction and improved the reaction rate the coupling ha and ea significantly improved degradation rate of the electro fenton and rate constant 0 27923 min 1 was found to be 6 5 times and 11 7 times that in ea electro fenton 0 04296 min 1 and ha sa electro fenton 0 02381 min 1 respectively the removal of solution toc was investigated fig s1 almost no toc was removed in sa electro fenton which was not consistent with the previous reports wang et al 2015 2021 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2019 this could be attributed to the fact that fe2 concentration in this study was far less than in previous reports 0 2 10 mm wang et al 2015 2021 zhou et al 2013 liu et al 2019 and fe2 ions was almost entirely precipitated on cathode due to the local alkalinization fig 6 an et al 2020 the ha sa electro fenton and ea electro fenton exhibited limited toc removal around 7 7 and 9 4 within 600 min respectively the coupling ea and ha elevated continuously the mineralization efficiency to 27 2 which improved by 250 and 185 compared to ha sa electro fenton and ea electro fenton respectively 3 2 effect of reaction conditions on dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton process 3 2 1 fe2 concentration fig 2 shows effect of fe2 concentration on dmp removal using ea or adding ha alone also enhanced dmp degradation of the electro fenton process at other fe2 concentrations 5 0 60 0 μm while using ea exhibited a much higher degradation efficiency compared with adding ha system after coupling ea and ha dmp degradation efficiency was further enhanced fig 2b d furthermore dmp degradation efficiency 96 7 by ha ea electro fenton with 5 μm fe2 was almost 0 1 fold and 1 6 fold higher relative to ea electro fenton with 40 μm fe2 92 9 and ha sa electro fenton with 60 μm fe2 61 0 respectively these results indicated that coupling ea and ha not only enhanced the removal of dmp but also reduced the usage of fe2 seen from fig 2 that dmp degradation in the electro fenton also showed the characteristic of two stage reaction in other fe2 concentrations when adding ha and or using ea this phenomenon disappeared which was due to rapid reduction of fe3 to fe2 3 2 2 solution ph solution ph affects the form and interaction of fe2 fe3 and ha in water so effect of initial solution ph on dmp degradation was studied fig 3 all the electro fenton processes had the best performance at ph 3 0 the fe oh 2 formed at ph 3 0 was reported to be more reactive than fe2 at ph 2 0 for fenton reaction pignatello et al 2006 with increasing ph from 4 0 to 6 92 removal of dmp was gradually inhibited the fe3 began to precipitate in the form of fe oh 3 above ph 3 7 which are less fenton reactive liu et al 2007 moreover it has been reported that ha gradually transformed from nh3oh to nh2oh with ph above 4 0 which consumed oxidants in a higher rate constant k 9 5 109 m 1 s 1 than nh3oh k 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 zou et al 2013 neta et al 1988 buxton et al 1988 these were the major causes to the variation of degradation efficiency of dmp with ph this variation was independent of h2o2 yield since addition of ha did not affect h2o2 generation fig s6 it should be noted that dmp degradation efficiencies of ha ea electro fenton process were remarkably improved in the ph range of 2 0 6 92 in addition to ph 3 0 fig 1 the synergy was also observed in other ph the coupling ea and ha also expanded the effective ph range for instance dmp degradation efficiency of ha ea electro fenton at ph 6 5 63 4 even surpassed that of ea electro fenton 59 5 and ha sa electro fenton at ph 3 0 38 2 the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by ea only occurred at the cathode in limited ph range adding ha into ea electro fenton accelerated the recovery of fe2 in bulk solution and other ph via complexing fe3 to go through the reversible redox reactions eqs 14 and 15 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 additionally with ea replacing sa improved dramatically production of h2o2 fig s6 the coupling ea and ha could make up for their respective shortcoming thus resulting in the synergy and widening the ph range 14 fe3 nh3oh fe nh2oh 3 h k 14 6 88 107 k 14 9 42 1010 15 fe nh2oh 3 nh2o fe2 h k 15 5 97 105 k 15 1 67 1011 3 2 3 ha concentration effects of ha concentration on dmp degradation were shown in fig 4 both the degradation efficiencies of sa and ea electro fenton systems were improved with increase of ha dosage increase of ha concentration improved the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 and enhanced generation of radicals in the system eqs 14 and 15 compared with ha sa electro fenton ha ea electro fenton could promote more dmp removal with a small amount of ha with increase of ha concentration from 0 0 to 0 5 mm dmp degradation efficiency in ea electro fenton was increased from 32 3 to 87 4 within 5 min while was only improved from 8 6 to 14 7 in sa electro fenton beside dmp removal in 0 2 mm ha ea electro fenton 94 1 exceeded that of 2 0 mm ha sa electro fenton 86 0 within 20 min a small amount of ha effectively enhanced the performance of ea electro fenton and ea reduced the use of ha in traditional electro fenton which would control the nitrogen content in water in eqs 14 and 15 the reversed rate constants were considered larger than the forward rate constants li et al 2020c the coupling ea and ha might promote the transformation of complex fe nh2oh 3 to fe2 and nh2oh eq 16 which accelerated the recovery of fe2 and reduced the dosage of ha hence coupling ha and ea to enhance the electro fenton performance would have better application prospects 16 fe nh2oh 3 e fe2 nh2oh 3 2 4 degradation of different concentrations of dmp figs s2 and s3 exhibit degradation of different concentrations of dmp in sa ea electro fenton systems with or without ha the dmp removal efficiencies in all systems gradually decreased when concentration increased from 5 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 degradation of high concentration of dmp required more oxidants the amount of oxidants in each system within a certain period was constant which would not increase with pollutant concentration so dmp removal efficiency gradually decreased with concentration the removal efficiencies of dmp were ordered as follows ha ea electro fenton ea electro fenton ha sa electro fenton sa electro fenton adding ha or using ea still improved the degradation of different concentrations of dmp and coupling ha and ea further promoted this result in addition to analyzing degradation normalization curve the degradation rate is also an important index to evaluate the degradation performance solís et al 2020 therefore dmp degradation rates in different systems were compared fig 5 with increase of dmp concentration the degradation rate gradually decreased in sa electro fenton but increased significantly in adding ha and or using ea systems which was positive correlation with dmp concentration decrease of degradation rate was due to the gradual precipitation of iron ions fig 6 a which reduced the generation of radicals while increase of degradation rate was mainly because increasing dmp concentration improved the probability of collision with radicals which utilized radicals more efficiently through linear fitting of rate constants it was found that increase degree k 0 03669 slope of the fitted line of degradation rate in ha ea electro fenton was greater than that of ea electro fenton k 0 00895 and ha sa electro fenton k 0 00356 which suggested that ha ea electro fenton system conferred a higher capacity for removing organics 3 3 degradation of other pollutants in ha ea electro fenton process the ha ea electro fenton process was applied for degradation of other organic pollutants including dye aromatic acid herbicide environmental hormone and pharmaceutical fig s4 the degradation of rhodamine b benzoic acid atrazine bisphenol a and ciprofloxacin also followed apparent first order kinetics with degradation efficiencies all over 99 9 after 10 20 min of reaction and rate constants of 0 4573 0 2489 0 2680 0 3040 and 0 4828 min 1 respectively fig s5 moreover the results of ha ea electro fenton process were compared with other reports as shown in table s2 by using much less fe2 a few one tenth of other systems ha ea electro fenton system exhibited several to tens of times higher pollutant removal amount at unit time relative to other electro fenton systems and various complex modified cathodes and or iron based catalysts were not required 3 4 mechanism of enhanced dmp removal by coupling ea and ha 3 4 1 effect of coupling ea and ha on electro generation of h2o2 the electro generation of h2o2 after adding ha and or using ea was studied fig s6 in the ph 2 0 7 0 h2o2 yield in ea system reached approximately 89 mg l 1 while around 56 mg l 1 and 28 mg l 1 h2o2 were produced in sa system at ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 7 0 respectively the ea improved the mass transfer between inside and outside of graphite felt electrode and provided more catalysis site to enhance h2o2 generation li et al 2020a however yields of h2o2 with ha were basically the same as that without ha implying that ha had no effect on electro generation of h2o2 although ha was a reducing agent and o2 was an oxidant ha in the form of nh3oh at ph 4 0 did not react with o2 choudhary and jana 2007 as proved in fig 9a within ph 4 0 7 0 ha in the form of nh2oh could reduce o2 to h2o2 in a low reaction rate k 0 1261 mol 1 s 1 tomat et al 1975 meanwhile the produced h2o2 was decomposed at cathode and anode via side reactions li et al 2018 and ha consumed h2o2 to generate h2o n2 nox and oh chen et al 2015 thus it could be inferred that the formation and consumption of h2o2 were in dynamic equilibrium 3 4 2 variations of concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron based on the above analyses coupling ea and ha could accelerate dramatically the transformation of fe3 to fe2 to verify this concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron were measured fig 6 around 76 and 86 of fe2 were oxidized to fe3 in sa and ea electro fenton systems within the initial 6 min respectively the high concentration of h2o2 was formed with ea thus oxidizing more fe2 to fe3 subsequently concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ea electro fenton decreased gradually after 60 min while nearly disappeared in sa electro fenton compared with sa electro fenton the higher concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ea electro fenton were attributed to the enhanced fe3 fe2 cycle with ea the decrease disappearance of iron ions was ascribed to the transformation from fe3 to fe oh 3 precipitation qiu et al 2015 and an et al 2020 also found this phenomenon ideally fe3 was reduced to fe2 by cathode nevertheless part of fe3 generated iron precipitation because of the local alkalinization at cathode an et al 2020 after addition of ha concentration of fe3 in both sa and ea electro fenton systems were decreased during the initial reaction and then kept relatively steady with a certain time it was worth noting that 10 μm fe3 was almost reduced to fe2 within 10 s when mixed with 0 5 mm ha data not shown the addition of ha promoted the conversion from fe3 to fe2 through eqs 5 7 and reduced the concentration of fe3 the stable fe3 concentration indicated that the conversion between fe2 and fe3 was in dynamic equilibrium zou et al 2013 beside concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ha sa system decreased slowly after 30 min which was interpreted with the rapid consumption of ha fig 9a however within 60 min concentrations of fe3 and total dissolved iron in ha ea system changed little indicating that the enhanced mass transfer of ea and the strong reducibility of ha jointly promoted the regeneration of fe2 3 4 3 generation of reactive oxidant in iron based fenton processes the o2 ferryl and oh were responsible for degradation of organics brillas et al 2009 when 10 mm benzoquinone was added to capture o2 degradation of dmp was suppressed fig s7 implying that o2 was involved in dmp removal the o2 might be the intermediate during reduction of o2 to h2o2 o2 o2 ho2 h2o2 zhao et al 2018 li et al 2020a and did not directly involved in dmp removal because electrolysis with aeration displayed slight dmp removal the presence of ferryl could be demonstrated by oxidation of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to the methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 however pmso was also oxidized to pmso2 during the electrochemical reduction of oxygen sharon et al 2013 if ferryl formed in the electro fenton pmso2 yield should increase to avoiding pmso2 degradation by oh benzoic acid was used to capture oh ferryl did not react with benzoic acid fig s8 showed that pmso2 yield did not increase in both ha systems thus no ferryl was formed moreover even if ferryl was formed ha could quickly reduce it to fe2 chen et al 2011 the addition of 10 20 mm tert butyl alcohol oh scavenger almost completely inhibited dmp degradation fig 7 so oh was the main reactive oxidant for dmp removal in esr spectra all the systems exhibited four 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo oh peaks jia et al 2020 and peak intensity of dmpooh in ha ea electro fenton was the highest implying that oh was produced in all systems and oh production in ha ea electro fenton was the highest fig 8 a in fluorescence spectra using benzoic acid as probe liu et al 2018 adding ha or using ea increased the fluorescence intensity of hydroxybenzoic acid in the electro fenton and the fluorescence intensity of ha ea electro fenton was much higher than that of ea and ha sa electro fenton fig 8b the fluorescence intensity was proportional to the oh concentration hence coupling ea and ha promoted the production of oh in the system the variation trend of fluorescence spectra corresponded to the dmp degradation trend and toc removal trend 3 4 4 degradation of dmp in ha sa fe3 and ha ea fe3 electro fenton systems to further verify the role of ha and advantage of coupling ea and ha dmp degradation in ha sa fe3 and ha ea fe3 electro fenton systems was studied fig s9 compared with fe2 electro fenton fe3 electro fenton showed the lower dmp removal efficiencies the addition of ha improved dmp degradation from 12 1 to 32 6 in sa fe3 electro fenton and elevated dmp removal from 37 8 to 92 4 in ea fe3 electro fenton the dmp removal in ha ea fe3 electro fenton was much higher than the summation 66 5 of ea fe3 electro fenton 37 8 and ha ea electro production h2o2 system 28 7 these further proved that ha accelerated reduction of fe3 into fe2 to enhance dmp removal and coupling ha and ea also showed a synergy in fe3 electro fenton system according to the above analyses the enhanced dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton system was attributed to following three reasons first the highly reductive ha combined with fe3 to form a complex fe nh3oh 3 and then converted to fe2 eqs 14 and 15 secondly ea enhanced the mass transfer of the system further promoting the transformation of fe3 fe nh3oh 3 to fe2 eqs 2 and 16 thirdly ea effectively accelerated the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 eq 1 therefore high concentration of fe2 catalyzed the decomposition of high concentration of h2o2 to generate a large amount of oh eq 3 which enhanced the removal of dmp the coupling ha and ea could solve the disadvantages of low h2o2 yield and slow fe3 fe2 cycle in traditional electro fenton process 3 5 n2 selectivity of ha transformation by coupling ea and ha the variations of ha and its transformation products were investigated as shown in fig 9 a ha had no reactivity with o2 at ph 3 0 in ha sa electro fenton system ha was completely consumed after 90 min while ha needed 600 min to be completely consumed in ha ea electro fenton system the ea reduced the use of ha which corresponded well with the results in 3 2 3 section fig 9b and c revealed the degradation products of ha the kjeldahl nitrogen was not detected indicating that no ammonia or organic nitrogen generated or their concentrations were too low to detect the n2o no3 and no2 were all detected and due to their high water solubility reduction of total nitrogen in water was thought to be caused by the formation of n2 chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the sum of residual ha n2o n2 no2 and no3 concentrations was basically equal to the initial concentration of ha indicating that transformation products of ha were n2o n2 no2 and no3 in ha sa electro fenton n2o and no3 accounted for 88 9 94 2 of ha products while n2 only occupied 5 8 6 7 in ha ea electro fenton ha products consisted of 60 1 62 1 n2 and 29 6 39 9 n2o and no3 the coupling ea and ha could transform degrade most of ha into environment friendly n2 considering that high concentration of reactive oxidants formed but ha slowly decomposed in ha ea electro fenton it could be inferred that less reaction between reactive oxidants and ha occurred thus ha byproducts mainly derived from the reaction of ha and fe3 the conversion processes of ha were shown in eqs 5 13 bengtsson et al 2002 chen et al 2011 2015 zou et al 2013 in this study only 10 μm fe3 was obtained when 10 μm fe2 was completely oxidized which was far less than ha concentration 0 5 mm however o2 aeration and the produced h2o2 could oxidize continuously fe2 to fe3 which resulted in a high cumulative concentration of fe3 in ha sa electro fenton only ha could effectively reduce fe3 to fe2 while in ha ea electro fenton in addition to ha reduction the enhanced mass transfer by ea also accelerated the recovery of fe2 and reduced the use of ha compared with ha ea system more ha would be needed to reduce fe3 in ha sa system 3 4 2 section proved this thus it was likely that concentration of ha was greater than that of fe3 in ha ea system ha was mainly transformed to n2 and the actual cumulative concentration of fe3 in ha sa system was in large excess leading to excessive generation of n2o and no3 li et al 2020c bengtsson et al 2002 the ha ea electro fenton not only exhibited a better pollutant removal but also controlled transformation of ha to n2 beside continuous generation of h2o2 via prolonging electrolytic time could eliminate the residual ha gradually which would be more convenient for practical operation 3 6 dmp degradation products and effects of common anions and humic acid on degradation of dmp 3 6 1 dmp degradation products the degradation intermediates of dmp in ea and ha ea electro fenton systems were detected two hydroxylated intermediates of dmp m z 210 and m z 226 including isomers were found and the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring was considered as the pathways for dmp degradation in both systems figs s10 and s11 which was consistent with the oh based reaction process yuan et al 2008 li et al 2021 in previous studies nitration intermediates of dmp were found via dmp and no2 reaction with the presence of no2 ho no2 no2 oh and some of nitration intermediates of dmp showed higher toxicity than dmp li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however no nitration intermediates were found in ha ea system which might be due to the low content of no2 the hydroxylated intermediates of dmp also displayed more toxic and estrogenic activity to aquatic organisms li et al 2020b gao et al 2015 considering that ha ea electro fenton exhibited the higher oh production and toc removal more toxic intermediates would be destroyed with time li et al 2020b 3 6 2 effects of common anions and humic acid on degradation of dmp fig s12 presents effects of cl co3 2 no3 and humic acid on dmp removal in ha ea electro fenton system the co3 2 and no3 had no effect on dmp degradation while cl exhibited an inhibitory effect with increasing cl concentration from 0 to 2 0 mm dmp removal efficiency decreased from 99 9 to 87 9 the cl could scavenge oh to produce active chlorine species of low reactivity such as cl2 hocl cl2 hocl clo3 and clo4 which did not effectively degrade dmp souza et al 2014 at ph 3 0 most of co3 2 were converted to co2 and escaped from the solution via aeration the no3 neither combined with fe3 fe2 nor reacted with oh therefore the presence of co3 2 and no3 affected hardly dmp degradation the low concentration of humic acid showed negligible influence on dmp removal and inhibitory effect was observed in the presence of high concentration of humic acid a small amount of humic acid could combine with the dissolved iron to generate complexes that continued to participate in the catalytic reaction miller et al 2013 the moieties of humic acid molecules were prone to react with oh thus the competitive consumption of oh by overmuch humic acid was responsible for the inhibition of dmp removal 3 7 dmp degradation in practical waterbody fig 10 shows the degradation of dmp in tap water groundwater and river water by different systems the addition of ha improved dmp removal in actual waterbody and degradation followed the order of ha ea electro fenton ea electro fenton ha sa electro fenton sa electro fenton nevertheless the actual water backgrounds had different inhibition effects on dmp degradation the inhibitory effects were basically in the following order groundwater river water tap water ultrapure water which was consistent with the cl content in water table s3 detailedly river water had a certain inhibitory effect on sa and ea electro fenton but almost had no effect on ha sa and ha ea electro fenton this might be because a small amount of organic matter in river water could combine with fe3 fe2 miller et al 2013 enabling it better participate in ha enhanced redox cycles tap water exerted no inhibitory effect on ha ea electro fenton but showed a slight inhibitory effect on ha sa and ea electro fenton groundwater showed a slight inhibitory effect on ha ea electro fenton while showed an obvious inhibitory effect on ha sa and ea electro fenton compared with ha sa and ea electro fenton the enhancement degree of dmp degradation by ha ea electro fenton was higher in actual waterbody than in ultrapure water 4 conclusions in summary coupling ea and ha was applied to the electro fenton process it exhibited a synergy for degradation of dmp and the application range of ph was expanded to 6 5 these can be attributable to prominent promotion of the fe3 fe2 redox cycles and h2o2 generation simultaneously which accelerated the generation of oh additionally coupling ha and ea reduced the consumption of ha and its degradation had better n2 selectivity which accounted for 60 1 62 1 of ha products while ha sa system rapidly consumed ha and the generated n2 only occupied 5 8 6 7 of ha products the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring was proposed as the dmp degradation pathways river water and tap water had no effect on dmp degradation in ha ea electro fenton system and groundwater showed a slight inhibition effect the coupling ea and ha in the electro fenton system

16198,the high concentration of salt in industrial wastewater has a strong inhibitory effect on the removal of pollutants by free radicals a method has been developed to effectively remove micro organic pollutants in industrial high salinity wastewater this study investigated the combination of ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi and fe iii on the reduction of the pollutants in synthetic high salinity wastewater while focusing on the effects of major inorganic substances whether in synthetic wastewater with or without salinity fe vi fe iii process exhibited higher pollutants removal rates than fe vi both chloride increasing from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 03 10 1 min 1 and bicarbonate increasing from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 02 10 1 min 1 significantly enhanced the removal of pollutants by the fe vi fe iii process chloride changed the ionic strength of fe vi but fe iii strengthened the formation of fe v fe iv from feo4 2 which offset the effect of the decrease of hfeo4 bicarbonate complexed fe v fe iv these complexes enhanced the oxidizing ability of fe v fe iv based on the program kintecus fe iv was proposed as the main iron species in fe vi fe iii system and its concentration was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than fe v at ph 9 0 the enhancement of fe vi fe iii system was observed in the oxidation of pollutant in real wastewater overall the fe vi fe iii process is a new option for treating organic pollutants in industrial high salinity wastewater keywords ferrate vi fe iii high salinity wastewater chloride bicarbonate 1 introduction high salinity content has always been a problem that plagued industrial wastewater treatment in the chemical manufacturing industry including pesticides herbicides drugs and dyes landfill leachate meat production and mining industries their wastewater is found to have high salinity characteristics in addition these industrial wastewaters from the chemical paper food petrochemical and textile industries are often alkaline due to the industrial generation process the treatment of high salinity alkaline wastewater is very difficult and the treatment has become more difficult when industrial wastewater containing micro organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical wastewater most of these pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater will further inhibit the activity of microorganisms or be toxic to microorganisms which makes them difficult to biodegrade farias et al 2020 isari et al 2020 prasertkulsak et al 2019 if these micro organic pollutants are not effectively treated and discharged into the municipal sewage treatment system the operation of the sewage treatment system will be seriously affected zhao et al 2019 to solve this problem chemical method may be a better alternative for the treatment of high salinity organic wastewater advanced oxidation process aop is one of the common chemical methods of organic wastewater treatment such as electrochemistry aulenta et al 2011 kong et al 2015 uv based aops lin et al 2020 and fenton methods maciel et al 2004 these technologies often use highly reactive free radicals formed in the process to remove micro organic pollutants however the high salinity organic wastewater contains a large amount of salt including chloride and bicarbonate which has a strong ability to scavenge free radicals thereby more oxidants need to be added to ensure a satisfactory removal efficiency but this also increases the cost ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi is a good green oxidation technology which can act as an electron acceptor and removes pollutants via electron transfer reaction fe vi not only maintains a good removal efficiency under alkaline conditions acid condition e0 2 20 v alkaline condition e0 0 70 v but also has a good resistance to salinity the species of ferrates include fe vi fe v and fe iv among them fe v e0 1 7 v and fe iv e0 1 0 1 4 v have higher redox potential than fe vi e0 0 7 v under alkaline conditions ezhov et al 2020 sharma 2011 and often appear in the form of intermediate valence in fe vi based technologies which are difficult to maintain in the natural environment sharma 2011 2013 in fe vi based technology enhancing the formation of fe v and fe iv can further improve the removal efficiency of fe vi technology there are many ways to strengthen fe vi including persulfate li et al 2019 uv wu et al 2020 quinones yang et al 2021 carbon nanotubes sun et al 2019 calcium sulfite shao et al 2019 sulfite zhang et al 2017 creatinine luo et al 2021a and metal ions zhang et al 2021 however most methods generate free radicals bzdyra et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 or have the potential to form other organic by products jiang and wang 2003 zhang et al 2021 during the activation of fe vi fe iii is a typical metal ion and has been proven to be able to use the comproportionation reaction of fe vi and fe iii to enhance the oxidation efficiency of fe vi technology eq 1 fe iii strengthened fe vi can satisfy the formation of fe v fe iv and no formation of free radicals or the possibility of generating unnecessary by products jiang et al 2015 fe3 is the final valence species formed by ferrates reacting with pollutants however there are no studies focusing on the relationship between salinity and fe vi fe iii in the existing reports on fe vi fe iii luo et al 2019 found that in the presence of chloride the removal of sulfonamides by fe vi was only slightly inhibited shao et al 2019 found that bicarbonate promotes the ability of fe vi to remove pollutants based on the similar properties of ferrates it is predicted that chloride and bicarbonate may have a weak effect on fe v fe iv in fe vi fe iii process therefore it is feasible to use the comproportionation reaction between fe iii and fe vi to form fe v and fe iv to enhance the removal of pollutants in high salinity organic wastewater 1 fe vi fe iii fe v fe iv in order to solve the problem that organic pollutants in high salinity wastewater are difficult to treat fe vi fe iii technology is selected in this study for the treatment of organic pollutants in high salinity this study investigated that the transformation of pharmaceutical micropollutants by fe vi fe iii in a high salinity matrix sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and sulfamethazine smz which commonly occur in the pharmaceutical wastewater were selected as target pollutants for this research clara et al 2004 liang et al 2020 payan et al 2019 experiments were performed with synthetic salinity matrix at ph 9 0 yang et al 2019 and the main parameters are shown in table s1 the effects of the common inorganic ions were evaluated including chloride ammonium and bicarbonate the differences between the fe vi fe iii process and the fe vi process regarding smx transformation products and pathways were compared 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts was used to evaluate the enhancement mechanism of the fe vi fe iii process lee et al 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a complete list of reagents is provided in text s1 2 2 synthetic high salinity organic wastewater the composition of high salinity wastewater is listed in table s1 ruiz et al 2003 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in common industrial wastewater is 100 mg l 1 jorgensen and weatherley 2003 the level of ammonia nitrogen in high ammonia wastewater is about 43 000 mg l 1 ruiz et al 2003 the ammonia nitrogen concentration selected in this study was 0 5 m 9000 mg l 1 which is between 100 mg l 1 and 43 000 mg l 1 naoh and nah2po4 were used to adjust the ph this study evaluated the effects of chloride 0 1 m bicarbonate 0 0 25 m and ammonium 0 0 5 m ions different concentrations of specific inorganic components were added to 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution at ph 9 0 to investigate the effects of individual inorganic components 2 3 oxidation of organic pollutants 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution at ph 9 0 50 0 ml was first added to the target organic pollutant 5 0 μm 10 20 μl then a 300 μl of fe iii stock solution achieving 600 0 μm was added and the reaction was initiated by adding a certain volume of fe vi stock solution 300 0 μm 200 250 μl samples 1 0 ml of the reaction solution were withdrawn at regular time intervals and immediately quenched with 200 mm na2s2o3 each aliquot was pretreated with a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter before analysis the ph of the solution was checked after the reaction and the ph change was never greater than 0 3 all oxidation experiments were performed in 100 ml narrow mouthed amber glass bottles at ambient temperature 25 c the apparent rate constant k obs was calculated from the linear dependence of ln c c0 on time 2 4 analysis the concentration changes of organic contaminants were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and solid phase extraction spe was used to analyze the transformation products of smx in the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 processes text s2 describes the analytical method in detail and text s3 describes the spe method in detail 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe iii on pollutants degradation by fe vi as shown by the pseudo first order rate constants in fig 1 lower removal rates of the three pharmaceuticals in non salinity solution were obtained by fe vi only 300 μm and the removal rates were increased in synthetic high salinity solution salinity is 3 7 the degradation rates of smx smt and cbz were increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 7 2 0 5 10 3 min 1 and 9 8 0 3 10 2 min 1 to 8 5 0 2 10 1 min 1 4 1 0 04 10 1 min 1 and 1 3 0 09 10 1 min 1 respectively this result is consistent with a previous report luo et al 2019 after adding fe iii 600 μμ the rates for degradation of the three pharmaceuticals by fe vi fe iii oxidation were further promoted in both with and without salinity wastewater especially smx the degradation rates of smx in without and with salinity wastewater increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 and 8 5 0 2 10 1 min 1 to 2 2 0 4 10 2 min 1 and 9 6 0 04 10 1 min 1 respectively in synthetic high salinity wastewater cbz was completely removed within 60 min by fe vi alone within 30 min by fe vi fe iii and k obs in fe vi fe iii was 2 1 times higher than in fe vi this indicates that the fe vi fe iii process is more efficient than fe vi alone in the synthesis wastewater the degradation of pollutants may be facilitated by the salinity components in high salinity wastewater which will be further explored in subsequent chapters fe iii did not significantly promote the degradation of smx and smt by fe vi in synthetic wastewater the main reason is that smx and smt are rapidly degraded by fe vi alone the removal rate reaches more than 90 0 within 3 min resulting in an insignificant promotion of the degradation trend after fe iii addition due to the rapid degradation of pollutants in synthetic high salinity wastewater the enhancement effect of fe iii was discussed in the absence of synthetic wastewater in order to more clearly see the effect of fe iii concentration on the degradation of smx by fe vi fig s1 shows that the degradation rate for smx was positively correlated with the dose of fe iii added during fe vi oxidation k obs increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 to 2 2 0 4 10 2 min 1 as the fe iii concentration increased from 0 to 0 6 mm smx was rapidly removed within 1 min at an fe iii concentration 1 5 mm and the removal rate was 79 2 0 005 these results indicate that fe iii reacted with fe vi to produce intermediate iron species which reacted quickly with smx however upon further increase of the fe iii concentration to 3 mm it was observed that the rate for removal of smx was slightly reduced compared to that seen with 1 5 mm fe iii indicating that the excessively high dose of fe iii accelerated the consumption of the intermediate iron species by way of a reaction between the intermediate iron species and fe iii 3 2 effect of inorganic components in synthetic high salinity organic wastewater in order to reveal the specific effects of various components in the synthetic high salinity wastewater on the degradation of pollutants we further investigated the influence of inorganic components in synthetic high salinity organic wastewater including chloride bicarbonate and ammonium on the transformation of smx by the fe vi fe iii process as shown in fig 2 previous study has also demonstrated that chloride bicarbonate and ammonium have an effect on fe vi oxidation luo et al 2019 both chloride and bicarbonate enhanced the degradation of smx by fe vi fe iii oxidation fig 2a d the promotion effect of bicarbonate was more significant than that of chloride and the degradation rate of smx was increased from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 02 10 1 min 1 with an increase in bicarbonate concentration from 0 to 0 25 m therefore the presence of bicarbonate in synthetic high salinity wastewater is beneficial for the fe vi fe iii process chloride efficiently scavenges ho and so4 based aops li et al 2021 qi et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 chloride influences the ionic strength of fe vi to change the normal extent of fe vi acid dissociation sharma et al 2001 2006b after adding fe iii more feo4 2 readily reacted with fe iii to form high reactive fe v or fe iv to offset the effect of decreased of hfeo4 the roles of bicarbonate and chloride will be discussed in subsequent sections ammonia is a strong quencher for oxidants zhang et al 2016 and often detected in industrial wastewater it is mainly in the form of ammonium under alkaline conditions we investigated the effect of ammonium 0 0 5 m on the fe vi fe iii process fig 2e and f the degradation rate of smx was reduced by a factor of 4 9 as the ammonium concentration was increased from 0 to 0 5 m previous studies found that the oxidation of fe vi was promoted by lower ammonium concentrations feng et al 2017 while inhibited by higher ammonium concentrations luo et al 2019 but when ammonium fe vi and fe iii coexist the effect of ammonium on fe vi technology is also changed due to the presence of fe iii this is because that k fe vi fe iii 2 7 0 9 m 1 s 1 was much larger than k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 and both reaction rate constants of fe v and fe iv with nitrogen containing compounds were faster than that of fe vi for these reasons when ammonium fe vi and fe iii coexist fe vi will preferentially react with fe iii to form intermediate valence iron and then these intermediate valence iron will be preferentially consumed by ammonium rather than reacting with pollutants thus ammonium played only a negative role in the fe vi fe iii process combined with the degradation of smx in synthetic wastewater by the fe vi fe iii process fig 1 the inhibitory effect of ammonium can be masked by the enhancements caused by bicarbonate and chloride 3 3 self decay of fe vi fig s2 shows the decay of fe vi in the presence of different inorganic substrates chloride bicarbonate and ammonium all accelerated the self decay of fe vi and fe iii greatly increased the self decay rate of fe vi in non salinity solution containing chloride bicarbonate or ammonium 3 3 1 chloride previous studies reported that the presence of chloride accelerated the self decay of fe vi about 1 3 m 1 min 1 schreyer and ockerman 1951 wagner et al 1952 which is consistent with the results of this study 9 3 m 1 min 1 fig s2a the rate of fe vi self decay was significantly enhanced in the presence of fe iii and chloride fig s2b the dissociation constants for fe vi h3feo4 were pk1 1 6 pk2 3 5 and pk3 7 3 at ph 9 0 feo4 2 was the main species containing fe vi sharma et al 2006b according to eq 2 sharma et al 2001 the pk3 value of the singly protonated fe vi species hfeo4 decreased with increasing ionic strength 0 1 m fig s3 the reaction rate constant of hfeo4 with h2o is much faster than that of feo4 2 eqs s1 and s16 resulting in less fe vi being decomposed ineffectively before it reacts with fe iii to form fe v fe iv therefore although hfeo4 was reduced more feo4 2 was formed with increasing chloride concentration and reacted with fe iii to form more reactive feo4 3 resulting in the effect on smx degradation by the decreased of hfeo4 can be offset eq s15 2 p k 3 4 247 888 5 t 0 8058 i 0 5 0 5144 i 529 43 i 0 5 t where i is ionic strength and t is absolute temperature 3 3 2 bicarbonates compared with non salinity solution bicarbonate 0 25 m significantly enhanced the self degradation of fe vi fig s2a and this acceleration had a positive effect on the removal of smx by fe vi this suggests that fe vi was easier to transform into fe v or fe iv in the presence of hco3 unlike chloride ions bicarbonate did not affect ionic strength the addition of fe iii did not significantly accelerate the self decomposition of fe vi in bicarbonate solution fig s2b a previous study has shown that ferrate does not activate bicarbonate to form co3 luo et al 2019 meaning that there are no free radicals in the fe vi fe iii bicarbonate system combined with the experimental results for bicarbonate involvement in the removal of smx by the fe vi fe iii process fig 2b this indicates that the effect of bicarbonate on the self decomposition of fe vi was greater than that of fe iii but the addition of fe iii makes the fe vi in bicarbonate solution more prone to conversion to fe v fe iv with higher redox potential previous studies have shown that the self decomposition of fe vi was susceptible to the influence of bicarbonate schreyer and ockerman 1951 wagner et al 1952 fe vi fe v and fe iv react with water to form fe iii as shown in eqs s1 s4 s7 s9 s11 and s14 the iron species with intermediate oxidation states fe v or fe iv have self decomposition processes similar to that of fe vi this indicates that bicarbonate also affects the stabilities of fe v and fe iv jiang et al 2015 reported that the stabilizing effects of different solutes on fe vi decrease in the order phosphate bicarbonate borate shao et al 2019 proved that in the aop process the rate for removal of fe v fe iv in borate buffer solution was much higher than that in phosphate buffer solution indicating that the influence of solute on the stability of ferrate fe vi fe v fe iv affected the rates for degradation of pollutants this means that bicarbonate enhanced the oxidizing ability of ferrate which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 3 3 3 ammonium ammonium 0 5 m accelerated the decomposition of fe vi which was caused by the reaction of fe vi and nh4 although the values of k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 were not high the reaction could not be ignored due to the high concentration of ammonium fig s2 shows that ammonium caused fe vi to decompose at two different rates the phenomenon shown in fig s2a was due to the rapid reaction of fe vi with high concentrations of ammonium and the decomposition of fe vi became slower after ammonium was consumed the addition of fe iii accelerated the production of fe v fe iv from fe vi with 0 5 m ammonium because of k fe vi fe iii 2 7 0 9 104 m 2 s 1 k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 zhang et al 2021 in addition the reaction rate constant of fe v and fe iv with ammonium was faster than that of fe vi because their redox potentials are higher than that of fe vi these factors lead to the rapid decomposition of fe vi shown in fig s2b for the fe vi fe iii ammonium system and then the rapid consumption of ammonium and fe iii led to slower decomposition of fe vi the accelerated decomposition of fe vi caused by high concentrations of ammonium was detrimental for fe vi based oxidation technology however as discussed in section 3 2 the actual ammonium concentration in industrial organic wastewater was lower and this inhibition by ammonium would be weaker in addition the results of removing smx with fe vi in synthetic wastewater showed that the inhibitory effect was far weaker than the promoting effects of bicarbonate and chloride therefore the fe vi fe iii process can still have stronger efficiency in high salinity organic wastewater than the fe vi process alone 3 4 roles of fe v and fe iv 3 4 1 transformation of pmso methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso generates a specific compound methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via single electron transfer which is different from the substance produced by the reaction of free radicals with pmso sharma 2011 therefore pmso is commonly used to detect high valent metal cations in this study pmso was used to study the role of fe v fe iv in the fe vi fe iii system for the treatment of pollutants in synthetic organic wastewater the impacts of different inorganic components in salinity solution on the degradation of pmso and the production of pmso2 by the fe vi and fe vi fe iii processes are shown in fig 3 a and b after fe vi alone was used as the oxidant for 1 h 29 0 of pmso was transformed to pmso2 however the conversion efficiency of pmso was increased to 60 8 after 1 h of fe vi fe iii oxidation huang et al 2021 also reported accelerated conversion of pmso to pmso2 by fe vi after the addition of fe iii this suggests the formation of fe v fe iv which is the main reason why the fe vi fe iii system degrades pollutants more efficiently than fe vi alone both bicarbonate 74 8 and chloride 71 8 significantly enhance the transformation percent of pmso2 from pmso these results indicate that bicarbonate and chloride ions accelerated the transformation of fe vi to fe v and fe iv ammonium significantly inhibited the conversion of pmso in the fe vi fe iii system and the conversion efficiency was only 9 2 indicating that the consumption of fe vi fe v and fe iv by ammonium 3 4 2 kinetics it is very difficult to determine the specific fe v and fe iv species present under the experimental conditions because the half lives of both fe v and fe iv were very short 1 μs to ms and the amounts produced were also low melton and bielski 1990 rush and bielski 1994 which made it difficult to successfully characterize fe v fe iv species with the stopped flow kinetic tracing method sharma 2011 therefore we simulated the iron species produced during the reaction of fe vi with fe iii by using program kintecus and reaction rate constant fig s4 and the reaction rate constant are shown in table s2 the trend for conversion of fe vi is shown in fig s4a the decomposition of fe vi was accelerated with increasing concentrations of fe iii this simulation result is consistent with the fe vi decomposition rate measured at 510 nm as shown in fig s4 fig s4b and c show that the formation of fe iv and fe v was strengthened by increasing the dose of fe iii which is consistent with a previous report zhang et al 2021 the formation of fe iv was 2 3 orders of magnitude faster than that of fe v meaning that fe iv was the main intermediate iron species in the fe vi fe iii process however the increase in fe iii dosage also accelerated the rapid decomposition of fe iv and fe v this is due to reactions between species with different oxidation states of iron eqs s6 s10 s12 and s14 and rapid self decomposition of fe iv and fe v at high concentrations this simulation result is also consistent with the result in fig 1b indicating that the rate for removal of smx was slightly reduced when a high concentration of fe iii was added in the fe vi fe iii process 3 5 the pathway for smx degradation the transformation products tps of smx produced by the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 systems in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution were analyzed by uplc qtof ms and the pathway for transformation of smx is shown in fig 4 the structure of each tp was determined by ion scanning based on its ms spectrum fig s5 and fragment information fig s6 compared with the results for the control samples a total of 17 smx tps were identified tp 98 tp 107 tp 123 tp 157 tp 267 1 tp 267 2 tp 269 1 tp 269 2 tp 269 3 tp 269 4 tp 281 tp 283 1 tp 283 2 tp 283 3 tp 285 tp 297 and tp 299 the possible pathways for transformation of smx by fe vi alone were inferred by analyzing the tps and they included 1 cleavage and oxidation of the c o bond in the isoxazole ring 2 oxidation of aniline and further oxidation of hydroxylamine 3 cleavage of the n s bond 4 cleavage of the c s bond and 5 hydroxyl addition of aromatic groups the isoxazole ring of smx was cleaved hydroxyl groups were added and the mixture was dehydrogenated to form tp 269 2 tp 98 and tp 157 were formed by breaking of the n s bond of smx tp 269 3 was generated by the oxidation of the nh2 bond in smx and further oxidation of hydroxylamine to form nitroso product tp 267 1 the nitroso group of tp 267 1 was further oxidized to form the nitro product tp 283 3 gong et al 2020 also reported that the formation of tp 283 3 via the oxidation of nitroso group the s c bonds of tp 267 1 and tp 283 3 were also broken to form tp 107 and tp 123 respectively the nitroso product tp 107 was also oxidized to form the nitro product tp 123 oxygen was added to tp 283 3 via benzene epoxidation or benzyl oxidation to form tp 299 sharma et al 2006a reported the formation of tp 299 during the oxidation of smx by fe vi these tps were similar to the products of smx formed during the fe vi oxidation reported by luo et al 2019 however new products tp 269 1 tp 269 4 tp 267 2 tp 283 2 tp 283 1 tp 281 and tp 297 were identified in the fe vi fe iii system the tps in the fe vi fe iii cl system were the same as those in the fe vi fe iii system but the corresponding peak areas were different luo et al 2019 also found the occurrence of tp 285 in the system of bicarbonate complexed ferrate comparing the peak areas of the tps and the original substance in the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 systems fig s5 indicates that the addition of fe iii made the transformation of smx more thorough and cl and hco3 further promoted this transformation the detailed mechanism is shown in fig s7 and we inferred different mechanisms for transformation of smx by fe vi scheme 1 and fe iv scheme 2 through the analyses of tps and in combination with previous studies sharma et al 2006b zhang et al 2021 scheme 1 contains three parts including oxidations of the isoxazole ring aniline ring and hydroxylamine ring this scheme was consistent with the report of sharma et al 2006b for oxidation of the isoxazole ring a complex with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry was first formed by complexation of fe vi smx and water molecules which is the complex geometry assumed by kamachi et al 2005 the water molecules in the complex attacked the β carbon of the eniminium cation to produce an unstable intermediate and then the c o bond in this intermediate was broken to yield tp 269 2 in the oxidation of aniline the nh2 group was attacked by fe vi via single electron transfer to form hydroxylamine which was reasonable for the formation of tp 269 3 hydroxylamine complexed to fe vi to form an unstable intermediate and then subsequently formed a nitroso group the water molecules and fe vi attacked the nitroso group to form a nitro group this was consistent with the formation of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 tp 283 3 tp 107 and tp 123 scheme 2 contains three parts including oxidations of the isoxazole ring the benzene ring and the methyl group in the oxidation of the isoxazole ring the highly reactive fe iv abstracted hydrogen to generate a carbon radical and fe iii oh and then two carbon radicals in the isoxazole ring abstracted the hydroxyl of fe iii oh to yield fe ii and an unstable intermediate with a gem diol structure subsequently the intermediate lost a water molecule to form tp 285 the oxidation of the benzene ring was triggered by the electrophilic attack of fe iv on the aromatic ring fe iv extracted the hydrogen at the meta position of the benzene ring and then hydroxylated it to form tp 269 1 fe iv attacked the ch bond on the methyl group to form a carbon radical and then hydroxylated it to form tp 269 4 and tp 283 1 which were further oxidized to form aldehydes tp 267 2 and tp 281 and then oxidized to form tp 283 2 and tp 297 this is consistent with the attackable sites of smx reported by yu et al 2017 and sharma et al 2006a the oxidation of smx by fe iv to form tp 267 2 tp 283 1 and tp 269 4 was also reported in recent reports zhang et al 2022 overall the degradation products of smx are more abundant in the fe vi fe iii system than that in the fe vi alone system luo et al 2019 also reported that the formation of intermediate valence iron in fe vi technology led to the emergence of new transformation products of smx which is similar to the results of this study chloride and bicarbonate can further intensify this degradation and some products are found which do not occur in the fe vi fe iii system this is consistent with the findings of earlier chapters in this manuscript however there are also certain differences in the products in the fe vi fe iii cl and the fe vi fe iii hco3 systems which means that the promotion mechanism may be different so further discussion is required 3 6 possible mechanism of chloride and bicarbonate promotion abts is often used to quantify different types of oxidants such as percarboxylic acid bromine chlorine and fe vi zheng et al 2021 abts can generate the stable green free radical abts via single electron oxidation in the reaction between abts and fe vi fe v was the main iron intermediate and it was determined that the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi consumption abts consumption and abts production was 1 1 1 huang et al 2018 the fe v produced and then self decomposed in the phosphate buffer solution indicating that phosphate promoted the self decay of fe v in water instead of the abts reaction herein abts was chosen as a model compound to study the effect of chloride and bicarbonate on fe vi oxidation seven different solutions phosphate 10 0 mm 10 mm phosphate containing 0 01 m 0 1 m chloride or 10 mm phosphate containing 0 05 m 0 25 m bicarbonate were used to investigate the mechanisms of fe iv fe v formation in different solutions in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi consumption abts consumption and abts production was 1 1 04 1 008 fig s8a which agreed well with the 1 1 1 ratio reported in previous studies huang et al 2018 lee et al 2005 the stoichiometric ratio among fe vi abts and abts was changed to 1 1 25 1 29 in the presence of fe iii fig s8b because of the more total iron with the electronic transfer capability were produced in fe vi fe iii system than that in fe vi alone recent research reported that k fe vi abts 5 96 105 m 1 s 1 k fe v abts 2 04 105 m 1 s 1 and k fe iv abts 4 64 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 in 10 mm phosphate buffer solution luo et al 2021b indicating that both fe iv and fe v produced in the fe vi fe iii system accelerate the oxidation of abts and the formation of abts the effects of chloride and bicarbonate on the transformations of abts in the fe vi and fe vi fe iii processes are shown in figs 5 and 6 in the absence of fe iii fig 5 both the oxidation of abts and the formation of abts slowed with increasing chloride dosage indicating that the presence of chloride ions had a negative effect on the oxidation of fe vi this is consistent with results reported by luo et al 2019 which indicated that chloride ions inhibit the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by fe vi the formation of abts decreased when the oxidation of abts did not change significantly with increasing doses of bicarbonate indicating that bicarbonate shifted the reactivity of ferrate previous research reported that the complex product of bicarbonate and fe v reduced the formation of abts instead forming an abts oxide shao et al 2019 in the presence of fe iii fig 6 the oxidation of abts was increased with increasing chloride dosage and the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi abts and abts was larger than 1 1 1 this suggested that fe iii increased the formation of fe iv and fe v which reacted with abts and generated an equimolar amount of abts to offset the negative effects of rapid self degradation of the phosphate complexed ferrate however the formation of abts was slower than abts consumption in the presence of fe iii and bicarbonate indicating that bicarbonate complexed fe iv or fe v could also react with abts to generate a transparent abts oxide to replace abts overall the addition of fe iii enhanced the formation of fe v and fe iv in the fe vi oxidation process the slight inhibition caused by the influence of chloride ions on the ionic strength in the fe vi oxidation process was offset by the formation of fe v and fe iv with higher redox capabilities after adding fe iii bicarbonate complexed fe v and fe iv and these complexes strengthened the oxidizing ability of fe v and fe iv thereby promoting the oxidizing effect of the fe vi fe iii system 3 7 removal of pharmaceuticals from real industrial wastewater real pharmaceutical industrial wastewater 1 l was collected from chongqing china and maintained at 4 c and adjusted ph to 9 0 it was filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter and spiked with 5 μm smx as the model compound for the degradation experiment the relevant parameters of the real industrial wastewater are shown in table s3 and the degradation of smx in real wastewater by different dosages of fe vi fe iii is shown in fig 7 the rate for removal of smx by fe vi alone was only 2 8 1 0 10 3 min 1 this discrepancy with the result for synthetic wastewater suggested that a large amount of organic matter led to a reaction competing with that of smx which reduced the effect of fe vi after adding fe iii the rate for removal of smx was increased by a factor of 7 6 to 2 1 0 01 10 2 min 1 we kept the molar ratio of fe vi fe iii at 1 2 and changed the dosages of fe vi and fe iii the rate for removal of smx increased from 1 5 0 4 10 2 min 1 to 9 9 0 4 10 2 min 1 as the dosage ratio of fe vi fe iii was increased from 150 μm 300 μm to 500 μm 1 mm compared with the effect of fe vi alone the rate of smx removal by the fe vi fe iii system was greatly improved the efficiency for removal of smx was further improved by further increasing the dosages of fe vi and fe iii however excessive increases in the dosage of fe vi and fe iii caused a large amount of fe oh 3 to precipitate in alkaline industrial wastewater which did not indicate whether the removal of pharmaceuticals was caused by oxidation or adsorptive precipitation so no further experiments were performed with higher dosages of fe vi and fe iii the total iron dosage in this experiment was converted into a mass of 0 1 g l 1 which was lower than the dosage of iron based inorganic agents used in traditional wastewater treatment processes in general the fe vi fe iii system effectively treated organic pollutants in high salinity wastewater 4 conclusions in this study the fe vi fe iii process was used to treat the micro organic pollutants in high salinity alkaline organic wastewater this study showed that fe iii enhanced fe vi on the reduction of organic pollutants in wastewater because fe v fe iv was produced during the fe vi fe iii process the main conclusions are as follows chloride and bicarbonate promoted the removal of pollutants in the fe vi fe iii process although the presence of chloride affected the ionization constant of fe vi and reduced the concentration of single protonated hfeo4 hfeo4 had a faster hydrolysis rate than feo4 2 which resulted in more feo4 2 reacting with fe iii to form fe v fe iv with the concentration of chloride increasing thereby promoting the removal of pollutants bicarbonate complexed fe v fe iv produced in the fe vi fe iii process these complexes enhanced the removal of pollutants more total iron with electron transfer capability in the fe vi fe iii system than in the fe vi system alone fe iv was the main intermediate form of iron and its concentration was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than fe v in summary this work conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the removal and transformation of pollutants by fe vi fe iii in high salinity alkaline wastewater the fe vi fe iii process can well resist the influence of salt the common salt chloride and bicarbonate not only did not limit but also promoted the degradation efficiency of pollutants this provided valuable insights for the fe vi fe iii process to treat industrial wastewater containing micro organic pollutants in addition since the redox potential of ferrates fe vi fe v and fe iv under acidic conditions is much higher than that of alkaline the fe vi fe iii process still has a good treatment efficiency for neutral or slightly acidic wastewater however the excessively fast self decomposition rate of ferrates under acidic conditions causes unnecessary oxidant loss so it is not recommended to use the fe vi fe iii process in acidic wastewater the next work will further explore the treatment efficiency of fe vi fe iii process on several typical actual industrial organic wastewater such as coking wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and food processing wastewater and focus on the reaction rate of fe iii with hfeo4 or complexes of bicarbonate and ferrate declaration of competing interest all of our authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled removal of micro

16198,the high concentration of salt in industrial wastewater has a strong inhibitory effect on the removal of pollutants by free radicals a method has been developed to effectively remove micro organic pollutants in industrial high salinity wastewater this study investigated the combination of ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi and fe iii on the reduction of the pollutants in synthetic high salinity wastewater while focusing on the effects of major inorganic substances whether in synthetic wastewater with or without salinity fe vi fe iii process exhibited higher pollutants removal rates than fe vi both chloride increasing from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 03 10 1 min 1 and bicarbonate increasing from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 02 10 1 min 1 significantly enhanced the removal of pollutants by the fe vi fe iii process chloride changed the ionic strength of fe vi but fe iii strengthened the formation of fe v fe iv from feo4 2 which offset the effect of the decrease of hfeo4 bicarbonate complexed fe v fe iv these complexes enhanced the oxidizing ability of fe v fe iv based on the program kintecus fe iv was proposed as the main iron species in fe vi fe iii system and its concentration was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than fe v at ph 9 0 the enhancement of fe vi fe iii system was observed in the oxidation of pollutant in real wastewater overall the fe vi fe iii process is a new option for treating organic pollutants in industrial high salinity wastewater keywords ferrate vi fe iii high salinity wastewater chloride bicarbonate 1 introduction high salinity content has always been a problem that plagued industrial wastewater treatment in the chemical manufacturing industry including pesticides herbicides drugs and dyes landfill leachate meat production and mining industries their wastewater is found to have high salinity characteristics in addition these industrial wastewaters from the chemical paper food petrochemical and textile industries are often alkaline due to the industrial generation process the treatment of high salinity alkaline wastewater is very difficult and the treatment has become more difficult when industrial wastewater containing micro organic pollutants such as pharmaceutical wastewater most of these pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater will further inhibit the activity of microorganisms or be toxic to microorganisms which makes them difficult to biodegrade farias et al 2020 isari et al 2020 prasertkulsak et al 2019 if these micro organic pollutants are not effectively treated and discharged into the municipal sewage treatment system the operation of the sewage treatment system will be seriously affected zhao et al 2019 to solve this problem chemical method may be a better alternative for the treatment of high salinity organic wastewater advanced oxidation process aop is one of the common chemical methods of organic wastewater treatment such as electrochemistry aulenta et al 2011 kong et al 2015 uv based aops lin et al 2020 and fenton methods maciel et al 2004 these technologies often use highly reactive free radicals formed in the process to remove micro organic pollutants however the high salinity organic wastewater contains a large amount of salt including chloride and bicarbonate which has a strong ability to scavenge free radicals thereby more oxidants need to be added to ensure a satisfactory removal efficiency but this also increases the cost ferrate vi fevio4 2 fe vi is a good green oxidation technology which can act as an electron acceptor and removes pollutants via electron transfer reaction fe vi not only maintains a good removal efficiency under alkaline conditions acid condition e0 2 20 v alkaline condition e0 0 70 v but also has a good resistance to salinity the species of ferrates include fe vi fe v and fe iv among them fe v e0 1 7 v and fe iv e0 1 0 1 4 v have higher redox potential than fe vi e0 0 7 v under alkaline conditions ezhov et al 2020 sharma 2011 and often appear in the form of intermediate valence in fe vi based technologies which are difficult to maintain in the natural environment sharma 2011 2013 in fe vi based technology enhancing the formation of fe v and fe iv can further improve the removal efficiency of fe vi technology there are many ways to strengthen fe vi including persulfate li et al 2019 uv wu et al 2020 quinones yang et al 2021 carbon nanotubes sun et al 2019 calcium sulfite shao et al 2019 sulfite zhang et al 2017 creatinine luo et al 2021a and metal ions zhang et al 2021 however most methods generate free radicals bzdyra et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 or have the potential to form other organic by products jiang and wang 2003 zhang et al 2021 during the activation of fe vi fe iii is a typical metal ion and has been proven to be able to use the comproportionation reaction of fe vi and fe iii to enhance the oxidation efficiency of fe vi technology eq 1 fe iii strengthened fe vi can satisfy the formation of fe v fe iv and no formation of free radicals or the possibility of generating unnecessary by products jiang et al 2015 fe3 is the final valence species formed by ferrates reacting with pollutants however there are no studies focusing on the relationship between salinity and fe vi fe iii in the existing reports on fe vi fe iii luo et al 2019 found that in the presence of chloride the removal of sulfonamides by fe vi was only slightly inhibited shao et al 2019 found that bicarbonate promotes the ability of fe vi to remove pollutants based on the similar properties of ferrates it is predicted that chloride and bicarbonate may have a weak effect on fe v fe iv in fe vi fe iii process therefore it is feasible to use the comproportionation reaction between fe iii and fe vi to form fe v and fe iv to enhance the removal of pollutants in high salinity organic wastewater 1 fe vi fe iii fe v fe iv in order to solve the problem that organic pollutants in high salinity wastewater are difficult to treat fe vi fe iii technology is selected in this study for the treatment of organic pollutants in high salinity this study investigated that the transformation of pharmaceutical micropollutants by fe vi fe iii in a high salinity matrix sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and sulfamethazine smz which commonly occur in the pharmaceutical wastewater were selected as target pollutants for this research clara et al 2004 liang et al 2020 payan et al 2019 experiments were performed with synthetic salinity matrix at ph 9 0 yang et al 2019 and the main parameters are shown in table s1 the effects of the common inorganic ions were evaluated including chloride ammonium and bicarbonate the differences between the fe vi fe iii process and the fe vi process regarding smx transformation products and pathways were compared 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts was used to evaluate the enhancement mechanism of the fe vi fe iii process lee et al 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a complete list of reagents is provided in text s1 2 2 synthetic high salinity organic wastewater the composition of high salinity wastewater is listed in table s1 ruiz et al 2003 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in common industrial wastewater is 100 mg l 1 jorgensen and weatherley 2003 the level of ammonia nitrogen in high ammonia wastewater is about 43 000 mg l 1 ruiz et al 2003 the ammonia nitrogen concentration selected in this study was 0 5 m 9000 mg l 1 which is between 100 mg l 1 and 43 000 mg l 1 naoh and nah2po4 were used to adjust the ph this study evaluated the effects of chloride 0 1 m bicarbonate 0 0 25 m and ammonium 0 0 5 m ions different concentrations of specific inorganic components were added to 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution at ph 9 0 to investigate the effects of individual inorganic components 2 3 oxidation of organic pollutants 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution at ph 9 0 50 0 ml was first added to the target organic pollutant 5 0 μm 10 20 μl then a 300 μl of fe iii stock solution achieving 600 0 μm was added and the reaction was initiated by adding a certain volume of fe vi stock solution 300 0 μm 200 250 μl samples 1 0 ml of the reaction solution were withdrawn at regular time intervals and immediately quenched with 200 mm na2s2o3 each aliquot was pretreated with a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter before analysis the ph of the solution was checked after the reaction and the ph change was never greater than 0 3 all oxidation experiments were performed in 100 ml narrow mouthed amber glass bottles at ambient temperature 25 c the apparent rate constant k obs was calculated from the linear dependence of ln c c0 on time 2 4 analysis the concentration changes of organic contaminants were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and solid phase extraction spe was used to analyze the transformation products of smx in the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 processes text s2 describes the analytical method in detail and text s3 describes the spe method in detail 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe iii on pollutants degradation by fe vi as shown by the pseudo first order rate constants in fig 1 lower removal rates of the three pharmaceuticals in non salinity solution were obtained by fe vi only 300 μm and the removal rates were increased in synthetic high salinity solution salinity is 3 7 the degradation rates of smx smt and cbz were increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 7 2 0 5 10 3 min 1 and 9 8 0 3 10 2 min 1 to 8 5 0 2 10 1 min 1 4 1 0 04 10 1 min 1 and 1 3 0 09 10 1 min 1 respectively this result is consistent with a previous report luo et al 2019 after adding fe iii 600 μμ the rates for degradation of the three pharmaceuticals by fe vi fe iii oxidation were further promoted in both with and without salinity wastewater especially smx the degradation rates of smx in without and with salinity wastewater increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 and 8 5 0 2 10 1 min 1 to 2 2 0 4 10 2 min 1 and 9 6 0 04 10 1 min 1 respectively in synthetic high salinity wastewater cbz was completely removed within 60 min by fe vi alone within 30 min by fe vi fe iii and k obs in fe vi fe iii was 2 1 times higher than in fe vi this indicates that the fe vi fe iii process is more efficient than fe vi alone in the synthesis wastewater the degradation of pollutants may be facilitated by the salinity components in high salinity wastewater which will be further explored in subsequent chapters fe iii did not significantly promote the degradation of smx and smt by fe vi in synthetic wastewater the main reason is that smx and smt are rapidly degraded by fe vi alone the removal rate reaches more than 90 0 within 3 min resulting in an insignificant promotion of the degradation trend after fe iii addition due to the rapid degradation of pollutants in synthetic high salinity wastewater the enhancement effect of fe iii was discussed in the absence of synthetic wastewater in order to more clearly see the effect of fe iii concentration on the degradation of smx by fe vi fig s1 shows that the degradation rate for smx was positively correlated with the dose of fe iii added during fe vi oxidation k obs increased from 6 3 0 4 10 3 min 1 to 2 2 0 4 10 2 min 1 as the fe iii concentration increased from 0 to 0 6 mm smx was rapidly removed within 1 min at an fe iii concentration 1 5 mm and the removal rate was 79 2 0 005 these results indicate that fe iii reacted with fe vi to produce intermediate iron species which reacted quickly with smx however upon further increase of the fe iii concentration to 3 mm it was observed that the rate for removal of smx was slightly reduced compared to that seen with 1 5 mm fe iii indicating that the excessively high dose of fe iii accelerated the consumption of the intermediate iron species by way of a reaction between the intermediate iron species and fe iii 3 2 effect of inorganic components in synthetic high salinity organic wastewater in order to reveal the specific effects of various components in the synthetic high salinity wastewater on the degradation of pollutants we further investigated the influence of inorganic components in synthetic high salinity organic wastewater including chloride bicarbonate and ammonium on the transformation of smx by the fe vi fe iii process as shown in fig 2 previous study has also demonstrated that chloride bicarbonate and ammonium have an effect on fe vi oxidation luo et al 2019 both chloride and bicarbonate enhanced the degradation of smx by fe vi fe iii oxidation fig 2a d the promotion effect of bicarbonate was more significant than that of chloride and the degradation rate of smx was increased from 2 2 0 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 1 0 02 10 1 min 1 with an increase in bicarbonate concentration from 0 to 0 25 m therefore the presence of bicarbonate in synthetic high salinity wastewater is beneficial for the fe vi fe iii process chloride efficiently scavenges ho and so4 based aops li et al 2021 qi et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 chloride influences the ionic strength of fe vi to change the normal extent of fe vi acid dissociation sharma et al 2001 2006b after adding fe iii more feo4 2 readily reacted with fe iii to form high reactive fe v or fe iv to offset the effect of decreased of hfeo4 the roles of bicarbonate and chloride will be discussed in subsequent sections ammonia is a strong quencher for oxidants zhang et al 2016 and often detected in industrial wastewater it is mainly in the form of ammonium under alkaline conditions we investigated the effect of ammonium 0 0 5 m on the fe vi fe iii process fig 2e and f the degradation rate of smx was reduced by a factor of 4 9 as the ammonium concentration was increased from 0 to 0 5 m previous studies found that the oxidation of fe vi was promoted by lower ammonium concentrations feng et al 2017 while inhibited by higher ammonium concentrations luo et al 2019 but when ammonium fe vi and fe iii coexist the effect of ammonium on fe vi technology is also changed due to the presence of fe iii this is because that k fe vi fe iii 2 7 0 9 m 1 s 1 was much larger than k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 and both reaction rate constants of fe v and fe iv with nitrogen containing compounds were faster than that of fe vi for these reasons when ammonium fe vi and fe iii coexist fe vi will preferentially react with fe iii to form intermediate valence iron and then these intermediate valence iron will be preferentially consumed by ammonium rather than reacting with pollutants thus ammonium played only a negative role in the fe vi fe iii process combined with the degradation of smx in synthetic wastewater by the fe vi fe iii process fig 1 the inhibitory effect of ammonium can be masked by the enhancements caused by bicarbonate and chloride 3 3 self decay of fe vi fig s2 shows the decay of fe vi in the presence of different inorganic substrates chloride bicarbonate and ammonium all accelerated the self decay of fe vi and fe iii greatly increased the self decay rate of fe vi in non salinity solution containing chloride bicarbonate or ammonium 3 3 1 chloride previous studies reported that the presence of chloride accelerated the self decay of fe vi about 1 3 m 1 min 1 schreyer and ockerman 1951 wagner et al 1952 which is consistent with the results of this study 9 3 m 1 min 1 fig s2a the rate of fe vi self decay was significantly enhanced in the presence of fe iii and chloride fig s2b the dissociation constants for fe vi h3feo4 were pk1 1 6 pk2 3 5 and pk3 7 3 at ph 9 0 feo4 2 was the main species containing fe vi sharma et al 2006b according to eq 2 sharma et al 2001 the pk3 value of the singly protonated fe vi species hfeo4 decreased with increasing ionic strength 0 1 m fig s3 the reaction rate constant of hfeo4 with h2o is much faster than that of feo4 2 eqs s1 and s16 resulting in less fe vi being decomposed ineffectively before it reacts with fe iii to form fe v fe iv therefore although hfeo4 was reduced more feo4 2 was formed with increasing chloride concentration and reacted with fe iii to form more reactive feo4 3 resulting in the effect on smx degradation by the decreased of hfeo4 can be offset eq s15 2 p k 3 4 247 888 5 t 0 8058 i 0 5 0 5144 i 529 43 i 0 5 t where i is ionic strength and t is absolute temperature 3 3 2 bicarbonates compared with non salinity solution bicarbonate 0 25 m significantly enhanced the self degradation of fe vi fig s2a and this acceleration had a positive effect on the removal of smx by fe vi this suggests that fe vi was easier to transform into fe v or fe iv in the presence of hco3 unlike chloride ions bicarbonate did not affect ionic strength the addition of fe iii did not significantly accelerate the self decomposition of fe vi in bicarbonate solution fig s2b a previous study has shown that ferrate does not activate bicarbonate to form co3 luo et al 2019 meaning that there are no free radicals in the fe vi fe iii bicarbonate system combined with the experimental results for bicarbonate involvement in the removal of smx by the fe vi fe iii process fig 2b this indicates that the effect of bicarbonate on the self decomposition of fe vi was greater than that of fe iii but the addition of fe iii makes the fe vi in bicarbonate solution more prone to conversion to fe v fe iv with higher redox potential previous studies have shown that the self decomposition of fe vi was susceptible to the influence of bicarbonate schreyer and ockerman 1951 wagner et al 1952 fe vi fe v and fe iv react with water to form fe iii as shown in eqs s1 s4 s7 s9 s11 and s14 the iron species with intermediate oxidation states fe v or fe iv have self decomposition processes similar to that of fe vi this indicates that bicarbonate also affects the stabilities of fe v and fe iv jiang et al 2015 reported that the stabilizing effects of different solutes on fe vi decrease in the order phosphate bicarbonate borate shao et al 2019 proved that in the aop process the rate for removal of fe v fe iv in borate buffer solution was much higher than that in phosphate buffer solution indicating that the influence of solute on the stability of ferrate fe vi fe v fe iv affected the rates for degradation of pollutants this means that bicarbonate enhanced the oxidizing ability of ferrate which is consistent with the results shown in fig 2 3 3 3 ammonium ammonium 0 5 m accelerated the decomposition of fe vi which was caused by the reaction of fe vi and nh4 although the values of k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 were not high the reaction could not be ignored due to the high concentration of ammonium fig s2 shows that ammonium caused fe vi to decompose at two different rates the phenomenon shown in fig s2a was due to the rapid reaction of fe vi with high concentrations of ammonium and the decomposition of fe vi became slower after ammonium was consumed the addition of fe iii accelerated the production of fe v fe iv from fe vi with 0 5 m ammonium because of k fe vi fe iii 2 7 0 9 104 m 2 s 1 k fe vi nh4 1 25 0 11 10 1 m 1 s 1 feng et al 2017 sharma et al 1998 zhang et al 2021 in addition the reaction rate constant of fe v and fe iv with ammonium was faster than that of fe vi because their redox potentials are higher than that of fe vi these factors lead to the rapid decomposition of fe vi shown in fig s2b for the fe vi fe iii ammonium system and then the rapid consumption of ammonium and fe iii led to slower decomposition of fe vi the accelerated decomposition of fe vi caused by high concentrations of ammonium was detrimental for fe vi based oxidation technology however as discussed in section 3 2 the actual ammonium concentration in industrial organic wastewater was lower and this inhibition by ammonium would be weaker in addition the results of removing smx with fe vi in synthetic wastewater showed that the inhibitory effect was far weaker than the promoting effects of bicarbonate and chloride therefore the fe vi fe iii process can still have stronger efficiency in high salinity organic wastewater than the fe vi process alone 3 4 roles of fe v and fe iv 3 4 1 transformation of pmso methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso generates a specific compound methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via single electron transfer which is different from the substance produced by the reaction of free radicals with pmso sharma 2011 therefore pmso is commonly used to detect high valent metal cations in this study pmso was used to study the role of fe v fe iv in the fe vi fe iii system for the treatment of pollutants in synthetic organic wastewater the impacts of different inorganic components in salinity solution on the degradation of pmso and the production of pmso2 by the fe vi and fe vi fe iii processes are shown in fig 3 a and b after fe vi alone was used as the oxidant for 1 h 29 0 of pmso was transformed to pmso2 however the conversion efficiency of pmso was increased to 60 8 after 1 h of fe vi fe iii oxidation huang et al 2021 also reported accelerated conversion of pmso to pmso2 by fe vi after the addition of fe iii this suggests the formation of fe v fe iv which is the main reason why the fe vi fe iii system degrades pollutants more efficiently than fe vi alone both bicarbonate 74 8 and chloride 71 8 significantly enhance the transformation percent of pmso2 from pmso these results indicate that bicarbonate and chloride ions accelerated the transformation of fe vi to fe v and fe iv ammonium significantly inhibited the conversion of pmso in the fe vi fe iii system and the conversion efficiency was only 9 2 indicating that the consumption of fe vi fe v and fe iv by ammonium 3 4 2 kinetics it is very difficult to determine the specific fe v and fe iv species present under the experimental conditions because the half lives of both fe v and fe iv were very short 1 μs to ms and the amounts produced were also low melton and bielski 1990 rush and bielski 1994 which made it difficult to successfully characterize fe v fe iv species with the stopped flow kinetic tracing method sharma 2011 therefore we simulated the iron species produced during the reaction of fe vi with fe iii by using program kintecus and reaction rate constant fig s4 and the reaction rate constant are shown in table s2 the trend for conversion of fe vi is shown in fig s4a the decomposition of fe vi was accelerated with increasing concentrations of fe iii this simulation result is consistent with the fe vi decomposition rate measured at 510 nm as shown in fig s4 fig s4b and c show that the formation of fe iv and fe v was strengthened by increasing the dose of fe iii which is consistent with a previous report zhang et al 2021 the formation of fe iv was 2 3 orders of magnitude faster than that of fe v meaning that fe iv was the main intermediate iron species in the fe vi fe iii process however the increase in fe iii dosage also accelerated the rapid decomposition of fe iv and fe v this is due to reactions between species with different oxidation states of iron eqs s6 s10 s12 and s14 and rapid self decomposition of fe iv and fe v at high concentrations this simulation result is also consistent with the result in fig 1b indicating that the rate for removal of smx was slightly reduced when a high concentration of fe iii was added in the fe vi fe iii process 3 5 the pathway for smx degradation the transformation products tps of smx produced by the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 systems in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution were analyzed by uplc qtof ms and the pathway for transformation of smx is shown in fig 4 the structure of each tp was determined by ion scanning based on its ms spectrum fig s5 and fragment information fig s6 compared with the results for the control samples a total of 17 smx tps were identified tp 98 tp 107 tp 123 tp 157 tp 267 1 tp 267 2 tp 269 1 tp 269 2 tp 269 3 tp 269 4 tp 281 tp 283 1 tp 283 2 tp 283 3 tp 285 tp 297 and tp 299 the possible pathways for transformation of smx by fe vi alone were inferred by analyzing the tps and they included 1 cleavage and oxidation of the c o bond in the isoxazole ring 2 oxidation of aniline and further oxidation of hydroxylamine 3 cleavage of the n s bond 4 cleavage of the c s bond and 5 hydroxyl addition of aromatic groups the isoxazole ring of smx was cleaved hydroxyl groups were added and the mixture was dehydrogenated to form tp 269 2 tp 98 and tp 157 were formed by breaking of the n s bond of smx tp 269 3 was generated by the oxidation of the nh2 bond in smx and further oxidation of hydroxylamine to form nitroso product tp 267 1 the nitroso group of tp 267 1 was further oxidized to form the nitro product tp 283 3 gong et al 2020 also reported that the formation of tp 283 3 via the oxidation of nitroso group the s c bonds of tp 267 1 and tp 283 3 were also broken to form tp 107 and tp 123 respectively the nitroso product tp 107 was also oxidized to form the nitro product tp 123 oxygen was added to tp 283 3 via benzene epoxidation or benzyl oxidation to form tp 299 sharma et al 2006a reported the formation of tp 299 during the oxidation of smx by fe vi these tps were similar to the products of smx formed during the fe vi oxidation reported by luo et al 2019 however new products tp 269 1 tp 269 4 tp 267 2 tp 283 2 tp 283 1 tp 281 and tp 297 were identified in the fe vi fe iii system the tps in the fe vi fe iii cl system were the same as those in the fe vi fe iii system but the corresponding peak areas were different luo et al 2019 also found the occurrence of tp 285 in the system of bicarbonate complexed ferrate comparing the peak areas of the tps and the original substance in the fe vi fe vi fe iii fe vi fe iii cl and fe vi fe iii hco3 systems fig s5 indicates that the addition of fe iii made the transformation of smx more thorough and cl and hco3 further promoted this transformation the detailed mechanism is shown in fig s7 and we inferred different mechanisms for transformation of smx by fe vi scheme 1 and fe iv scheme 2 through the analyses of tps and in combination with previous studies sharma et al 2006b zhang et al 2021 scheme 1 contains three parts including oxidations of the isoxazole ring aniline ring and hydroxylamine ring this scheme was consistent with the report of sharma et al 2006b for oxidation of the isoxazole ring a complex with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry was first formed by complexation of fe vi smx and water molecules which is the complex geometry assumed by kamachi et al 2005 the water molecules in the complex attacked the β carbon of the eniminium cation to produce an unstable intermediate and then the c o bond in this intermediate was broken to yield tp 269 2 in the oxidation of aniline the nh2 group was attacked by fe vi via single electron transfer to form hydroxylamine which was reasonable for the formation of tp 269 3 hydroxylamine complexed to fe vi to form an unstable intermediate and then subsequently formed a nitroso group the water molecules and fe vi attacked the nitroso group to form a nitro group this was consistent with the formation of tp 267 1 tp 283 1 tp 283 3 tp 107 and tp 123 scheme 2 contains three parts including oxidations of the isoxazole ring the benzene ring and the methyl group in the oxidation of the isoxazole ring the highly reactive fe iv abstracted hydrogen to generate a carbon radical and fe iii oh and then two carbon radicals in the isoxazole ring abstracted the hydroxyl of fe iii oh to yield fe ii and an unstable intermediate with a gem diol structure subsequently the intermediate lost a water molecule to form tp 285 the oxidation of the benzene ring was triggered by the electrophilic attack of fe iv on the aromatic ring fe iv extracted the hydrogen at the meta position of the benzene ring and then hydroxylated it to form tp 269 1 fe iv attacked the ch bond on the methyl group to form a carbon radical and then hydroxylated it to form tp 269 4 and tp 283 1 which were further oxidized to form aldehydes tp 267 2 and tp 281 and then oxidized to form tp 283 2 and tp 297 this is consistent with the attackable sites of smx reported by yu et al 2017 and sharma et al 2006a the oxidation of smx by fe iv to form tp 267 2 tp 283 1 and tp 269 4 was also reported in recent reports zhang et al 2022 overall the degradation products of smx are more abundant in the fe vi fe iii system than that in the fe vi alone system luo et al 2019 also reported that the formation of intermediate valence iron in fe vi technology led to the emergence of new transformation products of smx which is similar to the results of this study chloride and bicarbonate can further intensify this degradation and some products are found which do not occur in the fe vi fe iii system this is consistent with the findings of earlier chapters in this manuscript however there are also certain differences in the products in the fe vi fe iii cl and the fe vi fe iii hco3 systems which means that the promotion mechanism may be different so further discussion is required 3 6 possible mechanism of chloride and bicarbonate promotion abts is often used to quantify different types of oxidants such as percarboxylic acid bromine chlorine and fe vi zheng et al 2021 abts can generate the stable green free radical abts via single electron oxidation in the reaction between abts and fe vi fe v was the main iron intermediate and it was determined that the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi consumption abts consumption and abts production was 1 1 1 huang et al 2018 the fe v produced and then self decomposed in the phosphate buffer solution indicating that phosphate promoted the self decay of fe v in water instead of the abts reaction herein abts was chosen as a model compound to study the effect of chloride and bicarbonate on fe vi oxidation seven different solutions phosphate 10 0 mm 10 mm phosphate containing 0 01 m 0 1 m chloride or 10 mm phosphate containing 0 05 m 0 25 m bicarbonate were used to investigate the mechanisms of fe iv fe v formation in different solutions in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer solution the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi consumption abts consumption and abts production was 1 1 04 1 008 fig s8a which agreed well with the 1 1 1 ratio reported in previous studies huang et al 2018 lee et al 2005 the stoichiometric ratio among fe vi abts and abts was changed to 1 1 25 1 29 in the presence of fe iii fig s8b because of the more total iron with the electronic transfer capability were produced in fe vi fe iii system than that in fe vi alone recent research reported that k fe vi abts 5 96 105 m 1 s 1 k fe v abts 2 04 105 m 1 s 1 and k fe iv abts 4 64 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 in 10 mm phosphate buffer solution luo et al 2021b indicating that both fe iv and fe v produced in the fe vi fe iii system accelerate the oxidation of abts and the formation of abts the effects of chloride and bicarbonate on the transformations of abts in the fe vi and fe vi fe iii processes are shown in figs 5 and 6 in the absence of fe iii fig 5 both the oxidation of abts and the formation of abts slowed with increasing chloride dosage indicating that the presence of chloride ions had a negative effect on the oxidation of fe vi this is consistent with results reported by luo et al 2019 which indicated that chloride ions inhibit the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by fe vi the formation of abts decreased when the oxidation of abts did not change significantly with increasing doses of bicarbonate indicating that bicarbonate shifted the reactivity of ferrate previous research reported that the complex product of bicarbonate and fe v reduced the formation of abts instead forming an abts oxide shao et al 2019 in the presence of fe iii fig 6 the oxidation of abts was increased with increasing chloride dosage and the stoichiometric ratio for fe vi abts and abts was larger than 1 1 1 this suggested that fe iii increased the formation of fe iv and fe v which reacted with abts and generated an equimolar amount of abts to offset the negative effects of rapid self degradation of the phosphate complexed ferrate however the formation of abts was slower than abts consumption in the presence of fe iii and bicarbonate indicating that bicarbonate complexed fe iv or fe v could also react with abts to generate a transparent abts oxide to replace abts overall the addition of fe iii enhanced the formation of fe v and fe iv in the fe vi oxidation process the slight inhibition caused by the influence of chloride ions on the ionic strength in the fe vi oxidation process was offset by the formation of fe v and fe iv with higher redox capabilities after adding fe iii bicarbonate complexed fe v and fe iv and these complexes strengthened the oxidizing ability of fe v and fe iv thereby promoting the oxidizing effect of the fe vi fe iii system 3 7 removal of pharmaceuticals from real industrial wastewater real pharmaceutical industrial wastewater 1 l was collected from chongqing china and maintained at 4 c and adjusted ph to 9 0 it was filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter and spiked with 5 μm smx as the model compound for the degradation experiment the relevant parameters of the real industrial wastewater are shown in table s3 and the degradation of smx in real wastewater by different dosages of fe vi fe iii is shown in fig 7 the rate for removal of smx by fe vi alone was only 2 8 1 0 10 3 min 1 this discrepancy with the result for synthetic wastewater suggested that a large amount of organic matter led to a reaction competing with that of smx which reduced the effect of fe vi after adding fe iii the rate for removal of smx was increased by a factor of 7 6 to 2 1 0 01 10 2 min 1 we kept the molar ratio of fe vi fe iii at 1 2 and changed the dosages of fe vi and fe iii the rate for removal of smx increased from 1 5 0 4 10 2 min 1 to 9 9 0 4 10 2 min 1 as the dosage ratio of fe vi fe iii was increased from 150 μm 300 μm to 500 μm 1 mm compared with the effect of fe vi alone the rate of smx removal by the fe vi fe iii system was greatly improved the efficiency for removal of smx was further improved by further increasing the dosages of fe vi and fe iii however excessive increases in the dosage of fe vi and fe iii caused a large amount of fe oh 3 to precipitate in alkaline industrial wastewater which did not indicate whether the removal of pharmaceuticals was caused by oxidation or adsorptive precipitation so no further experiments were performed with higher dosages of fe vi and fe iii the total iron dosage in this experiment was converted into a mass of 0 1 g l 1 which was lower than the dosage of iron based inorganic agents used in traditional wastewater treatment processes in general the fe vi fe iii system effectively treated organic pollutants in high salinity wastewater 4 conclusions in this study the fe vi fe iii process was used to treat the micro organic pollutants in high salinity alkaline organic wastewater this study showed that fe iii enhanced fe vi on the reduction of organic pollutants in wastewater because fe v fe iv was produced during the fe vi fe iii process the main conclusions are as follows chloride and bicarbonate promoted the removal of pollutants in the fe vi fe iii process although the presence of chloride affected the ionization constant of fe vi and reduced the concentration of single protonated hfeo4 hfeo4 had a faster hydrolysis rate than feo4 2 which resulted in more feo4 2 reacting with fe iii to form fe v fe iv with the concentration of chloride increasing thereby promoting the removal of pollutants bicarbonate complexed fe v fe iv produced in the fe vi fe iii process these complexes enhanced the removal of pollutants more total iron with electron transfer capability in the fe vi fe iii system than in the fe vi system alone fe iv was the main intermediate form of iron and its concentration was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than fe v in summary this work conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the removal and transformation of pollutants by fe vi fe iii in high salinity alkaline wastewater the fe vi fe iii process can well resist the influence of salt the common salt chloride and bicarbonate not only did not limit but also promoted the degradation efficiency of pollutants this provided valuable insights for the fe vi fe iii process to treat industrial wastewater containing micro organic pollutants in addition since the redox potential of ferrates fe vi fe v and fe iv under acidic conditions is much higher than that of alkaline the fe vi fe iii process still has a good treatment efficiency for neutral or slightly acidic wastewater however the excessively fast self decomposition rate of ferrates under acidic conditions causes unnecessary oxidant loss so it is not recommended to use the fe vi fe iii process in acidic wastewater the next work will further explore the treatment efficiency of fe vi fe iii process on several typical actual industrial organic wastewater such as coking wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and food processing wastewater and focus on the reaction rate of fe iii with hfeo4 or complexes of bicarbonate and ferrate declaration of competing interest all of our authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled removal of micro

16199,adsorption and catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc of aqueous 2 4 dcp by palladium nanoparticles pd0nps associated with a biofilm i e a pd0 biofilm was investigated in terms of the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp dechlorinated product selectivity and reduction kinetics experiments were executed with pd0 biofilm and with abiotic pd0nps film alone the 2 4 dcp adsorption capacity of pd0 biofilm was 2 to 5 fold greater than that of abiotic pd0nps film and the adsorption accelerated dechlorination by pd0 biofilm including selectivity to phenol instead of mono chlorophenols a mechanistic kinetic model was developed to represent the sequential adsorption and reduction processes modeling results represented well the removal of 2 4 dcp and quantified that pd0 biofilm had a strong affinity for adsorbing 2 4 dcp the strong adsorption increased the volume averaged concentration of 2 4 dcp concentration inside the pd0 biofilm compared to the concentration in the bulk liquid this increase in the local concentration of 2 4 dcp led to a 2 to 4 fold increase in the reduction rate of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm compared to abiotic pd0nps film thus coupling pd0nps with the biofilm promoted 2 4 dcp removal and full dechlorination despite its low concentration in bulk water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords palladium nanoparticle biofilm adsorption hydrodechlorination kinetic model 1 introduction because of its large scale production and broad applicability 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp is one of the most common chlorophenols in aquatic environments gao et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2012 house et al 1997 2 4 dcp also is an emerging disinfection by product dbp in chlorinated swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 and tap water lin 1982 tang and huang 1996 zhang et al 2005 with concentrations reaching up to 2 2 0 3 mg l 1 due to its cytotoxicity carcinogenicity and slow biodegradation the u s environmental protection agency epa lists 2 4 dcp as a priority pollutant and has set a maximum contaminant level mcl of 0 1 mg l 1 for drinking water u s epa 2012 since the c cl bond makes chlorinated organics stable and persistent ding et al 2018 he et al 2018 long et al 2021 dechlorination of 2 4 dcp is an effective method to initiate detoxification of 2 4 dcp catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc by precious metal catalysts is a promising approach for dechlorination because hydrogen gas h2 is the sole chemical input required and hdc has fast kinetics mild operating conditions and no secondary waste stream luo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021a the mechanism of hdc is based on having atomic hydrogen h which is generated on the catalyst s surface by homolytic cleavage of adsorbed h2 h is activated and able to replace cl in chlorinated organics fu et al 2019 elemental palladium pd0 is the most studied catalyst due to its great h2 absorption capacity and ability to form h chaplin et al 2012 despite its advantages conventional pd0 catalytic dechlorination has been thwarted by two challenges the first challenge is poor efficiency of h2 supply due to its low water solubility which limits reduction kinetics and also can create safety concerns if it off gases zhou et al 2019 the second challenge is low catalyst longevity due to losses in practical application pd0 nanoparticles pd0nps are immobilized on packed supports cantillo and kappe 2014 greco et al 2015 or structured interfaces marks et al 2019 wang et al 2018 having large surface areas that allows high activity because of the fine structure and large contact surface with liquid these catalysts are liable to mechanical shedding wang et al 2018 and or chemical leaching cantillo and kappe 2014 greco et al 2015 moreover preparing and stabilizing these catalysts commonly require environmental unfriendly and energy consuming steps zhou et al 2021a another approach to enhance hdc performance is to take advantage of catalyst s adsorption capacity studies have confirmed that adsorption affects catalyst reactivity for example pd0 supported on granular activated carbon by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide functionalization zhou et al 2021b gave strong adsorption of 2 4 dcp that dramatically accelerated hdc rates however the effect of adsorption of reactants onto pd based catalysts has received rare attention and process of sequential adsorption and reduction over pd based catalysts has not been clear the h2 delivery challenge can be overcome by adapting the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which efficiently delivers h2 to biofilms growing in bubble free gas transfer membranes lee and rittmann 2002 in particular relevance here the h2 based mbfr was used for in situ generation of pd0nps that spontaneously accumulated within the biofilm i e a pd0 biofilm zhou et al 2016a and exhibited stable catalytic activity for long term hdc of para chlorophenol long et al 2021 and 2 4 dcp wu et al 2022 in addition biomass can adsorb 2 4 dcp gao and wang 2007 kennedy et al 1992 ning et al 1996 wu and yu 2006 which may enhance its susceptibility to hydrodechlorination while kinetics of coupled adsorption and catalytic hdc processes over pd0 biofilm have not been studied creating a partnership among h2 delivery membranes biofilm and pd0nps in a pd containing mbfr offers promises for safe cost effective and sustainable hdc we evaluated a h2 based palladized membrane biofilm reactor i e a pd mbfr for continuous hdc of 2 4 dcp experimentally we assessed the kinetics of adsorption and reduction and we documented the primary transformation pathway of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr the central feature of this work was a coupled adsorption and reduction model that we use to illuminate and quantify the mechanisms underlying hdc of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor figuration inoculation and feeding we operated in parallel two reactors of the same dual tube configuration illustrated in fig s1 supporting information as in a previous work wu et al 2021 each reactor contained a main bundle of 32 nonporous polypropylene hollow fiber membranes 200 μm outer diameter 100 110 μm inner diameter teijin japan in one column and a coupon bundle of 10 identical fibers used as sampling in the other column the reactor had a total membrane surface area of 54 cm2 with a working volume of 65 ml pure h2 gas was supplied to fiber bundles at different pressures controlled by a pressure regulator and it diffused through the fiber walls in a bubble free manner a solute s concentration in reactor was equal to its effluent concentration because the liquid of the reactor was well mixed by a recirculation rate of 150 ml min 1 provided by a peristaltic pump longer 1515x china the temperature was maintained at 25 2 c we inoculated one of the reactors with anoxic sludge from wusong wastewater treatment plant baoshan shanghai and fed the reactor continuously with a 0 5 mm no3 medium to accumulate biofilm on the membranes after two months mature biofilms formed in this mbfr the detail of inoculation and feeding were described in our previous work wu et al 2022 2 2 synthesis of pd0nps supported on h2 transfer membranes we introduced 0 8 mm pd ii as na2pdcl4 into the mbfr in batch mode with the h2 pressure of 20 psig 2 3 atm to produce biogenic pd0nps within the biofilm pd0 biofilm the composition of the pd ii containing medium is provided in wu et al wu et al 2022 the pd0 deposition process was carried out three times each batch lasted 2 days until a dark pd0 biofilm formed on the fibers and 99 of the soluble pd ii was immobilized after each addition the biofilm retained 32 8 mg total pd0 or 6 07 g pd0 m2 another membrane catalyst film reactor zhou et al 2021a mcfr the same configuration as in the section 2 1 was used to prepare an abiotic pd0nps film following the same methods but without a biofilm strictly auto catalytic reduction of pd ii led to the deposition 35 6 mg pd0 or 6 59 g pd0 m2 directly on the h2 transfer membrane 2 3 sample collection and characterization to characterize pd0nps deposited on the membranes we collected 5 cm long sections from coupon fibers after chemical fixation and ultra microtome slicing following the method described in a previous work wu et al 2021 these fiber sections were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy tem hitachi h 7650 japan and high resolution electron microscopy hrtem fei f20 the netherlands coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy we separated solids form fibers in the pd mbfr and the mcfr and then immediately freeze dried them for subsequent x ray diffraction xrd using an x pert pro mpd diffractometer with cu kα radiation 2 4 sampling and analyses liquid samples taken from the sampling ports of the reactors were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters the pd ii concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent 720es usa we measured the filtered samples for 2 4 dcp ortho chlorophenol 2 cp para chlorophenol 4 cp phenol and cyclohexanone using a high performance liquid chromatography with an agilent c18 column hplc shimadzu lc 20a japan cl was quantified by an ion chromatograph ic dionex aquion usa with an as 19 column ph and do was measured using a multi parameter meter hach hq40d usa 2 5 adsorption experiments for batch adsorption experiments performed in the pd mbfr and the mcfr the h2 supply was replaced with n2 and the medium was replaced by 65 ml of fresh medium contained 2 4 dcp at a target concentration 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 μm this medium was prepared by adding a 5 mm 2 4 dcp stock solution to the basic medium that had been purged with n2 wu et al 2022 between each experiment the reactors were rinsed with the basic medium in the continuous mode for 20 h 10 hrts to thoroughly remove adsorbed 2 4 dcp no cps was detected in the liquid by 20 h during each batch experiment we routinely measured the 2 4 dcp concentration in the liquid and computed the mass of adsorbed 2 4 dcp by difference all adsorption experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 6 adsorption kinetics modeling in the pd mbfr pd0 biofilm s adsorption of 2 4 dcp is described by 1 2 4 dcp p d 0 biofilm k 1 2 4 dc p ads p d 0 biofilm and the formation rate of adsorbed 2 4 dcp from 2 4 dcp and pd0 biofilm is given by 2 d c ads t d t k 1 c ads 0 c ads t c t where k 1 is the rate constant of adsorption l μmol 1 min 1 c t is the 2 4 dcp concentration in the liquid μm c ads 0 is saturated adsorption concentration of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm μm and c ads t is the volume averaged concentration of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm μm at time t min to obtain the saturated adsorption concentration c ads 0 we represented the adsorption capacities of pd0 biofilm for 2 4 dcp using the langmuir isotherm 3 q e q 0 b c e b c e 1 where q 0 is the maximum adsorption density per unit of membrane surface area µmol m 2 q e is the equilibrium adsorption density on the membrane surface μmol m 2 b is the langmuir equilibrium constant related to the energy of adsorption l μmol 1 and c e is the equilibrium solute concentration μm since the adsorption experiments gave c e and q e values eq 3 could be solved for b and q 0 using non linear fitting c ads 0 was derived from q 0 c ads 0 q 0 s v f where s is membrane surface area 54 cm2 and v f is volume of the pd0 biofilm 14 5 ml measured at the completion of the experiments c ads t in eq 2 could be eliminated as an independent variable by using the mass balance c ads t v f c 0 c t v w where v w is the working volume of the pd mbfr 50 5 ml then to obtain k 1 we integrated eq 2 to give a relationship between c t and time min

at equilibrium 2 7 dechlorination experiments a series of steady state dechlorination experiments investigated the kinetics of 2 4 dcp reduction in the pd0 mbfr and the mcfr the experiments were organized into three series summarized in table 1 prior to each substage the reactor was returned to the baseline condition which was the basic medium containing 100 μm 2 4 dcp 15 psig for h2 and 0 53 ml min 1 influent flow each substage lasted 8 hrts which was long enough for concentrations to reach steady state for the liquid phase replicate samples were collected at 6 7 and 8 hrts and the results are presented as the average values the standard deviation 2 8 modeling for kinetics of a coupled adsorption and reduction process pd0 catalyzed hydrogenation reactions follow pseudo first order kinetics wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 the reduction rate of adsorbed 2 4 dcp in a batch reaction for a pd mbfr is 5 d c ads t d t k ap c ads t where k ap denotes the apparent first order rate constant min 1 in a continuous reactor at steady state the adsorption rate of 2 4 dcp eq 2 equals its reduction rate eq 5 6 k 1 c ads 0 c ads c eff k ap c ads where c eff is the stable concentrations of 2 4 dcp in effluent μm c ads 0 is the saturated concentration of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm μm and c ads are the stable concentrations of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm μm rearranging eq 6 yields 7 c ads 0 c ads c eff c ads k ap k 1 k m the constant k m μm is the ratio of reduction and adsorption rate constants solving eq 7 yields the concentration of the 2 4 dcp adsorbed in the pd0 biofilm at steady state 8 c ads c ads 0 c eff k m c eff then the overall rate of 2 4 dcp removal in pd0 biofilm is 9 r k ap c ads k ap c ads 0 c eff k m c eff eq 9 describes the steady state reaction rate once the product of k ap and k m are obtained since c eff is a readily measurable quantity if the 2 4 dcp concentration is high enough that the adsorption of 2 4 dcp by pd0 biofilm is saturated i e c ads c ads 0 then the maximum reduction rate r m is 10 r m k ap c ads 0 dividing eq 9 by eq 10 yields 11 r r m c eff k m c eff eq 11 quantifies the relationship between the 2 4 dcp concentration and the reaction rate in relation to the maximum rate and it has a form similar to the michaelis menten and monod equations rittmann and mccarty 2020 thus r m and k m can be determined from measured c eff and r values from a set of steady state tests c eff is measured directly and r is calculated according to the mass balance on 2 4 dcp 12 r q c inf c eff v where q is the influent flow of the reactor ml min 1 c inf is the influent 2 4 dcp concentration μm and v is the reactor s liquid volume ml the mathematical model can be used for design of the operation parameters for a given influent the influent flow rate or hrt required to meet the effluent concentration below mcl can be computed by simultaneously solving eq 11 and eq 12 the volumetric loading of 2 4 dcp r l is calculated with eq 13 13 r l q c inf v 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pd0 biofilm and pd0 film the tem images in fig 1 characterize the location morphology and size of pd0nps generated in the pd mbfr and the mcfr in pd0 biofilm the pd0nps were highly dispersed with a statistical average pd0 crystallite size of 4 6 0 7 nm based on 270 counts fig 1c most pd0nps were distributed in the extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix and some were on the bacterial cell surfaces fig 1a in pd0 film the pd0 crystallites aggregated into larger particles and formed a continuous multi layer film figs 1b and 1d with average size of 13 1 1 3 nm 150 counts these results indicate that the biofilm in pd0 biofilm stabilized smaller pd0nps probably due to rapid encapsulation of pdnps in the eps at nucleation and initial surface growth with the sizes maintained by electrostatic stabilization through extracellular proteins zhou et al 2016b the presence of pd0nps was confirmed by the edx spectra embedded figures in figs 1c and d and the xrd spectra fig 1e confirmed that the nanoparticles were pd0 the xrd patterns exhibited the four distinct diffraction peaks of pd crystal structure with dominant facets of 1 1 1 40 1 1 1 1 46 7 2 0 0 68 1 2 2 0 and 82 1 3 1 1 the average sizes of the pd0 crystallites estimated from the full width at half maximum of the 1 1 1 facet were 3 8 and 16 2 nm for pd0 biofilm and pd0 film respectively which are similar to the statistical results from the tem images 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of 2 4 dcp to describe the adsorption of 2 4 dcp to pd0 biofilm and pd0nps we conducted separate batch tests in which the initial 2 4 dcp concentration was 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 μm the patterns of 2 4 dcp concentrations shown in fig s2 document that the adsorption capacity of pd0 biofilm was 2 to 5 fold larger than that of pd0 film likely due to adsorption to the biofilm s cells and eps caused by hydrophobic interactions between 2 4 dcp and the biofilm s negatively charged components which could be the protonation of carboxyl phosphate and hydroxyl functional groups benoit et al 1998 calace et al 2002 wang et al 2002 it also is possible that the smaller pd0nps in the biofilm had greater adsorption capacity for 2 4 dcp a langmuir isotherm using the q 0 and b values reported in fig 2 represented equilibrium adsorption well r2 value 0 99 fig 2 clearly shows that the adsorbed concentration in pd0 biofilm reached saturation as the equilibrium concentration increased above about 15 µm and the saturation adsorption capacity was 174 μmol m 2 which indicates c ads 0 was 63 7 μm the fitted lines in fig 3 show that the adsorption model for pd0 biofilm eq 3 represented the experimental results well r2 value 0 97 and no systematic errors the best fit value of k 1 ranged from 0 0037 to 0 0043 l µmol 1 min 1 with an average of 0 0039 l μmol 1 min 1 since the k 1 range was small using k 1 for all experiments yielded almost equally good fits not shown 3 3 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in continuous reduction experiments we altered the 2 4 dcp loading by changing the influent flow rate or influent 2 4 dcp concentration fig 4 presents the effluent concentration of cps c eff and released cl in general increasing the 2 4 dcp loading rate decreased the 2 4 dcp percentage removal in both reactors but the influent flow rate had a stronger impact pd mbfr always had greater 2 4 dcp removal fig 4 also shows that pd mbfr had almost no monochlorphenols mcps i e 2 cp and 4 cp despite greater removal of 2 4 dcp and effluent phenol concentrations also were lower that with the mcfr mass balance calculations showed 86 103 recovery of cl input in 2 4 dcp with most of the effluent cl being in released cl this confirms that 2 4 dcp was removed via catalytic dechlorination with the influent 2 4 dcp concentration of 25 μm an upper value of practical raw water contamination the sum of effluent concentrations of cps were 0 51 and 2 5 μm for pd mbfr and mcfr respectively fig 4b these results confirm that the pd mbfr can reduce 2 4 dcp in raw water to below the u s epa mcl of 0 61 μm with a high influent concentration of 25 µm fig 5 summarizes the 2 4 dcp removals and product selectivities towards mcps for different volumetric loading rates of 2 4 dcp for the pd mbfr when the 2 4 dcp loadings increased from 0 1 to 0 5 μmol l 1 min 1 the reduction rates proportionally increased bringing about stable removals of 95 and with no mcps in general the accumulation of mcps were relatively small in the both reactors because the first dechlorination was rate limiting wu et al 2021 however the higher product selectivities to mcps in the mcfr probably were caused by a relatively high desorption rate for the mcps our previous study documented that 2 4 dcp processed a lager adsorption capacity and affinity for the pd0np surface compared to that of 2 cp or 4 cp wu et al 2022 wu et al 2021 a higher 2 4 dcp concentration intensified competitive adsorption of 2 4 dcp onto pd0np surface which accelerated the desorption of mcps without further dechlorination because the biofilm in pd0 biofilm dispersed the pd0nps and maintained them with smaller sizes discussed in section 3 1 the contact surface for 2 4 dcp was larger which minimized competitive adsorption moreover mcps released from the pd0np surface could be trapped in the biofilm and further dechlorinated 3 4 kinetics and mechanisms for multistep removal of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm distinct kinetic patterns illustrated in fig 6 reveal that the removal of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr followed saturation kinetics at 2 4 dcp concentrations below 5 μm the reduction rate increased almost linearly with 2 4 dcp concentration as the 2 4 dcp concentrations increased however removal kinetics began to saturate and almost reached a plateau saturation kinetics of 2 4 dcp removal can be represented by eq 11 fig 6 shows the best fit values of k m and r m km 7 31 µm and rm 1 47 μmol l 1 min 1 which gave r2 0 98 and no systematic errors in contrast the reduction rate of 2 4 dcp in the mcfr followed first order kinetics r2 0 97 up to about 36 µm at which point the kinetics rapidly saturated k m reflects the affinity of the pd0 biofilm for 2 4 dcp and the low value of k m 7 31 μm supports strong affinity for 2 4 dcp which allows a rapid reduction rate for relatively low 2 4 dcp concentrations 20 µm the rate is 2 to 4 fold greater than in the mcfr for ceff 10 µm this feature makes the pd mbfr well suited to treat waters with relatively low 2 4 dcp concentrations the 2 4 dcp reduction rates were proportional to the concentration of 2 4 dcp an apparent first order reduction rate constant in the pd mbfr k ap 0 028 min 1 listed in table 2 and calculated according to eq 7 was slightly smaller than k 1 in the mcfr 0 033 min 1 the values of k ap and r m were then used to compute concentrations of adsorbed 2 4 dcp c ads inside pd0 biofilm by using eq 5 the calculated c ads 0 55 6 μm was not much lower than the fitted value of c ads 0 from adsorption experiments 63 7 μm which also indicates the adsorption was a strong determinant of the reduction rate fig 7 a displays the quantitative relationship between c ads and c eff the calculated c ads values were significantly higher than that the bulk phase concentration of 2 4 dcp c eff 40 µm therefore adsorption of 2 4 dcp accelerated the kinetics of 2 4 dcp reduction by concentrating 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm the reason for 2 4 dcp enrichment inside pd0 biofilm can be explained by relative kinetics we calculated initial adsorption rates eq 2 and initial reduction rates eq 5 by letting c ads c eff and the calculated results for different 2 4 dcp concentrations are displayed in fig 7b when c eff 47 µm the adsorption rates exceeded the reduction rate which resulted in the enrichment of 2 4 dcp in the pd0 biofilm the reduction rate matched the adsorption rate c eff 47 µm only when the adsorption rate saturated this indicates that the overall kinetics were controlled by adsorption for most concentrations of 2 4 dcp the calculated maximum reduction rate 1 26 μmol l 1 min 1 almost equals the measured one 1 24 μmol l 1 min 1 shown in fig 6 supporting that the model well reflects the simultaneous of adsorption and reduction of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm based on the distribution of pd0nps in pd0 biofilm the kinetics results and modeling we propose the multistep transformation pathway of 2 4 dcp shown in fig 8 adsorption of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm is the first step then 2 4 dcp is absorbed by pd0 with activation of the c cl bond and the formation of cl pd bond wu et al 2021 and the c cl bond is broken through coupled electron transfer from activated h also adsorbed to the pd0 surface the faster adsorption kinetic leads to the enrichment of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm and the concentrated 2 4 dcp accelerates the hdc rate conclusion in the h2 based pd mbfr in situ generated pd0nps associated with the biofilm to form a stable pd0 biofilm that provided greater removal of 2 4 dcp than pd0nps film alone the pd0 biofilm was an efficient adsorbent for 2 4 dcp and this increased the catalytic contact of 2 4 dcp with activated h on pd0 surface operated in the continuous flow mode the pd mbfr achieved up to 99 reduction of 2 4 dcp to phenol and could reduce 2 4 dcp to below 0 l mg l 1 kinetic modeling simulated well the adsorption and reduction of 2 4 dcp in continuous flow conditions it showed that the pd mbfr gave a greater reduction rate than that did the mcfr particularly for lower 2 4 dcp loadings because adsorption of 2 4 dcp by the biofilm enhanced the availability of 2 4 dcp to the catalyst thus experimental results and mechanistic modeling

16199,adsorption and catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc of aqueous 2 4 dcp by palladium nanoparticles pd0nps associated with a biofilm i e a pd0 biofilm was investigated in terms of the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp dechlorinated product selectivity and reduction kinetics experiments were executed with pd0 biofilm and with abiotic pd0nps film alone the 2 4 dcp adsorption capacity of pd0 biofilm was 2 to 5 fold greater than that of abiotic pd0nps film and the adsorption accelerated dechlorination by pd0 biofilm including selectivity to phenol instead of mono chlorophenols a mechanistic kinetic model was developed to represent the sequential adsorption and reduction processes modeling results represented well the removal of 2 4 dcp and quantified that pd0 biofilm had a strong affinity for adsorbing 2 4 dcp the strong adsorption increased the volume averaged concentration of 2 4 dcp concentration inside the pd0 biofilm compared to the concentration in the bulk liquid this increase in the local concentration of 2 4 dcp led to a 2 to 4 fold increase in the reduction rate of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm compared to abiotic pd0nps film thus coupling pd0nps with the biofilm promoted 2 4 dcp removal and full dechlorination despite its low concentration in bulk water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords palladium nanoparticle biofilm adsorption hydrodechlorination kinetic model 1 introduction because of its large scale production and broad applicability 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp is one of the most common chlorophenols in aquatic environments gao et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2012 house et al 1997 2 4 dcp also is an emerging disinfection by product dbp in chlorinated swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 and tap water lin 1982 tang and huang 1996 zhang et al 2005 with concentrations reaching up to 2 2 0 3 mg l 1 due to its cytotoxicity carcinogenicity and slow biodegradation the u s environmental protection agency epa lists 2 4 dcp as a priority pollutant and has set a maximum contaminant level mcl of 0 1 mg l 1 for drinking water u s epa 2012 since the c cl bond makes chlorinated organics stable and persistent ding et al 2018 he et al 2018 long et al 2021 dechlorination of 2 4 dcp is an effective method to initiate detoxification of 2 4 dcp catalytic hydrodechlorination hdc by precious metal catalysts is a promising approach for dechlorination because hydrogen gas h2 is the sole chemical input required and hdc has fast kinetics mild operating conditions and no secondary waste stream luo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021a the mechanism of hdc is based on having atomic hydrogen h which is generated on the catalyst s surface by homolytic cleavage of adsorbed h2 h is activated and able to replace cl in chlorinated organics fu et al 2019 elemental palladium pd0 is the most studied catalyst due to its great h2 absorption capacity and ability to form h chaplin et al 2012 despite its advantages conventional pd0 catalytic dechlorination has been thwarted by two challenges the first challenge is poor efficiency of h2 supply due to its low water solubility which limits reduction kinetics and also can create safety concerns if it off gases zhou et al 2019 the second challenge is low catalyst longevity due to losses in practical application pd0 nanoparticles pd0nps are immobilized on packed supports cantillo and kappe 2014 greco et al 2015 or structured interfaces marks et al 2019 wang et al 2018 having large surface areas that allows high activity because of the fine structure and large contact surface with liquid these catalysts are liable to mechanical shedding wang et al 2018 and or chemical leaching cantillo and kappe 2014 greco et al 2015 moreover preparing and stabilizing these catalysts commonly require environmental unfriendly and energy consuming steps zhou et al 2021a another approach to enhance hdc performance is to take advantage of catalyst s adsorption capacity studies have confirmed that adsorption affects catalyst reactivity for example pd0 supported on granular activated carbon by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide functionalization zhou et al 2021b gave strong adsorption of 2 4 dcp that dramatically accelerated hdc rates however the effect of adsorption of reactants onto pd based catalysts has received rare attention and process of sequential adsorption and reduction over pd based catalysts has not been clear the h2 delivery challenge can be overcome by adapting the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which efficiently delivers h2 to biofilms growing in bubble free gas transfer membranes lee and rittmann 2002 in particular relevance here the h2 based mbfr was used for in situ generation of pd0nps that spontaneously accumulated within the biofilm i e a pd0 biofilm zhou et al 2016a and exhibited stable catalytic activity for long term hdc of para chlorophenol long et al 2021 and 2 4 dcp wu et al 2022 in addition biomass can adsorb 2 4 dcp gao and wang 2007 kennedy et al 1992 ning et al 1996 wu and yu 2006 which may enhance its susceptibility to hydrodechlorination while kinetics of coupled adsorption and catalytic hdc processes over pd0 biofilm have not been studied creating a partnership among h2 delivery membranes biofilm and pd0nps in a pd containing mbfr offers promises for safe cost effective and sustainable hdc we evaluated a h2 based palladized membrane biofilm reactor i e a pd mbfr for continuous hdc of 2 4 dcp experimentally we assessed the kinetics of adsorption and reduction and we documented the primary transformation pathway of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr the central feature of this work was a coupled adsorption and reduction model that we use to illuminate and quantify the mechanisms underlying hdc of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor figuration inoculation and feeding we operated in parallel two reactors of the same dual tube configuration illustrated in fig s1 supporting information as in a previous work wu et al 2021 each reactor contained a main bundle of 32 nonporous polypropylene hollow fiber membranes 200 μm outer diameter 100 110 μm inner diameter teijin japan in one column and a coupon bundle of 10 identical fibers used as sampling in the other column the reactor had a total membrane surface area of 54 cm2 with a working volume of 65 ml pure h2 gas was supplied to fiber bundles at different pressures controlled by a pressure regulator and it diffused through the fiber walls in a bubble free manner a solute s concentration in reactor was equal to its effluent concentration because the liquid of the reactor was well mixed by a recirculation rate of 150 ml min 1 provided by a peristaltic pump longer 1515x china the temperature was maintained at 25 2 c we inoculated one of the reactors with anoxic sludge from wusong wastewater treatment plant baoshan shanghai and fed the reactor continuously with a 0 5 mm no3 medium to accumulate biofilm on the membranes after two months mature biofilms formed in this mbfr the detail of inoculation and feeding were described in our previous work wu et al 2022 2 2 synthesis of pd0nps supported on h2 transfer membranes we introduced 0 8 mm pd ii as na2pdcl4 into the mbfr in batch mode with the h2 pressure of 20 psig 2 3 atm to produce biogenic pd0nps within the biofilm pd0 biofilm the composition of the pd ii containing medium is provided in wu et al wu et al 2022 the pd0 deposition process was carried out three times each batch lasted 2 days until a dark pd0 biofilm formed on the fibers and 99 of the soluble pd ii was immobilized after each addition the biofilm retained 32 8 mg total pd0 or 6 07 g pd0 m2 another membrane catalyst film reactor zhou et al 2021a mcfr the same configuration as in the section 2 1 was used to prepare an abiotic pd0nps film following the same methods but without a biofilm strictly auto catalytic reduction of pd ii led to the deposition 35 6 mg pd0 or 6 59 g pd0 m2 directly on the h2 transfer membrane 2 3 sample collection and characterization to characterize pd0nps deposited on the membranes we collected 5 cm long sections from coupon fibers after chemical fixation and ultra microtome slicing following the method described in a previous work wu et al 2021 these fiber sections were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy tem hitachi h 7650 japan and high resolution electron microscopy hrtem fei f20 the netherlands coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy we separated solids form fibers in the pd mbfr and the mcfr and then immediately freeze dried them for subsequent x ray diffraction xrd using an x pert pro mpd diffractometer with cu kα radiation 2 4 sampling and analyses liquid samples taken from the sampling ports of the reactors were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters the pd ii concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes agilent 720es usa we measured the filtered samples for 2 4 dcp ortho chlorophenol 2 cp para chlorophenol 4 cp phenol and cyclohexanone using a high performance liquid

meter hach hq40d usa 2 5 adsorption experiments for batch adsorption experiments performed in the pd mbfr and the mcfr the h2 supply was replaced with n2 and the medium was replaced by 65 ml of fresh medium contained 2 4 dcp at a target concentration 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 μm this medium was prepared by adding a 5 mm 2 4 dcp stock solution to the basic medium that had been purged with n2 wu et al 2022 between each experiment the reactors were rinsed with the basic medium in the continuous mode for 20 h 10 hrts to thoroughly remove adsorbed 2 4 dcp no cps was detected in the liquid by 20 h during each batch experiment we routinely measured the 2 4 dcp concentration in the liquid and computed the mass of adsorbed 2 4 dcp by difference all adsorption experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 6 adsorption kinetics modeling in the pd mbfr pd0 biofilm s adsorption of 2 4 dcp is described by 1 2 4 dcp p d 0 biofilm k 1 2 4 dc p ads p d 0 biofilm and the formation rate of adsorbed 2 4 dcp from 2 4 dcp and pd0 biofilm is given by 2 d c ads t d t k 1 c ads 0 c ads t c t where k 1 is the rate constant of adsorption l μmol 1 min 1 c t is the 2 4 dcp concentration in the liquid μm c ads 0 is saturated adsorption concentration of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm μm and c ads t is the volume averaged concentration of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm μm at time t min to obtain the saturated adsorption concentration c ads 0 we represented the adsorption capacities of pd0 biofilm for 2 4 dcp using the langmuir isotherm 3 q e q 0 b c e b c e 1 where q 0 is the maximum adsorption density per unit of membrane surface area µmol m 2 q e is the equilibrium adsorption density on the membrane surface μmol m 2 b is the langmuir equilibrium constant related to the energy of adsorption l μmol 1 and c e is the equilibrium solute concentration μm since the adsorption experiments gave c e and q e values eq 3 could be solved for b and q 0 using non linear fitting c ads 0 was derived from q 0 c ads 0 q 0 s v f where s is membrane surface area 54 cm2 and v f is volume of the pd0 biofilm 14 5 ml measured at the completion of the experiments c ads t in eq 2 could be eliminated as an independent variable by using the mass balance c ads t v f c 0 c t v w where v w is the working volume of the pd mbfr 50 5 ml then to obtain k 1 we integrated eq 2 to give a relationship between c t and time min

at equilibrium 2 7 dechlorination experiments a series of steady state dechlorination experiments investigated the kinetics of 2 4 dcp reduction in the pd0 mbfr and the mcfr the experiments were organized into three series summarized in table 1 prior to each substage the reactor was returned to the baseline condition which was the basic medium containing 100 μm 2 4 dcp 15 psig for h2 and 0 53 ml min 1 influent flow each substage lasted 8 hrts which was long enough for concentrations to reach steady state for the liquid phase replicate samples were collected at 6 7 and 8 hrts and the results are presented as the average values the standard deviation 2 8 modeling for kinetics of a coupled adsorption and reduction process pd0 catalyzed hydrogenation reactions follow pseudo first order kinetics wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 the reduction rate of adsorbed 2 4 dcp in a batch reaction for a pd mbfr is 5 d c ads t d t k ap c ads t where k ap denotes the apparent first order rate constant min 1 in a continuous reactor at steady state the adsorption rate of 2 4 dcp eq 2 equals its reduction rate eq 5 6 k 1 c ads 0 c ads c eff k ap c ads where c eff is the stable concentrations of 2 4 dcp in effluent μm c ads 0 is the saturated concentration of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm μm and c ads are the stable concentrations of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm μm rearranging eq 6 yields 7 c ads 0 c ads c eff c ads k ap k 1 k m the constant k m μm is the ratio of reduction and adsorption rate constants solving eq 7 yields the concentration of the 2 4 dcp adsorbed in the pd0 biofilm at steady state 8 c ads c ads 0 c eff k m c eff then the overall rate of 2 4 dcp removal in pd0 biofilm is 9 r k ap c ads k ap c ads 0 c eff k m c eff eq 9 describes the steady state reaction rate once the product of k ap and k m are obtained since c eff is a readily measurable quantity if the 2 4 dcp concentration is high enough that the adsorption of 2 4 dcp by pd0 biofilm is saturated i e c ads c ads 0 then the maximum reduction rate r m is 10 r m k ap c ads 0 dividing eq 9 by eq 10 yields 11 r r m c eff k m c eff eq 11 quantifies the relationship between the 2 4 dcp concentration and the reaction rate in relation to the maximum rate and it has a form similar to the michaelis menten and monod equations rittmann and mccarty 2020 thus r m and k m can be determined from measured c eff and r values from a set of steady state tests c eff is measured directly and r is calculated according to the mass balance on 2 4 dcp 12 r q c inf c eff v where q is the influent flow of the

the influent flow rate or hrt required to meet the effluent concentration below mcl can be computed by simultaneously solving eq 11 and eq 12 the volumetric loading of 2 4 dcp r l is calculated with eq 13 13 r l q c inf v 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pd0 biofilm and pd0 film the tem images in fig 1 characterize the location morphology and size of pd0nps generated in the pd mbfr and the mcfr in pd0 biofilm the pd0nps were highly dispersed with a statistical average pd0 crystallite size of 4 6 0 7 nm based on 270 counts fig 1c most pd0nps were distributed in the extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix and some were on the bacterial cell surfaces fig 1a in pd0 film the pd0 crystallites aggregated into larger particles and formed a continuous multi layer film figs 1b and 1d with average size of 13 1 1 3 nm 150 counts these results indicate that the biofilm in pd0 biofilm stabilized smaller pd0nps probably due to rapid encapsulation of pdnps in the eps at nucleation and initial surface growth with the sizes maintained by electrostatic stabilization through extracellular proteins zhou et al 2016b the presence of pd0nps was confirmed by the edx spectra embedded figures in figs 1c and d and the xrd spectra fig 1e confirmed that the nanoparticles were pd0 the xrd patterns exhibited the four distinct diffraction peaks of pd crystal structure with dominant facets of 1 1 1 40 1 1 1 1 46 7 2 0 0 68 1 2 2 0 and 82 1 3 1 1 the average sizes of the pd0 crystallites estimated from the full width at half maximum of the 1 1 1 facet were 3 8 and 16 2 nm for pd0 biofilm and pd0 film respectively which are similar to the statistical results from the tem images 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of 2 4 dcp to describe the adsorption of 2 4 dcp to pd0 biofilm and pd0nps we conducted separate batch tests in which the initial 2 4 dcp concentration was 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 μm the patterns of 2 4 dcp concentrations shown in fig s2 document that the adsorption capacity of pd0 biofilm was 2 to 5 fold larger than that of pd0 film likely due to adsorption to the biofilm s cells and eps caused by hydrophobic interactions between 2 4 dcp and the biofilm s negatively charged components which could be the protonation of carboxyl phosphate and hydroxyl functional groups benoit et al 1998 calace et al 2002 wang et al 2002 it also is possible that the smaller pd0nps in the biofilm had greater adsorption capacity for 2 4 dcp a langmuir isotherm using the q 0 and b values reported in fig 2 represented equilibrium adsorption well r2 value 0 99 fig 2 clearly shows that the adsorbed concentration in pd0 biofilm reached saturation as the equilibrium concentration increased above about 15 µm and the saturation adsorption capacity was 174 μmol m 2 which indicates c ads 0 was 63 7 μm the fitted lines in fig 3 show that the adsorption model for pd0 biofilm eq 3 represented the experimental results well r2 value 0 97 and no systematic errors the best fit value of k 1 ranged from 0 0037 to 0 0043 l µmol 1 min 1 with an average of 0 0039 l μmol 1 min 1 since the k 1 range was small using k 1 for all experiments yielded almost equally good fits not shown 3 3 reductive dechlorination of 2 4 dcp in continuous reduction experiments we altered the 2 4 dcp loading by changing the influent flow rate or influent 2 4 dcp concentration fig 4 presents the effluent concentration of cps c eff and released cl in general increasing the 2 4 dcp loading rate decreased the 2 4 dcp percentage removal in both reactors but the influent flow rate had a stronger impact pd mbfr always had greater 2 4 dcp removal fig 4 also shows that pd mbfr had almost no monochlorphenols mcps i e 2 cp and 4 cp despite greater removal of 2 4 dcp and effluent phenol concentrations also were lower that with the mcfr mass balance calculations showed 86 103 recovery of cl input in 2 4 dcp with most of the effluent cl being in released cl this confirms that 2 4 dcp was removed via catalytic dechlorination with the influent 2 4 dcp concentration of 25 μm an upper value of practical raw water contamination the sum of effluent concentrations of cps were 0 51 and 2 5 μm for pd mbfr and mcfr respectively fig 4b these results confirm that the pd mbfr can reduce 2 4 dcp in raw water to below the u s epa mcl of 0 61 μm with a high influent concentration of 25 µm fig 5 summarizes the 2 4 dcp removals and product selectivities towards mcps for different volumetric loading rates of 2 4 dcp for the pd mbfr when the 2 4 dcp loadings increased from 0 1 to 0 5 μmol l 1 min 1 the reduction rates proportionally increased bringing about stable removals of 95 and with no mcps in general the accumulation of mcps were relatively small in the both reactors because the first dechlorination was rate limiting wu et al 2021 however the higher product selectivities to mcps in the mcfr probably were caused by a relatively high desorption rate for the mcps our previous study documented that 2 4 dcp processed a lager adsorption capacity and affinity for the pd0np surface compared to that of 2 cp or 4 cp wu et al 2022 wu et al 2021 a higher 2 4 dcp concentration intensified competitive adsorption of 2 4 dcp onto pd0np surface which accelerated the desorption of mcps without further dechlorination because the biofilm in pd0 biofilm dispersed the pd0nps and maintained them with smaller sizes discussed in section 3 1 the contact surface for 2 4 dcp was larger which minimized competitive adsorption moreover mcps released from the pd0np surface could be trapped in the biofilm and further dechlorinated 3 4 kinetics and mechanisms for multistep removal of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm distinct kinetic patterns illustrated in fig 6 reveal that the removal of 2 4 dcp in the pd mbfr followed saturation kinetics at 2 4 dcp concentrations below 5 μm the reduction rate increased almost linearly with 2 4 dcp concentration as the 2 4 dcp concentrations increased however removal kinetics began to saturate and almost reached a plateau saturation kinetics of 2 4 dcp removal can be represented by eq 11 fig 6 shows the best fit values of k m and r m km 7 31 µm and rm 1 47 μmol l 1 min 1 which gave r2 0 98 and no systematic errors in contrast the reduction rate of 2 4 dcp in the mcfr followed first order kinetics r2 0 97 up to about 36 µm at which point the kinetics rapidly saturated k m reflects the affinity of the pd0 biofilm for 2 4 dcp and the low value of k m 7 31 μm supports strong affinity for 2 4 dcp which allows a rapid reduction rate for relatively low 2 4 dcp concentrations 20 µm the rate is 2 to 4 fold greater than in the mcfr for ceff 10 µm this feature makes the pd mbfr well suited to treat waters with relatively low 2 4 dcp concentrations the 2 4 dcp reduction rates were proportional to the concentration of 2 4 dcp an apparent first order reduction rate constant in the pd mbfr k ap 0 028 min 1 listed in table 2 and calculated according to eq 7 was slightly smaller than k 1 in the mcfr 0 033 min 1 the values of k ap and r m were then used to compute concentrations of adsorbed 2 4 dcp c ads inside pd0 biofilm by using eq 5 the calculated c ads 0 55 6 μm was not much lower than the fitted value of c ads 0 from adsorption experiments 63 7 μm which also indicates the adsorption was a strong determinant of the reduction rate fig 7 a displays the quantitative relationship between c ads and c eff the calculated c ads values were significantly higher than that the bulk phase concentration of 2 4 dcp c eff 40 µm therefore adsorption of 2 4 dcp accelerated the kinetics of 2 4 dcp reduction by concentrating 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm the reason for 2 4 dcp enrichment inside pd0 biofilm can be explained by relative kinetics we calculated initial adsorption rates eq 2 and initial reduction rates eq 5 by letting c ads c eff and the calculated results for different 2 4 dcp concentrations are displayed in fig 7b when c eff 47 µm the adsorption rates exceeded the reduction rate which resulted in the enrichment of 2 4 dcp in the pd0 biofilm the reduction rate matched the adsorption rate c eff 47 µm only when the adsorption rate saturated this indicates that the overall kinetics were controlled by adsorption for most concentrations of 2 4 dcp the calculated maximum reduction rate 1 26 μmol l 1 min 1 almost equals the measured one 1 24 μmol l 1 min 1 shown in fig 6 supporting that the model well reflects the simultaneous of adsorption and reduction of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm based on the distribution of pd0nps in pd0 biofilm the kinetics results and modeling we propose the multistep transformation pathway of 2 4 dcp shown in fig 8 adsorption of 2 4 dcp inside the biofilm is the first step then 2 4 dcp is absorbed by pd0 with activation of the c cl bond and the formation of cl pd bond wu et al 2021 and the c cl bond is broken through coupled electron transfer from activated h also adsorbed to the pd0 surface the faster adsorption kinetic leads to the enrichment of 2 4 dcp in pd0 biofilm and the concentrated 2 4 dcp accelerates the hdc rate conclusion in the h2 based pd mbfr in situ generated pd0nps associated with the biofilm to form a stable pd0 biofilm that provided greater removal of 2 4 dcp than pd0nps film alone the pd0 biofilm was an efficient adsorbent for 2 4 dcp and this increased the catalytic contact of 2 4 dcp with activated h on pd0 surface operated in the continuous flow mode the pd mbfr achieved up to 99 reduction of 2 4 dcp to phenol and could reduce 2 4 dcp to below 0 l mg l 1 kinetic modeling simulated well the adsorption and reduction of 2 4 dcp in continuous flow conditions it showed that the pd mbfr gave a greater reduction rate than that did the mcfr particularly for lower 2 4 dcp loadings because adsorption of 2 4 dcp by the biofilm enhanced the availability of 2 4 dcp to the catalyst thus experimental results and mechanistic modeling describe how coupling pd0nps and biofilm promoted 2 4 dcp removal and enhanced the product selectivity towards phenol declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial
