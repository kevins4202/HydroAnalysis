23110,long wave structure interaction is studied numerically the rayleigh and goring wave generation theories with a solitary wave with two nonlinearity factors and three discretization schemes for the advective terms for the wave propagation are evaluated results show good agreement for the main wave peak and for the wave decay rate the model captures the trailing waves and some differences on the wave decay rates are observed majorcatic and solitary wave cases passing over submerged structure is then studied for the monochromatic scenario the model agrees very well with the free surface experimental data and a linear fluid structure interaction mechanism can be observed based on the structure geometry and the absence of adverse pressure gradient in the flow for the solitary wave case interacting with a slender column the numerical model agrees very well with the measurements showing that an adverse pressure gradient in the flow is presented and the vortex in the flow induces a wave breaking process not by the bottom friction nor by water depth reduction but by a strong transport of mass from upstream to downstream side of the vortex this turbulent structure is the dominant process even when the wave breaking is present keywords trailing waves vortex in the flow wave structure interaction 1 introduction understanding wave propagation and its interaction with submerged structures is crucial when studying hydrodynamic processes specially in coastal areas where the large interaction occurs between man made or natural structures and the sea in this area there are three main topics of research a the wave transformation along the submerged structure b vortex generation by adverse pressure gradient and c the wave breaking due to a water depth reduction on the submerged structure the physical processes present in wave submerged structure interactions are reflection transmission and dissipation of the incident wave losada et al 1996 christou et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 regarding the physical wave processes along the submerged structure with no breaking due to bottom effects two main phenomena are present a the generation of higher harmonics from the incident wave frequency by the increment on the wave non linearity when the wave is over the obstacle grue 1992 huang and dong 1999 and b the vortex formation in the flow at the upstream and downstream side of the structure if the structure geometry and wave properties satisfy some specific conditions producing the crest crest exchange and backward wave breaking cooker et al 1990 these complex flow behaviour vortex formation have been the focus of different works on the last decades because of the inclusion of viscous stresses in the hydrodynamic flow solutions finding that these flow modifications or secondary flows can strongly modify the wave free surface profile wave loads and structure stability huang and dong 1999 chang et al 2005 wu et al 2012 nevertheless the entire vortex evolution on a wave environment and its effect on the backward wave breaking process is still not completely understood related to the wave scenarios the solitary waves have been frequently employed for decades to determine the characteristics of tsunamis and strong surges zhang et al 2012 or to describe waves in the surf zone dean and dalrymple 1991 additionally the study of solitary wave transformation around marine breakwaters is a critical problem when evaluating the effects produced by these extreme waves in coastal areas wu et al 2012 also for monochromatic waves different authors study the wave transformation and its dissipation when an immersed obstacle is presented iwata et al 1996 kawasaki and iwata 1998 dong and huang 2001 shen and chan 2008 higuera et al 2013 chen et al 2014 concerning the use of cfd tools for wave generation and propagation and the understanding of different physical processes in wave structure interaction scenarios those who solve the navier stokes equations are the most appropriate due to the inclusion of viscosity effects in the wave field iwata et al 1996 huang and dong 1999 lin and liu 1999 chang et al 2001 shen and chan 2008 the usual approach for wave generation since it presents the lower computational cost uses a fixed mesh for the whole computational domain generating waves either by using the mass conservation equation a in specific region known as the mass source or source region ohyama and nadaoka 1991 iwata et al 1996 kawasaki and iwata 1998 lin and liu 1999 lara et al 2006 chen and hsiao 2016 or by specifying the free surface on an open boundary according to the desired wave characteristics and advecting them using the wave equations amini afshar 2010 lambert 2012 jacobsen et al 2012 higuera et al 2013 chen et al 2014 all these method applied a relaxation or sponge like layer zone in the computational domain in order to avoid unwanted reflected waves by open boundaries or internally in the computational domain lara et al 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 chen and hsiao 2016 however wave generation in fixed meshes presents limitations since implicit signals produced in laboratory are not recreated in particular the trailing waves as the result of the wave theory used in the solitary wave generation paddle movement is not simulated by these models inducing higher uncertainties since the differences between the model and the experimental data are the result of the wave boundary conditions a second approach for the wave generation is the use of dynamical computational mesh whose displacement is obtained by the solution of a specific equation at the boundary describing the wave generator movement dong and huang 2001 oliveira et al 2009 elangovan and sahoo 2010 xi zeng et al 2010 wu et al 2014 higuera et al 2015 in the present work the dynamic mesh approach is used following the piston type wave generator concept in order to include the trailing waves in the wave propagation for the solution of the dynamic mesh generation problem the library dynamicinkjetfvmesh weller et al 1998 jasak and tukovic 2006 is used and the wave generation theory is applied as a modulating function for the wave propagation the discretization scheme for the advective terms in the momentum equation jasak et al 1999 ferziger and peric 2002 is evaluated minimizing the numerical damping and the wave decay along the flume this paper is structured as follows first the dynamic mesh description and the long wave and monochromatic wave generation theories are presented followed by the modulating function for the wave governing equations at the moving boundary secondly a detailed analysis of the numerical discretization of the advective terms in the transport equation is described and the numerical solution studied for the slip and non slip boundary conditions finally the model is validated and used to describe two wave structure interaction scenarios 2 methodology in this section a review of the wave generation and propagation theories is briefly summarized the piston type wave generator concept is described using the governing equations for a variable volume domain jasak 2009 then several discretization schemes are tested to accurately solve the advective terms in the navier stokes equations jasak et al 1999 2 1 dynamic mesh in dynamic mesh computations two motions can be distinguished the motions at the boundary and the motions in the interior of the domain motions at the boundary are specified by a given governing equation representing the boundary displacement while the interior points have to accommodate to the prescribed boundary motion preserving the mesh validity and quality by following this procedure errors in the results can be only assigned to the mesh discretization jasak and tukovic 2010 the moving mesh in the finite volume discretization is based on the integral form of the mass conservation law over an arbitrary moving volume v bounded by a closed surface m for a general tensor property ψ the following equation has to be satisfied jasak and tukovic 2010 1 t v ρ ψ d v m ρ n v v m ψ d m m ρ γ ψ n ψ d m v m ψ d v where ρ is the fluid density n is a unit normal vector to the surface m v is the fluid velocity v m is velocity at the boundary γ ψ is a diffusive coefficient and m ψ is a source term now the relationship between the change of volume and the boundary velocity is defined by the space conservation law 2 t v d v m n v m d m 0 in this work equations 1 and 2 are part of the cfd solver and the wave generator is a modification of the native equation in the dynamic mesh movement directory interdymfoam of openfoam this solver considers an incompressible transient newtonian fluid in a two phase flow together with the dynamic mesh algorithm with no topological changes in the mesh greenshields 2015 the pseudo algorithm presented here uses the dynamicinkjetfvmesh library solver to simulate dynamic mesh phenomena where the mesh behaviour is represented as a linear spring and is part of the different solvers available for non topological dynamic mesh changes using an explicit equation this library allows the definition of a dynamic and fixed regions by using a pivot at a specified location on the domain so the dynamic region is used for the wave generation wave generation zone and the fixed one for wave propagation and wave structure interaction wave propagation zone the utility of the fixed or static region in the numerical wave flume permits to study wave interacting with any kind of fixed structures without inducing cell deformations in the structures by the mesh movement see fig 1 2 2 wave maker theory the challenge in the generation of solitary waves in wave flumes is to minimize the spurious waves generated after the main wave that degrades the target wave goring and raichlen 1980 katell and eric 2002 wu et al 2014 for monochromatic waves the objective is to obtain the desired wave height and period for a specific depth frigaard et al 1993 2 2 1 long wave generation for long waves a transfer function relates the horizontal velocity of the wave generator with the vertical average of the horizontal velocity component u as see fig 1 3 d ξ d t u ξ t c η ξ t h η ξ t where c is the wave celerity and η the free surface the left hand side lhs of equation 3 represents the speed of the moving paddle and the right hand side rhs represents the depth integrated horizontal velocity if η has the shape of any harmonic function for the paddle position ξ t equation 3 implies 4 η ξ t a f k c t η ξ t where k is the wave number by defining φ k c t ξ for a solitary wave equation 4 can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 5 η ξ t a sech 2 β φ 2 6 ξ t 2 a h β tanh β φ 2 where a is the amplitude of the solitary wave h the still water depth β is a decay coefficient s 4 a h β is the stroke of the paddle and the duration of the stroke is τ 4 β c arctanh 0 999 a h two different approximations for the solitary wave generator have been implemented the solution of the boussinesq equation presented by goring and raichlen 1980 and the solution of the rayleigh equation presented by katell and eric 2002 hereinafter the sub index g will denote the goring and raichlen constant and the r the rayleigh constant goring and raichlen approximation based on the simplified solution of the boussinesq equation with u ξ t u 0 t equation 6 can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 7 ξ t s g tanh 3 a 4 h 3 φ with s g 4 a h 3 2 2 1 1 rayleigh approximation in the rayleigh approximation the position of the paddle can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 8 ξ t s r h tanh β r c r t 2 h a 1 tanh 2 β r c r t 2 with s r 4 a a h 3 since the stroke of the paddle defined by equations 7 and 8 represents the displacements from s g to s g or from s r to s r a translation is applied to transform it from 0 to 2 s g or from 0 to 2 s r to prevent convergence problems of the numerical solution due to the rapid change of the boundary as well as to guarantee the reduction of the simulation time 2 2 2 wave train generation the wave train generation uses the biésel function which relates the wave amplitude with the paddle displacement frigaard et al 1993 this procedure starts from the mass conservation equation for potential flow and a harmonic boundary condition that mimics the wavemaker the wave hight stroke relation h s is a mathematical expression for the monochromatic wave generation see equation 9 and the expression for the paddle displacement including the effect of the second order terms is given by equation 10 9 h s 4 sinh 2 k h sinh 2 k h 2 k h m 1 10 ξ t h sin w t 2 m 1 h 2 32 1 h 2 h l 3 cosh k h sinh 3 k h 2 m 1 sin 2 w t where m 1 is the first order wave hight stroke relation w is the angular frequency and l is the wavelength of the desired wave satisfying the dispersion relation this formula is valid for ursel number up to 26 32 steven a 1993 3 mesh behaviour in the dynamic grid approach we need to define three regions i the displacement area for the wave generator ii the region where the computational cell faces move proportional to the distance to the moving boundary spring type region and iii a fixed or static sub domain where the wave propagation and wave structure interactions will be studied to do so an equation emulating a linear spring is defined in the generation zone see fig 1 the equation resulting for the grid that satisfies the above conditions is equation 11 jasak 2009 11 x n e w x o l d 1 p o s i t i o n x o l d r e f s c f where x n e w is the position of the cell faces at a given time including the boundary x o l d is the position of the cell faces at a previous time r e f is the pivot location where the dynamic and fixed regions match each other and s c f is a function that modulates the boundary displacement corresponding in our case to the solitary or monochromatic wave generation functions previously defined the objective for the wave generation is to apply the native openfoam equation equation 11 for wave propagation modifying the modulating function by the wavemaker theory this is achieved using a pivot position according to wave generation and combining a dynamic region for the wave generation with a fixed region for wave propagation in order to mimics wave fixed structure interaction scenarios special care is taken in the wave propagation zone see fig 1 where a static grid is defined since the grid resolution changes and some problems related to numerical diffusion can arise in the limit between the generation and propagation zones to overcome this issue we defined the cell size in the static zone to be the same as the neighbouring cells when the s c f parameter is maximum regarding the vertical direction the cell discretization ratio δ x δ y must have a moderate value which is related to the wave steepness as 12 δ x δ y 2 13 δ y δ x h l δ y h n where n is the number of cell divisions of the wave height 3 1 governing equations wave propagation is computed by solving the navier stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in a cartesian coordinate system 14 u 0 15 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u g 1 ρ f

over a differential control volume cv the total computational domain is arranged in a computational mesh conformed by small cvs computing the velocity field and the scalar variables at the center of the cell ferziger and peric 2002 as shown in fig 2 to transform this set of pdes into a set of integral equations the gauss first theorem is applied to the advective terms and the transient terms

s d v d t for the pressure term openfoam uses the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations and piso pressure implicit splitting operator methods a non hydrostatic approximation formulation and an iterative solution by coupling the velocity field and the pressure with the mass conservation equation ferziger and peric 2002 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 3 2 discretization schemes several tests are performed to evaluate the effect of different discretization schemes of the convective terms on the solution defining a as the vector field in the convective terms equation 22 is solved assuming that the integral is approximated using the midpoint rule and the integral of the flux over the infinitesimal surface d m is approximated as 23 m a d m e a e m e e a e m e considering that equation 23 is applied on the cv surface and the values of the hydrodynamic variables are available at the cv center node different methods can be used to interpolate the values from the nodes to the surfaces this procedure can be done if the variables are function of the values at the node which can be accomplished by applying some interpolating procedures i e the upwind ud the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinetics quick and the total variation diminishing van leer interpolation the ud interpolation scheme uses the value of the variable at the surface depending on the flow direction ud is a diffusive scheme thus a very fine mesh is required to obtain accurate results ferziger and peric 2002 the value of a e following fig 2 is 24 a e a p if u n 0 a e if u n 0 the quick scheme was developed as an improvement of ud where a parabolic fitting between the points p and e see fig 2 is implemented implying the use of an additional point to define the function this point is selected depending on the direction of the convection process i e if u x 0 w is selected and conversely if u x 0 ee is selected where u x is the velocity component in the x direction this scheme is more accurate than the ud scheme presenting less numerical diffusion although it introduces spurious oscillations for complex flows ferziger and peric 2002 the third interpolation method evaluated is the van leer scheme a second order scheme that allows controlling the spurious oscillations generated by the quick scheme this is achieved by defining a diffusive function details of the discretization schemes and their implementation can be reviewed in ferziger and peric 2002 and versteeg and malalasekera 2007 4 results in this section the dynamic mesh wave generation and propagation methodology is tested against analytical solution as well as with experimental data for a solitary wave additionally the cases for a monochromatic wave over a trapezoidal cross section structure and a solitary wave over a slender column are validated using experimental data reported in the literature and a backward wave breaking process due to vortex influence is explained all test cases neglect the reynolds stress tensor except for the solitary slender column case where the κ ω s s t turbulent model is used available in openfoam all simulations are 2 dv since we are interested in the wave propagation and transformation rather than its transversal effects for the numerical stability the courant number was restricted to 0 8 and for the free surface and hydrodynamic quantities the absolute error has to be lower than 10 6 before to pass to the next time step additionally in order to determine where the free surface position is on the vertical axis based on equations 16 and 17 the γ values equal to 0 5 were enough to extract the free surface time series in order to evaluate the convergence behaviour and mesh independence different mesh size were chosen to estimate the error order and ratio of convergence the order and ratio of convergence are estimated using the ud scheme and three different meshes see table 1 since the other two schemes are improvements to the this formulation the error analysis was based on the two finest meshes the numerical wave flume is a semi infinite domain in the direction of the wave propagation increasing the cell size away from the wave propagation zone to induce artificial damping in order to avoid reflection effects 4 1 solitary wave on a flat bottom the profile for the solitary wave in the boussinesq approach takes the form chang et al 2001 25 η h sech 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where c is the wave celerity h the wave height and h the still water depth the damping due to viscous effects along its propagation direction can be included by using the keulegan s formulation keulegan 1948 liu and orfila 2005 liu et al 2006 the numerical domain is a 25 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 9 m deep in a 0 15 m still water depth two different values for the non linear wave characteristics ε h h are tested the vertical mesh resolution is defined by dividing h by 15 30 and 40 for both wave cases and the horizontal resolution is based on the mesh quality defined in section 3 in table 1 the mesh resolution for h 15 m e s h 1 h 30 m e s h 2 and h 40 m e s h 3 are shown and the error analysis is presented for m e s h 2 and m e s h 3 since the relative error based on the wave peak differences was defined to be lower than 20 4 1 1 model convergence behaviour in order to evaluate the performance of the numerical wave flume it is important to assess the convergence of the solution against the analytical one the formulations presented in this section follow the eca and hoekstra 2008 methodology to estimate the order and ratio of convergence three different meshes have been implemented with a refinement ratio below 2 5 the slip boundary condition and the advective term ud since this formulation solves the flow quantities based on the flow direction being the other two improvements of the former having three different grid size δ 1 δ 2 and δ 3 and their specific variables scalar or vectorial solution ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 the free surface wave in this case the convergence ratio can be estimated by equation 26 as 26 γ ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 where ϕ 1 stands for the finest grid solution ϕ 2 for the intermediate grid solution and ϕ 3 the coarsest grid one and convergence conditions are defined as 0 γ 1 monotonic convergence 1 γ 0 oscillatory convergence γ 1 monotonic divergence γ 1 oscillatory divergence for the order of convergence j a fitting to an error estimator values is done by a power function expressed by equation 27 27 e r ϕ i ϕ 0 ζ h i j where ζ is a coefficient and ϕ 0 is the free surface reference value estimated by using equation 25 at three recording station see fig 1 the results for j for both nonlinearity values ε equals to 0 27 and 0 409 using the wave peak error and having r square higher than 80 in the fitting are presented in table 2 additionally γ values reported in this work are an average between the three recording stations illustrated in fig 1 as can be observed using both parameters the numerical solution shows a m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e behaviour and the error analysis can be done using the two finest meshes 4 1 2 slip flat bottom first the model is tested against the theoretical wave peak solution given by equation 25 considering a slip condition on the bottom no friction and varying the mesh resolution to determine the effect of the mesh size on the numerical results for all cases the relative wave peak error and main wave peak decay ω evaluated by taking the mean slope along three measuring points are obtained at three locations along the numerical wave flume for all numerical schemes these virtual wave gauges are at the same locations than the experimental ones see locations in fig 1 errors for the three schemes and the two waves are reported in table 3 and a time history at the three gauges for the three schemes and for the two wave non linearities in figs 4 and 5 respectively as seen the goring raichlen wave theory with m e s h 3 gives the best solution with all the numerical schemes the appropriate mesh and advective numerical scheme is used for comparing the keulegan s solution against the experimental data with the rayleigh wave generation method r a a more accurate theory than the goring raichlen g katell and eric 2002 however recent works using experimental and numerical approaches where equation 3 is modified using the fenton s wave profile show improvement in the attenuation of the trailing waves and a reduction of the main wave peak decay wu et al 2014 2016 this formulation is more accurate for pure solitary wave generation than the other theories mentioned above also it is important to remark that the experimental data available for the model validation comes from the goring and rayleigh formulations and the fenton s improvement will not be used in this work it is important to note that the exact solution of the paddle movement in the g approach is obtained from a system of equations which implies a larger computational effort the paddle movement for the cases studied is presented in fig 3 which reproduces equations 7 and 8 and the g simplification given by equation 28 28 ξ t s g tanh 7 6 t τ g 0 5 which obeys the hyperbolic tangent function avoiding the need of an iterative solution for the boundary condition at each time steep regarding the g method the numerical solutions for both non linear wave parameters underestimates the wave peak giving the highest trailing wave amplitude the r a method overestimates the main wave height and diminishes the trailing wave amplitude all methods reproduce the spurious trailing waves figs 4 7 for both non linear wave values tested g is the method with the highest trailing wave amplitude and the smallest trailing wave period conversely the r a method gives the smallest amplitude and the larger wave period for both ε values note that an increment of the non linear parameter generates an increment in the amplitude of the trailing waves and a reduction in their wave period not significant effects in the wave celerity and the trailing waves have been noticed regarding the discretization scheme additionally the wave decay rate and the error in the wave peak increase with larger non linearities due to limitations in the wave generation theories as already reported by katell and eric 2002 and wu et al 2014 based on the results table 3 the m e s h 3 and the quick scheme are selected for the wave simulation and comparison with keulegan s solution and experimental data however it is important to remark that the van leer and quick solutions are very close to each other showing differences between them below 1 for all the simulations 4 1 3 non slip flat bottom keulegan 1948 modified the solution for the theoretical solitary wave by including the effect of the bottom friction in order to model a realistic wave fig 8 and fig 9 show the numerical solution obtained with the r a method the quick scheme and the decay rate for both non linearity factors for comparison purposes the decay rate obtained by the keulegan s correction is also included the numerical model considers a non slip boundary condition on the channel bottom u x 0 the errors in the decay rate are summarized in table 4 indicating that the numerical model gives smaller decay rate than the value predicted by keulegan s formulation the theoretical an numerical decay rate increase as the non linear factor does 4 1 4 validation against experimental data in this section we validate the model against the experimental data presented in liu et al 2006 for a solitary wave these experiments were performed in a wave flume with the same characteristics as the numerical domain shown in the previous section for the validation two solitary waves with the same non linear parameters as those presented above were compared at locations m 1 m 2 and m 3 additionally the numerical model considers the rayleigh wave generation theory a non slip boundary condition at the bottom and the quick scheme for the advective terms model results and laboratory data are shown for ε 0 270 at the three locations in fig 10 the errors for the wave amplitude are shown in table 5 from these figures it is clear that the model captures accurately the shape of the wave although underpredicts the wave amplitude this error slightly increases in the direction of the wave propagation indicating that the model overpredicts the wave decay rate for ε 0 409 fig 11 the model overpredicts the wave decay rate and the magnitude of the wave peak with errors up to 3 1 table 5 the numerical model overpredicts the wave peak decay rate for both non linear wave values with the highest relative error of 5 5 for ε 0 270 at m1 and for ε 0 270 fig 12 left the trailing waves have a maximum amplitude of 0 16 cm 4 43 of the main wave with almost a constant period of 1 3 s at this location the model reproduces the trailing waves of the same amplitude but with a shorter period than those measured in the experiments these waves detach earlier from the main wave than the experimental ones leading to a wave profile which is above the experimental one for the non linearity factor ε 0 409 the experimental and the numerical trailing waves at m 1 fig 12 right are in much better agreement than for the other non linearity factor amplitude of 0 27 cm or 4 8 of the main wave and period of 0 98 s for this nonlinearity the simulated waves detach at the same time than the experimental ones the analysis of the trailing waves shows that viscosity has little effect for both non linear factors and for slip viscous fluid without bottom friction and non slip viscous fluid and bottom friction the numerical results show that neither the fluid viscosity nor the bottom friction nor the surface tension have effect on the trailing waves since they are modulated by the gravity term from equation 15 additionally the w e b e r number w e was estimated applying the linear wave theory showing different behaviour for the theoretical and the numerical computations when neglecting the surface tension fig 12 the theoretical estimation of the w e number is around 0 6 and 1 7 for ε 0 27 and 0 41 respectively indicating that effects of surface tension is important in the numerical simulations there are no differences for both nonlinearity factors at stations m 2 and m 3 the recording time in the experiments were too short to provide information about the trailing waves 4 2 monochromatic wave passing over a trapezoidal cross section in this section the numerical model is tested with the experiments by dingemnas 1993 for a monocromatic wave interacting with a submerged trapezoidal cross section structure the still water level is h 40 cm the wave height h 2 cm and the wave period t 2 02 s the incident ursell number is u r 4 5 so the wave generation theory presented above is adequate and the wave can be modelled in the linear wave theory range the submerged structure is 30 cm height and 11 m long see fig 13 to validate the model the experimental free surface from the wave gauges in red box d1 d2 d3 and d4 are compared against the numerical results the distance from the paddle to the wave gauges are 2 13 5 15 7 and 19 m respectively it is important to remark that the numerical simulation the spectral analysis and error estimates were computed during a simulation of 45 s but only the first 38 s are shown for illustration purposes the model results are shown in figs 14 17 in the time lower panel and frequency upper panel domains respectively all numerical results are recorded at the same location as the experimental ones eliminating the need to calibrate the numerical incoming wave with the first experimental wave gauge something that has to be done when using static meshes from the time series presented in fig 14 the wave at d1 is a perfect monochromatic wave however the wave at d2 and at the structure downstream slope stations d3 and d4 has been transformed generating f r e e w a v e s that detach from the main wave gaining energy by diffusion effects huang and dong 1999 even at points where secondary harmonics are as high as the incident one d3 and d4 comparison between numerical results and experimental data is presented in terms of the agreement index ai the mean absolute error mae and the mean bias error mbe willmott and matsuura 2005 applied wave by wave the error analysis shows that along the numerical domain the model agrees very well with the experimental data ai 98 and mae 7 5 10 4 meters at all stations and the mbe for the records is around zero with a mean value close to 3 10 4 meters showing a small over prediction respect to the experimental data see fig 18 furthermore the wave error behaviour ai is very stable for all the waves see fig 18 implying that the model does not need a warming time interval being able to solve the physical behaviour of the variables from the initial time of simulation those f r e e w a v e s are explained from the wave mechanics viewpoint by using fully nonlinear boussinesq models galan et al 2013 where the wave trains are propagated from a deeper water to a shallower one in deep water the dispersion is more important than the nonlinear effects but when the waves reach the shallow water the nonlinear effects becomes more relevant and the dispersion decreases in that moment higher harmonics are released by the nonlinear processes and those harmonics are more dispersive than the incident waves when they reach deeper waters again using a fft decomposition of the free surface time series it is possible to detect the wave frequencies as is shown in the upper panel of figs 14 17 where the vertical axes are twice the wave amplitude 2 a normalized by the incident wave height hi at d1 the main frequency is 0 5 hz corresponding to the target wave and downstream the structure higher frequencies appear d2 d3 and d4 with energy comparable with the incident wave d3 and d4 these frequencies correspond to the f r e e w a v e s that travel slower than the incident phase velocity huang and dong 1999 they are the result of the water column variation that produces an increment in the advective acceleration positive or negative this acceleration is positive on the upstream slope and on the top flat zone of the structure up to the beginning of the structure downstream slope where the acceleration is negative due to the change in the hydrodynamic conditions along the submerged structure the mass conservation requires the free surface to adjust to the new flow conditions at the boundaries increasing the wave steepness and also increasing the wave nonlinearity over the upstream slope and at the top of the structure over the downstream slope the diffusive term in the momentum equation is more relevant than the advection term transferring energy from lower to higher frequencies notice that this structure has very mild slopes long flat top and the ratio of its height base lengths is much less than unity working as a flat structure in an almost parallel flow no flow separation occurs for this type of physical processes together with low reynolds number we call them linear fluid structure interaction mechanism from the fluid mechanics point of view 4 3 solitary wave slender structure interaction at higher complexity in this section the model is tested with a solitary wave interacting with a slender column results are compared against the data published by wu et al 2012 the goring and raichlen 1980 theory is used for the generation of the solitary wave since it is the used by the work of wu et al 2012 the still water level is h 14 cm and the wave height h 7 cm with a nonlinear parameter of ε 0 5 wave breaking is presented downstream of the structure the submerged structure is 10 cm high d and 2 cm thick w the experiment set up is shown in fig 19 the mesh size close to the solid walls is 0 8 mm to validate the model the piv velocity field data is qualitatively compared against the numerical results and quantitatively with the vertical velocity profiles for the numerical configuration the turbulent 2 d vertical κ ω s s t model is used with the no slip condition at the bottom zero velocity at the end of the wave flume and zero gradient pressure on the walls bottom and structure the turbulent quantities on the solid walls sub index w and at the free stream sub index are set based on the formulation suggested by hellsten 1998 equations 29 33 29 ω w 2 ν 0 075 d 2 30 κ w 10 7 31 ω γ u l 32 ν t 10 3 ν 33 κ ν t ω where ν d and γ are the fluid viscosity the first node wall distance and a proportionality coefficient between 1 and 10 respectively the eddy viscosity at the boundary layer ν t w follows the formulation presented by spalding 1961 which is valid along the entire boundary layer from y 1 to y 30 the advective terms in the transport equation are solved using the quick scheme eight velocity profiles at five different instants are compared with the experimental data these profiles are taken from z h to z η at 0 06 0 08 0 1 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 18 and 0 2 m from the downstream face of the slender column comparisons are performed at t 0 46 0 6 0 74 0 88 1 02 seconds after the wave crest reaches x 0 657 m see fig 19 additionally a qualitative comparison between velocity fields is shown for each time maximum errors for the horizontal and vertical velocity components for each time are reported in table 6 showing that the ai is higher than 83 the lower ai and the higher mae are obtained at t 1 02 seconds the post breaking time the highest discrepancies are obtained when the horizontal velocity profile has the strongest inflexion point center of the vortex with a vertical velocity slightly close to the vortex center in this situation the model underpredicts the velocity gradients decreasing the vorticity see figs 20 24 the vortex structure and the magnitude of the velocity are in agreement with the experimental ones figs 20 24 upper panel at t 0 46 s a flow separation appears due to the drag pressure force exerted on the flow inducing an adverse pressure gradient exerted by the solid column the main vortex at this time two vortices arise the main vortex located downstream the column and a second one at the top of the structure both reported by wu et al 2012 the main vortex is advected by the wave with velocity magnitudes decreasing slightly in the wave propagation axis this behaviour is observed by following the vortex velocity profiles all time steps and noticing that the vertical velocity close to the vortex center upstream and downstream has an almost constant value of 1 m s and the difference between the upper and lower around the vortex center horizontal velocities is also 1 m s see figs 20 24 lower panel following these description we hypothesize that the vortex travels faster than what it is being diffused by turbulent and viscous effects so that the advective term is more relevant than the diffusive one in the transport equation this behaviour is in contradiction with chang et al 2001 who postulated that the diffusion is higher than the advection downstream the submerged obstacle as the main vortex travels along the wave propagation axis the vortex on the top of the structure vanishes since there is no significant flow over the column the vortex generated by the flow separation induces downstream a steeper free surface profile at 0 6 and 0 74 s because the velocity is higher in the vortex upper zone accumulating mass at its downstream side see figs 21 22 as a result the water column loses its own stability until the moment when the wave breaking process appears t 0 88 s see fig 23 breaking is occurring in the opposite direction of wave propagation because the accumulated mass downstream the vortex is taken from the upstream side t 1 02 seconds see fig 23 this simulation gives more information about the crest crest exchange process reported by cooker et al 1990 where the physical phenomena was studied by using the euler s equations without viscous effects with no vortices in the flow when the backward breaking wave is present a new vortex appears and air is trapped in the water notice that this air entrainment is not capture by the piv measurements this vortex interacts with the main vortex produced by adverse pressure gradient evolving into an elliptic form without affecting its original direction and magnitude this implies that the turbulent structure is dominated by the flow separation effects even when the wave breaking processes occurs 5 conclusions a numerical model implemented in openfoam for dynamic mesh has been presented for wave propagation the numerical results can be analysed at the same points as the experimental data eliminating the need to calibrate the numerical incoming wave with the first experimental wave gauge as has to be done with static meshes the definition of the generation and propagation zones solved the cell deformation problem close to the vicinity of the wave structure interaction region the inclusion of the trailing waves in the solitary wave propagation includes a more realistic wave generated by the model we reiterate here that the properties of the solitary and wave trains are dependent on the generation method according to katell and eric 2002 a special treatment was made for the grid size in a region close to the limits between the paddle stroke in the so called wave generation zone and at the rigid mesh the wave propagation zone since geometric similarity must be preserved between the two areas when defining the computational grid additionally for a solitary wave propagation a mesh size of h 40 was found enough for a correct wave simulation even in wave structure scenario regarding monochromatic waves a vertical mesh size of h 25 was enough close to the free surface to validate the case of a solitary wave on a flat bottom the wave generation methods were tested for several discretization schemes of the convective terms model results were compared against the analytical solution for the solitary wave as well as with experimental data the tests included a solitary wave propagating with slip and non slip wall conditions for these cases the three different discretization schemes the ud quick and van leer were compared against the analytical solution for the different wave generation theories the results showed that the rayleigh method better fits the analytical solitary wave in terms of the wave amplitude the smallest wave decay rate and moderate spurious trailing waves none of the numerical schemes tested had effects on the trailing waves the quick and van leer schemes adjusted better the analytical solitary wave being the less diffusive schemes regarding the trailing waves the model results were compared with the experimental data reported by liu et al 2006 numerical results agreed very well with experimental data for the case corresponding to ε 0 409 the simulated trailing waves were above the measured ones indicating that the model underestimates the depression produced by the trailing waves once the main wave has passed a certain location these trailing waves were not affected neither by the fluid viscosity the bottom friction the discretization schemes nor by the surface tension they are directly induced by the wave generation method and modulated by the gravity force it is worth to note that the numerical wave decay ratio was higher than the obtained in the flume experiments when simulating the wave behaviour over a submerged trapezoidal structure the appearance of higher harmonics were well simulated for the monochromatic wave case where the trapezoidal obstacle can be seen as a thin plate on the flume bottom due to its small height length ratio 0 3 11 finally for a solitary wave flowing over a slender submerged column the comparison between modelled and measured velocity profiles showed that the model represented very well the measurements as the maximum error for the velocity profiles was 17 and that the advection effects were higher than the diffusive ones over the main vortex at the downstream side of the structure the turbulent flow structure at the submerged solid slender column was dominated by the flow separation effects even when the wave breaking processes occurred additionally the backward breaking wave was not induced by the bottom friction or water depth reduction but it was forced by the effect of the main vortex on the free surface profile this phenoma explaines in more detail the crest crest exchange processes presented by cooker et al 1990 and the backward wave breaking for future analysis the effect of the vortex on the structure stability should be studied since it can undermine the soil that embeds the structure and advecting it by the vortex displacement inducing a

23110,long wave structure interaction is studied numerically the rayleigh and goring wave generation theories with a solitary wave with two nonlinearity factors and three discretization schemes for the advective terms for the wave propagation are evaluated results show good agreement for the main wave peak and for the wave decay rate the model captures the trailing waves and some differences on the wave decay rates are observed majorcatic and solitary wave cases passing over submerged structure is then studied for the monochromatic scenario the model agrees very well with the free surface experimental data and a linear fluid structure interaction mechanism can be observed based on the structure geometry and the absence of adverse pressure gradient in the flow for the solitary wave case interacting with a slender column the numerical model agrees very well with the measurements showing that an adverse pressure gradient in the flow is presented and the vortex in the flow induces a wave breaking process not by the bottom friction nor by water depth reduction but by a strong transport of mass from upstream to downstream side of the vortex this turbulent structure is the dominant process even when the wave breaking is present keywords trailing waves vortex in the flow wave structure interaction 1 introduction understanding wave propagation and its interaction with submerged structures is crucial when studying hydrodynamic processes specially in coastal areas where the large interaction occurs between man made or natural structures and the sea in this area there are three main topics of research a the wave transformation along the submerged structure b vortex generation by adverse pressure gradient and c the wave breaking due to a water depth reduction on the submerged structure the physical processes present in wave submerged structure interactions are reflection transmission and dissipation of the incident wave losada et al 1996 christou et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 regarding the physical wave processes along the submerged structure with no breaking due to bottom effects two main phenomena are present a the generation of higher harmonics from the incident wave frequency by the increment on the wave non linearity when the wave is over the obstacle grue 1992 huang and dong 1999 and b the vortex formation in the flow at the upstream and downstream side of the structure if the structure geometry and wave properties satisfy some specific conditions producing the crest crest exchange and backward wave breaking cooker et al 1990 these complex flow behaviour vortex formation have been the focus of different works on the last decades because of the inclusion of viscous stresses in the hydrodynamic flow solutions finding that these flow modifications or secondary flows can strongly modify the wave free surface profile wave loads and structure stability huang and dong 1999 chang et al 2005 wu et al 2012 nevertheless the entire vortex evolution on a wave environment and its effect on the backward wave breaking process is still not completely understood related to the wave scenarios the solitary waves have been frequently employed for decades to determine the characteristics of tsunamis and strong surges zhang et al 2012 or to describe waves in the surf zone dean and dalrymple 1991 additionally the study of solitary wave transformation around marine breakwaters is a critical problem when evaluating the effects produced by these extreme waves in coastal areas wu et al 2012 also for monochromatic waves different authors study the wave transformation and its dissipation when an immersed obstacle is presented iwata et al 1996 kawasaki and iwata 1998 dong and huang 2001 shen and chan 2008 higuera et al 2013 chen et al 2014 concerning the use of cfd tools for wave generation and propagation and the understanding of different physical processes in wave structure interaction scenarios those who solve the navier stokes equations are the most appropriate due to the inclusion of viscosity effects in the wave field iwata et al 1996 huang and dong 1999 lin and liu 1999 chang et al 2001 shen and chan 2008 the usual approach for wave generation since it presents the lower computational cost uses a fixed mesh for the whole computational domain generating waves either by using the mass conservation equation a in specific region known as the mass source or source region ohyama and nadaoka 1991 iwata et al 1996 kawasaki and iwata 1998 lin and liu 1999 lara et al 2006 chen and hsiao 2016 or by specifying the free surface on an open boundary according to the desired wave characteristics and advecting them using the wave equations amini afshar 2010 lambert 2012 jacobsen et al 2012 higuera et al 2013 chen et al 2014 all these method applied a relaxation or sponge like layer zone in the computational domain in order to avoid unwanted reflected waves by open boundaries or internally in the computational domain lara et al 2006 jacobsen et al 2012 chen and hsiao 2016 however wave generation in fixed meshes presents limitations since implicit signals produced in laboratory are not recreated in particular the trailing waves as the result of the wave theory used in the solitary wave generation paddle movement is not simulated by these models inducing higher uncertainties since the differences between the model and the experimental data are the result of the wave boundary conditions a second approach for the wave generation is the use of dynamical computational mesh whose displacement is obtained by the solution of a specific equation at the boundary describing the wave generator movement dong and huang 2001 oliveira et al 2009 elangovan and sahoo 2010 xi zeng et al 2010 wu et al 2014 higuera et al 2015 in the present work the dynamic mesh approach is used following the piston type wave generator concept in order to include the trailing waves in the wave propagation for the solution of the dynamic mesh generation problem the library dynamicinkjetfvmesh weller et al 1998 jasak and tukovic 2006 is used and the wave generation theory is applied as a modulating function for the wave propagation the discretization scheme for the advective terms in the momentum equation jasak et al 1999 ferziger and peric 2002 is evaluated minimizing the numerical damping and the wave decay along the flume this paper is structured as follows first the dynamic mesh description and the long wave and monochromatic wave generation theories are presented followed by the modulating function for the wave governing equations at the moving boundary secondly a detailed analysis of the numerical discretization of the advective terms in the transport equation is described and the numerical solution studied for the slip and non slip boundary conditions finally the model is validated and used to describe two wave structure interaction scenarios 2 methodology in this section a review of the wave generation and propagation theories is briefly summarized the piston type wave generator concept is described using the governing equations for a variable volume domain jasak 2009 then several discretization schemes are tested to accurately solve the advective terms in the navier stokes equations jasak et al 1999 2 1 dynamic mesh in dynamic mesh computations two motions can be distinguished the motions at the boundary and the motions in the interior of the domain motions at the boundary are specified by a given governing equation representing the boundary displacement while the interior points have to accommodate to the prescribed boundary motion preserving the mesh validity and quality by following this procedure errors in the results can be only assigned to the mesh discretization jasak and tukovic 2010 the moving mesh in the finite volume discretization is based on the integral form of the mass conservation law over an arbitrary moving volume v bounded by a closed surface m for a general tensor property ψ the following equation has to be satisfied jasak and tukovic 2010 1 t v ρ ψ d v m ρ n v v m ψ d m m ρ γ ψ n ψ d m v m ψ d v where ρ is the fluid density n is a unit normal vector to the surface m v is the fluid velocity v m is velocity at the boundary γ ψ is a diffusive coefficient and m ψ is a source term now the relationship between the change of volume and the boundary velocity is defined by the space conservation law 2 t v d v m n v m d m 0 in this work equations 1 and 2 are part of the cfd solver and the wave generator is a modification of the native equation in the dynamic mesh movement directory interdymfoam of openfoam this solver considers an incompressible transient newtonian fluid in a two phase flow together with the dynamic mesh algorithm with no topological changes in the mesh greenshields 2015 the pseudo algorithm presented here uses the dynamicinkjetfvmesh library solver to simulate dynamic mesh phenomena where the mesh behaviour is represented as a linear spring and is part of the different solvers available for non topological dynamic mesh changes using an explicit equation this library allows the definition of a dynamic and fixed regions by using a pivot at a specified location on the domain so the dynamic region is used for the wave generation wave generation zone and the fixed one for wave propagation and wave structure interaction wave propagation zone the utility of the fixed or static region in the numerical wave flume permits to study wave interacting with any kind of fixed structures without inducing cell deformations in the structures by the mesh movement see fig 1 2 2 wave maker theory the challenge in the generation of solitary waves in wave flumes is to minimize the spurious waves generated after the main wave that degrades the target wave goring and raichlen 1980 katell and eric 2002 wu et al 2014 for monochromatic waves the objective is to obtain the desired wave height and period for a specific depth frigaard et al 1993 2 2 1 long wave generation for long waves a transfer function relates the horizontal velocity of the wave generator with the vertical average of the horizontal velocity component u as see fig 1 3 d ξ d t u ξ t c η ξ t h η ξ t where c is the wave celerity and η the free surface the left hand side lhs of equation 3 represents the speed of the moving paddle and the right hand side rhs represents the depth integrated horizontal velocity if η has the shape of any harmonic function for the paddle position ξ t equation 3 implies 4 η ξ t a f k c t η ξ t where k is the wave number by defining φ k c t ξ for a solitary wave equation 4 can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 5 η ξ t a sech 2 β φ 2 6 ξ t 2 a h β tanh β φ 2 where a is the amplitude of the solitary wave h the still water depth β is a decay coefficient s 4 a h β is the stroke of the paddle and the duration of the stroke is τ 4 β c arctanh 0 999 a h two different approximations for the solitary wave generator have been implemented the solution of the boussinesq equation presented by goring and raichlen 1980 and the solution of the rayleigh equation presented by katell and eric 2002 hereinafter the sub index g will denote the goring and raichlen constant and the r the rayleigh constant goring and raichlen approximation based on the simplified solution of the boussinesq equation with u ξ t u 0 t equation 6 can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 7 ξ t s g tanh 3 a 4 h 3 φ with s g 4 a h 3 2 2 1 1 rayleigh approximation in the rayleigh approximation the position of the paddle can be expressed as katell and eric 2002 8 ξ t s r h tanh β r c r t 2 h a 1 tanh 2 β r c r t 2 with s r 4 a a h 3 since the stroke of the paddle defined by equations 7 and 8 represents the displacements from s g to s g or from s r to s r a translation is applied to transform it from 0 to 2 s g or from 0 to 2 s r to prevent convergence problems of the numerical solution due to the rapid change of the boundary as well as to guarantee the reduction of the simulation time 2 2 2 wave train generation the wave train generation uses the biésel function which relates the wave amplitude with the paddle displacement frigaard et al 1993 this procedure starts from the mass conservation equation for potential flow and a harmonic boundary condition that mimics the wavemaker the wave hight stroke relation h s is a mathematical expression for the monochromatic wave generation see equation 9 and the expression for the paddle displacement including the effect of the second order terms is given by equation 10 9 h s 4 sinh 2 k h sinh 2 k h 2 k h m 1 10 ξ t h sin w t 2 m 1 h 2 32 1 h 2 h l 3 cosh k h sinh 3 k h 2 m 1 sin 2 w t where m 1 is the first order wave hight stroke relation w is the angular frequency and l is the wavelength of the desired wave satisfying the dispersion relation this formula is valid for ursel number up to 26 32 steven a 1993 3 mesh behaviour in the dynamic grid approach we need to define three regions i the displacement area for the wave generator ii the region where the computational cell faces move proportional to the distance to the moving boundary spring type region and iii a fixed or static sub domain where the wave propagation and wave structure interactions will be studied to do so an equation emulating a linear spring is defined in the generation zone see fig 1 the equation resulting for the grid that satisfies the above conditions is equation 11 jasak 2009 11 x n e w x o l d 1 p o s i t i o n x o l d r e f s c f where x n e w is the position of the cell faces at a given time including the boundary x o l d is the position of the cell faces at a previous time r e f is the pivot location where the dynamic and fixed regions match each other and s c f is a function that modulates the boundary displacement corresponding in our case to the solitary or monochromatic wave generation functions previously defined the objective for the wave generation is to apply the native openfoam equation equation 11 for wave propagation modifying the modulating function by the wavemaker theory this is achieved using a pivot position according to wave generation and combining a dynamic region for the wave generation with a fixed region for wave propagation in order to mimics wave fixed structure interaction scenarios special care is taken in the wave propagation zone see fig 1 where a static grid is defined since the grid resolution changes and some problems related to numerical diffusion can arise in the limit between the generation and propagation zones to overcome this issue we defined the cell size in the static zone to be the same as the neighbouring cells when the s c f parameter is maximum regarding the vertical direction the cell discretization ratio δ x δ y must have a moderate value which is related to the wave steepness as 12 δ x δ y 2 13 δ y δ x h l δ y h n where n is the number of cell divisions of the wave height 3 1 governing equations wave propagation is computed by solving the navier stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in a cartesian coordinate system 14 u 0 15 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u g 1 ρ f

over a differential control volume cv the total computational domain is arranged in a computational mesh conformed by small cvs computing the velocity field and the scalar variables at the center of the cell ferziger and peric 2002 as shown in fig 2 to transform this set of pdes into a set of integral equations the gauss first theorem is applied to the advective terms and the transient terms

formulation and an iterative solution by coupling the velocity field and the pressure with the mass conservation equation ferziger and peric 2002 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 3 2 discretization schemes several tests are performed to evaluate the effect of different discretization schemes of the convective terms on the solution defining a as the vector field in the convective terms equation 22 is solved assuming that the integral is approximated using the midpoint rule and the integral of the flux over the infinitesimal surface d m is approximated as 23 m a d m e a e m e e a e m e considering that equation 23 is applied on the cv surface and the values of the hydrodynamic variables are available at the cv center node different methods can be used to interpolate the values from the nodes to the surfaces this procedure can be done if the variables are function of the values at the node which can be accomplished by applying some interpolating procedures i e the upwind ud the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinetics quick and the total variation diminishing van leer interpolation the ud interpolation scheme uses the value of the variable at the surface depending on the flow direction ud is a diffusive scheme thus a very fine mesh is required to obtain accurate results ferziger and peric 2002 the value of a e following fig 2 is 24 a e a p if u n 0 a e if u n 0 the quick scheme was developed as an improvement of ud where a parabolic fitting between the points p and e see fig 2 is implemented implying the use of an additional point to define the function this point is selected depending on the direction of the convection process i e if u x 0 w is selected and conversely if u x 0 ee is selected where u x is the velocity component in the x direction this scheme is more accurate than the ud scheme presenting less numerical diffusion although it introduces spurious oscillations for complex flows ferziger and peric 2002 the third interpolation method evaluated is the van leer scheme a second order scheme that allows controlling the spurious oscillations generated by the quick scheme this is achieved by defining a diffusive function details of the discretization schemes and their implementation can be reviewed in ferziger and peric 2002 and versteeg and malalasekera 2007 4 results in this section the dynamic mesh wave generation and propagation methodology is tested against analytical solution as well as with experimental data for a solitary wave additionally the cases for a monochromatic wave over a trapezoidal cross section structure and a solitary wave over a slender column are validated using experimental data reported in the literature and a backward wave breaking process due to vortex influence is explained all test cases neglect the reynolds stress tensor except for the solitary slender column case where the κ ω s s t turbulent model is used available in openfoam all simulations are 2 dv since we are interested in the wave propagation and transformation rather than its transversal effects for the numerical stability the courant number was restricted to 0 8 and for the free surface and hydrodynamic quantities the absolute error has to be lower than 10 6 before to pass to the next time step additionally in order to determine where the free surface position is on the vertical axis based on equations 16 and 17 the γ values equal to 0 5 were enough to extract the free surface time series in order to evaluate the convergence behaviour and mesh independence different mesh size were chosen to estimate the error order and ratio of convergence the order and ratio of convergence are estimated using the ud scheme and three different meshes see table 1 since the other two schemes are improvements to the this formulation the error analysis was based on the two finest meshes the numerical wave flume is a semi infinite domain in the direction of the wave propagation increasing the cell size away from the wave propagation zone to induce artificial damping in order to avoid reflection effects 4 1 solitary wave on a flat bottom the profile for the solitary wave in the boussinesq approach takes the form chang et al 2001 25 η h sech 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where c is the wave celerity h the wave height and h the still water depth the damping due to viscous effects along its propagation direction can be included by using the keulegan s formulation keulegan 1948 liu and orfila 2005 liu et al 2006 the numerical domain is a 25 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 9 m deep in a 0 15 m still water depth two different values for the non linear wave characteristics ε h h are tested the vertical mesh resolution is defined by dividing h by 15 30 and 40 for both wave cases and the horizontal resolution is based on the mesh quality defined in section 3 in table 1 the mesh resolution for h 15 m e s h 1 h 30 m e s h 2 and h 40 m e s h 3 are shown and the error analysis is presented for m e s h 2 and m e s h 3 since the relative error based on the wave peak differences was defined to be lower than 20 4 1 1 model convergence behaviour in order to evaluate the performance of the numerical wave flume it is important to assess the convergence of the solution against the analytical one the formulations presented in this section follow the eca and hoekstra 2008 methodology to estimate the order and ratio of convergence three different meshes have been implemented with a refinement ratio below 2 5 the slip boundary condition and the advective term ud since this formulation solves the flow quantities based on the flow direction being the other two improvements of the former having three different grid size δ 1 δ 2 and δ 3 and their specific variables scalar or vectorial solution ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 the free surface wave in this case the convergence ratio can be estimated by equation 26 as 26 γ ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 where ϕ 1 stands for the finest grid solution ϕ 2 for the intermediate grid solution and ϕ 3 the coarsest grid one and convergence conditions are defined as 0 γ 1 monotonic convergence 1 γ 0 oscillatory convergence γ 1 monotonic divergence γ 1 oscillatory divergence for the order of convergence j a fitting to an error estimator values is done by a power function expressed by equation 27 27 e r ϕ i ϕ 0 ζ h i j where ζ is a coefficient and ϕ 0 is the free surface reference value estimated by using equation 25 at three recording station see fig 1 the results for j for both nonlinearity values ε equals to 0 27 and 0 409 using the wave peak error and having r square higher than 80 in the fitting are presented in table 2 additionally γ values reported in this work are an average between the three recording stations illustrated in fig 1 as can be observed using both parameters the numerical solution shows a m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e behaviour and the error analysis can be done using the two finest meshes 4 1 2 slip flat bottom first the model is tested against the theoretical wave peak solution given by equation 25 considering a slip condition on the bottom no friction and varying the mesh resolution to determine the effect of the mesh size on the numerical results for all cases the relative wave peak error and main wave peak decay ω evaluated by taking the mean slope along three measuring points are obtained at three locations along the numerical wave flume for all numerical schemes these virtual wave gauges are at the same locations than the experimental ones see locations in fig 1 errors for the three schemes and the two waves are reported in table 3 and a time history at the three gauges for the three schemes and for the two wave non linearities in figs 4 and 5 respectively as seen the goring raichlen wave theory with m e s h 3 gives the best solution with all the numerical schemes the appropriate mesh and advective numerical scheme is used for comparing the keulegan s solution against the experimental data with the rayleigh wave generation method r a a more accurate theory than the goring raichlen g katell and eric 2002 however recent works using experimental and numerical approaches where equation 3 is modified using the fenton s wave profile show improvement in the attenuation of the trailing waves and a reduction of the main wave peak decay wu et al 2014 2016 this formulation is more accurate for pure solitary wave generation than the other theories mentioned above also it is important to remark that the experimental data available for the model validation comes from the goring and rayleigh formulations and the fenton s improvement will not be used in this work it is important to note that the exact solution of the paddle movement in the g approach is obtained from a system of equations which implies a larger computational effort the paddle movement for the cases studied is presented in fig 3 which reproduces equations 7 and 8 and the g simplification given by equation 28 28 ξ t s g tanh 7 6 t τ g 0 5 which obeys the hyperbolic tangent function avoiding the need of an iterative solution for the boundary condition at each time steep regarding the g method the numerical solutions for both non linear wave parameters underestimates the wave peak giving the highest trailing wave amplitude the r a method overestimates the main wave height and diminishes the trailing wave amplitude all methods reproduce the spurious trailing waves figs 4 7 for both non linear wave values tested g is the method with the highest trailing wave amplitude and the smallest trailing wave period conversely the r a method gives the smallest amplitude and the larger wave period for both ε values note that an increment of the non linear parameter generates an increment in the amplitude of the trailing waves and a reduction in their wave period not significant effects in the wave celerity and the trailing waves have been noticed regarding the discretization scheme additionally the wave decay rate and the error in the wave peak increase with larger non linearities due to limitations in the wave generation theories as already reported by katell and eric 2002 and wu et al 2014 based on the results table 3 the m e s h 3 and the quick scheme are selected for the wave simulation and comparison with keulegan s solution and experimental data however it is important to remark that the van leer and quick solutions are very close to each other showing differences between them below 1 for all the simulations 4 1 3 non slip flat bottom keulegan 1948 modified the solution for the theoretical solitary wave by including the effect of the bottom friction in order to model a realistic wave fig 8 and fig 9 show the numerical solution obtained with the r a method the quick scheme and the decay rate for both non linearity factors for comparison purposes the decay rate obtained by the keulegan s correction is also included the numerical model considers a non slip boundary condition on the channel bottom u x 0 the errors in the decay rate are summarized in table 4 indicating that the numerical model gives smaller decay rate than the value predicted by keulegan s formulation the theoretical an numerical decay rate increase as the non linear factor does 4 1 4 validation against experimental data in this section we validate the model against the experimental data presented in liu et al 2006 for a solitary wave these experiments were performed in a wave flume with the same characteristics as the numerical domain shown in the previous section for the validation two solitary waves with the same non linear parameters as those presented above were compared at locations m 1 m 2 and m 3 additionally the numerical model considers the rayleigh wave generation theory a non slip boundary condition at the bottom and the quick scheme for the advective terms model results and laboratory data are shown for ε 0 270 at the three locations in fig 10 the errors for the wave amplitude are shown in table 5 from these figures it is clear that the model captures accurately the shape of the wave although underpredicts the wave amplitude this error slightly increases in the direction of the wave propagation indicating that the model overpredicts the wave decay rate for ε 0 409 fig 11 the model overpredicts the wave decay rate and the magnitude of the wave peak with errors up to 3 1 table 5 the numerical model overpredicts the wave peak decay rate for both non linear wave values with the highest relative error of 5 5 for ε 0 270 at m1 and for ε 0 270 fig 12 left the trailing waves have a maximum amplitude of 0 16 cm 4 43 of the main wave with almost a constant period of 1 3 s at this location the model reproduces the trailing waves of the same amplitude but with a shorter period than those measured in the experiments these waves detach earlier from the main wave than the experimental ones leading to a wave profile which is above the experimental one for the non linearity factor ε 0 409 the experimental and the numerical trailing waves at m 1 fig 12 right are in much better agreement than for the other non linearity factor amplitude of 0 27 cm or 4 8 of the main wave and period of 0 98 s for this nonlinearity the simulated waves detach at the same time than the experimental ones the analysis of the trailing waves shows that viscosity has little effect for both non linear factors and for slip viscous fluid without bottom friction and non slip viscous fluid and bottom friction the numerical results show that neither the fluid viscosity nor the bottom friction nor the surface tension have effect on the trailing waves since they are modulated by the gravity term from equation 15 additionally the w e b e r number w e was estimated applying the linear wave theory showing different behaviour for the theoretical and the numerical computations when neglecting the surface tension fig 12 the theoretical estimation of the w e number is around 0 6 and 1 7 for ε 0 27 and 0 41 respectively indicating that effects of surface tension is important in the numerical simulations there are no differences for both nonlinearity factors at stations m 2 and m 3 the recording time in the experiments were too short to provide information about the trailing waves 4 2 monochromatic wave passing over a trapezoidal cross section in this section the numerical model is tested with the experiments by dingemnas 1993 for a monocromatic wave interacting with a submerged trapezoidal cross section structure the still water level is h 40 cm the wave height h 2 cm and the wave period t 2 02 s the incident ursell number is u r 4 5 so the wave generation theory presented above is adequate and the wave can be modelled in the linear wave theory range the submerged structure is 30 cm height and 11 m long see fig 13 to validate the model the experimental free surface from the wave gauges in red box d1 d2 d3 and d4 are compared against the numerical results the distance from the paddle to the wave gauges are 2 13 5 15 7 and 19 m respectively it is important to remark that the numerical simulation the spectral analysis and error estimates were computed during a simulation of 45 s but only the first 38 s are shown for illustration purposes the model results are shown in figs 14 17 in the time lower panel and frequency upper panel domains respectively all numerical results are recorded at the same location as the experimental ones eliminating the need to calibrate the numerical incoming wave with the first experimental wave gauge something that has to be done when using static meshes from the time series presented in fig 14 the wave at d1 is a perfect monochromatic wave however the wave at d2 and at the structure downstream slope stations d3 and d4 has been transformed generating f r e e w a v e s that detach from the main wave gaining energy by diffusion effects huang and dong 1999 even at points where secondary harmonics are as high as the incident one d3 and d4 comparison between numerical results and experimental data is presented in terms of the agreement index ai the mean absolute error mae and the mean bias error mbe willmott and matsuura 2005 applied wave by wave the error analysis shows that along the numerical domain the model agrees very well with the experimental data ai 98 and mae 7 5 10 4 meters at all stations and the mbe for the records is around zero with a mean value close to 3 10 4 meters showing a small over prediction respect to the experimental data see fig 18 furthermore the wave error behaviour ai is very stable for all the waves see fig 18 implying that the model does not need a warming time interval being able to solve the physical behaviour of the variables from the initial time of simulation those f r e e w a v e s are explained from the wave mechanics viewpoint by using fully nonlinear boussinesq models galan et al 2013 where the wave trains are propagated from a deeper water to a shallower one in deep water the dispersion is more important than the nonlinear effects but when the waves reach the shallow water the nonlinear effects becomes more relevant and the dispersion decreases in that moment higher harmonics are released by the nonlinear processes and those harmonics are more dispersive than the incident waves when they reach deeper waters again using a fft decomposition of the free surface time series it is possible to detect the wave frequencies as is shown in the upper panel of figs 14 17 where the vertical axes are twice the wave amplitude 2 a normalized by the incident wave height hi at d1 the main frequency is 0 5 hz corresponding to the target wave and downstream the structure higher frequencies appear d2 d3 and d4 with energy comparable with the incident wave d3 and d4 these frequencies correspond to the f r e e w a v e s that travel slower than the incident phase velocity huang and dong 1999 they are the result of the water column variation that produces an increment in the advective acceleration positive or negative this acceleration is positive on the upstream slope and on the top flat zone of the structure up to the beginning of the structure downstream slope where the acceleration is negative due to the change in the hydrodynamic conditions along the submerged structure the mass conservation requires the free surface to adjust to the new flow conditions at the boundaries increasing the wave steepness and also increasing the wave nonlinearity over the upstream slope and at the top of the structure over the downstream slope the diffusive term in the momentum equation is more relevant than the advection term transferring energy from lower to higher frequencies notice that this structure has very mild slopes long flat top and the ratio of its height base lengths is much less than unity working as a flat structure in an almost parallel flow no flow separation occurs for this type of physical processes together with low reynolds number we call them linear fluid structure interaction mechanism from the fluid mechanics point of view 4 3 solitary wave slender structure interaction at higher complexity in this section the model is tested with a solitary wave interacting with a slender column results are compared against the data published by wu et al 2012 the goring and raichlen 1980 theory is used for the generation of the solitary wave since it is the used by the work of wu et al 2012 the still water level is h 14 cm and the wave height h 7 cm with a nonlinear parameter of ε 0 5 wave breaking is presented downstream of the structure the submerged structure is 10 cm high d and 2 cm thick w the experiment set up is shown in fig 19 the mesh size close to the solid walls is 0 8 mm to validate the model the piv velocity field data is qualitatively compared against the numerical results and quantitatively with the vertical velocity profiles for the numerical configuration the turbulent 2 d vertical κ ω s s t model is used with the no slip condition at the bottom zero velocity at the end of the wave flume and zero gradient pressure on the walls bottom and structure the turbulent quantities on the solid walls sub index w and at the free stream sub index are set based on the formulation suggested by hellsten 1998 equations 29 33 29 ω w 2 ν 0 075 d 2 30 κ w 10 7 31 ω γ u l 32 ν t 10 3 ν 33 κ ν t ω where ν d and γ are the fluid viscosity the first node wall distance and a proportionality coefficient between 1 and 10 respectively the eddy viscosity at the boundary layer ν t w follows the formulation presented by spalding 1961 which is valid along the entire boundary layer from y 1 to y 30 the advective terms in the transport equation are solved using the quick scheme eight velocity profiles at five different instants are compared with the experimental data these profiles are taken from z h to z η at 0 06 0 08 0 1 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 18 and 0 2 m from the downstream face of the slender column comparisons are performed at t 0 46 0 6 0 74 0 88 1 02 seconds after the wave crest reaches x 0 657 m see fig 19 additionally a qualitative comparison between velocity fields is shown for each time maximum errors for the horizontal and vertical velocity components for each time are reported in table 6 showing that the ai is higher than 83 the lower ai and the higher mae are obtained at t 1 02 seconds the post breaking time the highest discrepancies are obtained when the horizontal velocity profile has the strongest inflexion point center of the vortex with a vertical velocity slightly close to the vortex center in this situation the model underpredicts the velocity gradients decreasing the vorticity see figs 20 24 the vortex structure and the magnitude of the velocity are in agreement with the experimental ones figs 20 24 upper panel at t 0 46 s a flow separation appears due to the drag pressure force exerted on the flow inducing an adverse pressure gradient exerted by the solid column the main vortex at this time two vortices arise the main vortex located downstream the column and a second one at the top of the structure both reported by wu et al 2012 the main vortex is advected by the wave with velocity magnitudes decreasing slightly in the wave propagation axis this behaviour is observed by following the vortex velocity profiles all time steps and noticing that the vertical velocity close to the vortex center upstream and downstream has an almost constant value of 1 m s and the difference between the upper and lower around the vortex center horizontal velocities is also 1 m s see figs 20 24 lower panel following these description we hypothesize that the vortex travels faster than what it is being diffused by turbulent and viscous effects so that the advective term is more relevant than the diffusive one in the transport equation this behaviour is in contradiction with chang et al 2001 who postulated that the diffusion is higher than the advection downstream the submerged obstacle as the main vortex travels along the wave propagation axis the vortex on the top of the structure vanishes since there is no significant flow over the column the vortex generated by the flow separation induces downstream a steeper free surface profile at 0 6 and 0 74 s because the velocity is higher in the vortex upper zone accumulating mass at its downstream side see figs 21 22 as a result the water column loses its own stability until the moment when the wave breaking process appears t 0 88 s see fig 23 breaking is occurring in the opposite direction of wave propagation because the accumulated mass downstream the vortex is taken from the upstream side t 1 02 seconds see fig 23 this simulation gives more information about the crest crest exchange process reported by cooker et al 1990 where the physical phenomena was studied by using the euler s equations without viscous effects with no vortices in the flow when the backward breaking wave is present a new vortex appears and air is trapped in the water notice that this air entrainment is not capture by the piv measurements this vortex interacts with the main vortex produced by adverse pressure gradient evolving into an elliptic form without affecting its original direction and magnitude this implies that the turbulent structure is dominated by the flow separation effects even when the wave breaking processes occurs 5 conclusions a numerical model implemented in openfoam for dynamic mesh has been presented for wave propagation the numerical results can be analysed at the same points as the experimental data eliminating the need to calibrate the numerical incoming wave with the first experimental wave gauge as has to be done with static meshes the definition of the generation and propagation zones solved the cell deformation problem close to the vicinity of the wave structure interaction region the inclusion of the trailing waves in the solitary wave propagation includes a more realistic wave generated by the model we reiterate here that the properties of the solitary and wave trains are dependent on the generation method according to katell and eric 2002 a special treatment was made for the grid size in a region close to the limits between the paddle stroke in the so called wave generation zone and at the rigid mesh the wave propagation zone since geometric similarity must be preserved between the two areas when defining the computational grid additionally for a solitary wave propagation a mesh size of h 40 was found enough for a correct wave simulation even in wave structure scenario regarding monochromatic waves a vertical mesh size of h 25 was enough close to the free surface to validate the case of a solitary wave on a flat bottom the wave generation methods were tested for several discretization schemes of the convective terms model results were compared against the analytical solution for the solitary wave as well as with experimental data the tests included a solitary wave propagating with slip and non slip wall conditions for these cases the three different discretization schemes the ud quick and van leer were compared against the analytical solution for the different wave generation theories the results showed that the rayleigh method better fits the analytical solitary wave in terms of the wave amplitude the smallest wave decay rate and moderate spurious trailing waves none of the numerical schemes tested had effects on the trailing waves the quick and van leer schemes adjusted better the analytical solitary wave being the less diffusive schemes regarding the trailing waves the model results were compared with the experimental data reported by liu et al 2006 numerical results agreed very well with experimental data for the case corresponding to ε 0 409 the simulated trailing waves were above the measured ones indicating that the model underestimates the depression produced by the trailing waves once the main wave has passed a certain location these trailing waves were not affected neither by the fluid viscosity the bottom friction the discretization schemes nor by the surface tension they are directly induced by the wave generation method and modulated by the gravity force it is worth to note that the numerical wave decay ratio was higher than the obtained in the flume experiments when simulating the wave behaviour over a submerged trapezoidal structure the appearance of higher harmonics were well simulated for the monochromatic wave case where the trapezoidal obstacle can be seen as a thin plate on the flume bottom due to its small height length ratio 0 3 11 finally for a solitary wave flowing over a slender submerged column the comparison between modelled and measured velocity profiles showed that the model represented very well the measurements as the maximum error for the velocity profiles was 17 and that the advection effects were higher than the diffusive ones over the main vortex at the downstream side of the structure the turbulent flow structure at the submerged solid slender column was dominated by the flow separation effects even when the wave breaking processes occurred additionally the backward breaking wave was not induced by the bottom friction or water depth reduction but it was forced by the effect of the main vortex on the free surface profile this phenoma explaines in more detail the crest crest exchange processes presented by cooker et al 1990 and the backward wave breaking for future analysis the effect of the vortex on the structure stability should be studied since it can undermine the soil that embeds the structure and advecting it by the vortex displacement inducing a

23111,risk perception of the situation by an officer on watch is the basis for improving situational awareness which is crucial in preventing ship collisions in vessel encounter situations defining risk perception for a vessel collision situation requires identifying the perceived risk this paper derives a multiple linear regression model for studying risk perception on a ship in various collision encounter situations to illustrate the procedure the collision risk perceived by korea coast guard officers on a patrol ship was obtained and applied to calibrate the regression model the results demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to define risk perception and to provide a better understanding of the perceived risk in collision encounter situations the application of some

needed knowledge and understanding of the management of the various risks associated with the revised stcw in 2011 endsley 1995 divided situation awareness into three stages level 1 perception of the situation level 2 comprehension of the situation and level 3 projection of future status and grech et al 2002 showed that 71 of human errors were caused by lack of situation awareness on the voyage of these level 1 counted as 58 5 followed by level 2 and level 3 at 32 7 and 8 8 respectively wagenaar and groeneweg 1987 also demonstrated that lack of situation awareness is a key element in human errors chauvin et al 2008 showed that in decision making to avoid collisions incorrect perception of useful information was a key factor in level 1 cases this study was followed by another by chauvin et al 2013 on collision analysis using human factor analysis and classification which suggested that the principal components of human errors by navigators included inappropriate situation awareness 33 33 attention deficit 30 77 and knowledge limitations 20 51 furthermore various studies have shown that level 1 perception of the situation of situation awareness differs according to the degree of risk perception smith et al 1984 slovic 1987 cacciabue 2004 montewka et al 2014 thus a literature review of these studies reveals that perception of collision risks is a key factor in situation awareness in particular the application of perceived collision risk to situation awareness requires its quantification and identification there have been various studies on the quantification of perceived collision risks by oows inoue et al 1998 measured and assessed the difficulty levels in vessel maneuvering using a ship handling simulator inoue 2000 also evaluated the difficulty in vessel maneuvering under diverse vessel encountering situations as environmental stress using a ship handling simulator chin and debnath 2009 established a probabilistic perceived collision risk model based on pilots in singapore their study was based on a survey for assessing the risks perceived by pilots during daytime and night time according to vessel size cohen et al 2015 estimated the performance of students from the royal netherlands naval college by measuring their heart rates in response to highly stressful training scenarios using a naval vessel simulator and the evaluation results obtained using a cognitive performance and error model showed that stress was one of the factors that induce human errors on the other hand the ship domain must be considered when identifying perceived collision risks because the probability of collision is high when two ships are close to each other and the ship s domain of the ownship is invaded by the target ship and the perceived collision risk at this time is important for situation awareness current ship domain theory which is still widely used determines the spacing that is sufficient for collision avoidance between ships the ship domain designed by fujii and tanaka 1971 aims to secure sufficient space for a ship to avoid collisions and this was later divided into three sectors by goodwin 1975 davis et al 1980 and davis 1981 used a computer model to illustrate a continuous ellipses that represents the discontinuous boundary reported by goodwin 1975 based on the distance at the closest point of approach and the time to the closest point of approach tcpa at present the concept of this ship domain is being applied to various studies for collision avoidance for example the introduction of a new ship domain szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 linkage between the ship domain and the colregs the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea goerlandt et al 2015 he et al 2017 szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 and the application of a collision alert system cas in maritime traffic baldauf et al 2011 a study of the quantitative relation between the ship domain and risk perception has reported some results as shown in the above review however no identification of these quantitative relations using actual navigating vessels has been reported in this study therefore the estimation results of the risk perception performed using the navigating vessel were compared with the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 in addition the application of the comparison result is discussed as described above various terms related to the ship domain and risk perception are used in this study these terms are a combination of physical or psychological concepts therefore clear definitions and or explanations are needed fig 1 shows the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 denoted by a solid lined ellipse and the experimental area denoted by a dotted lined semicircle for conducting risk perception in this study this figure depicts the five collision encounter situations that are formed when two ships are navigating at a given speed with the own ship fixed at the 0 0 position of the x and y coordinates where o represents the position of the ownship t1 t5 represent the different positions of the target ship and m1 m5 indicate the positions when the target ship reaches the circumference of the ship domain the relative heading of the target ship is indicated by arrows in the vicinity of t1 t5 in this figure therefore cpa is always 0 miles and tcpa depends on the actual distance between the own and target ship definitions of the terms based on fig 1 used in this study are as follows the term risk perception refers to how the oows subjectively grade and or rate the risk of a collision in a collision encounter situation such as those shown in fig 1 in this respect the term perception of the situation is defined as the perception of the status attributes and dynamics of relevant elements in the environment endsley 1995 this perception of risk is therefore a means of quantitatively assessing the risks in the perception of the situation proposed by endsley 1995 the term relative bearing refers to the azimuth between the headings of both ships in a collision encounter situation measured clockwise from the heading of the own ship to the heading of the target ship in fig 1 the five azimuths 0 45 90 135 and 180 all represent relative bearings the term separation distance refers to the actual distance between the own and target ship in a collision encounter situation such as those shown in fig 1 this separation distance depends on the relative bearing for example for a 45 relative bearing the distance between o and t2 or the distance between o and m2 is the separation distance in particular the separation distance between o and m2 is the same as the marginal distance described below the term marginal distance refers to the distance from the ownship to the circumference of the ship domain for example for a 45 relative bearing distance between o and m2 is the marginal distance this marginal distance depends on the relative bearing the term risk score refers to the response to the degree of risk perceived by the oows onboard the ownship looking at the target ship the value of the risk score is the result of the oows responding with a scale of 0 100 in this respect the term risk ratio refers to the relative intensity of the risk score compared to the maximum risk score the values of the risk ratio range from 0 lowest relative risk to 1 0 highest relative risk the term risk ratio for marginal distance refers to the estimated risk ratio for a separation distance having the same value as the marginal distance for example for a 45 relative bearing it indicates the risk ratio that corresponds to the separation distance between o and m2 i e the marginal distance when the target ship is at the m2 position the term risk perception domain refers to a two dimensional coordinate space of risk ratios consisting of a combination of relative bearings and separation distances the remainder of this article is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology including formulas and evaluation of the multiple linear regression model to illustrate the relationship between separation distance and perceived risk between the two ships followed by the risk perception survey onboard the vessel section 3 presents the results of model estimation the visualization of risk perception and a comparison of the ship domain and risk perception in section 4 the results of the study and its application were discussed and in section 5 the results of the study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling the perceived collision risk a multiple linear regression model is formulated to establish a statistical relationship between the separation distance of two ships and the perceived collision risk then a method of evaluating the predictive power of the model and the goodness of fit of the model is described 2 1 1 model formulation multiple linear regression is used to model the relationship between an independent variable and more than one explanatory variable a multiple linear regression model can be written in vector form as 1 y xβ ε where y is the dependent variable vector x is the independent variable vector β is the parameter vector and ε is the vector of the error term n 0 σ 2 given an observed data set y i x i 1 x i p i 1 n of n statistical units the n equations for a multiple linear regression model can be written as 2 y i β 0 1 β 1 x i 1 β p x i p ε i where y i is an n dimensional dependent variable x i 1 x i 2 x i p are n p dimensional independent variables β 0 β 1 β p are p 1 dimensional parameters and ε i is an n dimensional error term the most common means of fitting a linear equation to observed data using multiple linear regression is to include polynomial terms such as square or cubic independent variables this is accomplished by treating x x 2 as distinct independent variables in a multiple linear regression model in this case when considering just one independent variable x i 1 we might propose a quadratic model of the form 3 y i β 0 1 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x i 1 2 ε i where β 0 β 1 and β 3 β 2 are the constant term linear term and squared terms respectively this model is nonlinear in the independent variable but linear in the parameters the ordinary least squares method minimizes the summed squares of residuals between the observed and fitted values this method can be written as a closed form expression to determine the estimated value β ˆ of the unknown parameter β 4 β x i x i t 1 x i y i and to determine the estimated value y ˆ i of the dependent variable y i 5 y ˆ i x i t β ˆ the risk ratio fitted values y ˆ i can be obtained by dividing each y ˆ i by the i t h maximum value as follows 6 y ˆ i y ˆ i max y ˆ i 2 1 2 model assessment a one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of x i included in a multiple regression model and to evaluate whether the model has sufficient explanatory power r 2 and adjusted r 2 were used for the predictive power of the model pearson s χ 2 test was used to determine whether or not the residuals of the model appear to fit the assumption of a normal distribution mathworks matlab matlab 2008 a commercial tool was used to evaluate the model 2 2 risk perception survey explaining the proposed model requires collecting data of perceived collision risks in different encounter situations from participants perceived risk data can be collected using various experimental methods such as ship handling simulation random surveying and scenario based surveying in the case of ship handling simulation there is the problem that it cannot reflect real situations at sea random surveying i e randomly providing questionnaires among participants onboard a vessel might lead to a lack of data for some desired situations scenario based surveying involves providing questionnaires filled by designated participants designated vessels and planned collision situations but this method can be dangerous it can be costly to conduct a survey for collision situations and readily controllable vessels and well organized operation teams are required as well nevertheless in our study scenario based surveying was used to collect collision risk data in specified encounter collision situations involving two 1000 ton korea coast guard kcg patrol ships since kcg patrol ships have readily controllable maneuvering systems and well organized operation teams they are suitable for scenario based surveying of collision risks all of our experiments received permission from kcg headquarters and were controlled by one of the co authors a captain in the patrol ship 2 2 1 scenario based survey design collecting perceived collision risk data requires developing a two way risk matrix defined by different values of the relative bearing and the separation distance here the relative bearing in degrees is the clockwise angle from the straight line of the ownship s heading to the straight line of the target ship s heading and the separation distance in nautical miles nm is the minimum distance between the position of the ownship and the position of the target ship the experimental values of the relative bearings and the separation distances formulated as a 5 by 12 risk matrix were determined based on case studies kim and yim 2016 2017 the resulting matrix consists of five relative bearings of 0 45 90 135 and 180 and 12 separation distances of 0 25 0 5 0 75 2 75 and 3 0 nm the experiment began at 3 0 nm and ended at 0 25 nm for the safety of the patrol ship and was repeated for five vessel collision encounter situations participants were asked to indicate their perceived collision risks using risk scores from zero lowest risk to 100 highest risk for each separation distance of the relative bearing as explained in the experimental scenarios shown in fig 2 scenario 1 depicts a collision encounter situation when the ownship maintains a course of 0 and the target ship maintains a course of 180 this indicates that the ownship and target ship are on a relative bearing of 0 the risk measurements are taken at 12 separation distances ranging from 3 to 0 25 nm separated by 0 25 nm intervals scenarios 2 through 5 show situations for relative bearings such as 45 90 135 and 180 respectively and the measurement separation distance is the same as in scenario 1 the scenarios are designed to reflect the case study in which there is a high risk of collision in the area of the semicircle on the right side of the ownship 2 2 2 scenario based survey experiments using two kcg patrol ships the scenario based survey was conducted in west southern open sea in the republic of korea one ship was designated as the ownship and the other was designated as the target ship experiments were conducted on the ownship with a total of 60 officers participating in the experiment as shown in fig 3 all participants were volunteers who recognized that this is an important study to prevent ship collision the age of the participants ranged from 25 to 58 years with a mean and standard deviation of 38 2 and 9 7 years respectively the onboard experience of the participants ranged from three months to 30 years with a mean and standard deviation of 6 6 and 7 2 years respectively the certificate grades of the participants which can be assigned from zero no certificate to five highest grade ranged from zero to five with a mean and standard deviation of 1 8 and 1 6 respectively the work experience of the participants ranged from 1 to 33 years with a mean and standard deviation of 12 0 years and 9 5 years respectively all participants completed at least one year of general navigation training including ship maneuvering practices and completed job training at least once every two years 3 results 3 1 results of data analysis and model design for a multiple linear regression model to have sufficient predictive power a regression term appropriate to the data and a sufficient sample size are required the sample size and regression terms of our model were determined using the χ 2 goodness of fit test based on the one way anova of risk scores for relative bearing and separation distance the predictive power of the determined model was evaluated using r 2 and adjusted r 2 3 1 1 risk score analysis for relative bearing one way anova was used to assess the statistical significance of the risk scores for the five relative bearings the significant main effects of the relative bearings f 4 3599 4 94 p 0 01 were observed those for the relative bearings of 135 mean 48 33 180 mean 46 58 45 mean 45 03 and 90 mean 44 60 were significantly greater than those for the relative bearing of 0 mean 41 4 no significant differences were observed between the relative bearings of 45 mean 45 03 and 90 mean 44 6 the results are shown in table 1 and illustrated in fig 4 in particular in fig 4 which is the mean and standard error of 720 risk scores i e the risk scores of 60 participants who responded at each of 12 separation distances for each of the relative bearings the difference between the average scores is small and the range of the standard error is widely distributed for example the average score on the relative bearing is approximately 40 and the standard error range is approximately 30 the main reason for this statistical feature is that the risk scores for each of the respondents have large deviations owing to their characteristics according to the distances and relative bearings the large deviation of the individuals affects the significance of the relative bearings for example in table 1 there is no significant difference p 0 27 between the 45 and 90 relative bearings a detailed analysis of each combination of the relative bearings and separation distances is given in section 3 1 2 below 3 1 2 risk score analysis for separation distance one way anova was used to assess the statistical significance of risk scores for 12 separation distances significant main effects of separation distance between 1 nm f 4 295 3 94 p 0 01 and 0 25 nm f 4 295 2 93 p 0 01 were observed no significant main effects of separation distance between 3 and 1 25 nm were observed except for 2 25 nm f 4 295 2 67 p 0 05 these results are shown in table 2 and the average risk score and variance are illustrated in fig 5 for visual confirmation of the relationship between the separation distance and the average risk score in fig 5 the difference between the variances for the five relative bearings increases in the range of 3 to 1 5 nm then decreases to the minimum in the range of 1 5 to 1 0 nm and then increases again in the range of 1 0 to 0 25 nm this trend can also be seen in the differences between the mean risk scores the results show that the ranking of the average risk scores for the five relative bearings varies in the range of 3 0 to 1 0 nm and that the ranking does not change in the range of 1 0 to 0 25 nm therefore it was found that the participants could identify the risk of collision on five relative bearings from a distance of less than one mile at a significant level 3 1 3 determination of results for sample size and regression terms two multiple linear regression models a linear model with constant and linear terms and a quadratic model with constant linear and square terms were used to determine a sufficient sample size and regression terms for the evaluation first using the χ 2 test a sample size that satisfies the 95 confidence level p 0 05 of the χ 2 was determined for both models then the regression terms were determined by evaluating r 2 and adjusted r 2 of the two models using the data with the determined sample size fig 6 shows the results of evaluating the p value of χ 2 for both models when the size of the 12 sample data shown in table 2 was increased sample sizes satisfying the 95 confidence level p 0 05 of χ 2 for all five relative bearings appeared from more than 111 samples in the linear model and more than 65 samples in the quadratic model here the sample size was increased using piecewise cubic hermite interpolation which does not impair the characteristics of the given data because there is no overshoot and the vibration is small moreover the p value of χ 2 was calculated by setting the bin number to ten and setting the expected value of the bean to zero to prevent pooling table 3 shows the calculation results of r 2 and adjusted r 2 for two evaluation models with a sample size of 111 for the linear model r 2 and adjusted r 2 were 0 9888 and 0 9887 respectively on all five relative bearings for the quadratic model for the five relative bearings r 2 ranged from 0 996 to 0 9976 and adjusted r 2 ranged from 0 9959 to 0 9976 this result indicates that the quadratic model is more improved at the precision level of the second decimal place compared to the linear model these two results showed that the multiple regression linear model with constant linear and squared terms and the interpolated mean risk score data with a sample size of 111 are suitable for modeling perceived risk here the sample size of 111 is an interpolation of the average risk score for 12 spacing distances at ten equal intervals which can retain the original data characteristics because the original data are included in the sample as described above and as shown in table 3 for the same sample size the quadratic model has a smaller mean square error and a larger predicted power compared to the linear model therefore it is found that the quadratic model is more accurate than the linear model 3 2 multiple linear regression modeling results the parameter estimation results of the multiple linear regression model with constant linear and quadratic terms were evaluated using f statistics of regression and the t test of coefficients the perception of objective risk was identified by evaluating the ratio of risk scores estimated in the multiple linear regression model it is also easy to identify relative risk perceptions by visualizing the risk perception domain composed of a combination of separation distances and relative bearings the risk perception domain was compared with the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 to identify the difference between the space required for collision avoidance and the perception space of the collision risk 3 2 1 estimation results of the multiple linear regression model the diagnostic statistics for the multiple linear regression estimates are represented in table 4 and illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for all of the parameters for the relative bearings shown in table 4 significant main effects of regression with a 95 confidence level were observed using f statistics for which all regression coefficients other than the constant term are zero moreover the regression term indicates significant differences in all pairs of coefficients except the term of constants this implies that all parameters can be included in the model the results of adding the 95 confidence interval fit to the regression line of the multiple linear regression model are shown in fig 7 the estimated risk score increases as the separation distance decreases for all five relative bearings in particular in the case of 0 nm in which the two ships are expected to collide the risk score estimated for the four relative bearings other than that for the relative bearing of 0 exceeds the maximum value of 100 on the measurement scale as the separation distance decreases the 95 confidence interval increases and visually overlaps between them fig 8 shows the residuals of regression line fitting and standard normal quantiles the residuals for the regression line fitting values were large in the small and large risk scores within a range of up to ten the residuals of the standard normal quantiles generally appeared to be suitable for the standard distribution assumption of residuals but that assumption appears to be slightly inadequate in both tails of the residuals here the perceived risk of a participant is an index of neither subjective nor objective risk but the risk score estimated by multiple regression analysis is an index that can be used to evaluate the magnitude of risk subjectively from a statistical point of view döderlein 1983 furthermore since the ratio of the risk among the estimated risk scores is a relative value it can be used as an index for evaluating the objective intensity of risk using the risk ratio the risk can be evaluated within the range of the ratio even if the predicted risk score exceeds 100 and the 95 confidence interval can also be expressed as the value within the ratio therefore in this study risk perception was identified using the risk ratio 3 2 2 identified results of risk perception using 6 the estimated risk score was converted to a risk ratio ranging from zero lowest relative risk to 1 0 highest relative risk as illustrated in fig 9 where the risk ratio is the fraction of the estimated risk score for all relative bearings and all separation distances divided by the maximum estimated risk score that is the risk ratio refers to the relative intensity of the perceived risk for each relative bearing and each separation distance for example in fig 9 the risk ratios near 3 miles are approximately 0 6 which means that the estimated risk score near 3 miles indicates that the intensity of the perceived risk is smaller by a factor of 6 10 i e 0 6 than the estimated risk scores of all the relative bearings and all separation distances on the contrary for the 135 relative bearing the risk ratio is 1 0 the maximum value at all separation distances which indicates that the intensity of the perceived risk is greatest for 135 relative to all other relative bearings this risk ratio varies with distance which will be described in detail below for the 135 relative bearing the risk ratio at all separation distances was 1 0 and the 95 confidence interval was generally 1 0 but between 2 and 1 nm the upper 95 confidence interval of the 180 relative bearing is slightly invading therefore the participant perceived the collision encounter situation as the greatest risk for the 135 relative bearing for the 180 relative bearing the risk ratio is generally the second highest but between approximately 1 5 and 0 nm the 95 confidence intervals for the relative bearings of 45 and 90 are very invading in particular for the relative bearings of 45 and 90 these 95 confidence intervals overlap and a change occurs in the ranking of the risk ratios at separation distances of 2 3 and 1 2 nm these results are consistent with the results of the foregoing analysis with no significant difference between the risk scores of the 45 and 90 relative bearings on the other hand in the case of the relative bearing of 45 the risk ratio at a separation distance of 0 nm is larger than that for the relative bearing of 180 for the relative bearing of 0 the risk ratio was the smallest among the five relative bearings here the results of the study described above are compared with those of the existing studies as follows inoue 2000 assessed the difficulty of ship maneuvers between five relative bearings with a cumulative stress ratio at 0 relative bearing of 1 this type of stress is known to affect the risk perception however no formalized quantitative relation of this has been reported inoue 2000 bye and lambic 2007 cohen et al 2015 therefore in this study only the rankings between the risk ratios and cumulative stress ratios were compared for the five relative bearings according to the results in inoue 2000 the relative bearings of 135 180 90 45 and 0 are represented from the first to the fifth rank respectively and their ratio values are 3 01 2 46 1 71 1 14 and 1 0 respectively similarly our results also show that the relative bearings of 135 180 90 45 and 0 are partially represented from the first to the fifth rank respectively and that these orders are partially different depending on the separation distance as shown in fig 9 from these comparative results it was found that the rank of the risk ratio in our results partially coincided with the rank of the cumulative stress ratio of inoue 2000 however various factors such as the shape and speed of the ship the distance between the two ships the navigational environment and the time of day are known to affect risk perception inoue et al 1998 chin and debnath 2009 accordingly our results for these two 1000 ton patrol ships in a given environment are limited and the effects of these various factors on risk perception will be the subjects of ongoing studies fig 10 shows the results of visualizing the risk ratio as a risk perception domain where the x and y axes represent the relative bearing and the separation distance respectively and the various colors correspond to the risk ratio values a color bar next to the right hand y axis shows the value of the risk ratio which indicates that the risk increases as the color becomes closer from blue to red visually a space near the relative bearing of 135 appears as the highest intensity of risk perception and the size of the zone achieves maximum and minimum intensities at 1 5 and 3 nm separation distances respectively in the vicinity of the 45 relative bearing the intensity of the risk perception is largest near the separation distance of 0 nm and the intensity of the risk perception decreases as the separation distance gradually decreases the risk perception domain has the advantage of easily understanding the intensity of risk perception for a combination of relative bearings and separation distances from these results the risk perception of the ship s collision encounter situation for each combination of relative bearings and separation distances was identified as follows first the relative bearing of 135 was the greatest risk out of the five relative bearings at all separation distances second the relative bearings of 45 and 90 are difficult to distinguish from each other but the relative bearings of 45 are estimated to be riskier than the relative bearings of 180 at a separation distance of 0 nm 3 2 3 comparison results of identified risk perception and ship domain the ship domain is defined as an area the oows want to keep free of any target and or intruder and this domain area has usually the shape of an ellipse szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 the distance from the ownship to the circumference of the ellipse is the marginal distance required for collision avoidance in the ship domain the risk ratio corresponding to the marginal distance of the ship domain was calculated to compare the ship and risk perception domains where the marginal distance of the ship domain is obtained by referring to the image of the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 the calculation results are shown in fig 11 where the x axis represents the relative bearing the y axis on the left represents the marginal distance for the ship domain and the y axis on the right represents the risk ratio of the risk perception domain for the ship domain the marginal distance for the relative bearing of 18 appears to be the farthest 1 41 nm and the marginal distance for the relative bearing of 180 is the nearest 0 48 nm on the other hand for the risk perception domain the value of the risk ratio which corresponds to the marginal distance of the ship domain is 1 0 at the relative bearing of 135 and the smallest at 0 85 at the relative bearing of 0 the comparison results showed that a bearing difference of 127 18 135 occurred between 18 on the relative bearing at which the marginal distance is the maximum value in the ship domain and 135 on the relative bearing at which the risk ratio is maximum in the risk perception domain in addition it was found that a bearing difference of 180 180 0 occurred between 180 on the relative bearing where the marginal distance is the minimum value in the ship domain and 0 on the relative bearing where the risk ratio is minimum in the risk perception domain the results indicated that there is a roughly opposite space between the ship and risk perception domains 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of results risk perception of the situation proposed is the basis of situational awareness as shown in the foregoing results the proposed multiple regression linear models have a reasonable predictive power leading to a risk ratio suitable for describing the perception of the risk situation and to an easy understanding of the risk perception three interesting findings were derived from these results firstly the intensity of risk for the relative bearing of 135 was the largest for all of the relative bearings secondly at 0 miles the intensity of the risk for the relative bearing of 45 was the second largest after the relative bearing of 135 third comparing the marginal distances for the relative bearings of 45 and 135 the ship domain has the longest marginal distance at 45 while the risk perception domain has the highest risk intensity at 135 according to colregs when two vessels are meeting on collision courses each vessel is to pass on the port side of the other to avoid collision hence when a collision course of a 135 relative bearing occurs the oow is to take a collision avoidance action through various ship maneuverings such as turning away from the back of the target ship or turning to the left of the ownship in this situation the oow must make optimal decisions considering various situations and hence he feels the burden of ship control with the burden gradually increasing as a result of the decrease in the separation distance inoue 2000 also reported that handling the ship in a collision situation at 135 relative bearing is the most difficult as discussed above the marginal distance of the ship domain is wide in the area close to the heading of the ownship however the intensity of the perceived risk is stronger in the area close to the stern bearing of the ownship based on the discussion we found that the ship domain needs to be considered to enhance the perception of the situation proposed by endsley 1995 one way to apply the results of this study to enhance the perception of the situation is discussed in section 4 2 below 4 2 discussion concerning the application of the results based on the discussion of the results described above it is thought that there is a certain relationship between the three factors colregs ship domain and risk perception domain however unfortunately coregs does not use the term domain area and gives no indication at all of the shape or dimension of the ship domain nor does it provide any quantification for safe distances hilgert and baldauf 1997 in this respect various research results related to colregs ship domain and collision alerts have been reported as follows goerlandt et al 2015 proposed a framework for a risk informed maritime cas collision alert system that is useful for developing cas applications for different navigational environments and in specific operations such as convoy navigation in ice szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 offered a systematic and critical review of the newer ship domain models and discussed several differences in their approaches to ship domain concepts baldauf et al 2017 introduced a method for triggering collision warnings by focusing specifically on the critical last phase of an encounter and introduced the imo approach of defining alerts as a term including cautions warnings and alarms szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 focused on a radar based collision threat parameters area display designed to support the selection of safe maneuvers and presented a heuristic approach for maneuver selections when using this display baldauf et al 2011 conducted a comparative study of a traffic alert and collision avoidance system used by air traffic which identified potential synergies to improve maritime operational risk management he et al 2017 presented a novel quantitative analysis system for colregs and seamanship as a result of these literature reviews it was found that a technical elaboration is needed to apply the risk perception domain as proposed in this study to enhance the perception of the situation level 1 in the situation awareness proposed by endsley 1995 applying our research results to raise awareness of the situation is the subject of our ongoing work 5 conclusions a multiple linear regression model was derived for statistical modeling of perceived collision risk in a vessel encounter situation at sea to illustrate the method perceived risks were obtained from an experiment involving a risk perception survey of kcg officers onboard a patrol ship and we used to calibrate the models for different vessel encounter situations the estimation results of the models show that all of the calibrated modules have reasonable goodness of fit and predictive power and that the perceived risks are reasonably reflective of the ship collision situations several interesting findings were derived from the analyses first participants perceived the highest risk at the relative bearing at 135 and the lowest risk at the relative bearing at 0 second for relative bearings between 180 90 and 45 the intensity of risk perception varies by separation distance but for the relative bearing of 45 at a distance of 0 nm there was the second highest perceived intensity of risk third the difference between the relative bearing at which the longest marginal distance appears in the ship domain and the relative bearing at which the highest intensity risk appears in the risk perception domain is 127 finally it was found that a technical elaboration was needed to apply the risk perception domain proposed in this study to enhance the perception of the situation this research provides valuable insights into the modeling of the perception of collision risk by an oow in encountering situations and the result model is expected to be applied to the development of a new system capable of enhancing the perception of the situation acknowledgment this work is supported by the ministry of oceans and fisheries korea and

23111,risk perception of the situation by an officer on watch is the basis for improving situational awareness which is crucial in preventing ship collisions in vessel encounter situations defining risk perception for a vessel collision situation requires identifying the perceived risk this paper derives a multiple linear regression model for studying risk perception on a ship in various collision encounter situations to illustrate the procedure the collision risk perceived by korea coast guard officers on a patrol ship was obtained and applied to calibrate the regression model the results demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to define risk perception and to provide a better understanding of the perceived risk in collision encounter situations the application of some

needed knowledge and understanding of the management of the various risks associated with the revised stcw in 2011 endsley 1995 divided situation awareness into three stages level 1 perception of the situation level 2 comprehension of the situation and level 3 projection of future status and grech et al 2002 showed that 71 of human errors were caused by lack of situation awareness on the voyage of these level 1 counted as 58 5 followed by level 2 and level 3 at 32 7 and 8 8 respectively wagenaar and groeneweg 1987 also demonstrated that lack of situation awareness is a key element in human errors chauvin et al 2008 showed that in decision making to avoid collisions incorrect perception of useful information was a key factor in level 1 cases this study was followed by another by chauvin et al 2013 on collision analysis using human factor analysis and classification which suggested that the principal components of human errors by navigators included inappropriate situation awareness 33 33 attention deficit 30 77 and knowledge limitations 20 51 furthermore various studies have shown that level 1 perception of the situation of situation awareness differs according to the degree of risk perception smith et al 1984 slovic 1987 cacciabue 2004 montewka et al 2014 thus a literature review of these studies reveals that perception of collision risks is a key factor in situation awareness in particular the application of perceived collision risk to situation awareness requires its quantification and identification there have been various studies on the quantification of perceived collision risks by oows inoue et al 1998 measured and assessed the difficulty levels in vessel maneuvering using a ship handling simulator inoue 2000 also evaluated the difficulty in vessel maneuvering under diverse vessel encountering situations as environmental stress using a ship handling simulator chin and debnath 2009 established a probabilistic perceived collision risk model based on pilots in singapore their study was based on a survey for assessing the risks perceived by pilots during daytime and night time according to vessel size cohen et al 2015 estimated the performance of students from the royal netherlands naval college by measuring their heart rates in response to highly stressful training scenarios using a naval vessel simulator and the evaluation results obtained using a cognitive performance and error model showed that stress was one of the factors that induce human errors on the other hand the ship domain must be considered when identifying perceived collision risks because the probability of collision is high when two ships are close to each other and the ship s domain of the ownship is invaded by the target ship and the perceived collision risk at this time is important for situation awareness current ship domain theory which is still widely used determines the spacing that is sufficient for collision avoidance between ships the ship domain designed by fujii and tanaka 1971 aims to secure sufficient space for a ship to avoid collisions and this was later divided into three sectors by goodwin 1975 davis et al 1980 and davis 1981 used a computer model to illustrate a continuous ellipses that represents the discontinuous boundary reported by goodwin 1975 based on the distance at the closest point of approach and the time to the closest point of approach tcpa at present the concept of this ship domain is being applied to various studies for collision avoidance for example the introduction of a new ship domain szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 linkage between the ship domain and the colregs the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea goerlandt et al 2015 he et al 2017 szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 and the application of a collision alert system cas in maritime traffic baldauf et al 2011 a study of the quantitative relation between the ship domain and risk perception has reported some results as shown in the above review however no identification of these quantitative relations using actual navigating vessels has been reported in this study therefore the estimation results of the risk perception performed using the navigating vessel were compared with the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 in addition the application of the comparison result is discussed as described above various terms related to the ship domain and risk perception are used in this study these terms are a combination of physical or psychological concepts therefore clear definitions and or explanations are needed fig 1 shows the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 denoted by a solid lined ellipse and the experimental area denoted by a dotted lined semicircle for conducting risk perception in this study this figure depicts the five collision encounter situations that are formed when two ships are navigating at a given speed with the own ship fixed at the 0 0 position of the x and y coordinates where o represents the position of the ownship t1 t5 represent the different positions of the target ship and m1 m5 indicate the positions when the target ship reaches the circumference of the ship domain the relative heading of the target ship is indicated by arrows in the vicinity of t1 t5 in this figure therefore cpa is always 0 miles and tcpa depends on the actual distance between the own and target ship definitions of the terms based on fig 1 used in this study are as follows the term risk perception refers to how the oows subjectively grade and or rate the risk of a collision in a collision encounter situation such as those shown in fig 1 in this respect the term perception of the situation is defined as the perception of the status attributes and dynamics of relevant elements in the environment endsley 1995 this perception of risk is therefore a means of quantitatively assessing the risks in the perception of the situation proposed by endsley 1995 the term relative bearing refers to the azimuth between the headings of both ships in a collision encounter situation measured clockwise from the heading of the own ship to the heading of the target ship in fig 1 the five azimuths 0 45 90 135 and 180 all represent relative bearings the term separation distance refers to the actual distance between the own and target ship in a collision encounter situation such as those shown in fig 1 this separation distance depends on the relative bearing for example for a 45 relative bearing the distance between o and t2 or the distance between o and m2 is the separation distance in particular the separation distance between o and m2 is the same as the marginal distance described below the term marginal distance refers to the distance from the ownship to the circumference of the ship domain for example for a 45 relative bearing distance between o and m2 is the marginal distance this marginal distance depends on the relative bearing the term risk score refers to the response to the degree of risk perceived by the oows onboard the ownship looking at the target ship the value of the risk score is the result of the oows responding with a scale of 0 100 in this respect the term risk ratio refers to the relative intensity of the risk score compared to the maximum risk score the values of the risk ratio range from 0 lowest relative risk to 1 0 highest relative risk the term risk ratio for marginal distance refers to the estimated risk ratio for a separation distance having the same value as the marginal distance for example for a 45 relative bearing it indicates the risk ratio that corresponds to the separation distance between o and m2 i e the marginal distance when the target ship is at the m2 position the term risk perception domain refers to a two dimensional coordinate space of risk ratios consisting of a combination of relative bearings and separation distances the remainder of this article is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology including formulas and evaluation of the multiple linear regression model to illustrate the relationship between separation distance and perceived risk between the two ships followed by the risk perception survey onboard the vessel section 3 presents the results of model estimation the visualization of risk perception and a comparison of the ship domain and risk perception in section 4 the results of the study and its application were discussed and in section 5 the results of the study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling the perceived collision risk a multiple linear regression model is formulated to establish a statistical relationship between the separation distance of two ships and the perceived collision risk then a method of evaluating the predictive power of the model and the goodness of fit of the model is described 2 1 1 model formulation multiple linear regression is used to model the relationship between an independent variable and more than one explanatory variable a multiple linear regression model can be written in vector form as 1 y xβ ε where y is the dependent variable vector x is the independent variable vector β is the parameter vector and ε is the vector of the error term n 0 σ 2 given an observed data set y i x i 1 x i p i 1 n of n statistical units the n equations for a multiple linear regression model can be written as 2 y i β 0 1 β 1 x i 1 β p x i p ε i where y i is an n dimensional dependent variable x i 1 x i 2 x i p are n p dimensional independent variables β 0 β 1 β p are p 1 dimensional parameters and ε i is an n dimensional error term the most common means of fitting a linear equation to observed data using multiple linear regression is to include polynomial terms such as square or cubic independent variables this is accomplished by treating x x 2 as distinct independent variables in a multiple linear regression model in this case when considering just one independent variable x i 1 we might propose a quadratic model of the form 3 y i β 0 1 β 1 x i 1 β 2 x i 1 2 ε i where β 0 β 1 and β 3 β 2 are the constant term linear term and squared terms respectively this model is nonlinear in the independent variable but linear in the parameters the ordinary least squares method minimizes the summed squares of residuals between the observed and fitted values this method can be written as a closed form expression to determine the estimated value β ˆ of the unknown parameter β 4 β x i x i t 1 x i y i and to determine the estimated value y ˆ i of the dependent variable y i 5 y ˆ i x i t β ˆ the risk ratio fitted values y ˆ i can be obtained by dividing each y ˆ i by the i t h maximum value as follows 6 y ˆ i y ˆ i max y ˆ i 2 1 2 model assessment a one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of x i included in a multiple regression model and to evaluate whether the model has sufficient explanatory power r 2 and adjusted r 2 were used for the predictive power of the model pearson s χ 2 test was used to determine whether or not the residuals of the model appear to fit the assumption of a normal distribution mathworks matlab matlab 2008 a commercial tool was used to evaluate the model 2 2 risk perception survey explaining the proposed model requires collecting data of perceived collision risks in different encounter situations from participants perceived risk data can be collected using various experimental methods such as ship handling simulation random surveying and scenario based surveying in the case of ship handling simulation there is the problem that it cannot reflect real situations at sea random surveying i e randomly providing questionnaires among participants onboard a vessel might lead to a lack of data for some desired situations scenario based surveying involves providing questionnaires filled by designated participants designated vessels and planned collision situations but this method can be dangerous it can be costly to conduct a survey for collision situations and readily controllable vessels and well organized operation teams are required as well nevertheless in our study scenario based surveying was used to collect collision risk data in specified encounter collision situations involving two 1000 ton korea coast guard kcg patrol ships since kcg patrol ships have readily controllable maneuvering systems and well organized operation teams they are suitable for scenario based surveying of collision risks all of our experiments received permission from kcg headquarters and were controlled by one of the co authors a captain in the patrol ship 2 2 1 scenario based survey design collecting perceived collision risk data requires developing a two way risk matrix defined by different values of the relative bearing and the separation distance here the relative bearing in degrees is the clockwise angle from the straight line of the ownship s heading to the straight line of the target ship s heading and the separation distance in nautical miles nm is the minimum distance between the position of the ownship and the position of the target ship the experimental values of the relative bearings and the separation distances formulated as a 5 by 12 risk matrix were determined based on case studies kim and yim 2016 2017 the resulting matrix consists of five relative bearings of 0 45 90 135 and 180 and 12 separation distances of 0 25 0 5 0 75 2 75 and 3 0 nm the experiment began at 3 0 nm and ended at 0 25 nm for the safety of the patrol ship and was repeated for five vessel collision encounter situations participants were asked to indicate their perceived collision risks using risk scores from zero lowest risk to 100 highest risk for each separation distance of the relative bearing as explained in the experimental scenarios shown in fig 2 scenario 1 depicts a collision encounter situation when the ownship maintains a course of 0 and the target ship maintains a course of 180 this indicates that the ownship and target ship are on a relative bearing of 0 the risk measurements are taken at 12 separation distances ranging from 3 to 0 25 nm separated by 0 25 nm intervals scenarios 2 through 5 show situations for relative bearings such as 45 90 135 and 180 respectively and the measurement separation distance is the same as in scenario 1 the scenarios are designed to reflect the case study in which there is a high risk of collision in the area of the semicircle on the right side of the ownship 2 2 2 scenario based survey experiments using two kcg patrol ships the scenario based survey was conducted in west southern open sea in the republic of korea one ship was designated as the ownship and the other was designated as the target ship experiments were conducted on the ownship with a total of 60 officers participating in the experiment as shown in fig 3 all participants were volunteers who recognized that this is an important study to prevent ship collision the age of the participants ranged from 25 to 58 years with a mean and standard deviation of 38 2 and 9 7 years respectively the onboard experience of the participants ranged from three months to 30 years with a mean and standard deviation of 6 6 and 7 2 years respectively the certificate grades of the participants which can be assigned from zero no certificate to five highest grade ranged from zero to five with a mean and standard deviation of 1 8 and 1 6 respectively the work experience of the participants ranged from 1 to 33 years with a mean and standard deviation of 12 0 years and 9 5 years respectively all participants completed at least one year of general navigation training including ship maneuvering practices and completed job training at least once every two years 3 results 3 1 results of data analysis and model design for a multiple linear regression model to have sufficient predictive power a regression term appropriate to the data and a sufficient sample size are required the sample size and regression terms of our model were determined using the χ 2 goodness of fit test based on the one way anova of risk scores for relative bearing and separation distance the predictive power of the determined model was evaluated using r 2 and adjusted r 2 3 1 1 risk score analysis for relative bearing one way anova was used to assess the statistical significance of the risk scores for the five relative bearings the significant main effects of the relative bearings f 4 3599 4 94 p 0 01 were observed those for the relative bearings of 135 mean 48 33 180 mean 46 58 45 mean 45 03 and 90 mean 44 60 were significantly greater than those for the relative bearing of 0 mean 41 4 no significant differences were observed between the relative bearings of 45 mean 45 03 and 90 mean 44 6 the results are shown in table 1 and illustrated in fig 4 in particular in fig 4 which is the mean and standard error of 720 risk scores i e the risk scores of 60 participants who responded at each of 12 separation distances for each of the relative bearings the difference between the average scores is small and the range of the standard error is widely distributed for example the average score on the relative bearing is approximately 40 and the standard error range is approximately 30 the main reason for this statistical feature is that the risk scores for each of the respondents have large deviations owing to their characteristics according to the distances and relative bearings the large deviation of the individuals affects the significance of the relative bearings for example in table 1 there is no significant difference p 0 27 between the 45 and 90 relative bearings a detailed analysis of each combination of the relative bearings and separation distances is given in section 3 1 2 below 3 1 2 risk score analysis for separation distance one way anova was used to assess the statistical significance of risk scores for 12 separation distances significant main effects of separation distance between 1 nm f 4 295 3 94 p 0 01 and 0 25 nm f 4 295 2 93 p 0 01 were observed no significant main effects of separation distance between 3 and 1 25 nm were observed except for 2 25 nm f 4 295 2 67 p 0 05 these results are shown in table 2 and the average risk score and variance are illustrated in fig 5 for visual confirmation of the relationship between the separation distance and the average risk score in fig 5 the difference between the variances for the five relative bearings increases in the range of 3 to 1 5 nm then decreases to the minimum in the range of 1 5 to 1 0 nm and then increases again in the range of 1 0 to 0 25 nm this trend can also be seen in the differences between the mean risk scores the results show that the ranking of the average risk scores for the five relative bearings varies in the range of 3 0 to 1 0 nm and that the ranking does not change in the range of 1 0 to 0 25 nm therefore it was found that the participants could identify the risk of collision on five relative bearings from a distance of less than one mile at a significant level 3 1 3 determination of results for sample size and regression terms two multiple linear regression models a linear model with constant and linear terms and a quadratic model with constant linear and square terms were used to determine a sufficient sample size and regression terms for the evaluation first using the χ 2 test a sample size that satisfies the 95 confidence level p 0 05 of the χ 2 was determined for both models then the regression terms were determined by evaluating r 2 and adjusted r 2 of the two models using the data with the determined sample size fig 6 shows the results of evaluating the p value of χ 2 for both models when the size of the 12 sample data shown in table 2 was increased sample sizes satisfying the 95 confidence level p 0 05 of χ 2 for all five relative bearings appeared from more than 111 samples in the linear model and more than 65 samples in the quadratic model here the sample size was increased using piecewise cubic hermite interpolation which does not impair the characteristics of the given data because there is no overshoot and the vibration is small moreover the p value of χ 2 was calculated by setting the bin number to ten and setting the expected value of the bean to zero to prevent pooling table 3 shows the calculation results of r 2 and adjusted r 2 for two evaluation models with a sample size of 111 for the linear model r 2 and adjusted r 2 were 0 9888 and 0 9887 respectively on all five relative bearings for the quadratic model for the five relative bearings r 2 ranged from 0 996 to 0 9976 and adjusted r 2 ranged from 0 9959 to 0 9976 this result indicates that the quadratic model is more improved at the precision level of the second decimal place compared to the linear model these two results showed that the multiple regression linear model with constant linear and squared terms and the interpolated mean risk score data with a sample size of 111 are suitable for modeling perceived risk here the sample size of 111 is an interpolation of the average risk score for 12 spacing distances at ten equal intervals which can retain the original data characteristics because the original data are included in the sample as described above and as shown in table 3 for the same sample size the quadratic model has a smaller mean square error and a larger predicted power compared to the linear model therefore it is found that the quadratic model is more accurate than the linear model 3 2 multiple linear regression modeling results the parameter estimation results of the multiple linear regression model with constant linear and quadratic terms were evaluated using f statistics of regression and the t test of coefficients the perception of objective risk was identified by evaluating the ratio of risk scores estimated in the multiple linear regression model it is also easy to identify relative risk perceptions by visualizing the risk perception domain composed of a combination of separation distances and relative bearings the risk perception domain was compared with the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 to identify the difference between the space required for collision avoidance and the perception space of the collision risk 3 2 1 estimation results of the multiple linear regression model the diagnostic statistics for the multiple linear regression estimates are represented in table 4 and illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for all of the parameters for the relative bearings shown in table 4 significant main effects of regression with a 95 confidence level were observed using f statistics for which all regression coefficients other than the constant term are zero moreover the regression term indicates significant differences in all pairs of coefficients except the term of constants this implies that all parameters can be included in the model the results of adding the 95 confidence interval fit to the regression line of the multiple linear regression model are shown in fig 7 the estimated risk score increases as the separation distance decreases for all five relative bearings in particular in the case of 0 nm in which the two ships are expected to collide the risk score estimated for the four relative bearings other than that for the relative bearing of 0 exceeds the maximum value of 100 on the measurement scale as the separation distance decreases the 95 confidence interval increases and visually overlaps between them fig 8 shows the residuals of regression line fitting and standard normal quantiles the residuals for the regression line fitting values were large in the small and large risk scores within a range of up to ten the residuals of the standard normal quantiles generally appeared to be suitable for the standard distribution assumption of residuals but that assumption appears to be slightly inadequate in both tails of the residuals here the perceived risk of a participant is an index of neither subjective nor objective risk but the risk score estimated by multiple regression analysis is an index that can be used to evaluate the magnitude of risk subjectively from a statistical point of view döderlein 1983 furthermore since the ratio of the risk among the estimated risk scores is a relative value it can be used as an index for evaluating the objective intensity of risk using the risk ratio the risk can be evaluated within the range of the ratio even if the predicted risk score exceeds 100 and the 95 confidence interval can also be expressed as the value within the ratio therefore in this study risk perception was identified using the risk ratio 3 2 2 identified results of risk perception using 6 the estimated risk score was converted to a risk ratio ranging from zero lowest relative risk to 1 0 highest relative risk as illustrated in fig 9 where the risk ratio is the fraction of the estimated risk score for all relative bearings and all separation distances divided by the maximum estimated risk score that is the risk ratio refers to the relative intensity of the perceived risk for each relative bearing and each separation distance for example in fig 9 the risk ratios near 3 miles are approximately 0 6 which means that the estimated risk score near 3 miles indicates that the intensity of the perceived risk is smaller by a factor of 6 10 i e 0 6 than the estimated risk scores of all the relative bearings and all separation distances on the contrary for the 135 relative bearing the risk ratio is 1 0 the maximum value at all separation distances which indicates that the intensity of the perceived risk is greatest for 135 relative to all other relative bearings this risk ratio varies with distance which will be described in detail below for the 135 relative bearing the risk ratio at all separation distances was 1 0 and the 95 confidence interval was generally 1 0 but between 2 and 1 nm the upper 95 confidence interval of the 180 relative bearing is slightly invading therefore the participant perceived the collision encounter situation as the greatest risk for the 135 relative bearing for the 180 relative bearing the risk ratio is generally the second highest but between approximately 1 5 and 0 nm the 95 confidence intervals for the relative bearings of 45 and 90 are very invading in particular for the relative bearings of 45 and 90 these 95 confidence intervals overlap and a change occurs in the ranking of the risk ratios at separation distances of 2 3 and 1 2 nm these results are consistent with the results of the foregoing analysis with no significant difference between the risk scores of the 45 and 90 relative bearings on the other hand in the case of the relative bearing of 45 the risk ratio at a separation distance of 0 nm is larger than that for the relative bearing of 180 for the relative bearing of 0 the risk ratio was the smallest among the five relative bearings here the results of the study described above are compared with those of the existing studies as follows inoue 2000 assessed the difficulty of ship maneuvers between five relative bearings with a cumulative stress ratio at 0 relative bearing of 1 this type of stress is known to affect the risk perception however no formalized quantitative relation of this has been reported inoue 2000 bye and lambic 2007 cohen et al 2015 therefore in this study only the rankings between the risk ratios and cumulative stress ratios were compared for the five relative bearings according to the results in inoue 2000 the relative bearings of 135 180 90 45 and 0 are represented from the first to the fifth rank respectively and their ratio values are 3 01 2 46 1 71 1 14 and 1 0 respectively similarly our results also show that the relative bearings of 135 180 90 45 and 0 are partially represented from the first to the fifth rank respectively and that these orders are partially different depending on the separation distance as shown in fig 9 from these comparative results it was found that the rank of the risk ratio in our results partially coincided with the rank of the cumulative stress ratio of inoue 2000 however various factors such as the shape and speed of the ship the distance between the two ships the navigational environment and the time of day are known to affect risk perception inoue et al 1998 chin and debnath 2009 accordingly our results for these two 1000 ton patrol ships in a given environment are limited and the effects of these various factors on risk perception will be the subjects of ongoing studies fig 10 shows the results of visualizing the risk ratio as a risk perception domain where the x and y axes represent the relative bearing and the separation distance respectively and the various colors correspond to the risk ratio values a color bar next to the right hand y axis shows the value of the risk ratio which indicates that the risk increases as the color becomes closer from blue to red visually a space near the relative bearing of 135 appears as the highest intensity of risk perception and the size of the zone achieves maximum and minimum intensities at 1 5 and 3 nm separation distances respectively in the vicinity of the 45 relative bearing the intensity of the risk perception is largest near the separation distance of 0 nm and the intensity of the risk perception decreases as the separation distance gradually decreases the risk perception domain has the advantage of easily understanding the intensity of risk perception for a combination of relative bearings and separation distances from these results the risk perception of the ship s collision encounter situation for each combination of relative bearings and separation distances was identified as follows first the relative bearing of 135 was the greatest risk out of the five relative bearings at all separation distances second the relative bearings of 45 and 90 are difficult to distinguish from each other but the relative bearings of 45 are estimated to be riskier than the relative bearings of 180 at a separation distance of 0 nm 3 2 3 comparison results of identified risk perception and ship domain the ship domain is defined as an area the oows want to keep free of any target and or intruder and this domain area has usually the shape of an ellipse szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 the distance from the ownship to the circumference of the ellipse is the marginal distance required for collision avoidance in the ship domain the risk ratio corresponding to the marginal distance of the ship domain was calculated to compare the ship and risk perception domains where the marginal distance of the ship domain is obtained by referring to the image of the ship domain proposed by davis et al 1980 the calculation results are shown in fig 11 where the x axis represents the relative bearing the y axis on the left represents the marginal distance for the ship domain and the y axis on the right represents the risk ratio of the risk perception domain for the ship domain the marginal distance for the relative bearing of 18 appears to be the farthest 1 41 nm and the marginal distance for the relative bearing of 180 is the nearest 0 48 nm on the other hand for the risk perception domain the value of the risk ratio which corresponds to the marginal distance of the ship domain is 1 0 at the relative bearing of 135 and the smallest at 0 85 at the relative bearing of 0 the comparison results showed that a bearing difference of 127 18 135 occurred between 18 on the relative bearing at which the marginal distance is the maximum value in the ship domain and 135 on the relative bearing at which the risk ratio is maximum in the risk perception domain in addition it was found that a bearing difference of 180 180 0 occurred between 180 on the relative bearing where the marginal distance is the minimum value in the ship domain and 0 on the relative bearing where the risk ratio is minimum in the risk perception domain the results indicated that there is a roughly opposite space between the ship and risk perception domains 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of results risk perception of the situation proposed is the basis of situational awareness as shown in the foregoing results the proposed multiple regression linear models have a reasonable predictive power leading to a risk ratio suitable for describing the perception of the risk situation and to an easy understanding of the risk perception three interesting findings were derived from these results firstly the intensity of risk for the relative bearing of 135 was the largest for all of the relative bearings secondly at 0 miles the intensity of the risk for the relative bearing of 45 was the second largest after the relative bearing of 135 third comparing the marginal distances for the relative bearings of 45 and 135 the ship domain has the longest marginal distance at 45 while the risk perception domain has the highest risk intensity at 135 according to colregs when two vessels are meeting on collision courses each vessel is to pass on the port side of the other to avoid collision hence when a collision course of a 135 relative bearing occurs the oow is to take a collision avoidance action through various ship maneuverings such as turning away from the back of the target ship or turning to the left of the ownship in this situation the oow must make optimal decisions considering various situations and hence he feels the burden of ship control with the burden gradually increasing as a result of the decrease in the separation distance inoue 2000 also reported that handling the ship in a collision situation at 135 relative bearing is the most difficult as discussed above the marginal distance of the ship domain is wide in the area close to the heading of the ownship however the intensity of the perceived risk is stronger in the area close to the stern bearing of the ownship based on the discussion we found that the ship domain needs to be considered to enhance the perception of the situation proposed by endsley 1995 one way to apply the results of this study to enhance the perception of the situation is discussed in section 4 2 below 4 2 discussion concerning the application of the results based on the discussion of the results described above it is thought that there is a certain relationship between the three factors colregs ship domain and risk perception domain however unfortunately coregs does not use the term domain area and gives no indication at all of the shape or dimension of the ship domain nor does it provide any quantification for safe distances hilgert and baldauf 1997 in this respect various research results related to colregs ship domain and collision alerts have been reported as follows goerlandt et al 2015 proposed a framework for a risk informed maritime cas collision alert system that is useful for developing cas applications for different navigational environments and in specific operations such as convoy navigation in ice szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 offered a systematic and critical review of the newer ship domain models and discussed several differences in their approaches to ship domain concepts baldauf et al 2017 introduced a method for triggering collision warnings by focusing specifically on the critical last phase of an encounter and introduced the imo approach of defining alerts as a term including cautions warnings and alarms szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 focused on a radar based collision threat parameters area display designed to support the selection of safe maneuvers and presented a heuristic approach for maneuver selections when using this display baldauf et al 2011 conducted a comparative study of a traffic alert and collision avoidance system used by air traffic which identified potential synergies to improve maritime operational risk management he et al 2017 presented a novel quantitative analysis system for colregs and seamanship as a result of these literature reviews it was found that a technical elaboration is needed to apply the risk perception domain as proposed in this study to enhance the perception of the situation level 1 in the situation awareness proposed by endsley 1995 applying our research results to raise awareness of the situation is the subject of our ongoing work 5 conclusions a multiple linear regression model was derived for statistical modeling of perceived collision risk in a vessel encounter situation at sea to illustrate the method perceived risks were obtained from an experiment involving a risk perception survey of kcg officers onboard a patrol ship and we used to calibrate the models for different vessel encounter situations the estimation results of the models show that all of the calibrated modules have reasonable goodness of fit and predictive power and that the perceived risks are reasonably reflective of the ship collision situations several interesting findings were derived from the analyses first participants perceived the highest risk at the relative bearing at 135 and the lowest risk at the relative bearing at 0 second for relative bearings between 180 90 and 45 the intensity of risk perception varies by separation distance but for the relative bearing of 45 at a distance of 0 nm there was the second highest perceived intensity of risk third the difference between the relative bearing at which the longest marginal distance appears in the ship domain and the relative bearing at which the highest intensity risk appears in the risk perception domain is 127 finally it was found that a technical elaboration was needed to apply the risk perception domain proposed in this study to enhance the perception of the situation this research provides valuable insights into the modeling of the perception of collision risk by an oow in encountering situations and the result model is expected to be applied to the development of a new system capable of enhancing the perception of the situation acknowledgment this work is supported by the ministry of oceans and fisheries korea and

23112,the frequent occurrence of seismic events results in the damage to the structures structural control is one of the popular methods to prevent these damages in structural control the main objective is to impart an adequate counterforce this required counter force is determined by a suitable control algorithm in this work an optimized and adaptive control algorithm is proposed based on modified quasi bang bang control algorithm to generate the adequate counterforce the constant output weights used in the modified quasi bang bang controller are optimized for best performance in dynamic loading such as earthquake using the particle swarm optimization pso the proposed optimized controller is then applied to a three storey prototype structure fixed with an mr damper this structure has been subjected to various seismic events for performance evaluation the results thus obtained are compared with best performing clipped optimal linear quadratic gaussian lqg controller quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controller the results establish that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller is superior to the other controller in reducing the structural responses i e relative displacement interstorey drift and the absolute accelerations further the voltage comparison shows that the power consumption is less for the proposed controller in attaining better performance keywords pso lqg bang bang controller mr damper 1 introduction the seismic vibrations put additional stress on the structure and the vibrations caused are not considered good for its health therefore the need for the technical methods for mitigation of the vibrations arises one of the popular adopted methods is the structural control in structural control the seismic vibrations are reduced by imparting adequate counter force determined by a control law using external actuating devices such as passive active hybrid or semi active yu and thenozhi 2016 in literature the structure vibration control can be achieved mainly by three simple methods i e passive active and semi active control having their merits and demerits choi et al 2016 saaed et al 2015 soong and spencer 2000 spencer and nagarajaiah 2003 the passive control is the simplest method of structural control and used to be very popular among the scientific community due to its many useful features such as it does not require any external power to operate easy to implement it also does not alter the stability of the structure but its inability to adapt to the changes in the external excitation and poor performance at low frequencies makes this control scheme less attractive to improve upon these disadvantages the active control scheme came into the existence the active control scheme was adaptive to the external changes and delivered excellent performance for a range of vibration frequencies but it relies on the large power source to operate which is very difficult to ensure during the incidence of the earthquake datta 2003 soong et al 1991 yu and thenozhi 2016 additionally the active control scheme may destabilize structure dyke et al 1996 ramesh kumar and narayanan 2008 to overcome these drawbacks a method known as semi active control scheme came into existence and largely investigated huang et al 2015a zapateiro et al 2012 it requires very less power to operate a few watts and shows performance at par with the active control strategy dyke et al 1999 jansen and dyke 2000 it also does not subvert the stability of the structure because the energy of the vibration will only be engrossed without imparting any additional energy to the structure thus the semi active control methodologies have been the well thought out choice for structural control the semi active control strategy generally uses the magneto rheological mr dampers mr dampers vary their physical form proactively with a change in the magnetic field zhu et al 2012 due to their physical properties like easy to manufacture insensitive to temperature high dynamic range and mechanical simplicity mr dampers are increasingly considered for application in vibration control medical and automobile sector to name a few ahamed et al 2018 here one thing is notable that the control force required to mitigate the vibration is largely dependent on the choice of the control algorithm for the semi active scheme kumar and kumar 2017 zapateiro et al 2012 therefore a range of the control algorithms varying from model dependent optimal controllers like lqr lqg controllers to model free advanced neural network controllers or fuzzy controllers is reported in the literature casciati et al 2012 choi et al 2004 das et al 2013 dong et al 2010 yang et al 2006 ying et al 2005 all control algorithms calculate the adequate amount of control force to be imparted to the structure keeping the stability of the structure intact the complexity of the implementation of these controllers varies from controller to controller here the quasi bang bang controller is simple effective and easy to implement a controller for the semi active control scheme it assumes that the structure is at equilibrium at the reference position i e centre position it applies the full voltage 2 25 v if the structure is moving away from the reference position and a flat 0 v if the structure reaches to the centre the major disadvantage of this controller is the undesirable control chattering near the origin of state space due to high frequency switching of control force often occurs and great care must be taken against spillover instability at higher modes lim et al 2003 a modified approach to the quasi bang bang controller was proposed by a m aly 2013 which considers the remaining positions between the reference and the maximum displacements this is accomplished by assigning constant weights to the output similar to the fuzzy logic controller flc but these weights had been chosen randomly in the range of 0 1 this random selection does not determine the optimized value of the command signal to the mr damper it leads to the inferior performance of the controller and semi active control scheme further quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controller use the maximum available power which needs to be cut down using lesser electrical power is one of the main features of the semi active control method to find a solution to these prominent problems the authors propose a pso modified quasi bang bang controller based on modified quasi bang bang control algorithm in which the random weights have been optimized in real time using particle swarm optimization technique to achieve better performance using less power further this controller is easy to implement and designed for real time application in structural control in the development of the controller it is assumed that there is no sensor fault during the earthquake and all states are available a fault tolerant observer may be designed in case of sensor fault during the earthquake kommuri et al 2016 the suggested approach has been validated on a prototype three story structure coupled with a single mr damper at the ground floor the outcomes are compared with the modified quasi bang bang controller quasi bang bang controller and clipped optimal lqg controller dyke et al 1999 and it is demonstrated through the numerical solutions that the proposed pso modified quasi bang bang controller is more effective in reducing the structural responses i e relative displacement inter story drift and absolute acceleration 2 magnetorheological mr damper modelling many semi active devices like variable stiffness dampers variable orifice dampers and variable friction devices are used in seismic structural control but none of them has shown performance as good as mr damper mr dampers possess many qualities which make this device very attractive for seismic applications these dampers require very minimal power to operate and are very quick to changes in control input to perceive nonlinearities in the mr damper the modified bouc wen phenomenon model shown in fig 1 is considered here for study spencer et al 1997 spencer et al 1997a the equations used to simulate this phenological model are given from eq 1 7 this damper generates a force f as in eq 1 which is subject to the voltage applied to the damper as can be seen from eqs 4 6 the variables α c0 and c1 are linearly corresponding to the effective voltage u these variables connect the mechanical properties of the mr damper to the command voltage and ensure that the model is working efficiently in altering magnetic fields the stiffness of the accumulator is shown by the variable k 1 and the damping observed at large and low velocities are shown here by two dashpots c 0 and c 1 respectively the stiffness at large velocities is depicted by variable k 0 and the displacement x 0 of spring k 1 demonstrates a small force of the accumulator the adjustable parameters β γ η and a control the hysteresis curve for mr liquid 1 f c 1 y k 1 x x 0 2 y 1 c 0 c 1 α z c 0 x k 0 x y 3 z γ x y z z n 1 β x y z n a x y 4 α α a α b u 5 c 0 c

and it expresses the mechanism of the dependence of the response on history kumar and kumar 2017 spencer et al 1996 the output of the first order filter given in eq 7 is used to drive the electromagnet in the mr damper this relation helps to understand that how the mr damper attains the rheological equilibrium dyke et al 1998 the parameters used in the present work are specified in table 1 the mr damper with the parameter given in table 1 is tested using a sinewave of 2 5 hz having an amplitude of 1 5 cm through simulation and the results are shown in fig 2 a c these results are very similar to those obtained by laboratory testing of the mr damper and presented in dyke et al 1999 3 control algorithms 3 1 clipped optimal lqg controller this controller is very effective and used with mr damper for semi active control strategy the lqg controller can be developed using lqr linear quadratic regulator controller in conjunction with linear quadratic estimator kalman filter a controller kc which is linear and optimal is designed to estimate a desired control force fc based on measurement of structural responses y and measured force f applied to the structure as given in eq 9 9 f c l 1 k c s l y f here l is the laplace transform to determine the desired control force f from the mr damper the concept of clipped optimal control was proposed dyke et al 1999 the command voltage v is selected as in eq 10 10 v v m a x h f c f f where vmax is the maximum voltage can be given to the mr damper within its saturation limits and h is the heaviside step function this rule is graphically represented in fig 3 dyke et al 1999 the idea behind this controller was that the desired force cannot be always generated because the force generated in the mr damper is dependent upon the structural measurements but the input voltage can be altered according to the need of the system the clipped optimal lqg controller is popular among the many control algorithms for semi active control strategies this linear quadratic gaussian controller employs a kalman estimator which estimates the unknown states of the system 3 2 quasi bang bang controller in this algorithm the voltage to the mr damper is decided according to the two different rules these rules depend on the reference position of the structure the structure is assumed to be at rest position static equilibrium when there is no external loading i e its centre position there may be only two possibilities based on the reference position i if the structure is moving away from the centre i e reference position ii if the structure is moving towards the centre the command voltage is selected as per control law in eq 11 11 v i v m a x i f m o v i n g a w a y f r o m t h e c e n t r e 0 i f m o v i n g t o w a r d s t h e c e n t r e 3 3 modified quasi bang bang controller this is the control approach proposed by am aly 2013 in this approach the author made use of the intermediate stages of the two extremes i e 0 vmax of the command voltages to the mr damper the weights selected in this control law are similar to the fuzzy logic controller these weights are constant and chosen by trial and error method the control law is given as in eq 12 12 v i α 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 β 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 γ 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 v m a x o t h e r w i s e it is difficult to find the optimized weights using trial and error method therefore the authors presented a modified controller using particle swarm optimization approach to find the optimized weights for the modified quasi bang bang controller 3 4 formulation of pso modified quasi bang bang controller particle swarm optimization pso is a heuristic calculation system developed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 huang et al 2015b the essential of pso algorithm relies on social conduct illustration as it was intended to reinvent the social demeanour as in a path of flying creatures pso introduces a populace of indiscriminately picked up and coming solutions each emerging solution for the issue is assumed as an individual called a particle every particle is considered similar to a winged creature in the path that modifies its flying way as indicated by its own and its associates vision of the best area as in the pursuit of sustenance subsequently this algorithm advances particles by collaboration and rivalry among themselves as opposed to the genetic algorithm for the optimization of any given problem there is an objective function or cost function based on which every particle in the pso algorithm has a fitness value or cost it additionally has a velocity which coordinates the development of the particle with the goal that it can search the pursuit of space these velocities will be balanced dynamically all together to manage the particles closer and nearer to the solution the position and the velocity of the k t h the particle may be represented as in eqs 13 and 14 respectively in the d dimensional pursuit space amini et al 2013 hassan et al 2005 13 q k q k 1 q k 2 q k 3 q k 4 q k d 14 q k q k 1 q k 2 q k 3 q k 4 q k d here particle s velocity and position are

transformer lvdt is normally used to measure the displacement and the high accuracy accelerometers are used to obtain the acceleration 5 result analysis and discussion the simulation results obtained

are shown in table 4 the parameters xn cm idn cm an cm sec2 and f n represent the peak values of displacement inter story drift and absolute acceleration of the nth floor respectively for visual analysis the comparison of third floor displacement and force time histories using different controllers are shown in fig 6 for el centro valley earthquake and in fig 7 for the structure subjected to hachinohe earthquake fig 6 a and c show the comparison of the time histories of the third floor displacement and force respectively for first 5 s and whereas fig 6 b and d show the enlarged view of same time histories shown in figures a and c respectively for first 2 s for better visualization of the results similarly for hachinohe earthquake fig 6 e and g present the third floor s relative displacement and the force time history for first 5 s whereas the figures f and h demonstrate the similar time histories for first 2 s respectively a careful observation of these figures a h leads to the conclusion that the suggested pso modified quasi bang bang controller reduces the displacement effectively during the whole time period using optimized force the quantitative analysis of the results due to el centro earthquake is carried out by the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 observing table 4 it is seen that the third floor s relative displacement is reduced by 27 and 26 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all the three floors is substantially lesser about 10 15 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller nearly matches the relative displacements of all floors obtained by the best clipped optimal lqg controller moreover the superior results over the co lqg controller for the first and second floor also been achieved by using the suggested control algorithm as shown in table 4 the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 55 and 60 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively similarly the accelerations of the first second and third floor are reduced by 46 47 and 30 over the clipped optimal lqg controller the proposed controller achieves a better reduction in peak absolute acceleration over all other controllers considered for comparison further the analysis is done for hachinohe earthquake referring to fig 6 it can be concluded that the pso modified controller gives superior results throughout the earthquake time history the peak values of the responses given in table 4 justify the conclusions just made for el centro earthquake for hachinohe earthquake observing the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 the third floor displacement is reduced by 16 and 26 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all floors is substantially lesser about 10 20 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller gives superior results for the first second and third floor by 47 36 and 37 as compared to clipped optimal lqg controller the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 27 37 and 42 over the quasi bang bang modified quasi bang bang and clipped optimal lqg controller respectively similarly the accelerations of the first second and third floor are reduced by 25 4 and 17 over the clipped optimal lqg controller 36 3 and 12 over the quasi bang bang controller and 40 7 and 10 over the modified quasi bang bang controller fig 7 a b show the third floor displacement and force time histories respectively for hard soil fig 7 c d and fig 7 e f show the time histories medium soil and soft soil respectively a visual inspection of these figures suggests that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller gives excellent performance over other controllers in each soil type for the earthquake recorded in hard soil observing the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 the third floor displacement is reduced by 15 and 17 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all floors is lesser about 15 25 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller reduces the relative displacements for the first second and third floor by 46 31 and 17 as compared to clipped optimal lqg controller the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 27 37 and 42 over the quasi bang bang modified quasi bang bang and clipped optimal lqg controller respectively similarly the accelerations of the second and third floor are reduced by 25 and 36 over the clipped optimal lqg controller 16 and 30 over the quasi bang bang controller and 12 and 18 over the modified quasi bang bang controller the acceleration of the first floor also reduced sufficiently for earthquake recorded in medium soil and soft soil a careful observation the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration in table 4 advocates superior performance of the suggested control algorithm over all other controllers fig 8 i iii show the force displacement curve a lqg controller b quasi bang bang c modified quasi bang bang d pso modified quasi bang bang controller for hard medium and soft soil respectively the force displacement curve elucidates the hysteric nature of the controllers this figure clearly shows that the capability of pso modified bang bang controller of reducing the vibrations using lesser force is better among all other controllers for all earthquake time histories considered in this work it is evident that the power required for the operation of the semi active system is a very critical issue because it is very difficult to ensure a continues power supply to the system during a seismic event the minimum possible power consumption for the operation of the whole system must be ensured the input voltage to the mr damper for every controller and for every earthquake considered in the present study is shown in fig 9 i v the visual inspection of fig 9 i for el centro earthquake suggests that the pso modified bang bang controller requires lesser voltage to operate this trend can be observed for every other earthquake considered for simulation in the present study this is a crucial advantage of the proposed controller fig 10 shows the power contained in the displacement signal of the third floor as msa and rms displacement amplitude for all controllers for el centro earthquake this power spectrum clearly shows that pso modified controller is the best of all the rms value of the displacement is the least for the pso modified earthquake similar comments about the power spectrum and displacement rms values can be made for other earthquake time histories considered in this work 6 conclusion a pso modified quasi bang bang controller is presented and evaluated in this work this controller has evolved from the optimization of the ordinary modified quasi bang bang controller by altering the weights using pso algorithm it can generate the optimum control force to diminish structural responses using lesser force utilizing the optimized values of the weights amid the seismic tremor in this manner the benefit of the exhorted technique is that the constant weights are found adaptively by the pso algorithm unlike modified quasi bang bang controller it utilizes the power intelligently which is a critical factor in seismic vibration control the results of the three dof test structure due to two near fault earthquake excitation exhibits that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller performs superior to other controllers examined in the present work overall its simple implementation quality makes this controller an attractive option to control the vibrations though the proposed controller shows commendable performance in various conditions in simulations it s laboratory testing is highly recommended further the continuous application of high voltage would lead to floor lock up condition and it could be the possible field of the research the study on the issues like non availability of all states and measurements due to sensor fault during the earthquake may also be interesting problems for further research acknowledgements this

23112,the frequent occurrence of seismic events results in the damage to the structures structural control is one of the popular methods to prevent these damages in structural control the main objective is to impart an adequate counterforce this required counter force is determined by a suitable control algorithm in this work an optimized and adaptive control algorithm is proposed based on modified quasi bang bang control algorithm to generate the adequate counterforce the constant output weights used in the modified quasi bang bang controller are optimized for best performance in dynamic loading such as earthquake using the particle swarm optimization pso the proposed optimized controller is then applied to a three storey prototype structure fixed with an mr damper this structure has been subjected to various seismic events for performance evaluation the results thus obtained are compared with best performing clipped optimal linear quadratic gaussian lqg controller quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controller the results establish that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller is superior to the other controller in reducing the structural responses i e relative displacement interstorey drift and the absolute accelerations further the voltage comparison shows that the power consumption is less for the proposed controller in attaining better performance keywords pso lqg bang bang controller mr damper 1 introduction the seismic vibrations put additional stress on the structure and the vibrations caused are not considered good for its health therefore the need for the technical methods for mitigation of the vibrations arises one of the popular adopted methods is the structural control in structural control the seismic vibrations are reduced by imparting adequate counter force determined by a control law using external actuating devices such as passive active hybrid or semi active yu and thenozhi 2016 in literature the structure vibration control can be achieved mainly by three simple methods i e passive active and semi active control having their merits and demerits choi et al 2016 saaed et al 2015 soong and spencer 2000 spencer and nagarajaiah 2003 the passive control is the simplest method of structural control and used to be very popular among the scientific community due to its many useful features such as it does not require any external power to operate easy to implement it also does not alter the stability of the structure but its inability to adapt to the changes in the external excitation and poor performance at low frequencies makes this control scheme less attractive to improve upon these disadvantages the active control scheme came into the existence the active control scheme was adaptive to the external changes and delivered excellent performance for a range of vibration frequencies but it relies on the large power source to operate which is very difficult to ensure during the incidence of the earthquake datta 2003 soong et al 1991 yu and thenozhi 2016 additionally the active control scheme may destabilize structure dyke et al 1996 ramesh kumar and narayanan 2008 to overcome these drawbacks a method known as semi active control scheme came into existence and largely investigated huang et al 2015a zapateiro et al 2012 it requires very less power to operate a few watts and shows performance at par with the active control strategy dyke et al 1999 jansen and dyke 2000 it also does not subvert the stability of the structure because the energy of the vibration will only be engrossed without imparting any additional energy to the structure thus the semi active control methodologies have been the well thought out choice for structural control the semi active control strategy generally uses the magneto rheological mr dampers mr dampers vary their physical form proactively with a change in the magnetic field zhu et al 2012 due to their physical properties like easy to manufacture insensitive to temperature high dynamic range and mechanical simplicity mr dampers are increasingly considered for application in vibration control medical and automobile sector to name a few ahamed et al 2018 here one thing is notable that the control force required to mitigate the vibration is largely dependent on the choice of the control algorithm for the semi active scheme kumar and kumar 2017 zapateiro et al 2012 therefore a range of the control algorithms varying from model dependent optimal controllers like lqr lqg controllers to model free advanced neural network controllers or fuzzy controllers is reported in the literature casciati et al 2012 choi et al 2004 das et al 2013 dong et al 2010 yang et al 2006 ying et al 2005 all control algorithms calculate the adequate amount of control force to be imparted to the structure keeping the stability of the structure intact the complexity of the implementation of these controllers varies from controller to controller here the quasi bang bang controller is simple effective and easy to implement a controller for the semi active control scheme it assumes that the structure is at equilibrium at the reference position i e centre position it applies the full voltage 2 25 v if the structure is moving away from the reference position and a flat 0 v if the structure reaches to the centre the major disadvantage of this controller is the undesirable control chattering near the origin of state space due to high frequency switching of control force often occurs and great care must be taken against spillover instability at higher modes lim et al 2003 a modified approach to the quasi bang bang controller was proposed by a m aly 2013 which considers the remaining positions between the reference and the maximum displacements this is accomplished by assigning constant weights to the output similar to the fuzzy logic controller flc but these weights had been chosen randomly in the range of 0 1 this random selection does not determine the optimized value of the command signal to the mr damper it leads to the inferior performance of the controller and semi active control scheme further quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controller use the maximum available power which needs to be cut down using lesser electrical power is one of the main features of the semi active control method to find a solution to these prominent problems the authors propose a pso modified quasi bang bang controller based on modified quasi bang bang control algorithm in which the random weights have been optimized in real time using particle swarm optimization technique to achieve better performance using less power further this controller is easy to implement and designed for real time application in structural control in the development of the controller it is assumed that there is no sensor fault during the earthquake and all states are available a fault tolerant observer may be designed in case of sensor fault during the earthquake kommuri et al 2016 the suggested approach has been validated on a prototype three story structure coupled with a single mr damper at the ground floor the outcomes are compared with the modified quasi bang bang controller quasi bang bang controller and clipped optimal lqg controller dyke et al 1999 and it is demonstrated through the numerical solutions that the proposed pso modified quasi bang bang controller is more effective in reducing the structural responses i e relative displacement inter story drift and absolute acceleration 2 magnetorheological mr damper modelling many semi active devices like variable stiffness dampers variable orifice dampers and variable friction devices are used in seismic structural control but none of them has shown performance as good as mr damper mr dampers possess many qualities which make this device very attractive for seismic applications these dampers require very minimal power to operate and are very quick to changes in control input to perceive nonlinearities in the mr damper the modified bouc wen phenomenon model shown in fig 1 is considered here for study spencer et al 1997 spencer et al 1997a the equations used to simulate this phenological model are given from eq 1 7 this damper generates a force f as in eq 1 which is subject to the voltage applied to the damper as can be seen from eqs 4 6 the variables α c0 and c1 are linearly corresponding to the effective voltage u these variables connect the mechanical properties of the mr damper to the command voltage and ensure that the model is working efficiently in altering magnetic fields the stiffness of the accumulator is shown by the variable k 1 and the damping observed at large and low velocities are shown here by two dashpots c 0 and c 1 respectively the stiffness at large velocities is depicted by variable k 0 and the displacement x 0 of spring k 1 demonstrates a small force of the accumulator the adjustable parameters β γ η and a control the hysteresis curve for mr liquid 1 f c 1 y k 1 x x 0 2 y 1 c 0 c 1 α z c 0 x k 0 x y 3 z γ x y z z n 1 β x y z n a x y 4 α α a α b u 5 c 0 c

and it expresses the mechanism of the dependence of the response on history kumar and kumar 2017 spencer et al 1996 the output of the first order filter given in eq 7 is used to drive the electromagnet in the mr damper this relation helps to understand that how the mr damper attains the rheological equilibrium dyke et al 1998 the parameters used in the present work are specified in table 1 the mr damper with the parameter given in table 1 is tested using a sinewave of 2 5 hz having an amplitude of 1 5 cm through simulation and the results are shown in fig 2 a c these results are very similar to those obtained by laboratory testing of the mr damper and presented in dyke et al 1999 3 control algorithms 3 1 clipped optimal lqg controller this controller is very effective and used with mr damper for semi active control strategy the lqg controller can be developed using lqr linear quadratic regulator controller in conjunction with linear quadratic estimator kalman filter a controller kc which is linear and optimal is designed to estimate a desired control force fc based on measurement of structural responses y and measured force f applied to the structure as given in eq 9 9 f c l 1 k c s l y f here l is the laplace transform to determine the desired control force f from the mr damper the concept of clipped optimal control was proposed dyke et al 1999 the command voltage v is selected as in eq 10 10 v v m a x h f c f f where vmax is the maximum voltage can be given to the mr damper within its saturation limits and h is the heaviside step function this rule is graphically represented in fig 3 dyke et al 1999 the idea behind this controller was that the desired force cannot be always generated because the force generated in the mr damper is dependent upon the structural measurements but the input voltage can be altered according to the need of the system the clipped optimal lqg controller is popular among the many control algorithms for semi active control strategies this linear quadratic gaussian controller employs a kalman estimator which estimates the unknown states of the system 3 2 quasi bang bang controller in this algorithm the voltage to the mr damper is decided according to the two different rules these rules depend on the reference position of the structure the structure is assumed to be at rest position static equilibrium when there is no external loading i e its centre position there may be only two possibilities based on the reference position i if the structure is moving away from the centre i e reference position ii if the structure is moving towards the centre the command voltage is selected as per control law in eq 11 11 v i v m a x i f m o v i n g a w a y f r o m t h e c e n t r e 0 i f m o v i n g t o w a r d s

vmax of the command voltages to the mr damper the weights selected in this control law are similar to the fuzzy logic controller these weights are constant and chosen by trial and error method the control law is given as in eq 12 12 v i α 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 β 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 γ 1 v m a x i f s i g n x 1 s i g n x 1 v m a x o t h e r w i s e it is difficult to find the optimized weights using trial and error method therefore the authors presented a modified controller using particle swarm optimization approach to find the optimized weights for the modified quasi bang bang controller 3 4 formulation of pso modified quasi bang bang controller particle swarm optimization pso is a heuristic calculation system developed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 huang et al 2015b the essential of pso algorithm relies on social conduct illustration as it was intended to reinvent the social demeanour as in a path of flying creatures pso introduces a populace of indiscriminately picked up and coming solutions each emerging solution for the issue is assumed as an individual called a particle every particle is considered similar to a winged creature in the path that modifies its flying way as indicated by its own and its associates vision of the best area as in the pursuit of sustenance subsequently this algorithm advances particles by collaboration and rivalry among themselves as opposed to the genetic algorithm for the optimization of any given problem there is an objective function or cost function based on which every particle in the pso algorithm has a fitness value or cost it additionally has a velocity which coordinates the development of the particle with the goal that it can search the pursuit of space these velocities will be balanced dynamically all together to manage the particles closer and nearer to the solution the position and the velocity of the k t h the particle may be represented as in eqs 13 and 14

the most suitable optimal values of the constants α 1 β 1 and γ 1 for the modified quasi bang bang controller so that the semi active control method could deliver optimum structural response with smaller and optimum control force the cost function or the objective function considered here is a function of the relative displacement of the structure this may be characterized as a function of the relative displacement x i t of the ith floor as given in eq 18 18 j p s o 0 t i x i 1 t x i t 2 d t this optimization of weighting constants initiates the lessening of responses using a smaller

those offered by am aly aly 2013 in which these constants are decided by trial and error the pso algorithm parameters used in this work are given in table 2 this controller is applicable for real time application the structure under the seismic loading changes its response constantly and based on the measurement of the sensors the controller determines the appropriate actuating signal voltage for the mr damper to produce the control force further the developed controller assumes that all the states are available all the time whereas in a noisy environment the states may not be available all the time similarly the developed controller is dependent on the system parameters any alteration in the system parameters affects the performance of the controller the pso algorithm s flowchart is represented in fig 4 which depicts a well ordered working of the algorithm refereeing to fig 4 a solution can be considered as an optimized solution if a user defined ending criterion is matched otherwise the simulation may end after maximum iterations defined by the user now there might be two situations first if the maximum iterations do not finish the pso algorithm will look at the fitness

population size and maximum iterations etc in the quest of the most suitable optimal solution kumar and kumar 2017 this pso algorithm is used here to find the optimum values of the parameters α 1 β 1 and γ 1 as given in 12 to obtain the reduced structural response using the optimized force the power utilization management of the proposed algorithm is very efficient the utilization of power is a very critical issue in the field of seismic vibration control 4 a numerical example the proposed method has been tested on a three story structure integrated with a single mr damper using the two

analysis the comparison of third floor displacement and force time histories using different controllers are shown in fig 6 for el centro valley earthquake and in fig 7 for the structure subjected to hachinohe earthquake fig 6 a and c show the comparison of the time histories of the third floor displacement and force respectively for first 5 s and whereas fig 6 b and d show the enlarged view of same time histories shown in figures a and c respectively for first 2 s for better visualization of the results similarly for hachinohe earthquake fig 6 e and g present the third floor s relative displacement and the force time history for first 5 s whereas the figures f and h demonstrate the similar time histories for first 2 s respectively a careful observation of these figures a h leads to the conclusion that the suggested pso modified quasi bang bang controller reduces the displacement effectively during the whole time period using optimized force the quantitative analysis of the results due to el centro earthquake is carried out by the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 observing table 4 it is seen that the third floor s relative displacement is reduced by 27 and 26 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all the three floors is substantially lesser about 10 15 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller nearly matches the relative displacements of all floors obtained by the best clipped optimal lqg controller moreover the superior results over the co lqg controller for the first and second floor also been achieved by using the suggested control algorithm as shown in table 4 the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 55 and 60 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively similarly the accelerations of the first second and third floor are reduced by 46 47 and 30 over the clipped optimal lqg controller the proposed controller achieves a better reduction in peak absolute acceleration over all other controllers considered for comparison further the analysis is done for hachinohe earthquake referring to fig 6 it can be concluded that the pso modified controller gives superior results throughout the earthquake time history the peak values of the responses given in table 4 justify the conclusions just made for el centro earthquake for hachinohe earthquake observing the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 the third floor displacement is reduced by 16 and 26 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all floors is substantially lesser about 10 20 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller gives superior results for the first second and third floor by 47 36 and 37 as compared to clipped optimal lqg controller the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 27 37 and 42 over the quasi bang bang modified quasi bang bang and clipped optimal lqg controller respectively similarly the accelerations of the first second and third floor are reduced by 25 4 and 17 over the clipped optimal lqg controller 36 3 and 12 over the quasi bang bang controller and 40 7 and 10 over the modified quasi bang bang controller fig 7 a b show the third floor displacement and force time histories respectively for hard soil fig 7 c d and fig 7 e f show the time histories medium soil and soft soil respectively a visual inspection of these figures suggests that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller gives excellent performance over other controllers in each soil type for the earthquake recorded in hard soil observing the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration from table 4 the third floor displacement is reduced by 15 and 17 over the quasi bang bang and modified quasi bang bang controllers respectively and the displacement of all floors is lesser about 15 25 using the proposed approach the pso modified controller reduces the relative displacements for the first second and third floor by 46 31 and 17 as compared to clipped optimal lqg controller the inter story drift between second third floor is reduced by 27 37 and 42 over the quasi bang bang modified quasi bang bang and clipped optimal lqg controller respectively similarly the accelerations of the second and third floor are reduced by 25 and 36 over the clipped optimal lqg controller 16 and 30 over the quasi bang bang controller and 12 and 18 over the modified quasi bang bang controller the acceleration of the first floor also reduced sufficiently for earthquake recorded in medium soil and soft soil a careful observation the peak values of the displacement interstorey drift and acceleration in table 4 advocates superior performance of the suggested control algorithm over all other controllers fig 8 i iii show the force displacement curve a lqg controller b quasi bang bang c modified quasi bang bang d pso modified quasi bang bang controller for hard medium and soft soil respectively the force displacement curve elucidates the hysteric nature of the controllers this figure clearly shows that the capability of pso modified bang bang controller of reducing the vibrations using lesser force is better among all other controllers for all earthquake time histories considered in this work it is evident that the power required for the operation of the semi active system is a very critical issue because it is very difficult to ensure a continues power supply to the system during a seismic event the minimum possible power consumption for the operation of the whole system must be ensured the input voltage to the mr damper for every controller and for every earthquake considered in the present study is shown in fig 9 i v the visual inspection of fig 9 i for el centro earthquake suggests that the pso modified bang bang controller requires lesser voltage to operate this trend can be observed for every other earthquake considered for simulation in the present study this is a crucial advantage of the proposed controller fig 10 shows the power contained in the displacement signal of the third floor as msa and rms displacement amplitude for all controllers for el centro earthquake this power spectrum clearly shows that pso modified controller is the best of all the rms value of the displacement is the least for the pso modified earthquake similar comments about the power spectrum and displacement rms values can be made for other earthquake time histories considered in this work 6 conclusion a pso modified quasi bang bang controller is presented and evaluated in this work this controller has evolved from the optimization of the ordinary modified quasi bang bang controller by altering the weights using pso algorithm it can generate the optimum control force to diminish structural responses using lesser force utilizing the optimized values of the weights amid the seismic tremor in this manner the benefit of the exhorted technique is that the constant weights are found adaptively by the pso algorithm unlike modified quasi bang bang controller it utilizes the power intelligently which is a critical factor in seismic vibration control the results of the three dof test structure due to two near fault earthquake excitation exhibits that the pso modified quasi bang bang controller performs superior to other controllers examined in the present work overall its simple implementation quality makes this controller an attractive option to control the vibrations though the proposed controller shows commendable performance in various conditions in simulations it s laboratory testing is highly recommended further the continuous application of high voltage would lead to floor lock up condition and it could be the possible field of the research the study on the issues like non availability of all states and measurements due to sensor fault during the earthquake may also be interesting problems for further research acknowledgements this

23113,third party threats from accidentally dropped objects could cause external impact loading that may potentially affect the integrity and safety of a subsea pipeline system these incidents may occur during installation construction and operation phases of the project to evaluate the structural integrity of carbon steel cs subsea pipelines due to dropped objects events risk assessment is conducted following the procedure detailed in dnv rp f107 which gives a closed form formula for predicting the impact energy capacity of the cs pipeline and assumes an acceptance criterion of limiting the dent depth ratio to 5 of pipe diameter for a no leakage condition in the case of cs pipelines mechanically lined with corrosion resistant alloy cra the applicability of the impact energy formula and the acceptance criterion is however largely unknown considering that cra lined pipes involve additional modes of failure in the form of liner separation and its potential for subsequent fatigue failure during operation this paper discusses finite element modelling undertaken to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline subjected to external impact loads results confirm that liner separation is of minor importance and the use of the established acceptance criterion derived for plain carbon steel pipes can be justified to apply to cra lined pipelines keywords corrosion resistant alloy cra cra lined fea impact loads damage assessment notations 3 d three dimension cra corrosion resistant alloy cs carbon steel fe fea finite element finite element analysis eprg european pipeline research group od outside diameter simops simultaneous operations 1 introduction as the global energy demand grows with time the increased exploitation and recovery of offshore natural resources has invariably led to numerous fields where the produced raw gas contains significant levels of compounds carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide that may make the anticipated flow stream highly corrosive for carbon steel flowlines pipelines and will require a corrosion mitigation method as an alternative to chemical corrosion inhibition the pipeline can be protected by materials that are inherently corrosion resistant to the produced fluids i e corrosion resistant alloy cra line pipes constructed from cra entirely are expensive and hence carbon steel pipes internally clad or lined with a cra are typically used in the case of clad pipes the cra material is applied to the inner surface of the carbon steel pipe by means of a metallurgical bond lined pipes on the other hand are produced by hydrostatically or mechanically expanding a cra liner onto the inner surface of the carbon steel pipe the lined pipe joint is supplied with a cra seal weld on each end for site welding purposes although the cra lined pipe provides significant cost savings it poses additional failure modes in comparison to clad or solid cra pipes focke 2007 the primary limit state condition for lined pipe is the onset of local buckling or wrinkling of the liner as shown in fig 1 either due to an impact load or the combination of bending and axial compression load the wrinkled liner may suffer from early fatigue failure due to cycles of stress concentration from pressure and temperature variations during operational shutdowns other potential failure modes include fracture of girth welds however since there is no risk of seal weld separation at this location this is expected to happen only at higher impact loads the present study thus focuses on assessing the cra liner wrinkling due to impact loads and the associated risks 2 dropped object risk assessment the dnv recommended practice for integrity management of submarine pipeline systems dnv rp f116 2009 1 1 dnv rp f116 has been superseded by dnvgl rp f116 notes that the most common pipeline threats may be organised into six threat groups the threats from accidentally dropped objects resulting in impact loads are defined under the third party threats group dropped objects causing damage to subsea pipelines and structures may occur during installation construction and or operation activities simultaneous operations simops of drilling and production undertaken during infill drilling and well intervention campaigns throughout the life of the project are known to pose high likelihood for dropped objects causing damage to the subsea production systems doris 2011 the consequence of this damage to cra lined subsea flowlines is potential for loss of containment i e an environmental risk such a loss can lead to safety risk to the rig personnel due to significant inventories in the subsea flowlines there is also asset risk from the seawater ingress resulting in loss of flowline due to severe corrosion to assess the impact risk on the pipeline probability risk assessments are conducted following the standard methodology described in the recommended practice dnv rp f107 2010 the probability that an impact results in damage is established based on the impact energy estimate and the impact energy capacity for the installed subsea equipment 2 1 impact energy capacities impact damage is based on an energy balance approach where the available kinetic energy from an impacting object is compared to the energy required to produce a dent the dent size expressed as a percentage of the overall pipeline diameter is an indication as to the likelihood of a leak or rupture dnv rp f107 2010 2 2 dnv rp f107 has been superseded by dnvgl rp f107 provides a relation for determining the impact energy required to dent the pipeline due to dropped objects the closed form equation shown below assumes a rigid knife edge impacting perpendicular to the axis of the pipeline 1 e 16 2 π 9 m p d t d δ d 3 2 m p 1 4 σ y t 2 where e is the impact energy δ is the dent depth t is the pipe wall thickness σy is the material yield stress mp is the plastic moment capacity of the pipe wall and d is the pipe outer diameter it is noted the empirical formulations in the recommended practice for impact assessments are based on plain carbon steel which is a significant idealisation for cra lined pipelines an additional risk could result due to local deformations imposed by impact loading in the vicinity of inherent weld defects at girth welds this form of potential failure mode is not considered here 2 2 allowable dent depth section 4 2 in dnv rp f107 2010 describes the damage classifications used to define severity of dent depth the acceptance criterion is based on limiting the damage in the pipe in terms of the ratio of dent depth to pipe diameter to a maximum of 5 for damage category d1 as specified in dnv rp f107 2010 the dent depth in the steel pipe wall of up to 5 of the diameter will not normally have any immediate influence on the operation of the lines including pigging whilst the results from the dropped object risk assessment may show that the risk of a dropped object exceeding the pipeline resistance is low there is still the requirement to justify the use of the following assumptions for cra lined pipeline in terms of impact energy capacity an equivalent plain carbon steel pipe with the total thickness of the backing steel pipe and the cra liner can represent the cra lined pipe and hence equation 1 above for predicting impact energy capacity may be used the 5 od dent depth limit ensures no damage to the cra liner and no leakage in the backing steel pipe including the effects of a gouge the 5 od dent depth limit also ensures that the allowable fatigue damage at the dent location is the same as that for the undented pipe during the design phase of a recently completed subsea project a case study of the impact resistance of cra lined flowline was conducted to justify the above assumptions the flowline was designed in accordance with dnv os f101 2010 3 3 dnv os f101 has been superseded by dnvgl st f101 for its general mechanical requirement and safebuck guideline 2008 for its lateral buckling mitigation the case study utilised 3 d nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis fea to investigate the impact resistance of a 14 inch flowline with the following parameters that resulted from the design seamless pipe with 14 3 mm wall thickness made of dnv grade 450 carbon steel 3 mm thick internal liner made of aisi 316 stainless steel design pressure equal to 73 of steel pipe burst pressure allowable fatigue damage over the design life of 4 which accounts for the design fatigue factor in dnv os f101 2010 proportion of fatigue during installation and operation and a project specified knockdown factor for fatigue in cra lined pipe deepest end of the flowline in 230 m water depth the design of the flowline includes 5lpp insulation coating that was conservatively neglected in the present analysis of the impact energy capacity of the cra lined pipe itself polymer coating absorbs a proportion of the impact energy and dnv rp f107 2010 provides an estimate of the energy absorption capacity of different thicknesses of polymer coating 3 impact loads from dropped objects dropped objects possess a certain energy a portion of which is transferred to the subsea asset upon impact resulting in varying degrees of damage depending on the properties of both object and impacted assets an impact is a highly nonlinear dynamic phenomenon due to the large deformations that take place in a very short duration the nonlinearity in turn leads to different types of pipeline deformation under impact loads empirical models by jones and birch 2010 indicate that the deformation of a pipeline on the seabed is primarily in the form of local denting while a free spanning pipeline will deform globally with minimal denting therefore the primary concern for a pipeline on the seabed is the dent depth gouging or loss of pipe wall material and potential rupture at the dent location the dent depth is defined as the permanent reduction of the pipe nominal diameter at the dent location subsequent to the elastic rebound when the impact load is removed as previously established for cra lined pipelines there is a concern with the potential failure mode arising from liner separation in the area of the dent it is possible that small gaps between the liner and cs pipe inner surface could occur along a pipeline resulting from the method of pipe manufacturing this study assumes that the cra liner is initially in contact with the backing steel pipe and no liner separation or wrinkling takes place during pipelay it is known that internal over pressure has significant effects on local denting of a plain steel pipe and therefore it is of interest to examine whether the presence of internal over pressure could avoid or minimise liner separation in cra lined pipeline another possibility is that the high internal pressure during hydrotest operating condition would re attach the liner that gets separated should an impact occur when the pipeline is de pressurised this is only meaningful as long as fracture does not develop in the liner during impact hence a damage assessment needs to be performed as part of the fea or as a post processor to fea results 4 numerical analysis 4 1 analysis premise for a given impact energy the local denting is affected by many factors such as the angle between the orientation of the pipeline and impacting object net external or internal pressure the presence of insulation and concrete weight coatings strain rate of material hence the present analysis adopts the following assumptions the impacting object or indenter is modelled as a rigid sharp knife edge the knife edge is in a horizontal position when it impacts the pipeline these are the same assumptions on which equation 1 in dnv rp f107 2010 is based the length of the indenter is typically assumed to be perpendicular to the pipeline axis during impact however it has been recognised that an indenter parallel to the pipeline axis may cause worse damage cosham and hopkins 2003 these two orientations are therefore considered in the present investigation effects of insulation and concrete weight coatings are not taken into account in establishing the limiting criterion for dent depth and damage to the steel pipe and cra liner these coatings absorb impact energy which means that higher impact energy would be required to cause the same amount of damage to the pipe similarly the limiting criterion for dent depth and damage assumes that seabed is rigid and supports the pipeline continuously seabed flexibility helps increase the pipe impact capacity for the same dent depth the indenter has reached the terminal velocity at time of impact and hence its acceleration is zero the effects of material strain rate are modelled using the cowper symonds overstress power law in the absence of project specific test data the coefficient and exponent for the carbon steel are set to 40 and 4 5 which are based on hse 2001 a review of hse 2001 indicates that the use of the same coefficient and exponent can be justified for the cra material with lower yield strength used in the project 4 2 damage assessment an impact load can introduce a high level of plastic strain at the dent without fracture as the three dimensional state of stress may inhibit the formation and growth of cracks and due to material defects hence a simple comparison of the strain at a dent to an allowable value from uni axial tension test cannot be used for assessing the level of damage at a dent a material failure criterion is highly dependent on material properties and rate of loading in addition an impact load from a dropped object on a subsea pipeline also typically causes some kind of gouge and may develop into a secondary damage of loss of pipewall material therefore the damage assessment in this paper follows three approaches 1 a mathematical model for material damage initiation and evolution which indicates whether a damage leading to ductile fracture is starting to form in the material is applied to predict damage in the cra liner since no gouges are expected to take place therein this damage model is used directly as part of the fe model 2 empirical formulas from the eprg roovers et al 1999a for predicting residual burst capacity of a dented pipe with gouges are applied as fea result post processor to predict fracture in the backing steel pipe 3 an empirical formula from the eprg roovers et al 1999b for predicting fatigue life of a dented pipe with gouges is applied as fea result post processor to predict the fatigue damage in the steel pipe and cra liner the formula uses stress cycle approach and takes into account the stress concentration due to dents and gouges stress cycle is considered appropriate for predicting fatigue damage due to the variation of temperature and pressure during shutdowns in operation the fe model described can accurately predict the dent depth however a local 3 d fe mesh size requirement for the modelling of gouging in the steel pipe is too expensive and therefore the gouge depth in this analysis is estimated from the global fe mesh distortion 4 2 1 damage model in fea the fea adopts the so called damage fracture initiation and evolution criteria to assess the occurrence of damage to the cra material the criteria are sometimes called stress modified critical strain and assume damage is initiated and starts to affect material stiffness when the equivalent plastic strain reaches the critical value this critical value in turn is a function of the material properties and the local state of stress abaqus abaqus 2011 has these criteria as a built in feature and computes the ratio of damage initiation as part of the solution 4 2 2 empirical formulas the level of damage to complete fracture at a dent can be expressed as 2 ω d 1 rb where ω d is the ratio of damage initiation rb is the ratio of the burst capacity of a dented pipe to that of undamaged pipe the burst capacity of the undamaged pipe is given as 3 p b 2 σ y t d where p b σ y t and d are the steel yield stress pipe wall thickness and outer diameter respectively the formulas for predicting burst capacity of pipes containing dent and gouge in cosham and hopkins 2001 are based on the dent and gouge depths pipe outer diameter and wall thickness material yield strength and fracture toughness 4 3 finite element model description the fe package abaqus version 6 10 1 abaqus 2011 is used for the analysis the specifics approaches adopted in the fe model include the model uses c3d8 element in abaqus which is a three dimensional eight node linear continuum element with full integration the use of element with full integration minimises potential error in the energy conservation calculation in a transient dynamic analysis however it requires more computational time than elements with reduced integration the fe discretisation in the vicinity of the point of impact utilises a uniform element size of about 2 mm along the longitudinal and circumferential directions larger element size of 20 mm in the longitudinal direction is used to discretise the region away from the point of impact three layers of elements are used to discretise the wall thickness the resulting finite element models are shown in fig 2 the modelled length of the flowline is 1m which is about three times pipe outer diameter to minimise the effects of the far boundary only half of the pipe cross section and half of the length of the indenter is included in the model due to the use of symmetry the near end of the model is restrained in the axial direction to model the symmetry of the indenter profile and hence the resulting dent the far end of the model is free to move this is also where the surface traction representing the true wall axial force is applied in the case of internal external pressure being taken into account the uniaxial stress strain curves for the carbon steel and cra materials are presented in fig 3 for seamless pipes the manufacturing method does not affect the behavior of the material in the circumferential direction and hence isotropic behavior can be assumed in addition the carbon steel and cra materials are assumed to follow isotropic hardening plasticity in abaqus this is the only hardening rule for metals in abaqus which takes into account the strain rate effect contact between the cra liner and steel pipe in the normal direction is modelled as a contact pair with hard pressure overclosure relation in abaqus no initial interface pressure due to manufacturing process is taken into account as this pressure typically diminishes during the heating for coating application in the absence of definite data the tangential interaction is represented by a coulomb friction model with an assumed coefficient of 0 5 rigid element r3d4 is used to model the knife edge indenter with its mass being lumped at the corners using point mass elements contact between the indenter and steel pipe is also modelled as a contact pair with hard pressure overclosure relation in abaqus the seabed is modelled as an analytical rigid surface internal pressure is applied to the inner surface of the cra liner while the truewall axial force is applied as a surface pressure to both carbon steel pipe and cra layer at the far end of the flowline this reflects the fact that the cra layer issealed at both ends of the pipe joint with weld overlay the true wall axial force n is related to the effective axial force seff as follows 4 n s e f f a i p i a e p e where pi and pe are internal and external pressure respectively ai is the area of the pipe bore and ae is the area enclosed by pipe outer diameter 4 4 analysis cases table 1 below presents the analysis cases considered in the fea a cycle between operating and shut down condition is performed to obtain the stress range at the dent for fatigue assessment the fe analysis was performed for a range of impact energies between 5 kj and 30 kj this range was found to be sufficient to identify the limiting case for the pipe either due to the predicted remaining burst capacity or the expected accumulation fatigue damage 5 results and discussions 5 1 analysis case 1 no pressure effects figs 4 and 5 present snapshots from the fea showing the sequence of the pipe deformation and the resulting dent formation during impact with transverse and longitudinal indenter respectively as an illustration the pipe is completely deformed in 60 milliseconds for a 30 kj impact this highlights the importance of including strain rate effect in the material properties as shown in fig 6 the dent reaches a maximum depth due to the combination of elastic and plastic deformations before settling to a permanent plastic deformation a transverse indenter which hits the pipe in the perpendicular direction to the pipe axis causes a slightly deeper dent than a longitudinal indenter however fig 7 indicates that the longitudinal indenter causes three times as large separation of the cra liner snapshots of the deformed fe mesh in fig 8 show that a longitudinal indenter causes a dent where the steel pipe deforms with significantly larger curvature than the cra liner the separated cra liner is in tension at the dent location and therefore there is no potential for wrinkling during impact 5 1 1 comparison of impact energy capacity in different pipe types fig 9 compares the response of cra lined pipe to that of plain steel pipe and cra clad pipe with the same wall thickness it can be seen that the impact energy capacity of cra lined pipe is more closely related to that of plain steel pipe on the other hand the cra layer is metallurgically bonded to the backing steel pipe in a cra clad pipe and hence the cra layer in this case does provide additional resistance to impact load and reduce the dent depth for the same amount of impact energy fig 9 also confirms that the orientation of the indenter does affect the impact energy capacity of either a cra clad pipe or a cra lined pipe the plain steel pipe in this comparison has the same wall thickness as the backing steel pipe of the cra lined and cra clad pipes the impact energy capacity is directly related to the fraction of impact energy being absorbed by the steel and cra layers as shown in fig 10 the amount of energy being absorbed by the backing steel pipe in cra lined pipe lies between that in plain steel pipe and cra clad pipe regardless the orientation of the indenter transverse or longitudinal the liner in the cra lined pipe absorbs only a small fraction of the impact energy and hence the steel layer absorbs almost the same amount as a plain steel pipe does on the other hand due to the perfect bond between the cra and steel layers in the cra clad pipe the contribution of the cra layer in energy absorption is higher based on the comparison of the impact energy capacity it can be asserted that it is acceptable and sufficiently conservative to neglect the contribution of the liner in predicting dent depth in a cra lined pipe using theoretical empirical formulas in the literature which were derived for plain steel pipes further justification is presented in section 5 1 2 5 1 2 comparison of impact energy prediction from fea and theoretical empirical formulas as part of the verification of the fe model a comparison of the impact energy capacity prediction given by the fea and theoretical empirical formulas has been performed ellinas and walker 1983 published an empirical formula for local dent in tubular structural member while de oliveira et al 1982 presented a simplified formula from quasi static theoretical analysis dnv rp f107 2010 also provided a simplified formula based on the quasi static solution by wierzbicki and suh 1988 all empirical theoretical solutions were derived for a transverse indenter it can be seen in fig 11 that there is a good correlation between the fe results and empirical theoretical solutions for dent depth less than 5 od omitting the cra liner the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 gives a conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths up to 10 for plain carbon steel pipe and 12 for cra lined pipe other empirical theoretical solutions tend to over predict the impact energy for dents deeper than 5 od as those solutions are based on quasi static analysis and neglect stronger dynamic effects in impacts with higher impact energy note that including the thickness of the cra liner and assuming the cra liner as steel in the simplified formula in dnv rp f107 2010 results in a non conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths greater than 6 5 2 analysis case 2 effects of external over pressure impact to empty pipe prior to hydrotest finite element simulation in fig 12 shows that a cra lined pipe has less impact capacity to a transverse indenter than to a longitudinal indenter in other words a transverse indenter will cause a deeper dent than a longitudinal indenter does for the same amount of impact energy the effects of external pressure from 230 m water column are also shown in the same figure as expected the impact energy capacity is reduced as external over pressure increases the dent depth for the same amount of impact energy in this case the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 still gives a conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths up to 9 the external pressure at the deepest end is quite small and evidently has only a small effect on the energy capacity in other possible cases such as deep water pipelines where collapse would be a relevant limit state the effect of external pressure is likely to be a much more significant factor on the impact energy capacity simulation results in fig 12 suggests that the formula can result in non conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for pipelines in ultra deep waters and the effects of external over pressure must be assessed by means of numerical simulation high contact force during impact also leads to the development of a gouge or loss of pipe wall material locally fig 13 shows the estimated gouge depth from fea mesh a reduction in wall thickness in the order of 10 12 due to gouging from a transverse indenter is noted the presence of external over pressure tends to reduce the gouge depth as a larger proportion of the impact energy is absorbed towards the formation of a deeper dent as was previously shown on the time history plot in fig 7 a longitudinal indenter causes larger separation of the cra liner than a transverse indenter does fig 14 predicts that the amount of liner separation due to a longitudinal indenter increases substantially for dent depths greater than 9 od it also highlights that although the presence of external over pressure increases the dent depth the dent itself can be smoother or have smaller curvature than the dent without the effects of external over pressure as a result external over pressure tends to reduce the separation of the cra liner the reduction is more noticeable in the case of a transverse indenter the predicted ratios of the dented burst pressure in the backing steel pipe from the eprg model are shown in fig 15 while fig 16 presents the predicted ratios of damage initiation in the cra layer from the fea it can be seen that the damage initiation ratio for the cra liner is less than unity and therefore it does not suffer from any significant damage for dent depths up to 13 the low damage initiation ratio also indicates low risk of damage to undermatch cra seal weld and girth weld the two methods of damage assessment show good correlation a transverse indenter is more damaging to the backing steel pipe than to the cra liner due to deeper gouge while a longitudinal indenter is more damaging to the cra liner due to the greater liner separation both methods show the tendency of the external over pressure to reduce the amount of damage from the decrease in either the gouge depth or liner separation however the reduction is not substantial as shown in fig 15 the critical dent depth for maintaining the capacity to contain the design pressure is 6 1 od which corresponds to impact energy capacity of 10 9 kj in the case of no external over pressure in fig 12 in the presence of external over pressure the impact energy capacity reduces slightly to 10 3 kj it is noted that the contribution of the cra liner to resist burst pressure is typically neglected in a cra lined pipe 5 2 1 effects of operating pressure and temperature cycles fig 17 shows that hydrotest pressure which is applied subsequent to the impact load following the loading sequence in table 1 pushes the dent out and reduces its depth for the critical dent depth of 6 1 od there is a noticeable change in the dent depth as the pressure cycles between the maximum operating and shut down conditions it is this type of movement that may lead to failure due to fatigue the hydrotest pressure also pushes the cra liner and re attaches it to the backing steel pipe the true wall stress is actually in tension during hydrotest and hence there is no potential for the liner to wrinkle fig 18 indicates that there is little movement of the liner during the pressure cycles between the maximum operating and shut down condition the evolution of the dent depth and liner separation during post impact pressurisation and de pressurisation is illustrated in fig 19 fig 20 presents the calculated fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe and cra liner a longitudinal indenter causes the most severe fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe the elongated dent experiences larger stress amplitude from the larger change in dent depth due to pressure fluctuation in this particular case the dent depth corresponding to the allowable fatigue damage of 4 is 8 2 od and hence the critical dent depth is indeed limited by the remaining burst capacity due to the small movement of the liner after the hydrotest condition the fatigue damage in the cra liner remains small this is also consistent with the prediction that no damage has been initiated 5 3 analysis case 3 effects of internal over pressure impact during shut down a flowline is typically kept pressurised during shut down and fig 21 displays the effects of a low internal over pressure about 5 5 mpa in this particular case on the dent depth compared to the dent depth without the pressure effects there is little or practically no change in the dent depth on the other hand fig 22 shows that the gouge depth increases significantly in particular the gouge caused by a transverse indenter this indicates that more impact energy is being absorbed by damage in the material rather than plastic deformation of the pipe wall which is effectively constrained by the internal over pressure this observation is confirmed by the reduction in the dented burst pressure in the backing steel pipe shown in fig 23 the critical dent depth for maintaining the capacity to contain the design pressure is reduced to 5 1 od which corresponds to impact energy capacity of 8 3 kj in fig 21 although remained undamaged the damage initiation ratio in the cra layer in fig 24 at the critical dent depth also increases significantly nevertheless despite causing more damage to the steel pipe the internal over pressure minimises the tendency of the cra liner to separate from the backing steel pipe it can be seen in fig 25 that the gap between the liner and the steel pipe is only in the order of 0 1 mm 5 3 1 effects of operating pressure and temperature cycles fig 26 shows the variation of the dent depth due to the pressure and temperature cycles while fig 27 presents the variation of the liner separation at the critical dent depth of 5 1 od the liner separation may increase slightly as the internal pressure and consequently the dent depth change this can be attributed to the re rounding of the pipe circumference and changes in the curvature of the dent however the increase in liner separation is minimal and the gap remains in the order of 0 1 mm the calculated fatigue damage is shown in fig 28 the backing steel pipe suffers from higher fatigue damage due to the deeper gouge in this particular case the dent depth corresponding to the allowable fatigue damage of 4 is 7 3 od and hence the critical dent depth is limited by the remaining burst capacity i e 5 1 od 5 4 calculated allowable dent depth table 2 presents a summary of the allowable dent depths from the three analysis cases considered in this paper the limiting criteria are the burst pressure and fatigue life of the backing steel pipe it can be seen that the allowable dent depth is in the range of 5 8 od which agrees with the recommended range of 6 7 od in the guidelines jones and birch 2010 cosham and hopkins 2003 roovers et al 1999a 1999b the smallest allowable dent depth is 5 1 od which is limited by the remaining burst capacity in analysis case 3 representing the operating condition 6 conclusions the post impact fitness for purpose of the cra lined pipes is limited by either fatigue damage or the remaining capacity of the dented backing steel pipe to withstand internal pressure prior to fracture fe analysis reveals that the backing steel pipe dominates the response and consequently the dent depth and damage caused by impact load are similar to those found in plain steel pipes despite being separated during impact and subsequently re attached to the backing steel pipe in the subsequent pipe pressurisation during hydrotest or operation the cra liner is undamaged and its fatigue capacity is not compromised the risk of liner wrinkling is therefore minimal results from the assessment have shown the risk for cra liner separation is greatest when the flowline is empty during installation however internal over pressure during the subsequent hydrotest will minimise the gap between the liner and the backing steel pipe and there is limited potential for further liner separation during operating and shut down cycles the presence of internal over pressure during impact reduces the dent depth and keeps the cra liner separation at a minimum however for the same impact energy it causes deeper gouge to the backing steel at the impact location resulting in substantial reduction in both fatigue life and remaining burst capacity a longitudinal indenter causes the most severe fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe the elongated dent experiences larger stress amplitude from the larger change in dent depth due to pressure fluctuation the presence of external over pressure during impact on the other hand increases the dent depth and depending on the orientation of the dropped object with respect to pipeline direction may increase the liner separation however there is not significant increase in the material damage since there is less gouging in the pipe wall the fe analysis verifies that 5 od dent depth is acceptable for a cra lined pipe for the same dent depth the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 conservatively predicts less impact energy capacity therefore the dropped object risk assessment in detailed in dnv rp f107 2010 is on the conservative side and its validity for cra lined pipe is verified 
23113,third party threats from accidentally dropped objects could cause external impact loading that may potentially affect the integrity and safety of a subsea pipeline system these incidents may occur during installation construction and operation phases of the project to evaluate the structural integrity of carbon steel cs subsea pipelines due to dropped objects events risk assessment is conducted following the procedure detailed in dnv rp f107 which gives a closed form formula for predicting the impact energy capacity of the cs pipeline and assumes an acceptance criterion of limiting the dent depth ratio to 5 of pipe diameter for a no leakage condition in the case of cs pipelines mechanically lined with corrosion resistant alloy cra the applicability of the impact energy formula and the acceptance criterion is however largely unknown considering that cra lined pipes involve additional modes of failure in the form of liner separation and its potential for subsequent fatigue failure during operation this paper discusses finite element modelling undertaken to evaluate the structural response of a cra lined pipeline subjected to external impact loads results confirm that liner separation is of minor importance and the use of the established acceptance criterion derived for plain carbon steel pipes can be justified to apply to cra lined pipelines keywords corrosion

pipeline research group od outside diameter simops simultaneous operations 1 introduction as the global energy demand grows with time the increased exploitation and recovery of offshore natural resources has invariably led to numerous fields where the produced raw gas contains significant levels of compounds carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide that may make the anticipated flow stream highly corrosive for carbon steel flowlines pipelines and will require a corrosion mitigation method as an alternative to chemical corrosion inhibition the pipeline can be protected by materials that are inherently corrosion resistant to the produced fluids i e corrosion resistant alloy cra line pipes constructed from cra entirely are expensive and hence carbon steel pipes internally clad or lined with a cra are typically used in the case of clad pipes the cra material is applied to the inner surface of the carbon steel pipe by means of a metallurgical bond lined pipes on the other hand are produced by hydrostatically or mechanically expanding a cra liner onto the inner surface of the carbon steel pipe the lined pipe joint is supplied with a cra seal weld on each end for site welding purposes although the cra lined pipe provides significant cost savings it poses additional failure modes in comparison to clad or solid cra pipes focke 2007 the primary limit state condition for lined pipe is the onset of local buckling or wrinkling of the liner as shown in fig 1 either due to an impact load or the combination of bending and axial compression load the wrinkled liner may suffer from early fatigue failure due to cycles of stress concentration from pressure and temperature variations during operational shutdowns other potential failure modes include fracture of girth welds however since there is no risk of seal weld separation at this location this is expected to happen only at higher impact loads the present study thus focuses on assessing the cra liner wrinkling due to impact loads and the associated risks 2 dropped object risk assessment the dnv recommended practice for integrity management of submarine pipeline systems dnv rp f116 2009 1 1 dnv rp f116 has been superseded by dnvgl rp f116 notes that the most common pipeline threats may be organised into six threat groups the threats from accidentally dropped objects resulting in impact loads are defined under the third party threats group dropped objects causing damage to subsea pipelines and structures may occur during installation construction and or operation activities simultaneous operations simops of drilling and production undertaken during infill drilling and well intervention campaigns throughout the life of the project are known to pose high likelihood for dropped objects causing damage to the subsea production systems doris 2011 the consequence of this damage to cra lined subsea flowlines is potential for loss of containment i e an environmental risk such a loss can lead to safety risk to the rig personnel due to significant inventories in the subsea flowlines there is also asset risk from the seawater ingress resulting in loss of flowline due to severe corrosion to assess the impact risk on the pipeline probability risk assessments are conducted following the standard methodology described in the recommended practice dnv rp f107 2010 the probability that an impact results in damage is established based on the impact energy estimate and the impact energy capacity for the installed subsea equipment 2 1 impact energy capacities impact damage is based on an energy balance approach where the available kinetic energy from an impacting object is compared to the energy required to produce a dent the dent size expressed as a percentage of the overall pipeline diameter is an indication as to the likelihood of a leak or rupture dnv rp f107 2010 2 2 dnv rp f107 has been superseded by dnvgl rp f107 provides a relation for determining the impact energy required to dent the pipeline due to dropped objects the closed form equation shown below assumes a rigid knife edge impacting perpendicular to the axis of the pipeline 1 e 16 2 π 9 m p d t d δ d 3 2 m p 1 4 σ y t 2 where e is the impact energy δ is the dent depth t is the pipe wall thickness σy is the material yield stress mp is the plastic moment capacity of the pipe wall and d is the pipe outer diameter it is noted the empirical formulations in the recommended practice for impact assessments are based on plain carbon steel which is a significant idealisation for cra lined pipelines an additional risk could result due to local deformations imposed by impact loading in the vicinity of inherent weld defects at girth welds this form of potential failure mode is not considered here 2 2 allowable dent depth section 4 2 in dnv rp f107 2010 describes the damage classifications used to define severity of dent depth the acceptance criterion is based on limiting the damage in the pipe in terms of the ratio of dent depth to pipe diameter to a maximum of 5 for damage category d1 as specified in dnv rp f107 2010 the dent depth in the steel pipe wall of up to 5 of the diameter will not normally have any immediate influence on the operation of the lines including pigging whilst the results from the dropped object risk assessment may show that the risk of a dropped object exceeding the pipeline resistance is low there is still the requirement to justify the use of the following assumptions for cra lined pipeline in terms of impact energy capacity an equivalent plain carbon steel pipe with the total thickness of the backing steel pipe and the cra liner can represent the cra lined pipe and hence equation 1 above for predicting impact energy capacity may be used the 5 od dent depth limit ensures no damage to the cra liner and no leakage in the backing steel pipe including the effects of a gouge the 5 od dent depth limit also ensures that the allowable fatigue damage at the dent location is the same as that for the undented pipe during the design phase of a recently completed subsea project a case study of the impact resistance of cra lined flowline was conducted to justify the above assumptions the flowline was designed in accordance with dnv os f101 2010 3 3 dnv os f101 has been superseded by dnvgl st f101 for its general mechanical requirement and safebuck guideline 2008 for its lateral buckling mitigation the case study utilised 3 d nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis fea to investigate the impact resistance of a 14 inch flowline with the following parameters that resulted from the design seamless pipe with 14 3 mm wall thickness made of dnv grade 450 carbon steel 3 mm thick internal liner made of aisi 316 stainless steel design pressure equal to 73 of steel pipe burst pressure allowable fatigue damage over the design life of 4 which accounts for the design fatigue factor in dnv os f101 2010 proportion of fatigue during installation and operation and a project specified knockdown factor for fatigue in cra lined pipe deepest end of the flowline in 230 m water depth the design of the flowline includes 5lpp insulation coating that was conservatively neglected in the present analysis of the impact energy capacity of the cra lined pipe itself polymer coating absorbs a proportion of the impact energy and dnv rp f107 2010 provides an estimate of the energy absorption capacity of different thicknesses of polymer coating 3 impact loads from dropped objects dropped objects possess a certain energy a portion of which is transferred to the subsea asset upon impact resulting in varying degrees of damage depending on the properties of both object and impacted assets an impact is a highly nonlinear dynamic phenomenon due to the large deformations that take place in a very short duration the nonlinearity in turn leads to different types of pipeline deformation under impact loads empirical models by jones and birch 2010 indicate that the deformation of a pipeline on the seabed is primarily in the form of local denting while a free spanning pipeline will deform globally with minimal denting therefore the primary concern for a pipeline on the seabed is the dent depth gouging or loss of pipe wall material and potential rupture at the dent location the dent depth is defined as the permanent reduction of the pipe nominal diameter at the dent location subsequent to the elastic rebound when the impact load is removed as previously established for cra lined pipelines there is a concern with the potential failure mode arising from liner separation in the area of the dent it is possible that small gaps between the liner and cs pipe inner surface could occur along a pipeline resulting from the method of pipe manufacturing this study assumes that the cra liner is initially in contact with the backing steel pipe and no liner separation or wrinkling takes place during pipelay it is known that internal over pressure has significant effects on local denting of a plain steel pipe and therefore it is of interest to examine whether the presence of internal over pressure could avoid or minimise liner separation in cra lined pipeline another possibility is that the high internal pressure during hydrotest operating condition would re attach the liner that gets separated should an impact occur when the pipeline is de pressurised this is only meaningful as long as fracture does not develop in the liner during impact hence a damage assessment needs to be performed as part of the fea or as a post processor to fea results 4 numerical analysis 4 1 analysis premise for a given impact energy the local denting is affected by many factors such as the angle between the orientation of the pipeline and impacting object net external or internal pressure the presence of insulation and concrete weight coatings strain rate of material hence the present analysis adopts the following assumptions the impacting object or indenter is modelled as a rigid sharp knife edge the knife edge is in a horizontal position when it impacts the pipeline these are the same assumptions on which equation 1 in dnv rp f107 2010 is based the length of the indenter is typically assumed to be perpendicular to the pipeline axis during impact however it has been recognised that an indenter parallel to the pipeline axis may cause worse damage cosham and hopkins 2003 these two orientations are therefore considered in the present investigation effects of insulation and concrete weight coatings are not taken into account in establishing the limiting criterion for dent depth and damage to the steel pipe and cra liner these coatings absorb impact energy which means that higher impact energy would be required to cause the same amount of damage to the pipe similarly the limiting criterion for dent depth and damage assumes that seabed is rigid and supports the pipeline continuously seabed flexibility helps increase the pipe impact capacity for the same dent depth the indenter has reached the terminal velocity at time of impact and hence its acceleration is zero the effects of material strain rate are modelled using the cowper symonds overstress power law in the absence of project specific test data the coefficient and exponent for the carbon steel are set to 40 and 4 5 which are based on hse 2001 a review of hse 2001 indicates that the use of the same coefficient and exponent can be justified for the cra material with lower yield strength used in the project 4 2 damage assessment an impact load can introduce a high level of plastic strain at the dent without fracture as the three dimensional state of stress may inhibit the formation and growth of cracks and due to material defects hence a simple comparison of the strain at a dent to an allowable value from uni axial tension test cannot be used for assessing the level of damage at a dent a material failure criterion is highly dependent on material properties and rate of loading in addition an impact load from a dropped object on a subsea pipeline also typically causes some kind of gouge and may develop into a secondary damage of loss of pipewall material therefore the damage assessment in this paper follows three approaches 1 a mathematical model for material damage initiation and evolution which indicates whether a damage leading to ductile fracture is starting to form in the material is applied to predict damage in the cra liner since no gouges are expected to take place therein this damage model is used directly as part of the fe model 2 empirical formulas from the eprg roovers et al 1999a for predicting residual burst capacity of a dented pipe with gouges are applied as fea result post processor to predict fracture in the backing steel pipe 3 an empirical formula from the eprg roovers et al 1999b for predicting fatigue life of a dented pipe with gouges is applied as fea result post processor to predict the fatigue damage in the steel pipe and cra liner the formula uses stress cycle approach and takes into account the stress concentration due to dents and gouges stress cycle is considered appropriate for predicting fatigue damage due to the variation of temperature and pressure during shutdowns in operation the fe model described can accurately predict the dent depth however a local 3 d fe mesh size requirement for the modelling of gouging in the steel pipe is too expensive and therefore the gouge depth in this analysis is estimated from the global fe mesh distortion 4 2 1 damage model in fea the fea adopts the so called damage fracture initiation and evolution criteria to assess the occurrence of damage to the cra material the criteria are sometimes called stress modified critical strain and assume damage is initiated and starts to affect material stiffness when the equivalent plastic strain reaches the critical value this critical value in turn is a function of the material properties and the local state of stress abaqus abaqus 2011 has these criteria as a built in feature and computes the ratio of damage initiation as part of the solution 4 2 2 empirical formulas the level of damage to complete fracture at a dent can be expressed as 2 ω d 1 rb where ω d is the ratio of damage initiation rb is the ratio of the burst capacity of a dented pipe to that of undamaged pipe the burst capacity of the undamaged pipe is given as 3 p b 2 σ y t d where p b σ y t and d are the steel yield stress pipe wall thickness and outer diameter respectively the formulas for predicting burst capacity of pipes containing dent and gouge in cosham and hopkins 2001 are based on the dent and gouge depths pipe outer diameter and wall thickness material yield strength and fracture toughness 4 3 finite element model description the fe package abaqus version 6 10 1 abaqus 2011 is used for the analysis the specifics approaches adopted in the fe model include the model uses c3d8 element in abaqus which is a three dimensional eight node linear continuum element with full integration the use of element with full integration minimises potential error in the energy conservation calculation in a transient dynamic analysis however it requires more computational time than elements with reduced integration the fe discretisation in the vicinity of the point of impact utilises a uniform element size of about 2 mm along the longitudinal and circumferential directions larger element size of 20 mm in the longitudinal direction is used to discretise the region away from the point of impact three layers of elements are used to discretise the wall thickness the resulting finite element models are shown in fig 2 the modelled length of the flowline is 1m which is about three times pipe outer diameter to minimise the effects of the far boundary only half of the pipe cross section and half of the length of the indenter is included in the model due to the use of symmetry the near end of the model is restrained in the axial direction to model the symmetry of the indenter profile and hence the resulting dent the far end of the model is free to move this is also where the surface traction representing the true wall axial force is applied in the case of internal external pressure being taken into account the uniaxial stress strain curves for the carbon steel and cra materials are presented in fig 3 for seamless pipes the manufacturing method does not affect the behavior of the material in the circumferential direction and hence isotropic behavior can be assumed in addition the carbon steel and cra materials are assumed to follow isotropic hardening plasticity in abaqus this is the only hardening rule for metals in abaqus which takes into account the strain rate effect contact between the cra liner and steel pipe in the normal direction is modelled as a contact pair with hard pressure overclosure relation in abaqus no initial interface pressure due to manufacturing process is taken into account as this pressure typically diminishes during the heating for coating application in the absence of definite data the tangential interaction is represented by a coulomb friction model with an assumed coefficient of 0 5 rigid element r3d4 is used to model the knife edge indenter with its mass being lumped at the corners using point mass elements contact between the indenter and steel pipe is also modelled as a contact pair with hard pressure overclosure relation in abaqus the seabed is modelled as an analytical rigid surface internal pressure is applied to the inner surface of the cra liner while the truewall axial force is applied as a surface pressure to both carbon steel pipe and cra layer at the far end of the flowline this reflects the fact that the cra layer issealed at both ends of the pipe joint with weld overlay the true wall axial force n is related to the effective axial force seff as follows 4 n s e f f a i p i a e p e where pi and pe are internal and external pressure respectively ai is the area of the pipe bore and ae is the area enclosed by pipe outer diameter 4 4 analysis cases table 1 below presents the analysis cases considered in the fea a cycle between operating and shut down condition is performed to obtain the stress range at the dent for fatigue assessment the fe analysis was performed for a range of impact energies between 5 kj and 30 kj this range was found to be sufficient to identify the limiting case for the pipe either due to the predicted remaining burst capacity or the expected accumulation fatigue damage 5 results and discussions 5 1 analysis case 1 no pressure effects figs 4 and 5 present snapshots from the fea showing the sequence of the pipe deformation and the resulting dent formation during impact with transverse and longitudinal indenter respectively as an illustration the pipe is completely deformed in 60 milliseconds for a 30 kj impact this highlights the importance of including strain rate effect in the material properties as shown in fig 6 the dent reaches a maximum depth due to the combination of elastic and plastic deformations before settling to a permanent plastic deformation a transverse indenter which hits the pipe in the perpendicular direction to the pipe axis causes a slightly deeper dent than a longitudinal indenter however fig 7 indicates that the longitudinal indenter causes three times as large separation of the cra liner snapshots of the deformed fe mesh in fig 8 show that a longitudinal indenter causes a dent where the steel pipe deforms with significantly larger curvature than the cra liner the separated cra liner is in tension at the dent location and therefore there is no potential for wrinkling during impact 5 1 1 comparison of impact energy capacity in different pipe types fig 9 compares the response of cra lined pipe to that of plain steel pipe and cra clad pipe with the same wall thickness it can be seen that the impact energy capacity of cra lined pipe is more closely related to that of plain steel pipe on the other hand the cra layer is metallurgically bonded to the backing steel pipe in a cra clad pipe and hence the cra layer in this case does provide additional resistance to impact load and reduce the dent depth for the same amount of impact energy fig 9 also confirms that the orientation of the indenter does affect the impact energy capacity of either a cra clad pipe or a cra lined pipe the plain steel pipe in this comparison has the same wall thickness as the backing steel pipe of the cra lined and cra clad pipes the impact energy capacity is directly related to the fraction of impact energy being absorbed by the steel and cra layers as shown in fig 10 the amount of energy being absorbed by the backing steel pipe in cra lined pipe lies between that in plain steel pipe and cra clad pipe regardless the orientation of the indenter transverse or longitudinal the liner in the cra lined pipe absorbs only a small fraction of the impact energy and hence the steel layer absorbs almost the same amount as a plain steel pipe does on the other hand due to the perfect bond between the cra and steel layers in the cra clad pipe the contribution of the cra layer in energy absorption is higher based on the comparison of the impact energy capacity it can be asserted that it is acceptable and sufficiently conservative to neglect the contribution of the liner in predicting dent depth in a cra lined pipe using theoretical empirical formulas in the literature which were derived for plain steel pipes further justification is presented in section 5 1 2 5 1 2 comparison of impact energy prediction from fea and theoretical empirical formulas as part of the verification of the fe model a comparison of the impact energy capacity prediction given by the fea and theoretical empirical formulas has been performed ellinas and walker 1983 published an empirical formula for local dent in tubular structural member while de oliveira et al 1982 presented a simplified formula from quasi static theoretical analysis dnv rp f107 2010 also provided a simplified formula based on the quasi static solution by wierzbicki and suh 1988 all empirical theoretical solutions were derived for a transverse indenter it can be seen in fig 11 that there is a good correlation between the fe results and empirical theoretical solutions for dent depth less than 5 od omitting the cra liner the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 gives a conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths up to 10 for plain carbon steel pipe and 12 for cra lined pipe other empirical theoretical solutions tend to over predict the impact energy for dents deeper than 5 od as those solutions are based on quasi static analysis and neglect stronger dynamic effects in impacts with higher impact energy note that including the thickness of the cra liner and assuming the cra liner as steel in the simplified formula in dnv rp f107 2010 results in a non conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths greater than 6 5 2 analysis case 2 effects of external over pressure impact to empty pipe prior to hydrotest finite element simulation in fig 12 shows that a cra lined pipe has less impact capacity to a transverse indenter than to a longitudinal indenter in other words a transverse indenter will cause a deeper dent than a longitudinal indenter does for the same amount of impact energy the effects of external pressure from 230 m water column are also shown in the same figure as expected the impact energy capacity is reduced as external over pressure increases the dent depth for the same amount of impact energy in this case the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 still gives a conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for dent depths up to 9 the external pressure at the deepest end is quite small and evidently has only a small effect on the energy capacity in other possible cases such as deep water pipelines where collapse would be a relevant limit state the effect of external pressure is likely to be a much more significant factor on the impact energy capacity simulation results in fig 12 suggests that the formula can result in non conservative estimate of the impact energy capacity for pipelines in ultra deep waters and the effects of external over pressure must be assessed by means of numerical simulation high contact force during impact also leads to the development of a gouge or loss of pipe wall material locally fig 13 shows the estimated gouge depth from fea mesh a reduction in wall thickness in the order of 10 12 due to gouging from a transverse indenter is noted the presence of external over pressure tends to reduce the gouge depth as a larger proportion of the impact energy is absorbed towards the formation of a deeper dent as was previously shown on the time history plot in fig 7 a longitudinal indenter causes larger separation of the cra liner than a transverse indenter does fig 14 predicts that the amount of liner separation due to a longitudinal indenter increases substantially for dent depths greater than 9 od it also highlights that although the presence of external over pressure increases the dent depth the dent itself can be smoother or have smaller curvature than the dent without the effects of external over pressure as a result external over pressure tends to reduce the separation of the cra liner the reduction is more noticeable in the case of a transverse indenter the predicted ratios of the dented burst pressure in the backing steel pipe from the eprg model are shown in fig 15 while fig 16 presents the predicted ratios of damage initiation in the cra layer from the fea it can be seen that the damage initiation ratio for the cra liner is less than unity and therefore it does not suffer from any significant damage for dent depths up to 13 the low damage initiation ratio also indicates low risk of damage to undermatch cra seal weld and girth weld the two methods of damage assessment show good correlation a transverse indenter is more damaging to the backing steel pipe than to the cra liner due to deeper gouge while a longitudinal indenter is more damaging to the cra liner due to the greater liner separation both methods show the tendency of the external over pressure to reduce the amount of damage from the decrease in either the gouge depth or liner separation however the reduction is not substantial as shown in fig 15 the critical dent depth for maintaining the capacity to contain the design pressure is 6 1 od which corresponds to impact energy capacity of 10 9 kj in the case of no external over pressure in fig 12 in the presence of external over pressure the impact energy capacity reduces slightly to 10 3 kj it is noted that the contribution of the cra liner to resist burst pressure is typically neglected in a cra lined pipe 5 2 1 effects of operating pressure and temperature cycles fig 17 shows that hydrotest pressure which is applied subsequent to the impact load following the loading sequence in table 1 pushes the dent out and reduces its depth for the critical dent depth of 6 1 od there is a noticeable change in the dent depth as the pressure cycles between the maximum operating and shut down conditions it is this type of movement that may lead to failure due to fatigue the hydrotest pressure also pushes the cra liner and re attaches it to the backing steel pipe the true wall stress is actually in tension during hydrotest and hence there is no potential for the liner to wrinkle fig 18 indicates that there is little movement of the liner during the pressure cycles between the maximum operating and shut down condition the evolution of the dent depth and liner separation during post impact pressurisation and de pressurisation is illustrated in fig 19 fig 20 presents the calculated fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe and cra liner a longitudinal indenter causes the most severe fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe the elongated dent experiences larger stress amplitude from the larger change in dent depth due to pressure fluctuation in this particular case the dent depth corresponding to the allowable fatigue damage of 4 is 8 2 od and hence the critical dent depth is indeed limited by the remaining burst capacity due to the small movement of the liner after the hydrotest condition the fatigue damage in the cra liner remains small this is also consistent with the prediction that no damage has been initiated 5 3 analysis case 3 effects of internal over pressure impact during shut down a flowline is typically kept pressurised during shut down and fig 21 displays the effects of a low internal over pressure about 5 5 mpa in this particular case on the dent depth compared to the dent depth without the pressure effects there is little or practically no change in the dent depth on the other hand fig 22 shows that the gouge depth increases significantly in particular the gouge caused by a transverse indenter this indicates that more impact energy is being absorbed by damage in the material rather than plastic deformation of the pipe wall which is effectively constrained by the internal over pressure this observation is confirmed by the reduction in the dented burst pressure in the backing steel pipe shown in fig 23 the critical dent depth for maintaining the capacity to contain the design pressure is reduced to 5 1 od which corresponds to impact energy capacity of 8 3 kj in fig 21 although remained undamaged the damage initiation ratio in the cra layer in fig 24 at the critical dent depth also increases significantly nevertheless despite causing more damage to the steel pipe the internal over pressure minimises the tendency of the cra liner to separate from the backing steel pipe it can be seen in fig 25 that the gap between the liner and the steel pipe is only in the order of 0 1 mm 5 3 1 effects of operating pressure and temperature cycles fig 26 shows the variation of the dent depth due to the pressure and temperature cycles while fig 27 presents the variation of the liner separation at the critical dent depth of 5 1 od the liner separation may increase slightly as the internal pressure and consequently the dent depth change this can be attributed to the re rounding of the pipe circumference and changes in the curvature of the dent however the increase in liner separation is minimal and the gap remains in the order of 0 1 mm the calculated fatigue damage is shown in fig 28 the backing steel pipe suffers from higher fatigue damage due to the deeper gouge in this particular case the dent depth corresponding to the allowable fatigue damage of 4 is 7 3 od and hence the critical dent depth is limited by the remaining burst capacity i e 5 1 od 5 4 calculated allowable dent depth table 2 presents a summary of the allowable dent depths from the three analysis cases considered in this paper the limiting criteria are the burst pressure and fatigue life of the backing steel pipe it can be seen that the allowable dent depth is in the range of 5 8 od which agrees with the recommended range of 6 7 od in the guidelines jones and birch 2010 cosham and hopkins 2003 roovers et al 1999a 1999b the smallest allowable dent depth is 5 1 od which is limited by the remaining burst capacity in analysis case 3 representing the operating condition 6 conclusions the post impact fitness for purpose of the cra lined pipes is limited by either fatigue damage or the remaining capacity of the dented backing steel pipe to withstand internal pressure prior to fracture fe analysis reveals that the backing steel pipe dominates the response and consequently the dent depth and damage caused by impact load are similar to those found in plain steel pipes despite being separated during impact and subsequently re attached to the backing steel pipe in the subsequent pipe pressurisation during hydrotest or operation the cra liner is undamaged and its fatigue capacity is not compromised the risk of liner wrinkling is therefore minimal results from the assessment have shown the risk for cra liner separation is greatest when the flowline is empty during installation however internal over pressure during the subsequent hydrotest will minimise the gap between the liner and the backing steel pipe and there is limited potential for further liner separation during operating and shut down cycles the presence of internal over pressure during impact reduces the dent depth and keeps the cra liner separation at a minimum however for the same impact energy it causes deeper gouge to the backing steel at the impact location resulting in substantial reduction in both fatigue life and remaining burst capacity a longitudinal indenter causes the most severe fatigue damage to the backing steel pipe the elongated dent experiences larger stress amplitude from the larger change in dent depth due to pressure fluctuation the presence of external over pressure during impact on the other hand increases the dent depth and depending on the orientation of the dropped object with respect to pipeline direction may increase the liner separation however there is not significant increase in the material damage since there is less gouging in the pipe wall the fe analysis verifies that 5 od dent depth is acceptable for a cra lined pipe for the same dent depth the formula in dnv rp f107 2010 conservatively predicts less impact energy capacity therefore the dropped object risk assessment in detailed in dnv rp f107 2010 is on the conservative side and its validity for cra lined pipe is verified

offshore aquaculture vessel were carried out while multidisciplinary design optimization aimed to improve the resistance performance and the wake field quality of the vessel numerical analysis was performed using a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver and the numerical method was validated by comparing the numerical results from the original shape to the experimental results three support vector regression svr based surrogate models with different numbers of sample points were built and the influence of the sample set size on the prediction precision was determined an svr surrogate model with 60 sample points was applied and optimized to replace direct numerical simulations an optimization framework using latin hypercube sampling lhs the free form deformation ffd method the svr surrogate model and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii was developed nine design variables were employed to modify the shape of the vessel because of the trade off between the minimum resistance and the minimum circumferential nonuniformity of the wake flow the optimal solution of the hull shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions to balance the two objectives model tests for the optimized shape were then performed to validate the design results the results showed that the resistance and the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake flow of the

terrigenous pollution and disease and is suitable for deep sea aquaculture among marine power strategies deep sea aquaculture equipment may experience significant development as a more efficient and greener mode of performing aquaculture designing an offshore aquaculture platform could offer great value to china s deep sea aquaculture equipment industry profoundly impact the overcapacity in the shipbuilding industry and improve deep sea aquaculture equipment however the hull form design of a platform is complex and involves a large number of design variables complicated constraints and multiple objectives and thus it is difficult to determine a globally optimal hull form traditionaldesign method is mainly based on the shape of the parent vessel the hull form is modified to satisfy design objectives on a per use basis and theperformance is optimized and verified by model testing however traditional optimization methods are expensive and time consuming relying too heavily on the form of the parent vessel model testing and employment of experienced engineers therefore it is necessary to find a time and cost effective optimization method for hull form design in the 1970s optimization theory was introduced into the field of ship design during this time ship optimization research focused mainly on the expression of hull geometry and numerical calculation hsiung 1972 introduced a set of tent functions to approximate the ship hull function by introducing the functions the michell integral for wave resistance was reduced to a standard quadratic form the quadratic programming techniques were applied to minimize the wave resistance three optimal forms were chosen and validated by model tests it was found that the wave resistance of the ship was reduced significantly after optimization huan and huang 1998 optimized the wave making resistance by applying a highly efficient gradient based optimization method combined with the potential flow method suzuki and iokamori 1999 proposed an elliptical panel arrangement of the free surface panels and the improved dawson type solver was used to report the wave making resistance of the ship a weight function was introduced to present the hull as a smooth surface by means of sequential quadratic programming optimization of the htc container ship was carried out to minimize the wave making resistance and showed good performance harries 1998 applied the lackenby transform method to the lng ship for the first time this led to a transformation of the hull shape by changing the sectional area curve of the ship harries and abt 1998 conducted an in depth study on a proposed method that consisted of a parametric curve and a surface based on the variation differential scheme since then harries 2001 2004 abt et al 2001 and valdenazzi et al 2002 have developed the commercial modeling software friendship now caeses and have performed parametric modeling as well as shape deformation modeling of various ships the resistance and sea keeping performance of these ships were predicted based on the panel method and the 2 d strip method optimizations of the hull shapes were conducted according to the studies above and produced good results han et al 2012 carried out global shape optimization of an ultra large container ship and the fore body hull form optimization of an lpg carrier using an f spline based optimization procedure verified by model testing the total resistance of the optimal lng carrier was decreased by 5 7 and the peak of the bow waves was reduced with the development of computer hardware and computational fluid dynamics cfd a new design method that combines the viscous cfd method with optimization technology has been gradually rising in popularity the new design method simulation based design sbd is a multi disciplinary globally oriented design pattern that is rigorously supported by mathematics the viscous cfd method evaluates the hydrodynamic performance of the target ship thus the target ship is optimized within a given constraint by using geometric reconstruction and optimization technology to obtain the optimal hull shape tahara 1998 applied the rans solver to optimize the hull form of a tanker peri et al 2001 and campana et al 2002 applied the bezier patch method on the optimization of a bulbous bow taking the amplitude of the bow wave and the total resistance as optimization objectives a series of traditional optimization methods were used to optimize the model and the results were verified by model testing optimization modeling determined that the total resistance could be reduced by 3 and the amplitude of the bow wave could be reduced by 71 peri and campana 2003 2005 tahara et al 2008 and campana et al 2004 2009a optimized a scale model of a dtmb5415 ship with the optimization objectives of reducing the wave making resistance improving the sea keeping performance i e reducing the heave and the peak of the pitch angle and increasing the quality of the wake field studies on the variable fidelity surrogate model multi objective global optimization algorithm bezier patch method and cad based geometric reconstruction method were carried out in detail the optimization results were verified by model testing the results showed that the total resistance of the optimal ship could be decreased by 5 23 while the wave making resistance and the quality of the wake flow field were improved campana et al 2006 conducted geometric reconstruction of a bulbous bow using the non nuiform rational b spline nurbs surface modeling method and the hydrodynamic performance of the bulbous bow was obtained by solving rans equations the bulbous bow was optimized and the ideal result was obtained kim et al 2010 optimized the series 60 model using a geometric reconstruction method combined with the lackenby method and the radial basis function rbf the results showed that a better resistance reduction effect was obtained by applying the blending geometric reconstruction method in order to minimize the computation cost while maintaining adequate optimization and accuracy scientists have also researched optimization strategies for example by using a surrogate model to improve optimization algorithms peri and campana 2006 and tahara et al 2008 applied the multi objective genetic algorithm moga and a hybrid algorithm combing particle swarm optimization pso and the diagonal rectangular algorithm for global optimization drago for the optimization of a high speed catamaran a single target resistance at one sailing speed a weighted single target weighted resistance at three different sailing speeds and multiple targets resistance and sea keeping performance were set as the optimization objectives the free form deformation ffd method and the cad based method were used for geometric reconstruction of the hull the results showed that the resistance heave peak and roll peak of the optimal design were reduced by 9 3 50 5 and 27 4 respectively pino et al 2007 proposed the deterministic particle swarm optimization dpso algorithm on the basis of the pso algorithm the results showed that the new algorithm could achieve better optimization results peri et al 2008 2009 analyzed the impact of a surrogate model on calculation accuracy and time cost they determined that using a surrogate model could greatly reduce the time cost of optimization while still ensuring the accuracy of the optimization results thus the trade off between the accuracy and efficiency of optimization could be well balanced campana et al 2009b proposed the deterministic derivative free particle swarm optimization ddfpso to solve multi objective global optimization and the algorithm was tested by standard functions the results showed that the improved algorithm could reach the global optimal solution more efficiently and accurately diez et al 2010 presented a quantitative uncertainty method for the ship design process by applying the bayes theory the conventional multidisciplinary design optimization mdo model and the mdo model based on robust design were established to address fin keel optimization lee et al 2016 used the kriging surrogate model and the genetic algorithm to optimize the aerodynamic performance of the wing sails the shape of the wing sails and the working conditions were selected as optimization objectives the results showed that the thrust performance of the optimal design was improved by 14 22 at all wind angles as discussed above a great deal of research has been carried out on geometric hull reconstruction hydrodynamic performance prediction optimization algorithms and surrogate models although the cfd method can produce more accurate prediction values and better capture flow field detail the time cost is much larger than that of the potential flow method constructing a surrogate model with sufficient accuracy using as few samples as possible has yet to be studied support vector regression svr is a regression algorithm derived from support vector machines svm svr is suitable for small training sets because only a few support vectors are needed moreover the inner product is calculated by using a kernel function in svr instead of by linear mapping to high dimensional space thus avoiding complications associated with the multiple design variables that are required when dimensionality is introduced therefore svr is suitable for the construction of a surrogate model in ship design optimization in this study multi objective optimization of an offshore aquaculture vessel hull form was conducted nine design variables were employed to modify the shape of the vessel decreasing the resistance and minimizing the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake flow were chosen as the optimization objectives during the optimization procedure model tests of the original hull were conducted to evaluate hydrodynamic performance and a rans solver was then applied for the numerical analysis the accuracy of the numerical calculation was verified by comparing the numerical results to the experimental results then an optimization framework integrating the lhs the ffd method the surrogate model and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii was developed the svr based surrogate model was then built and optimized to verify the impact of the sample set scale on the prediction precision surrogate models with different numbers of sample points were also built and compared through multi objective optimization the optimum solution of the hull shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions finally model tests of the optimal hull were performed and the optimization results were validated via comparison to the model test results 2 experiment methodology 2 1 target ship the target ship was the vessel hull of an offshore aquaculture vessel with the scale ratio of 1 80 the principal dimensions of the original hull for both the ship and the scale model are shown in table 1 the model used in the experiment is shown in fig 1 the lines plan of the offshore aquaculture platform is depicted in fig 2 2 2 test devices model tests were carried out in the circulating water channel cwc at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the test section of the channel was 8 0 m length 3 0 m width 1 6 m water depth to compensate for velocity loss induced by the boundary layer a surface flow acceleration device was equipped upstream of the test section the test section is shown in fig 3 the velocity of the cwc was also calibrated as shown in fig 4 a slice was set 2 2 m away from the inlet of the test section a grid of 240 control points was imposed on the slice with an interval of 100 mm in the z direction ranging from 100 to 1400 mm and an interval of 200 mm in the y direction ranging from 1400 to 1400 mm the speed of the inlet flow was set to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s and the velocities of the 240 control points were measured to estimate the flow field of the cwc test section at the three different inlet speeds to observe the change of the velocities more directly the velocity ratio v which can be calculated by equation 1 was employed in the equation v t represents the measured velocity while v s represents the predetermined velocity of the cwc the contours of the velocity ratios at different inlet speeds are illustrated in fig 5 1 v v t v s as can be seen from fig 5 the velocity distributions at three inlet speeds represented a similar status the velocities were always slightly smaller than the predetermined speeds at most areas and the velocities of the middle areas were smaller than the areas close to the free surface and the bottom of the cwc moreover the velocities changed little in the y direction and a small quantity of low velocity zones appeared only in the small areas near the wall of the cwc above all velocity distributions of the slice were uniform at different inlet speeds the standard deviations for the velocity ratios at different speeds were calculated by equation 2 and listed in table 2 in equation 2 v i represents the measured velocity ratio and v represents the mean velocity ratio equal to 1 of all the measured points as can be seen the standard deviation decreased with increasing predetermined speed and the standard deviations were smaller than 1 3 at all speeds 2 σ 1 n i 1 n v i v 2 the resistance was measured by a single component resistance dynamometer whose measuring gauge was 50 n the velocity distribution of the wake field was measured by applying the traversing system and an sv 3w propeller type current meter with a limit bias of 0 01 m s the measuring devices are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 2 3 resistance test a fixed model was adopted in the model tests the model velocity was specified by the inlet speed of the circulating water channel resistances at 11 different speeds were measured and the speeds were converted from the sailing speeds of the actual ship using equation 3 3 v m v s λ since the main concern was the hydrodynamic performance at the design speed the uncertainty estimate for the resistance measurement at the design speed was carried out the model hull was ballasted to its displacement mass which was determined by its nominal displacement volume and the mass density of the cwc water 26 3 c the model was measured to be 236 90 kg with a limit bias of 0 05 kg the standard uncertainty of the displacement mass was u δ 0 005 3 kg 0 029 kg then u δ 0 029 236 90 0 012 the relative standard uncertainty of the resistance was estimated as 4 u 1 r t 2 3 u δ 0 008 as mentioned in section 2 2 the bias limit of the cwc was within 1 3 the relative standard uncertainty under the assumption of normal distribution was 5 u v 1 3 1 3 0 433 and the relative standard uncertainty of resistance was 6 u 4 r t 2 u v 0 867 the dynamometer for resistance was also calibrated ten loads ranging from 0 kgf to 4 5 kgf with intervals of 0 5 kgf were implemented by weights and applied four times the measured voltages are shown in fig 8 by linear regression the fitting curve for the predicting force is 7 f u 0 5101 where f is the force and u is the measured voltage the standard deviation is see 0 00052 kgf and the standard uncertainty for resistance measurement is 8 u 2 r t 0 00052 kgf the resistance measured at the design speed was 0 208 kgf and the relative standard uncertainty corresponding to the calibration component was approximately 0 250 the bias limit of the thermometer was 0 1 the standard uncertainty for the readings of the thermometer is 9 u t 0 1 2 3 2 0 2 3 2 0 073 for water at 26 3 c a temperature deviation of 0 073 c will lead to a change of u v 0 16 in the water kinematic viscosity the corresponding component of uncertainty in resistance is 10 u 3 r t c f c t 0 87 log 10 re 2 u v 0 027 the resistance test was repeated nine times at the design speed the corresponding component of uncertainty is 11 u a m e a n s t d e v n r m e a n 0 243 u a single s t d e v r m e a n 0 729 where stdev represents the standard deviation the combination of uncertainty components of the resistance measurement is summarized in table 3 the measured resistances of the model hull at design speed can be expressed as 12 r t r t m e a n 1 2 u c m e a n 2 4 wake flow measurement the velocity distribution of the wake field was measured at the design speed velocity 0 575 m s to obtain the velocity distribution velocities of all 120 points located on the paddle disk were measured the measurement points were distributed evenly in the radial direction at an interval of 0 1 relative to the diameter of the propeller d from 0 2d to 1 1d and spaced evenly around the circumference at a circumferential interval of 30 a diagram of the measurement point locations relative to each other is shown in fig 9 uncertainty estimation for the velocity measurement was also carried out the measurement point was located at the z axis of fig 4 the distance between the measurement point and the free surface was 200 mm the bias limit of the current meter was 0 01 m s compared to the velocity of 0 575 m s the uncertainty component was 1 739 the position of the current meter was controlled by a servo motor and leading screw with a limit bias of 0 1 mm compared with 200 mm the relative error was 0 05 and its effect was negligible for water at 26 3 c a temperature deviation of 0 2 c will lead to a 0 002 change of the density the effect of which is negligible the velocity was measured six times the corresponding component of uncertainty was 13 u m e a n s t d e v n v m e a n 0 086 u single s t d e v v m e a n 0 211 where stdev represents the standard deviation and v mean represents the mean measured velocity the combination of the uncertainty components of the mean velocity was 1 732 3 numerical setup 3 1 cfd solver as mentioned earlier numerical simulations were also conducted for the 1 80 scale model with a froude number ranging from 0 0525 to 0 1574 the finite volume method fvm commercial software star ccm was applied for numerical simulations in this study governing equations of the incompressible viscous flow were described by the three dimensional rans equations and continuity equations the linear pressure strain reynolds stress turbulence model was applied to close the set of equations 3 2 domain and boundary conditions a numerical model of the original hull is shown in fig 10 because the design speed of the offshore aquaculture vessel was low enough the free surface could be neglected thus a double model method was used for numerical simulations to reduce the computation time due to the symmetrical geometry only half of the hull was modeled the free surface was treated as a symmetry plane and the hull above the still water surface was ignored in order to be consistent with experiment conditions the height i e water depth and width of the computation domain were set to 1 6 m and 1 5 m respectively the same size as the cwc s test section to make sure that the wake field was fully developed the length of the computation domain was set to 25 m which was slightly over three times the length of the test section of the cwc the boundary conditions were specified as follows a no slip condition was imposed on the hull surface a slip condition was applied to the bottom and the side boundaries a symmetry condition was used for the center plane of the hull and the top boundary the flow velocity of the inlet boundary was set to match the flow rate of the experiment and atmospheric pressure was applied at the outlet detailed dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 11 3 3 mesh generation and sensitivity study the unstructured mesh model trimmer was applied in this study with a boundary layer that was refined using prism elements sixteen layers of prism mesh were generated with a growth ratio of 1 05 because a large velocity gradient was observed in the wall normal direction since the size of the mesh attached to the surface has a significant influence on the computational accuracy a mesh sensitivity study was also carried out at the design speed with the froude number of 0 1049 both the surface mesh size of the hull and the non dimensional distance of the first prism element center y were analyzed two y values 0 8 and 1 0 are discussed in this study using the length overall l oa as the reference length four different mesh solutions for each y were tested based on different surface mesh sizes ranging from 0 018 l oa to 0 024 l oa at an interval of 0 002 l oa the calculated resistance coefficients are summarized in fig 12 and the experimental resistance coefficient was determined in order to evaluate the numerical precision the results demonstrated that a smaller surface mesh size always returned results with better accuracy calculated results in which y 1 0 were more precise than that those in which y 0 8 but the difference was smaller than 0 1 moreover for the mesh with y 1 0 there was no obvious improvement of the calculated precision when the surface mesh size varied from 0 018 l oa to 0 020 l oa therefore a surface mesh size of 0 02 l oa with a y 1 0 was selected for the following numerical calculations the total elements number was 2 85 106 and detailed mesh conditions are shown in fig 13 3 4 accuracy validation of cfd simulation the accuracy of the cfd simulations was validated by comparing the simulated results to the experimental results the simulated friction coefficients c fm were also compared with the results calculated by the 1957 ittc equations the results are illustrated in fig 14 as can be seen the predicted resistance coefficients c tm were slightly larger than the experimental results considering froude numbers less than 0 0839 the maximum error was 6 79 when the froude number was 0 0630 since the impact of the free surface becomes more significant as the froude number increases the prediction precision based on the double model method gradually declined the maximum error was 12 01 with the froude number of 0 1574 and the prediction error was 4 94 at the design speed the predicted friction coefficients c fm were quite close to the experimental results when the froude number was less than 0 0839 the maximum absolute error was 1 63 when the froude number was 0 0525 with increasing froude number the prediction error became larger but did not change sharply the maximum error was 6 76 with a froude number of 0 1156 the velocity distribution of the wake field at the design speed was also determined for both the experiment and the cfd simulation a comparison of the velocity distributions is illustrated in fig 15 as can be seen the velocity distributions obtained by the two methods were quite similar in most areas so fig 15 demonstrates the accuracy of the cfd prediction as a result cfd simulation results could be used for optimization 4 optimization formulation in this study nine different design variables were employed to modify the hull of the offshore aquaculture vessel the upper and lower bounds of each design variable were determined considering geometric feasibility and the requirements of engineering applications based on the design of experiment doe theory sample points were selected within the constraints by using the ffd method the hull was transformed into various shapes according to the design variables of the different sample points the hydrodynamic performance of each deformed hull was estimated through cfd simulation after hydrodynamic performances were predicted the svr based surrogate model could be built the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified by a cross validation method and the coefficient of determination r2 was chosen as the criterion to optimize the surrogate model the nsgaii was applied as a multi objective optimization algorithm using the optimized surrogate model numerical solutions were obtained from the optimal surrogate model instead of from direct numerical calculation thus significantly decreasing the amount of time required to run the optimization process without sacrificing precision the pareto optimal solutions were obtained through optimization calculations and a flow chart of the optimization process is illustrated in fig 16 4 1 optimization objectives the optimization process utilized in this study focused primarily on the rapidity of the offshore aquaculture vessel and the rapidity mainly consists of the resistance performance and the propulsion performance for most fat ships the resistance performance is negatively related to the propulsion performance and the propulsion performance is usually easier to improve to quantify the performances the resistance and the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field were selected the factor r r o p t r o r g was selected as the first optimization objective to reflect the resistance change where r o p t and r o r g represent the resistance of the optimized hull and the resistance of the original hull respectively the circumferential nonuniformity coefficient of the wake field was applied to quantify the wake field quality in this study a polar coordinate system was established at the paddle disk center in order to determine the measurement point positions on the paddle disk the propeller shaft was defined as the point of origin the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field was specified as follows 14 w f i 2 n 1 m j 1 m v x i j v x i 2 i 2 3 11 j 1 90 m 90 n 10 where i represents the radius r ranging from 0 2r to 1 1r at the interval of 0 1r and j represents the angle ranging from 4 to 360 with an interval of 4 v x i j represents the axial dimensionless velocity located on the ith radius and jth angle of the paddle disk v x i represents the mean axial dimensionless velocity of the ith radius because the measurement points did not always overlap with the grid nodes the bilinear interpolation method was applied to evaluate the velocity at the measurement points interpolation was first carried out in the y direction port direction to obtain the function value of p x y fig 17 15 f r 1 y 2 y y 2 y 1 f q 11 y y 1 y 2 y 1 f q 21 r 1 y z 1 f r 2 y 2 y y 2 y 1 f q 12 y y 1 y 2 y 1 f q 22 r 2 y z 2 interpolation was then carried out in the z direction up direction 16 f p z 2 z z 2 z 1 f r 1 z z 1 z 2 z 1 f r 2 the factor w w o p t w o r g was selected as the second optimization objective to reflect a change in the wake field quality where w o p t and w o r g represent the wake field circumferential nonuniformity of the optimized hull and the original hull respectively 4 2 geometric reconstruction method the ffd method presented by sederberg and parry 1986 was applied to transform the shape of the hull in this study the ffd method involves mapping from the real geometry onto the deformation space through a bernstein polynomial and the method can be applied to any solid modeling system using the ffd method the object was embedded in a local coordinate system on a parallelepiped region any point x x y z in the cartesian coordinate system could then be expressed by equations 17 and 18 in the local coordinate system s t u 17 x x 0 s s t t u u 18 s t u x x 0 t u s t s u x x 0 s u t u s t x x 0 s t u a grid of control points q i j k was then imposed on the parallelepiped region allowing several planes to be formed and inserted into the parallelepiped region l 1 planes in the s direction m 1 planes in the t direction and n 1 planes in the u direction in fig 18 l 1 m 2 and n 3 the control points form a lattice and are indicated by yellow balls with their locations expressed by 19 q i j k x 0 i l s j m t k n u deformation was achieved by moving the control points from their primary lattice positions the deformed position of point x can be presented as 20 x s t u i 0 l j 0 m k 0 n b i l s b j m t b k n u q i j k where 21 b i l s l i l i s i 1 s l i b j m t m j m j t j 1 t m j b k n u n k n k u k 1 u n k 4 3 design of experiment the doe method provided a reasonable and effective way to select sample points in doe theory design variables are called factors and their values are called levels optimal latin hypercube sampling opt lhs was adopted as the doe method in this study opt lhs was developed on the basis of lhs as presented by mckay et al 1979 for n factors x k k 1 n the coordinate interval of each factor x k min x k max k 1 n was equally divided into m levels and each level was denoted as x k i 1 x k i i 1 m design variable values of each sample point were randomly selected for n times from the levels and each level of one factor could be chosen only once although applying lhs could fill the entire design space its randomness could lead to an uneven distribution of the sample points the use of opt lhs improved the randomness of lhs and the selection of the sample points was more uniform thus the fitting of the factors and the responses was more accurate 4 4 svr based surrogate model the support vector regression svr is a regression algorithm based on the support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 for a given set of sample points t t x 1 y 1 x l y l χ γ l and x i χ r n y i γ r i 1 l by importing a constant value ε to all the y values of the sample points the negative set and positive set were defined as d and d as follows 22 d x i y i ε i 1 l d x i y i ε i 1 l the regression problem could then be converted to the following classification problem which could then be applied to the svm 23 min w r n b r 1 2 w 2 s t w x i b y i ε i 1 l to deal with numerical noise a slack variable ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ l ξ

represents the lagrangian multiplier of the positive classification and α i represents the lagrangian multiplier of the negative classification to deal with non linearity a kernel function k x i x j was applied to map the original problem to a linear separable space and equation 25 was written as 26 min w r n b r 1 2 i j 1 l α i α i α j α j k x i x j ε i 1 l α i α i i 1 l y i α i α i s t i 1 l α

optimization algorithm the nsgaii deb 2001 was applied as the optimization algorithm in this study to solve multi object optimization problems to improve efficiency nsgaii introduced fast non dominated sorting individual crowing distance and elite strategy the subgroups were obtained by crossover and mutation of the current parent group and then the two groups were merged into a population in the target space objective function vectors of different individuals were pairwise compared according to the pareto optimal relationship and all the individuals were divided into multiple frontiers that were sequentially controlled the qualities of the individuals in different pareto front layers were differentiated by evaluating the superiority of the pareto front the qualities of the individuals in the same pareto front layer were differentiated by crowing distance 5 optimization of the offshore aquaculture vessel hull form 5 1 hull transformation 5 1 1 geometric reconstruction of the hull the commercial software caeses was used for geometric reconstruction of the hull three parallelepiped regions were built at the stern the aft body and the stem of the hull four sets of control points were selected for the transformation since the shape of the aft body had a significant impact on the resistance and wake flow field two sets of control points were allocated to modify the shape with more accuracy additionally one set of control points was allocated for the deformation of the stern and one set of control points was allocated for the deformation of the stem the four sets of control points are shown in fig 19 as yellow circles 5 1 2 design variables and constraints displacements of the control points were defined as the design variables nine design variables were employed in this study the control point set of the stem moved along the x and y direction to modify the gradient and the width of the bow the displacements were specified as the design variables x and y the control point set of the stern moved along z direction to modify the shape of the stern and the distance between the stern transform plate and the free surface the displacement was specified as the design variable z the two control point sets of the aft body moved along the x y and z directions at a mutually independent value to modify the uv degree of the aft body the displacements of the two control point sets were specified by the design variables x 1 y 1 z 1 and x 2 y 2 z 2 the upper and lower bounds of the design variables were determined with geometric feasibility in mind to meet the requirements of engineering applications the absolute variations of the displacement and the wetted surface were limited to be within 1 constraints on the variables are listed in table 4 5 2 svr based surrogate model after the optimization objectives were selected an svr based surrogate model was established while the k fold cross validation was applied to estimate the accuracy of the surrogate model the initial set of sample points was divided into k subsets the k 1 subsets were used to build a new surrogate model and the independent subset was reserved for the validation of the newly built model by repeating cross validation for k times each subset was validated once a 10 fold cross validation k 10 was adopted in this study the coefficient of determination specified as equation 28 was then applied to estimate accuracy 28 r s q u a r e 1 i 1 l y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 l y i y i 2 where y i is the original value of sample point i y ˆ i is the predicted value of sample point i and y i is the mean value of the original data to determine how the number of sample points influenced the prediction accuracy three surrogate models were built and optimized the surrogate models contained 60 120 and 300 sample points the coefficients of determination for both r and w of each optimal surrogate model were calculated and compared and the mean relative errors specified in equation 29 were also compared to strengthen the validation the results are listed in table 5 29 m e a n r e l a t i v e e r r o r i 1 l y i y ˆ i y i l 100 as shown in table 5 there was little difference in prediction precision between the three surrogate models the mean relative errors of the first surrogate model were only 0 608 and 0 329 for w and r respectively and the coefficients of determination were 0 991 and 0 945 respectively the svr based surrogate model could achieve enough accuracy with a small number of sample points therefore the svr based surrogate model with 60 sample points was applied to replace direct numerical calculations for the following optimization steps 5 3 multi objective optimization and pareto optimal solutions based on the surrogate models nsgaii was applied for the multi objective optimization with a population size of 60 and a maximum generation of 100 the pareto front shown in fig 20 indicated a trade off relationship between the two optimization objectives where the w values decreased as the r values increased twenty non dominated individuals were selected to form the pareto optimal solutions the optimal designs are listed in table 6 direct numerical simulation was used to verify the optimization objectives r and w of the optimal solutions the relative errors of r and w are listed in fig 21 the maximum relative errors of r and w were 0 51 and 0 93 respectively thus the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified again furthermore all constraints of the pareto optimal solutions could satisfy the requirements fig 22 variation trends of the nine design variables are shown in fig 23 for all the pareto optimal solutions x y and y 2 remained at the lower bound while x 2 and z 2 remained at the upper bound by decreasing x y and y 2 and increasing x 2 and z 2 both the resistance and the quality of the wake field were improved the design variables x 1 and y 1 also remained at the lower bound except in the 19th and 20th pareto optimal solution however the numerical simulations from these two solutions showed that such changes could lead to a slight deterioration of the two objectives different from the other design variables in this study z and z 1 changed sequentially when z and z 1 decreased the aft body varied from v type to u type leading to a more uniform wake field and higher resistance the resistance reduction gained from the 20 pareto optimal solutions was rather small with a maximum resistance reduction of only 2 68 the improvement of the wake field however reached up to 13 91 based on the analysis above the 18th pareto optimal solution was selected as the optimal hull the body plan of the optimal hull is illustrated and compared with the original hull in fig 24 5 4 experiment validation of the optimal hull model tests of the optimal hull were carried out in the circulating water channel at sjtu to verify its performance a comparison of the resistance at different froude numbers fig 25 showed that the resistance performance of the optimal hull was better than the original hull at all froude numbers the maximum achievable resistance reduction ratio was 2 85 and the resistance reduction ratio at the design speed was 1 59 the velocity distribution of the wake field at the design speed was also measured as shown in fig 26 the velocity distribution of the optimal hull appeared to shrink and change to a ring like arrangement using equation 14 the circumferential nonuniformity of the optimal hull w opt was calculated to be 1 230 compared to the original hull w org which was calculated to be 1 497 this led to a nonuniformity reduction of 17 8 thus both the resistance performance and the quality of the wake field were improved and the optimization result was validated through model testing 6 conclusion in this study an optimization process was conducted to solve the multi objective optimization problem for the hull form of an offshore aquaculture vessel a rans solver was applied for the numerical analysis of the resistance and the wake field and the validity of the numerical method was demonstrated by comparing numerical results of the original shape with the experimental results from model testing nine design variables were employed for the transformation of the hull the svr based surrogate model was built and optimized to estimate the resistance and the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field the accuracy of the svr surrogate model was also analyzed with a varying number of sampling points an optimization framework using lhs ffd method svr surrogate model and nsgaii was developed to search for the pareto optimal solutions multi objective optimization was performed for the offshore aquaculture vessel s hull form and the optimal shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions the optimization was then validated by model testing the following conclusions were reached 1 a surrogate model based on svr provided sufficient precision the surrogate model could be used to predict hydrodynamic performance instead of performing direct numerical simulations 2 reducing the number of sample points did not significantly impact the accuracy of the surrogate model the svr surrogate model was more applicable to the optimization problems with expansive computational costs 3 the resistance performance was negatively correlated with the quality of the wake field while the shape of the aft body varied from a v shape to a u shape the change of the wake field was much more significant than that of the resistance 4 the resistance performance of the optimal hull improved at all sailing speeds and the wake field was more uniform thus achieving both improvement objectives after optimization it should be noted however that while the velocity distribution of the wake field was analyzed to determine the propulsive performance of the offshore aquaculture vessel the mutual interference between the hull and the propeller has yet to be studied further work should focus on propulsive performance optimization by considering the interaction between the propeller and the hull acknowledgements this

23114,the shape of a ship s hull has a significant impact on the resistance and propulsive performance of the ship especially for wide ships in this study experimental and numerical analyses of an offshore aquaculture vessel were carried out while multidisciplinary design optimization aimed to improve the resistance performance and the wake field quality of the vessel numerical analysis was performed using a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver and the numerical method was validated by comparing the numerical results from the original shape to the experimental results three support vector regression svr based surrogate models with different numbers of sample points were built and the influence of the sample set size on the prediction precision was determined an svr surrogate model with 60 sample points was applied and optimized to replace direct numerical simulations an optimization framework using latin hypercube sampling lhs the free form deformation ffd method the svr surrogate model and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii was developed nine design variables were employed to modify the shape of the vessel because of the trade off between the minimum resistance and the minimum circumferential nonuniformity of the wake flow the optimal solution of the hull shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions to balance the two

terrigenous pollution and disease and is suitable for deep sea aquaculture among marine power strategies deep sea aquaculture equipment may experience significant development as a more efficient and greener mode of performing aquaculture designing an offshore aquaculture platform could offer great value to china s deep sea aquaculture equipment industry profoundly impact the overcapacity in the shipbuilding industry and improve deep sea aquaculture equipment however the hull form design of a platform is complex and involves a large number of design variables complicated constraints and multiple objectives and thus it is difficult to determine a globally optimal hull form traditionaldesign method is mainly based on the shape of the parent vessel the hull form is modified to satisfy design objectives on a per use basis and theperformance is optimized and verified by model testing however traditional optimization methods are expensive and time consuming relying too heavily on the form of the parent vessel model testing and employment of experienced engineers therefore it is necessary to find a time and cost effective optimization method for hull form design in the 1970s optimization theory was introduced into the field of ship design during this time ship optimization research focused mainly on the expression of hull geometry and numerical calculation hsiung 1972 introduced a set of tent functions to approximate the ship hull function by introducing the functions the michell integral for wave resistance was reduced to a standard quadratic form the quadratic programming techniques were applied to minimize the wave resistance three optimal forms were chosen and validated by model tests it was found that the wave resistance of the ship was reduced significantly after optimization huan and huang 1998 optimized the wave making resistance by applying a highly efficient gradient based optimization method combined with the potential flow method suzuki and iokamori 1999 proposed an elliptical panel arrangement of the free surface panels and the improved dawson type solver was used to report the wave making resistance of the ship a weight function was introduced to present the hull as a smooth surface by means of sequential quadratic programming optimization of the htc container ship was carried out to minimize the wave making resistance and showed good performance harries 1998 applied the lackenby transform method to the lng ship for the first time this led to a transformation of the hull shape by changing the sectional area curve of the ship harries and abt 1998 conducted an in depth study on a proposed method that consisted of a parametric curve and a surface based on the variation differential scheme since then harries 2001 2004 abt et al 2001 and valdenazzi et al 2002 have developed the commercial modeling software friendship now caeses and have performed parametric modeling as well as shape deformation modeling of various ships the resistance and sea keeping performance of these ships were predicted based on the panel method and the 2 d strip method optimizations of the hull shapes were conducted according to the studies above and produced good results han et al 2012 carried out global shape optimization of an ultra large container ship and the fore body hull form optimization of an lpg carrier using an f spline based optimization procedure verified by model testing the total resistance of the optimal lng carrier was decreased by 5 7 and the peak of the bow waves was reduced with the development of computer hardware and computational fluid dynamics cfd a new design method that combines the viscous cfd method with optimization technology has been gradually rising in popularity the new design method simulation based design sbd is a multi disciplinary globally oriented design pattern that is rigorously supported by mathematics the viscous cfd method evaluates the hydrodynamic performance of the target ship thus the target ship is optimized within a given constraint by using geometric reconstruction and optimization technology to obtain the optimal hull shape tahara 1998 applied the rans solver to optimize the hull form of a tanker peri et al 2001 and campana et al 2002 applied the bezier patch method on the optimization of a bulbous bow taking the amplitude of the bow wave and the total resistance as optimization objectives a series of traditional optimization methods were used to optimize the model and the results were verified by model testing optimization modeling determined that the total resistance could be reduced by 3 and the amplitude of the bow wave could be reduced by 71 peri and campana 2003 2005 tahara et al 2008 and campana et al 2004 2009a optimized a scale model of a dtmb5415 ship with the optimization objectives of reducing the wave making resistance improving the sea keeping performance i e reducing the heave and the peak of the pitch angle and increasing the quality of the wake field studies on the variable fidelity surrogate model multi objective global optimization algorithm bezier patch method and cad based geometric reconstruction method were carried out in detail the optimization results were verified by model testing the results showed that the total resistance of the optimal ship could be decreased by 5 23 while the wave making resistance and the quality of the wake flow field were improved campana et al 2006 conducted geometric reconstruction of a bulbous bow using the non nuiform rational b spline nurbs surface modeling method and the hydrodynamic performance of the bulbous bow was obtained by solving rans equations the bulbous bow was optimized and the ideal result was obtained kim et al 2010 optimized the series 60 model using a geometric reconstruction method combined with the lackenby method and the radial basis function rbf the results showed that a better resistance reduction effect was obtained by applying the blending geometric reconstruction method in order to minimize the computation cost while maintaining adequate optimization and accuracy scientists have also researched optimization strategies for example by using a surrogate model to improve optimization algorithms peri and campana 2006 and tahara et al 2008 applied the multi objective genetic algorithm moga and a hybrid algorithm combing particle swarm optimization pso and the diagonal rectangular algorithm for global optimization drago for the optimization of a high speed catamaran a single target resistance at one sailing speed a weighted single target weighted resistance at three different sailing speeds and multiple targets resistance and sea keeping performance were set as the optimization objectives the free form deformation ffd method and the cad based method were used for geometric reconstruction of the hull the results showed that the resistance heave peak and roll peak of the optimal design were reduced by 9 3 50 5 and 27 4 respectively pino et al 2007 proposed the deterministic particle swarm optimization dpso algorithm on the basis of the pso algorithm the results showed that the new algorithm could achieve better optimization results peri et al 2008 2009 analyzed the impact of a surrogate model on calculation accuracy and time cost they determined that using a surrogate model could greatly reduce the time cost of optimization while still ensuring the accuracy of the optimization results thus the trade off between the accuracy and efficiency of optimization could be well balanced campana et al 2009b proposed the deterministic derivative free particle swarm optimization ddfpso to solve multi objective global optimization and the algorithm was tested by standard functions the results showed that the improved algorithm could reach the global optimal solution more efficiently and accurately diez et al 2010 presented a quantitative uncertainty method for the ship design process by applying the bayes theory the conventional multidisciplinary design optimization mdo model and the mdo model based on robust design were established to address fin keel optimization lee et al 2016 used the kriging surrogate model and the genetic algorithm to optimize the aerodynamic performance of the wing sails the shape of the wing sails and the working conditions were selected as optimization objectives the results showed that the thrust performance of the optimal design was improved by 14 22 at all wind angles as discussed above a great deal of research has been carried out on geometric hull reconstruction hydrodynamic performance prediction optimization algorithms and surrogate models although the cfd method can produce more accurate prediction values and better capture flow field detail the time cost is much larger than that of the potential flow method constructing a surrogate model with sufficient accuracy using as few samples as possible has yet to be studied support vector regression svr is a regression algorithm derived from support vector machines svm svr is suitable for small training sets because only a few support vectors are needed moreover the inner product is calculated by using a kernel function in svr instead of by linear mapping to high dimensional space thus avoiding complications associated with the multiple design variables that are required when dimensionality is introduced therefore svr is suitable for the construction of a surrogate model in ship design optimization in this study multi objective optimization of an offshore aquaculture vessel hull form was conducted nine design variables were employed to modify the shape of the vessel decreasing the resistance and minimizing the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake flow were chosen as the optimization objectives during the optimization procedure model tests of the original hull were conducted to evaluate hydrodynamic performance and a rans solver was then applied for the numerical analysis the accuracy of the numerical calculation was verified by comparing the numerical results to the experimental results then an optimization framework integrating the lhs the ffd method the surrogate model and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsgaii was developed the svr based surrogate model was then built and optimized to verify the impact of the sample set scale on the prediction precision surrogate models with different numbers of sample points were also built and compared through multi objective optimization the optimum solution of the hull shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions finally model tests of the optimal hull were performed and the optimization results were validated via comparison to the model test results 2 experiment methodology 2 1 target ship the target ship was the vessel hull of an offshore aquaculture vessel with the scale ratio of 1 80 the principal dimensions of the original hull for both the ship and the scale model are shown in table 1 the model used in the experiment is shown in fig 1 the lines plan of the offshore aquaculture platform is depicted in fig 2 2 2 test devices model tests were carried out in the circulating water channel cwc at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the test section of the channel was 8 0 m length 3 0 m width 1 6 m water depth to compensate for velocity loss induced by the boundary layer a surface flow acceleration device was equipped upstream of the test section the test section is shown in fig 3 the velocity of the cwc was also calibrated as shown in fig 4 a slice was set 2 2 m away from the inlet of the test section a grid of 240 control points was imposed on the slice with an interval of 100 mm in the z direction ranging from 100 to 1400 mm and an interval of 200 mm in the y direction ranging from 1400 to 1400 mm the speed of the inlet flow was set to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m s and the velocities of the 240 control points were measured to estimate the flow field of the cwc test section at the three different inlet speeds to observe the change of the velocities more directly the velocity ratio v which can be calculated by equation 1 was employed in the equation v t represents the measured velocity while v s represents the predetermined velocity of the cwc the contours of the velocity ratios at different inlet speeds are illustrated in fig 5 1 v v t v s as can be seen from fig 5 the velocity distributions at three inlet speeds represented a similar status the velocities were always slightly smaller than the predetermined speeds at most areas and the velocities of the middle areas were smaller than the areas close to the free surface and the bottom of the cwc moreover the velocities changed little in the y direction and a small quantity of low velocity zones appeared only in the small areas near the wall of the cwc above all velocity distributions of the slice were uniform at different inlet speeds the standard deviations for the velocity ratios at different speeds were calculated by equation 2 and listed in table 2 in equation 2 v i represents the measured velocity ratio and v represents the mean velocity ratio equal to 1 of all the measured points as can be seen the standard deviation decreased with increasing predetermined speed and the standard deviations were smaller than 1 3 at all speeds 2 σ 1 n i 1 n v i v 2 the resistance was measured by a single component resistance dynamometer whose measuring gauge was 50 n the velocity distribution of the wake field was measured by applying the traversing system and an sv 3w propeller type current meter with a limit bias of 0 01 m s the measuring devices are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 2 3 resistance test a fixed model was adopted in the model tests the model velocity was specified by the inlet speed of the circulating water channel resistances at 11 different speeds were measured and the speeds were converted from the sailing speeds of the actual ship using equation 3 3 v m v s λ since the main concern was the hydrodynamic performance at the design speed the uncertainty estimate for the resistance measurement at the design speed was carried out the model hull was ballasted to its displacement mass which was determined by its nominal displacement volume and the mass density of the cwc water 26 3 c the model was measured to be 236 90 kg with a limit bias of 0 05 kg the standard uncertainty of the displacement mass was u δ 0 005 3 kg 0 029 kg then u δ 0 029 236 90 0 012 the relative standard uncertainty of the resistance was estimated as 4 u 1 r t 2 3 u δ 0 008 as mentioned in section 2 2 the bias limit of the cwc was within 1 3 the relative standard uncertainty under the assumption of normal distribution was 5 u v 1 3 1 3 0 433 and the relative standard uncertainty of resistance was 6 u 4 r t 2 u v 0 867 the dynamometer for resistance was also calibrated ten loads ranging from 0 kgf to 4 5 kgf with intervals of 0 5 kgf were implemented by weights and applied four times the measured voltages are shown in fig 8 by linear regression the fitting curve for the predicting force is 7 f u 0 5101 where f is the force and u is the measured voltage the standard deviation is see 0 00052 kgf and the standard uncertainty for resistance measurement is 8 u 2 r t 0 00052 kgf the resistance measured at the design speed was 0 208 kgf and the relative standard uncertainty corresponding to the calibration component was approximately 0 250 the bias limit of the thermometer was 0 1 the standard uncertainty for the readings of the thermometer is 9 u t 0 1 2 3 2 0 2 3 2 0 073 for water at 26 3 c a temperature deviation of 0 073 c will lead to a change of u v 0 16 in the water kinematic viscosity the corresponding component of uncertainty in resistance is 10 u 3 r t c f c t 0 87 log 10 re 2 u v 0 027 the resistance test was repeated nine times at the design speed the corresponding component of uncertainty is 11 u a m e a n s t d e v n r m e a n 0 243 u a single s t d e v r m e a n 0 729 where stdev represents the standard deviation the combination of uncertainty components of the resistance measurement is summarized in table 3 the measured resistances of the model hull at design speed can be expressed as 12 r t r t m e a n 1 2 u c m e a n 2 4 wake flow measurement the velocity distribution of the wake field was measured at the design speed velocity 0 575 m s to obtain the velocity distribution velocities of all 120 points located on the paddle disk were measured the measurement points were distributed evenly in the radial direction at an interval of 0 1 relative to the diameter of the propeller d from 0 2d to 1 1d and spaced evenly around the circumference at a circumferential interval of 30 a diagram of the measurement point locations relative to each other is shown in fig 9 uncertainty estimation for the velocity measurement was also carried out the measurement point was located at the z axis of fig 4 the distance between the measurement point and the free surface was 200 mm the bias limit of the current meter was 0 01 m s compared to the velocity of 0 575 m s the uncertainty component was 1 739 the position of the current meter was controlled by a servo motor and leading screw with a limit bias of 0 1 mm compared with 200 mm the relative error was 0 05 and its effect was negligible for water at 26 3 c a temperature deviation of 0 2 c will lead to a 0 002 change of the density the effect of which is negligible the velocity was measured six times the corresponding component of uncertainty was 13 u m e a n s t d e v n v m e a n 0 086 u single s t d e v v m e a n 0 211 where stdev represents the standard deviation and v mean represents the mean measured velocity the combination of the uncertainty components of the mean velocity was 1 732 3 numerical setup 3 1 cfd solver as mentioned earlier numerical simulations were also conducted for the 1 80 scale model with a froude number ranging from 0 0525 to 0 1574 the finite volume method fvm commercial software star ccm was applied for numerical simulations in this study governing equations of the incompressible viscous flow were described by the three dimensional rans equations and continuity equations the linear pressure strain reynolds stress turbulence model was applied to close the set of equations 3 2 domain and boundary conditions a numerical model of the original hull is shown in fig 10 because the design speed of the offshore aquaculture vessel was low enough the free surface could be neglected thus a double model method was used for numerical simulations to reduce the computation time due to the symmetrical geometry only half of the hull was modeled the free surface was treated as a symmetry plane and the hull above the still water surface was ignored in order to be consistent with experiment conditions the height i e water depth and width of the computation domain were set to 1 6 m and 1 5 m respectively the same size as the cwc s test section to make sure that the wake field was fully developed the length of the computation domain was set to 25 m which was slightly over three times the length of the test section of the cwc the boundary conditions were specified as follows a no slip condition was imposed on the hull surface a slip condition was applied to the bottom and the side boundaries a symmetry condition was used for the center plane of the hull and the top boundary the flow velocity of the inlet boundary was set to match the flow rate of the experiment and atmospheric pressure was applied at the outlet detailed dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 11 3 3 mesh generation and sensitivity study the unstructured mesh model trimmer was applied in this study with a boundary layer that was refined using prism elements sixteen layers of prism mesh were generated with a growth ratio of 1 05 because a large velocity gradient was observed in the wall normal direction since the size of the mesh attached to the surface has a significant influence on the computational accuracy a mesh sensitivity study was also carried out at the design speed with the froude number of 0 1049 both the surface mesh size of the hull and the non dimensional distance of the first prism element center y were analyzed two y values 0 8 and 1 0 are discussed in this study using the length overall l oa as the reference length four different mesh solutions for each y were tested based on different surface mesh sizes ranging from 0 018 l oa to 0 024 l oa at an interval of 0 002 l oa the calculated resistance coefficients are summarized in fig 12 and the experimental resistance coefficient was determined in order to evaluate the numerical precision the results demonstrated that a smaller surface mesh size always returned results with better accuracy calculated results in which y 1 0 were more precise than that those in which y 0 8 but the difference was smaller than 0 1 moreover for the mesh with y 1 0 there was no obvious improvement of the calculated precision when the surface mesh size varied from 0 018 l oa to 0 020 l oa therefore a surface mesh size of 0 02 l oa with a y 1 0 was selected for the following numerical calculations the total elements number was 2 85 106 and detailed mesh conditions are shown in fig 13 3 4 accuracy validation of cfd simulation the accuracy of the cfd simulations was validated by comparing the simulated results to the experimental results the simulated friction coefficients c fm were also compared with the results calculated by the 1957 ittc equations the results are illustrated in fig 14 as can be seen the predicted resistance coefficients c tm were slightly larger than the experimental results considering froude numbers less than 0 0839 the maximum error was 6 79 when the froude number was 0 0630 since the impact of the free surface becomes more significant as the froude number increases the prediction precision based on the double model method gradually declined the maximum error was 12 01 with the froude number of 0 1574 and the prediction error was 4 94 at the design speed the predicted friction coefficients c fm were quite close to the experimental results when the froude number was less than 0 0839 the maximum absolute error was 1 63 when the froude number was 0 0525 with increasing froude number the prediction error became larger but did not change sharply the maximum error was 6 76 with a froude number of 0 1156 the velocity distribution of the wake field at the design speed was also determined for both the experiment and the cfd simulation a comparison of the velocity distributions is illustrated in fig 15 as can be seen the velocity distributions obtained by the two methods were quite similar in most areas so fig 15 demonstrates the accuracy of the cfd prediction as a result cfd simulation results could be used for optimization 4 optimization formulation in this study nine different design variables were employed to modify the hull of the offshore aquaculture vessel the upper and lower bounds of each design variable were determined considering geometric feasibility and the requirements of engineering applications based on the design of experiment doe theory sample points were selected within the constraints by using the ffd method the hull was transformed into various shapes according to the design variables of the different sample points the hydrodynamic performance of each deformed hull was estimated through cfd simulation after hydrodynamic performances were predicted the svr based surrogate model could be built the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified by a cross validation method and the coefficient of determination r2 was chosen as the criterion to optimize the surrogate model the nsgaii was applied as a multi objective optimization algorithm using the optimized surrogate model numerical solutions were obtained from the optimal surrogate model instead of from direct numerical calculation thus significantly decreasing the amount of time required to run the optimization process without sacrificing precision the pareto optimal solutions were obtained through optimization calculations and a flow chart of the optimization process is illustrated in fig 16 4 1 optimization objectives the optimization process utilized in this study focused primarily on the rapidity of the offshore aquaculture vessel and the rapidity mainly consists of the resistance performance and the propulsion performance for most fat ships the resistance performance is negatively related to the propulsion performance and the propulsion performance is usually easier to improve to quantify the performances the resistance and the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field were selected the factor r r o p t r o r g was selected as the first optimization objective to reflect the resistance change where r o p t and r o r g represent the resistance of the optimized hull and the resistance of the original hull respectively the circumferential nonuniformity coefficient of the wake field was applied to quantify the wake field quality in this study a polar coordinate system was established at the paddle disk center in order to determine the measurement point positions on the paddle disk the propeller shaft was defined as the point of origin the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field was specified as follows 14 w f i 2 n 1 m j 1 m v x i j v x i 2 i 2 3 11 j 1 90 m 90 n 10 where i represents the radius r ranging from 0 2r to 1 1r at the interval of 0 1r and j represents the angle ranging from 4 to 360 with an interval of 4 v x i j represents the axial dimensionless velocity located on the ith radius and jth angle of the paddle disk v x i represents the mean axial dimensionless velocity of the ith radius because the measurement points did not always overlap with the grid nodes the bilinear interpolation method was applied to evaluate the velocity at the measurement points interpolation was first carried out in the y direction port direction to obtain the function value of p x y fig 17 15 f r 1 y 2 y y 2 y 1 f q 11 y y 1 y 2 y 1 f q 21 r 1 y z 1 f r 2 y 2 y y 2 y 1 f q 12 y y 1 y 2 y 1 f q 22 r 2 y z 2 interpolation was then carried out in the z direction up direction 16 f p z 2 z z 2 z 1 f r 1 z z 1 z 2 z 1 f r 2 the factor w w o p t w o r g was selected as the second optimization objective to reflect a change in the wake field quality where w o p t and w o r g represent the wake field circumferential nonuniformity of the optimized hull and the original hull respectively 4 2 geometric reconstruction method the ffd method presented by sederberg and parry 1986 was applied to transform the shape of the hull in this study the ffd method involves mapping from the real geometry onto the deformation space through a bernstein polynomial and the method can be applied to any solid modeling system using the ffd method the object was embedded in a local coordinate system on a parallelepiped region any point x x y z in the cartesian coordinate system could then be expressed by equations 17 and 18 in the local coordinate system s t u 17 x x 0 s s t t u u 18 s t u x x 0 t u s t s u x x 0 s u t u s t x x 0 s t u a grid of control points q i j k was then imposed on the parallelepiped region allowing several planes to be formed and inserted into the parallelepiped region l 1 planes in the s direction m 1 planes in the t direction and n 1 planes in the u direction in fig 18 l 1 m 2 and n 3 the control points form a lattice and are indicated by yellow balls with their locations expressed by 19 q i j k x 0 i l s j m t k n u deformation was achieved by moving the control points from their primary lattice positions the deformed position of point x can be presented as 20 x s t u i 0 l j 0 m k 0 n b i l s b j m t b k n u q i j k where 21 b i l s l i l i s i 1 s l i b j m t m j m j t j 1 t m j b k n u n k n k u k 1 u n k 4 3 design of experiment the doe method provided a reasonable and effective way to select sample points in doe theory design variables are called factors and their values are called levels optimal latin hypercube sampling opt lhs was adopted as the doe method in this study opt lhs was developed on the basis of lhs as presented by mckay et al 1979 for n factors x k k 1 n the coordinate interval of each factor x k min x k max k 1 n was equally divided into m levels and each level was denoted as x k i 1 x k i i 1 m design variable values of each sample point were randomly selected for n times from the levels and each level of one factor could be chosen only once although applying lhs could fill the entire design space its randomness could lead to an uneven distribution of the sample points the use of opt lhs improved the randomness of lhs and the selection of the sample points was more uniform thus the fitting of the factors and the responses was more accurate 4 4 svr based surrogate model the support vector regression svr is a regression algorithm based on the support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 for a given set of sample points t t x 1 y 1 x l y l χ γ l and x i χ r n y i γ r i 1 l by importing a constant value ε to all the y values of the sample points the negative set and positive set were defined as d and d as follows 22 d x i y i ε i 1 l d x i y i ε i 1 l the regression problem could then

optimization algorithm the nsgaii deb 2001 was applied as the optimization algorithm in this study to solve multi object optimization problems to improve efficiency nsgaii introduced fast non dominated sorting individual crowing distance and elite strategy the subgroups were obtained by crossover and mutation of the current parent group and then the two groups were merged into a population in the target space objective function vectors of different individuals were pairwise compared according to the pareto optimal relationship and all the individuals were divided into multiple frontiers that were sequentially controlled the qualities of the individuals in different pareto front layers were differentiated by evaluating the superiority of the pareto front the qualities of the individuals in the same pareto front layer were differentiated by crowing distance 5 optimization of the offshore aquaculture vessel hull form 5 1 hull transformation 5 1 1 geometric reconstruction of the hull the commercial software caeses was used for geometric reconstruction of the hull three parallelepiped regions were built at the stern the aft body and the stem of the hull four sets of control points were selected for the transformation since the shape of the aft body had a significant impact on the resistance and wake flow field two sets of control points were allocated to modify the shape with more accuracy additionally one set of control points was allocated for the deformation of the stern and one set of control points was allocated for the deformation of the stem the four sets of control points are shown in fig 19 as yellow circles 5 1 2 design variables and constraints displacements of the control points were defined as the design variables nine design variables were employed in this study the control point set of the stem moved along the x and y direction to modify the gradient and the width of the bow the displacements were specified as the design variables x and y the control point set of the stern moved along z direction to modify the shape of the stern and the distance between the stern transform plate and the free surface the displacement was specified as the design variable z the two control point sets of the aft body moved along the x y and z directions at a mutually independent value to modify the uv degree of the aft body the displacements of the two control point sets were specified by the design variables x 1 y 1 z 1 and x 2 y 2 z 2 the upper and lower bounds of the design variables were determined with geometric feasibility in mind to meet the requirements of engineering applications the absolute variations of the displacement and the wetted surface were limited to be within 1 constraints on the variables are listed in table 4 5 2 svr based surrogate model after the optimization objectives were selected an svr based surrogate model was established while the k fold cross validation was applied to estimate the accuracy of the surrogate model the initial set of sample points was divided into k subsets the k 1 subsets were used to build a new surrogate model and the independent subset was reserved for the validation of the newly built model by repeating cross validation for k times each subset was validated once a 10 fold cross validation k 10 was adopted in this study the coefficient of determination specified as equation 28 was then applied to estimate accuracy 28 r s q u a r e 1 i 1 l y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 l y i y i 2 where y i is the original value of sample point i y ˆ i is the predicted value of sample point i and y i is the mean value of the original data to determine how the number of sample points influenced the prediction accuracy three surrogate models were built and optimized the surrogate models contained 60 120 and 300 sample points the coefficients of determination for both r and w of each optimal surrogate model were calculated and compared and the mean relative errors specified in equation 29 were also compared to strengthen the validation the results are listed in table 5 29 m e a n r e l a t i v e e r r o r i 1 l y i y ˆ i y i l 100 as shown in table 5 there was little difference in prediction precision between the three surrogate models the mean relative errors of the first surrogate model were only 0 608 and 0 329 for w and r respectively and the coefficients of determination were 0 991 and 0 945 respectively the svr based surrogate model could achieve enough accuracy with a small number of sample points therefore the svr based surrogate model with 60 sample points was applied to replace direct numerical calculations for the following optimization steps 5 3 multi objective optimization and pareto optimal solutions based on the surrogate models nsgaii was applied for the multi objective optimization with a population size of 60 and a maximum generation of 100 the pareto front shown in fig 20 indicated a trade off relationship between the two optimization objectives where the w values decreased as the r values increased twenty non dominated individuals were selected to form the pareto optimal solutions the optimal designs are listed in table 6 direct numerical simulation was used to verify the optimization objectives r and w of the optimal solutions the relative errors of r and w are listed in fig 21 the maximum relative errors of r and w were 0 51 and 0 93 respectively thus the accuracy of the surrogate model was verified again furthermore all constraints of the pareto optimal solutions could satisfy the requirements fig 22 variation trends of the nine design variables are shown in fig 23 for all the pareto optimal solutions x y and y 2 remained at the lower bound while x 2 and z 2 remained at the upper bound by decreasing x y and y 2 and increasing x 2 and z 2 both the resistance and the quality of the wake field were improved the design variables x 1 and y 1 also remained at the lower bound except in the 19th and 20th pareto optimal solution however the numerical simulations from these two solutions showed that such changes could lead to a slight deterioration of the two objectives different from the other design variables in this study z and z 1 changed sequentially when z and z 1 decreased the aft body varied from v type to u type leading to a more uniform wake field and higher resistance the resistance reduction gained from the 20 pareto optimal solutions was rather small with a maximum resistance reduction of only 2 68 the improvement of the wake field however reached up to 13 91 based on the analysis above the 18th pareto optimal solution was selected as the optimal hull the body plan of the optimal hull is illustrated and compared with the original hull in fig 24 5 4 experiment validation of the optimal hull model tests of the optimal hull were carried out in the circulating water channel at sjtu to verify its performance a comparison of the resistance at different froude numbers fig 25 showed that the resistance performance of the optimal hull was better than the original hull at all froude numbers the maximum achievable resistance reduction ratio was 2 85 and the resistance reduction ratio at the design speed was 1 59 the velocity distribution of the wake field at the design speed was also measured as shown in fig 26 the velocity distribution of the optimal hull appeared to shrink and change to a ring like arrangement using equation 14 the circumferential nonuniformity of the optimal hull w opt was calculated to be 1 230 compared to the original hull w org which was calculated to be 1 497 this led to a nonuniformity reduction of 17 8 thus both the resistance performance and the quality of the wake field were improved and the optimization result was validated through model testing 6 conclusion in this study an optimization process was conducted to solve the multi objective optimization problem for the hull form of an offshore aquaculture vessel a rans solver was applied for the numerical analysis of the resistance and the wake field and the validity of the numerical method was demonstrated by comparing numerical results of the original shape with the experimental results from model testing nine design variables were employed for the transformation of the hull the svr based surrogate model was built and optimized to estimate the resistance and the circumferential nonuniformity of the wake field the accuracy of the svr surrogate model was also analyzed with a varying number of sampling points an optimization framework using lhs ffd method svr surrogate model and nsgaii was developed to search for the pareto optimal solutions multi objective optimization was performed for the offshore aquaculture vessel s hull form and the optimal shape was selected from the pareto optimal solutions the optimization was then validated by model testing the following conclusions were reached 1 a surrogate model based on svr provided sufficient precision the surrogate model could be used to predict hydrodynamic performance instead of performing direct numerical simulations 2 reducing the number of sample points did not significantly impact the accuracy of the surrogate model the svr surrogate model was more applicable to the optimization problems with expansive computational costs 3 the resistance performance was negatively correlated with the quality of the wake field while the shape of the aft body varied from a v shape to a u shape the change of the wake field was much more significant than that of the resistance 4 the resistance performance of the optimal hull improved at all sailing speeds and the wake field was more uniform thus achieving both improvement objectives after optimization it should be noted however that while the velocity distribution of the wake field was analyzed to determine the propulsive performance of the offshore aquaculture vessel the mutual interference between the hull and the propeller has yet to be studied further work should focus on propulsive performance optimization by considering the interaction between the propeller and the hull acknowledgements this
