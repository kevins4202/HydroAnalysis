9960,climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of abiotic stresses especially drought has become the major threat to cotton production worldwide due to long and intense dry spells in many cotton growing areas drought stress curtails the photosynthesis carbohydrate metabolism starch sucrose synthesis activities of several enzymes including vacuolar invertase and sucrose synthase etc which are involved in fiber development moreover drought stressed cotton plant has poor assimilate translocation towards reproductive tissues leading to poor pollen functioning reproductive failure and inferior fiber quality the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes using transgenes or qtl based molecular breeding approaches has proved effective in improving drought tolerance and fiber quality in cotton the use of plant growth regulators and mineral elements can also aid in enhancing drought stress tolerance fiber yield and quality of cotton through initiating stress response related signaling cascades although effects of drought stress in cotton are well reported but variations in fiber quality due to the drought are not well explored during the last few years progress has been observed to understand these mechanisms which are critically reviewed here this review highlights the water deficit stress induced habitual physiological and biochemical changes during the reproductive growth leading to poor development of fiber it also highlights the effect of drought stress on assimilate accumulation and portioning in reproductive tissues of cotton which finally converts into the fiber this review will help devise new research to mitigate the negative impact of global climate change on world cotton production and fiber quality keywords climate change physiological effects carbohydrate metabolism molecular mechanism fiber development 1 introduction cotton gossypium hirsutum l is considered a leading cash crop of the world with a major contribution from china the usa india pakistan and brazil meyer 2019 climate change has threatened world agriculture due to the severity of biotic and abiotic stresses major threats to cotton production in china india usa pakistan brazil and other tropical regions include less availability of irrigation water change in frequency and intensity of rainfall drought and heat spells and salinization ton 2011 cotton has an indeterminate growth habit and is vulnerable to environmental anomalies rehman and farooq 2019 being a crop of tropical and subtropical regions cotton is moderately tolerant to drought stress especially for vegetative growth but its reproductive growth is highly sensitive to drought stress wang et al 2016a iqbal et al 2017 niu et al 2018 drought is the most important abiotic stress and 20 of the global land area is facing moderate to severe drought barichivich et al 2019 which is projected to increase in the future as cotton is a crop of tropical and sub tropical climate areas which are more prone to drought stress its production is threatened by long dry spells in the future meyer 2019 to devise a strategy to minimize the effects of drought stress on fiber production cotton is a fiber crop it is necessary to understand the effect of drought on fiber development and yield typically cotton growth and development are divided into five stages with respect to irrigation requirements i e planting to emergence emergence to first square first square to first flower first flower to peak bloom and peak bloom to first boll open bauer et al 2012 at planting time irrigation is necessary for crop germination and establishment from emergence to first square drought stress has little impact on yield and even moderate drought stress is beneficial to promote root growth bauer et al 2012 zonta et al 2017 next two stages i e first square to first flower and first flower to peak bloom are the most sensitive stages to abiotic stresses especially drought and heat stress at these stages drought stress affects development of fruiting sites and cause abortion of existing fruiting structure and thus lead to reduced yield bauer et al 2012 snowden et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 zonta et al 2017 at last stage i e peak bloom to first boll open crop water requirement is reduced and moderate drought stress have relatively less effect on yield but it affects fiber characteristics bauer et al 2012 snowden et al 2014 hussain et al 2020 fiber is a typical elongation trichome that is differentiated from protoderm cells of the ovule the process of fiber development occurs in four overlapping developmental stages i e differentiation from the protoderm expansion and elongation synthesis of secondary wall and maturation zou et al 2016 rehman and farooq 2019 moisture stress adversely affect fiber length strength and micronaire value where effect observed more pronounced on upper fruiting branches than lower ones wang et al 2016a the availability of sufficient water is important at all fiber developmental stages for better fiber yield and quality rehman and farooq 2019 zhao et al 2019a drought stress reduces photosynthesis stomatal conductance atps synthesis fig 1 saleem et al 2016 meeks et al 2019 li et al 2020 carbohydrate metabolism and assimilates translocation fig 1 rehman and farooq 2019 leading to relative lower biomass production moreover limited water supply during the reproductive stage affects the pollen function due to reduced activities of starch synthesis enzymes downregulation of sucrose synthase and invertase gene curtailed starch accumulation in pistils lead to poor pollen tube growth instigating reproductive failure hu et al 2019 poor fiber yield and quality of cotton fig 1 wang et al 2016a abdelraheem et al 2020 development of management strategies required understanding of various mechanisms involved in response to drought like membrane stability co2 fixation hormonal regulation and production of antioxidants and stress proteins khan et al 2018 despite the complexity of the mechanism of drought stress on fiber development yield and quality a lot have been explored saleem et al 2016 khan et al 2018 abdelraheem et al 2019 ergashovich et al 2020 but the literature on critical analysis of available data on drought effects on cotton with respect to fiber quality development mechanisms is lacking the major objective of this study is to critically analyze the recent progress in understanding the variation in fiber development and its yield and quality due to drought with a special emphasis on the development of fruiting branches seed and fiber development source and sink relationships and possible tolerance strategies have been appraised and future challenges and opportunities have been identified to improve the fiber yield and quality under the threats of short and long term drought stress in climate change scenario this review will help devise new research to mitigate the negative impact of global climate change on world cotton production especially fiber quality 2 drought consequences drought stress have detrimental effects on all the stages of cotton growth and development but here we have discussed the effect of drought stress on the development of fruiting branches seed and fiber development and source sink relationships 2 1 effect of drought stress on development of fruiting sites the plant architecture especially the development of fruiting branches and flowering distribution plays a critical role in sunlight exploitation assimilates distribution and final yield the cotton plant has two types of branches i e monopodial branches do not directly bear the fruit and sympodial branches fruiting branches rehman and farooq 2019 generally lateral branches arise from the lower or upper leaf axil and then differentiate into monopodial or sympodial branches respectively sun et al 2016 cotton has an indeterminate growth habit where its vegetative and reproductive growth overlaps with the onset of drought the balance of vegetative and reproductive development got disturbed drought stress disrupts the boll development and distribution as the higher fruiting branches have smaller and fewer bolls wang et al 2016a drought stress at the time of early reproductive growth results in shorter plants with a smaller number of nodes but plants compensate yield if sufficient water is available at latter stages ullah et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2019 ergashovich et al 2020 reported that drought stress reduces leaf surface area and thus photosynthetic productivity leading to partial shedding of crop organs like bolls leaves and flowers thus to develop genotypes tolerant to drought stress it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism like gas exchange carbohydrate metabolism osmatic adjustment etc wang et al 2016a iqbal et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 with the onset of drought plant stomatal conductance reduces to conserve water which results in reduced leaf water potential photosynthesis and ultimately a lower carboxylation efficiency of cotton meeks et al 2019 pilon et al 2019 the viability of pollen depends on the health of anthers drought stress severely affects the anther growth and development which affects pollen viability zhang et al 2020 drought stress reduced starch accumulation and its breakdown into hexoses in the anthers of cotton which in turn restrict the productions of atps hu et al 2020b this results in less availability of energy to developing pollens and leads to the production of less viable or unviable pollens and results in premature abortion of buds and flowers echer et al 2014 hu et al 2020a and the biomass allocation to reproductive organs reduced wang et al 2016a drought stress causes a decline in photosynthesis due to stomatal limitations leading to poor boll development resulting in lower boll number and boll weight fig 1 drought stress limits soluble starch synthase susy and adp glucose pyrophosphorylase agpase activities hu et al 2019 and downregulates the expression of genes associated with sucrose transportation ghsut 1 sucrose synthase ghsusa ghsusb and ghsusd and invertase activities ghinv1 and ghinv2 in pistils fig 1 pilon et al 2019 hu et al 2019 2020a resulting in lower energy for pollen tubes development which often results in unfertilized flowers hu et al 2019 recently hu et al 2019 explored the impact of drought stress on in vivo pollen tube growth and found that starch contents in pistils of the early growth stage of the pollen tube were 31 less than non stressed plants low starch contents in pistils of drought stressed plants attributed to lower agpase and susy activities which ultimately lead to failure of fertilization even after successful pollination and lead to bud shedding in crux boll shedding due to failure in fertilization during drought stress is mainly due to unorganized carbohydrate metabolism and inefficient antioxidant mechanism in female reproductive parts failing pollen germination and pollen tube development drought stress also has an impact on boll formation and boll shedding iqbal et al 2017 bakhsh et al 2019 there are a number of factors that contribute to boll shedding but drought and heat stress dominate drought stress leads to more production of destructive enzymes which include pectinase hydrolase and cellulase along with ethylene and abscisic acid production tariq et al 2017 zahoor et al 2017 drought stress triggers reactive oxygen species ros production which down regulates biological processes and disturbs reproductive development in cotton fig 1 wang et al 2016b hu et al 2020a during the stress the concentration of soluble carbohydrate metabolites decreased in leaves as leaf area and photosynthesis decreased in response to drought furthermore under water deficit conditions most of the photo assimilate translocated to root followed by leaves and fruits and less is allocated to the reproductive parts which hamper the reproductive development of cotton fig 1 shareef et al 2018 for instance drought induced oxidative stress at the reproductive stage curtailed carbohydrate metabolism resulting in poor carbohydrate assimilation in reproductive parts ultimately leading to flower and bud shedding loka et al 2019 and breakdown in boll cells wang et al 2016b therefore plants use reserved assimilates to compensate for growth losses wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2019b which result in less assimilate accumulation in bolls leading to a lower boll size and boll retention however the effect of drought differed on different fruiting branches wang et al 2016a restriction in the accumulation of non structural carbohydrates has also been reported as a cause of boll shedding in cotton wang et al 2016b hu et al 2020a and drought stress by inhibiting the cell division and assimilates transport weakens the bond of flower boll with the stalk causing boll shedding and diminished plant yield nevertheless the genotypic response may deviate as some genotypes with higher activities of callose and chitinase and elevated secondary metabolism resists boll shedding during drought stress ibrahim et al 2019 callose and chitinase regulate carbohydrate metabolism and translocation in reproductive parts conclusively drought stress affects cotton reproductive development through curtailing the photosynthesis pollen function carbohydrate metabolism and translocation to fruiting bodies moreover drought induced oxidative stress further limits the reproductive development and increased abortion of fruiting sites in cotton 2 2 effect of drought stress on fiber development successful fertilization initiates boll formation which overlaps with the seed and fiber development the process of fiber development consisted of four overlapping stages i e fiber initiation starts after 2 days of anthesis fiber cell elongation 0 21 days after anthesis secondary cell wall deposition 15 28 days of anthesis and maturation 35 50 days after anthesis chen and burke 2015 rehman and farooq 2019 out of these four stages the first three are highly sensitive to abiotic stresses especially drought kolahi et al 2020 witt et al 2020 adequate water availability is very crucial for the maintenance of cell turgor and carbohydrate assimilation to the developing fibers abdelraheem et al 2019 kolahi et al 2020 li et al 2020 water stress causes a reduction in osmotic potential leading to stomatal closure and thus limits photosynthesis and carbohydrates assimilation into the developing bolls the role of the sucrose synthesis gene in seed fiber development in cotton has been well documented ahmed et al 2018 chen et al 2019 whose expression is affected by drought stress gao et al 2020 loka et al 2020 and thus reduced sucrose concentration in developing fibers results in shorter fibers osmotic stress at fiber initiation and elongation reduces the fiber cell division leading to a smaller number of total fiber cells zhang et al 2020 and shortens the fiber length drought stress reduces the fiber length by reducing the leaf water potential causing a decrease in the rate of fiber elongation fig 2 studies have shown that the force and duration of the cell turgor regulate the fiber elongation process wang et al 2016a tang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a gao et al 2020 drought stress disturbs the fiber cell turgor pressure wang et al 2016a ullah et al 2017 leading to reduced fiber length uniformity and strength while the increase in fiber micronaire therefore leaf water potential is a key indicator of the fiber quality of cotton grown under water deficit conditions drought stress at flowering and boll development reduces the length and number of fibers per seed but their thickness is increased hu et al 2018 which shows a decline in fiber quality index fig 2 wang et al 2016a investigated the effect of drought stress on fiber quality traits of cotton and reported that fiber length and strength decrease linearly with decreasing the leaf water potential and suggested leaf water potential a reliable index to estimate cotton fiber quality under stress conditions snowden et al 2014 also reported that drought stress at early and full bloom have similar effects on reproductive development of cotton but on full bloom it has more detrimental effect on fiber length and fineness than early bloom stress fiber elongation is mainly accomplished due to cell wall loosening and increase in cell turgor and 80 of the total osmotic potential is contributed by solutes such as soluble sugars k and malate among these sucrose is the major sugar involved in osmotic adjustment yang et al 2016 drought stress inhibits the mechanical and physiological process of cell expansion for instance drought stress reduced the different carbohydrates glucose fructose sucrose and starch concentration in fibers tang et al 2017 alternatively sucrose and k ion concentration increased in leaves for an osmotic adjustment wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2019a thus osmolytes concentration in fiber cells reduced leading to poor development of fibers at the fiber elongation phase drought stress reduces the sucrose contents and activity of sucrose synthase in developing fibers which causes a reduction in fiber turgor pressure and ultimately leads to a reduced final fiber length fig 2 for instance water deficit condition during flowering results in reduced fiber strength and increase in short fiber content due to low cell turgidity as drought affected the expansion of cell and cellulose deposition during fiber development abdelraheem et al 2020 transcriptomic analysis of cotton revealed that water deficit has comparatively less impact on fiber initiation but significantly affect fiber elongation through downregulation of key genes related to cell wall loosening and expansion process padmalatha et al 2012 droughts stress at the secondary wall deposition stage mainly affects fiber thickness and strength which are the main contributors to lint weight gao et al 2020 the mature fiber has thicker secondary wall smaller middle cavity and high strength zhang et al 2019 fiber thickness development involves largely synthesis and accumulation of cellulose and it depends on amount and quality of deposited cellulose pettigrew 2001 limited water availability during the fiber thickening stage of secondary wall deposition affects carbohydrate metabolism in developing fibers leading to lower fiber sucrose contents and insufficient udp glucose tang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 resulting in callose synthesis instead of cellulose and results in weak fibers zaho et al 2020 reported that sucrose contents activity of β 1 3 glucanase and susy directly correlate with fiber strength under drought stress and osmotic adjustment strategies also improve sucrose contents and enzymatic activities leading to improved fiber strength alteration in sucrose to callose ratio of bolls varies the cellulose deposition rate and affect the fiber strength zhang et al 2009 drought stress disturbs fiber development by decreasing leaf water potential cell expansion and carbohydrate metabolism resulting in reduced the quality of developing fiber of upland cotton by lowering the length uniformity and strength of developing fiber witt et al 2020 drought stress also increases the number and size of neps formed by the immature or dead fibers and seed coat fragments can also cause neps which are not desirable and deteriorate the fiber quality abdelraheem et al 2020 management of drought stress should be a top priority at the fiber development stage to produce high quality fiber 2 3 source sink relationship naturally plants have developed an intricate mechanism to balance source carbon assimilation and sink carbon utilization but drought stress imbalance this equilibrium and leads to a loss in productivity cotton has an indeterminate type of crop growth and environmental stresses e g drought can strongly influence the proportion of vegetative and reproductive growth drought stress affects the source sink relationship of cotton by influencing the source capacity of assimilates production and their assimilation in different fruiting branches of cotton pilon et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b starch and sucrose produced during photosynthesis are translocated to sink tissues from source tissues where it is transferred into hexoses and thus provides energy for active plant growth reviewed in rehman and farooq 2019 drought stress decreases the photosynthesis leaf water potential and leaf atp level in cotton loka et al 2020 furthermore drought stress caused a decline in sucrose starch and hexoses accumulation by declining activities of susy soluble acid invertase sai and sucrose phosphate synthase sps tang et al 2017 loka et al 2020 drought stress disturbed physiological mechanisms leaf water potential photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate and quantum yield fv fm of cotton plants and the effect was more pronounced in upper fruiting branches than lower ones wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019b consequently promotes carbon assimilation to older bolls and newly formed bolls are more affected by it under water deficit conditions plant changes their preference for photo assimilates translocation cotton plants prefer to accumulate more assimilates in roots followed by vegetative and reproductive parts under limited water supply shareef et al 2018 regarding the partitioning of assimilates within bolls more assimilates accumulated in seed instead of fiber fig 3 tang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 resulting in lower than optimum sucrose cleaving enzyme activities and lead to reduced fiber quality likewise water deficit conditions alter the carbohydrate distribution in flower and leaves as drought stress after the onset of flowering resulted in osmotic adjustment in reproductive parts and their subtending leaves where pistil cells accumulated higher sucrose to maintain cell turgor however subtending leaves maintained cell turgor by accumulating proline pilon et al 2019 reduction in soluble carbohydrates and sucrose in leaves leads to less accumulation of dry matter and lower productivity drought stress affects the source sink relationship of cotton by limiting assimilate production and their partitioning under water limited conditions more assimilates are translocated towards roots water uptake and leaves photosynthesis to keep the plant alive and limit the assimilate accumulation in reproductive parts bolls and fiber which results in poor fiber development and lower lint yield 3 management strategies 3 1 genetic improvements development of drought tolerance genotypes or induction of drought tolerance through genetic manipulation is the most sustainable strategy to cope with drought stress drought tolerance is a complex trait that includes physiological occurrence of water imbalances i e metabolic water bound water and cell sap etc biochemical balance of free amino acids antioxidants and carbohydrates and habitual plant structure boll shedding etc therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanism to make sustainable progress ergashovich et al 2020 plenty of genetic mechanisms have been identified that impart genetic tolerance against drought stress mahmood et al 2020 shinwari et al 2020 but are not fully understood abdelraheem et al 2019 due to the complexity of stress mechanism and involvement of many genes with small effects drought stress tolerance is comprised of two steps i e drought signaling and activation of the stress response this response includes morphological development of new roots to harvest far off the water physiological increase photosynthesis stomatal regulations etc biochemical hormonal regulation antioxidant defense system and molecular mechanisms upregulation of genes initiating cascades of stress responses mahmood et al 2020 many genes and transcription factors have been identified that control these response mechanisms shinwari et al 2020 variation in the presence of transcription factors genes and expression of the gene exist in different genotypes of the cotton shen et al 2015 iqbal et al 2017 out of the four cultivated species of cotton g hirsutum has a minimum variability for drought stress tolerance due to continuous selection and breeding of near genetic lines considerable viability against abiotic stresses especially for drought stress exists in g barbadense and g arboretum el esawi and alayafi 2019 ahmad et al 2020 which are cultivated in limited areas and have a broad genetic base there are many successful examples where drought tolerant genes have been successfully introgressed into g hirsutum to incorporate drought stress tolerance table 1 iqbal et al 2017 2019a 2019b transfer of genes by genetic engineering is another modern way to incorporate drought stress tolerance in cotton table 1 it is being done both for the incorporation of new genes and to enhance the expression of already available genes it is observed that over expression of ghabf2 which is a bzip transcription factor gene imparts drought tolerance in transgenic cotton by regulating aba liang et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 and improves yield compared to non transgenic cotton where it is just normally expressed similarly an arabidopsis transcription factor gene atedt1 hdg11 improves drought stress tolerance in transgenic cotton by producing a larger root system and a strong antioxidant defense mechanism yu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 to scavenge ros produced in the response of drought stress several studies have expressed improved drought stress tolerance in transgenic cotton having overexpressed genes related to drought stress tolerance liang et al 2017 el esawi and alayafi 2019 guo et al 2019 a gene tsvp a h ppase derived from thellungiella halophile has shown improvement in drought tolerance in cotton by improving the photosynthetic rate overexpression of vacuolar genes of arabidopsis i e avp1 and atnhx1 produced 24 and 35 higher fiber yield respectively in transgenic plants relative to non transgenic cotton plants shen et al 2015 some more successful cotton transformation against drought stress has been reported by ullah et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 reported that genotypes engineered with iaa biosynthetic gene produce more fiber along with improved fiber fineness due to the role of iaa in cotton fiber initiation bajwa et al 2015 reported that transgenic cotton with overexpression of ghexpa8 show improved fiber length and strength by improving the cellulose contents likewise han et al 2014 reported that overexpression of a putative psk gene ghpsk improves the fiber length and fineness by regulating the reactive oxygen species the use of qtl mapping can also help in the identification loci for marker assisted breeding to impart drought tolerance in cotton these loci control are the genetic bases of several morphological and physiological responses and exhibit the combined effect of hundreds of genes many qtls have been mapped for morphological and physiological traits including early flowering fiber development fiber fineness strength uniformity and length under drought stress conditions baytar et al 2018 mahmood et al 2020 in conclusion the transgenic approach is efficient and has proved effective in inducing drought stress tolerance in cotton said et al 2013 shen et al 2015 liang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 moreover transgenic plants showed better yield and fiber quality under water deficit conditions qtl mapping based molecular breeding approach can also help in the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes with better fiber quality 3 2 agronomic management exogenous supply of plant growth regulators pgrs improves the abiotic stress tolerance in plants many pgrs have been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in cotton khan et al 2018 tanveer et al 2019 hu et al 2020b for instance melatonin application regulates carbohydrate balance in reproductive tissues by enhancing the starch and sucrose synthesis through increased susy and agpase activities higher atp generation and improved male fertility in drought stressed cotton plants hu et al 2020b which lead to better boll development and consequently higher fiber yield and quality acetic acid treatment to drought stress cotton seedlings enhanced the aba and ja contents through upregulation of aba and ja biosynthesis genes biosynthesis genes and improved the soil relative water content which helped in cotton survival under water deficit conditions li et al 2021 likewise exogenous application of aba salicylic acid proline and polyamines improved drought stress tolerance in cotton through augmenting the osmotic adjustment cell turgor pressure regulation and enhanced antioxidant defense capacity of plant against oxidative stress zahoor et al 2017 tanveer et al 2019 hu et al 2020b nitrogen n metabolism regulation is very crucial for tolerance against environmental stresses e g drought due to its involvement in the majority of the physiological processes of plants lawlor 2002 drought stress disturb the plant metabolism by affecting the uptake and translocation of n to above ground parts through reduction in transpiration xiong et al 2018 application of n to cotton plants under water deficit conditions can help in improving the drought stress tolerance through antioxidant enzymes activation leading to decrease lipid peroxidation and better root growth zhou and oosterhuis 2012 likewise exogenous n supply improved the n uptake photosynthesis relative water contents of cotton leaves under drought stress conditions further high n concentration in plants helped in mitigating the drought induced stomatal limitations enhanced the osmoprotectants synthesis soluble proteins and free amino acids activities of antioxidant sod pod and cat enzymes and n assimilating enzymes nitrogen reductase glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase iqbal et al 2020 diminished phosphorus p availability and water deficit condition decreases the cotton yield in arid areas application of p under drought stressed conditions improved the p absorption and transfer efficiency thus enhanced the stress tolerance ability with higher biomass production and cotton yield jun et al 2017 application of p increased the soil p availability which led to improvement in morphological traits of cotton and seed cotton yield in drying soil singh et al 2006a the excessive p availability increased the leaf water total free and bound water and leaf expansion rate under drought stress conditions in a severely drying soil 1 5 mpa due to excessive osmolyte supply to cell leading to accumulation of free and bound water and rapid leaf expansion singh et al 2006b potassium k is a key plant nutrient about water relations of cotton and it influences growth and development by regulating several physiological and biochemical processes khan et al 2018 zhao et al 2019a application of k under drought stress improves cell membrane recovery chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic rate an increase in k demand for drought stressed plant may be associated with the involvement of k in co2 fixation and photo assimilates translocation to sink zhao et al 2019a application of k has been effective in improving the antioxidant defense system nitrogen and sucrose metabolism in functional leaves of drought stressed cotton plants which lead to improved bud retention and higher fiber yield zahoor et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a moreover k fertilization also helps in regulating the activities of plasma membrane atpase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which are strongly correlated with fiber length and fiber strength of cotton hu et al 2018 nonetheless ali et al 2019 disclosed that combined foliar application of k magnesium mg and nitrogen n had the potential to improve cotton fiber quality under well watered and water limited conditions in another study moderate n application improved fiber quality of rainfed cotton while overdose of n curtailed fiber quality of both irrigated and rainfed cotton sui et al 2017 therefore adequate k and n fertilization may ameliorate the adverse effect of drought stress on cotton growth and fiber yield field management practices can be adopted to avoid evaporation losses for drought management in cotton addition of soil organic matter can enhance the water holding capacity of the soil minasny and mcbratney 2018 oldfield et al 2018 and avoid evaporation losses it is well known that weeds compete with crop plants for water and nutrients therefore weed management can also have a positive impact on drought stress tolerance iqbal et al 2019a 2019b reported that partial rhizosphere drying combined with mulching improves cotton growth and productivity under limited water availability it is also reported that skipping the alternative irrigation and irrigation scheduling in limited water resources can improve the water use efficiency and water productivity feike et al 2017 imran et al 2019 hussain et al 2020 depending on the water resources and availability an integrated use of above mentioned strategies can be used to mitigate the drought effects in conclusion transgenic approaches and qtls mapping for molecular breeding may be a good choice in the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes with better fiber yield and quality application of plant growth regulators and adequate plant nutrient supply e g k mg n and field management may improve the growth fiber yield and quality of cotton plants grown in water limited environments 4 conclusions and prospects drought stress severely affects cotton growth and development especially reproductive development fiber yield and quality drought stress disrupts the carbohydrate metabolism assimilate translocation to the sink tissues pollen function and curtail the antioxidant defense system of the plant leading to shriveled boll size and inferior fiber quality cotton plants compensate vegetative growth under drought on the cost of reproductive development where maximum assimilate are translocated to roots and leaves while reproductive parts and developing fibers receive very low assimilate supply many studies have reported the influence of water deficit conditions on cotton reproductive development but still work is in progress for the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of drought stress on fruiting sites and seed fiber development application of pgrs osmoprotectants and mineral nutrients e g k helped in ameliorating the drought induced reduction in plant growth fiber yield and quality through enhanced cellular signaling hormonal homeostasis cell turgor potential regulation improved allocation of assimilate to the fruiting branches and improved carbohydrate metabolism moreover various genetic approaches like introgression of the gene from related species transformation and overexpression of drought related genes have shown promising results in inducing drought stress in cotton without compromising on fiber yield and quality the integrated use management approach i e pgrs and nutrient application field management practices complemented with a genetic approach should be tested for farthest improvement for higher cotton production in drought prone areas moreover the genetic and molecular basis of pgrs induced drought tolerance should be explored drought stress tolerance is a complex trait and controlled by several loci and genes moreover very few genes have been identified which are associated with fiber quality under drought stress therefore there is a need to identify more qtls and genes responsible for improved fiber quality traits under drought stress to develop cotton cultivars with better fiber quality under water limited environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9960,climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of abiotic stresses especially drought has become the major threat to cotton production worldwide due to long and intense dry spells in many cotton growing areas drought stress curtails the photosynthesis carbohydrate metabolism starch sucrose synthesis activities of several enzymes including vacuolar invertase and sucrose synthase etc which are involved in fiber development moreover drought stressed cotton plant has poor assimilate translocation towards reproductive tissues leading to poor pollen functioning reproductive failure and inferior fiber quality the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes using transgenes or qtl based molecular breeding approaches has proved effective in improving drought tolerance and fiber quality in cotton the use of plant growth regulators and mineral elements can also aid in enhancing drought stress tolerance fiber yield and quality of cotton through initiating stress response related signaling cascades although effects of drought stress in cotton are well reported but variations in fiber quality due to the drought are not well explored during the last few years progress has been observed to understand these mechanisms which are critically reviewed here this review highlights the water deficit stress induced habitual physiological and biochemical changes during the reproductive growth leading to poor development of fiber it also highlights the effect of drought stress on assimilate accumulation and portioning in reproductive tissues of cotton which finally converts into the fiber this review will help devise new research to mitigate the negative impact of global climate change on world cotton production and fiber quality keywords climate change physiological effects carbohydrate metabolism molecular mechanism fiber development 1 introduction cotton gossypium hirsutum l is considered a leading cash crop of the world with a major contribution from china the usa india pakistan and brazil meyer 2019 climate change has threatened world agriculture due to the severity of biotic and abiotic stresses major threats to cotton production in china india usa pakistan brazil and other tropical regions include less availability of irrigation water change in frequency and intensity of rainfall drought and heat spells and salinization ton 2011 cotton has an indeterminate growth habit and is vulnerable to environmental anomalies rehman and farooq 2019 being a crop of tropical and subtropical regions cotton is moderately tolerant to drought stress especially for vegetative growth but its reproductive growth is highly sensitive to drought stress wang et al 2016a iqbal et al 2017 niu et al 2018 drought is the most important abiotic stress and 20 of the global land area is facing moderate to severe drought barichivich et al 2019 which is projected to increase in the future as cotton is a crop of tropical and sub tropical climate areas which are more prone to drought stress its production is threatened by long dry spells in the future meyer 2019 to devise a strategy to minimize the effects of drought stress on fiber production cotton is a fiber crop it is necessary to understand the effect of drought on fiber development and yield typically cotton growth and development are divided into five stages with respect to irrigation requirements i e planting to emergence emergence to first square first square to first flower first flower to peak bloom and peak bloom to first boll open bauer et al 2012 at planting time irrigation is necessary for crop germination and establishment from emergence to first square drought stress has little impact on yield and even moderate drought stress is beneficial to promote root growth bauer et al 2012 zonta et al 2017 next two stages i e first square to first flower and first flower to peak bloom are the most sensitive stages to abiotic stresses especially drought and heat stress at these stages drought stress affects development of fruiting sites and cause abortion of existing fruiting structure and thus lead to reduced yield bauer et al 2012 snowden et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 zonta et al 2017 at last stage i e peak bloom to first boll open crop water requirement is reduced and moderate drought stress have relatively less effect on yield but it affects fiber characteristics bauer et al 2012 snowden et al 2014 hussain et al 2020 fiber is a typical elongation trichome that is differentiated from protoderm cells of the ovule the process of fiber development occurs in four overlapping developmental stages i e differentiation from the protoderm expansion and elongation synthesis of secondary wall and maturation zou et al 2016 rehman and farooq 2019 moisture stress adversely affect fiber length strength and micronaire value where effect observed more pronounced on upper fruiting branches than lower ones wang et al 2016a the availability of sufficient water is important at all fiber developmental stages for better fiber yield and quality rehman and farooq 2019 zhao et al 2019a drought stress reduces photosynthesis stomatal conductance atps synthesis fig 1 saleem et al 2016 meeks et al 2019 li et al 2020 carbohydrate metabolism and assimilates translocation fig 1 rehman and farooq 2019 leading to relative lower biomass production moreover limited water supply during the reproductive stage affects the pollen function due to reduced activities of starch synthesis enzymes downregulation of sucrose synthase and invertase gene curtailed starch accumulation in pistils lead to poor pollen tube growth instigating reproductive failure hu et al 2019 poor fiber yield and quality of cotton fig 1 wang et al 2016a abdelraheem et al 2020 development of management strategies required understanding of various mechanisms involved in response to drought like membrane stability co2 fixation hormonal regulation and production of antioxidants and stress proteins khan et al 2018 despite the complexity of the mechanism of drought stress on fiber development yield and quality a lot have been explored saleem et al 2016 khan et al 2018 abdelraheem et al 2019 ergashovich et al 2020 but the literature on critical analysis of available data on drought effects on cotton with respect to fiber quality development mechanisms is lacking the major objective of this study is to critically analyze the recent progress in understanding the variation in fiber development and its yield and quality due to drought with a special emphasis on the development of fruiting branches seed and fiber development source and sink relationships and possible tolerance strategies have been appraised and future challenges and opportunities have been identified to improve the fiber yield and quality under the threats of short and long term drought stress in climate change scenario this review will help devise new research to mitigate the negative impact of global climate change on world cotton production especially fiber quality 2 drought consequences drought stress have detrimental effects on all the stages of cotton growth and development but here we have discussed the effect of drought stress on the development of fruiting branches seed and fiber development and source sink relationships 2 1 effect of drought stress on development of fruiting sites the plant architecture especially the development of fruiting branches and flowering distribution plays a critical role in sunlight exploitation assimilates distribution and final yield the cotton plant has two types of branches i e monopodial branches do not directly bear the fruit and sympodial branches fruiting branches rehman and farooq 2019 generally lateral branches arise from the lower or upper leaf axil and then differentiate into monopodial or sympodial branches respectively sun et al 2016 cotton has an indeterminate growth habit where its vegetative and reproductive growth overlaps with the onset of drought the balance of vegetative and reproductive development got disturbed drought stress disrupts the boll development and distribution as the higher fruiting branches have smaller and fewer bolls wang et al 2016a drought stress at the time of early reproductive growth results in shorter plants with a smaller number of nodes but plants compensate yield if sufficient water is available at latter stages ullah et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2019 ergashovich et al 2020 reported that drought stress reduces leaf surface area and thus photosynthetic productivity leading to partial shedding of crop organs like bolls leaves and flowers thus to develop genotypes tolerant to drought stress it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism like gas exchange carbohydrate metabolism osmatic adjustment etc wang et al 2016a iqbal et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 with the onset of drought plant stomatal conductance reduces to conserve water which results in reduced leaf water potential photosynthesis and ultimately a lower carboxylation efficiency of cotton meeks et al 2019 pilon et al 2019 the viability of pollen depends on the health of anthers drought stress severely affects the anther growth and development which affects pollen viability zhang et al 2020 drought stress reduced starch accumulation and its breakdown into hexoses in the anthers of cotton which in turn restrict the productions of atps hu et al 2020b this results in less availability of energy to developing pollens and leads to the production of less viable or unviable pollens and results in premature abortion of buds and flowers echer et al 2014 hu et al 2020a and the biomass allocation to reproductive organs reduced wang et al 2016a drought stress causes a decline in photosynthesis due to stomatal limitations leading to poor boll development resulting in lower boll number and boll weight fig 1 drought stress limits soluble starch synthase susy and adp glucose pyrophosphorylase agpase activities hu et al 2019 and downregulates the expression of genes associated with sucrose transportation ghsut 1 sucrose synthase ghsusa ghsusb and ghsusd and invertase activities ghinv1 and ghinv2 in pistils fig 1 pilon et al 2019 hu et al 2019 2020a resulting in lower energy for pollen tubes development which often results in unfertilized flowers hu et al 2019 recently hu et al 2019 explored the impact of drought stress on in vivo pollen tube growth and found that starch contents in pistils of the early growth stage of the pollen tube were 31 less than non stressed plants low starch contents in pistils of drought stressed plants attributed to lower agpase and susy activities which ultimately lead to failure of fertilization even after successful pollination and lead to bud shedding in crux boll shedding due to failure in fertilization during drought stress is mainly due to unorganized carbohydrate metabolism and inefficient antioxidant mechanism in female reproductive parts failing pollen germination and pollen tube development drought stress also has an impact on boll formation and boll shedding iqbal et al 2017 bakhsh et al 2019 there are a number of factors that contribute to boll shedding but drought and heat stress dominate drought stress leads to more production of destructive enzymes which include pectinase hydrolase and cellulase along with ethylene and abscisic acid production tariq et al 2017 zahoor et al 2017 drought stress triggers reactive oxygen species ros production which down regulates biological processes and disturbs reproductive development in cotton fig 1 wang et al 2016b hu et al 2020a during the stress the concentration of soluble carbohydrate metabolites decreased in leaves as leaf area and photosynthesis decreased in response to drought furthermore under water deficit conditions most of the photo assimilate translocated to root followed by leaves and fruits and less is allocated to the reproductive parts which hamper the reproductive development of cotton fig 1 shareef et al 2018 for instance drought induced oxidative stress at the reproductive stage curtailed carbohydrate metabolism resulting in poor carbohydrate assimilation in reproductive parts ultimately leading to flower and bud shedding loka et al 2019 and breakdown in boll cells wang et al 2016b therefore plants use reserved assimilates to compensate for growth losses wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2019b which result in less assimilate accumulation in bolls leading to a lower boll size and boll retention however the effect of drought differed on different fruiting branches wang et al 2016a restriction in the accumulation of non structural carbohydrates has also been reported as a cause of boll shedding in cotton wang et al 2016b hu et al 2020a and drought stress by inhibiting the cell division and assimilates transport weakens the bond of flower boll with the stalk causing boll shedding and diminished plant yield nevertheless the genotypic response may deviate as some genotypes with higher activities of callose and chitinase and elevated secondary metabolism resists boll shedding during drought stress ibrahim et al 2019 callose and chitinase regulate carbohydrate metabolism and translocation in reproductive parts conclusively drought stress affects cotton reproductive development through curtailing the photosynthesis pollen function carbohydrate metabolism and translocation to fruiting bodies moreover drought induced oxidative stress further limits the reproductive development and increased abortion of fruiting sites in cotton 2 2 effect of drought stress on fiber development successful fertilization initiates boll formation which overlaps with the seed and fiber development the process of fiber development consisted of four overlapping stages i e fiber initiation starts after 2 days of anthesis fiber cell elongation 0 21 days after anthesis secondary cell wall deposition 15 28 days of anthesis and maturation 35 50 days after anthesis chen and burke 2015 rehman and farooq 2019 out of these four stages the first three are highly sensitive to abiotic stresses especially drought kolahi et al 2020 witt et al 2020 adequate water availability is very crucial for the maintenance of cell turgor and carbohydrate assimilation to the developing fibers abdelraheem et al 2019 kolahi et al 2020 li et al 2020 water stress causes a reduction in osmotic potential leading to stomatal closure and thus limits photosynthesis and carbohydrates assimilation into the developing bolls the role of the sucrose synthesis gene in seed fiber development in cotton has been well documented ahmed et al 2018 chen et al 2019 whose expression is affected by drought stress gao et al 2020 loka et al 2020 and thus reduced sucrose concentration in developing fibers results in shorter fibers osmotic stress at fiber initiation and elongation reduces the fiber cell division leading to a smaller number of total fiber cells zhang et al 2020 and shortens the fiber length drought stress reduces the fiber length by reducing the leaf water potential causing a decrease in the rate of fiber elongation fig 2 studies have shown that the force and duration of the cell turgor regulate the fiber elongation process wang et al 2016a tang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a gao et al 2020 drought stress disturbs the fiber cell turgor pressure wang et al 2016a ullah et al 2017 leading to reduced fiber length uniformity and strength while the increase in fiber micronaire therefore leaf water potential is a key indicator of the fiber quality of cotton grown under water deficit conditions drought stress at flowering and boll development reduces the length and number of fibers per seed but their thickness is increased hu et al 2018 which shows a decline in fiber quality index fig 2 wang et al 2016a investigated the effect of drought stress on fiber quality traits of cotton and reported that fiber length and strength decrease linearly with decreasing the leaf water potential and suggested leaf water potential a reliable index to estimate cotton fiber quality under stress conditions snowden et al 2014 also reported that drought stress at early and full bloom have similar effects on reproductive development of cotton but on full bloom it has more detrimental effect on fiber length and fineness than early bloom stress fiber elongation is mainly accomplished due to cell wall loosening and increase in cell turgor and 80 of the total osmotic potential is contributed by solutes such as soluble sugars k and malate among these sucrose is the major sugar involved in osmotic adjustment yang et al 2016 drought stress inhibits the mechanical and physiological process of cell expansion for instance drought stress reduced the different carbohydrates glucose fructose sucrose and starch concentration in fibers tang et al 2017 alternatively sucrose and k ion concentration increased in leaves for an osmotic adjustment wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2019a thus osmolytes concentration in fiber cells reduced leading to poor development of fibers at the fiber elongation phase drought stress reduces the sucrose contents and activity of sucrose synthase in developing fibers which causes a reduction in fiber turgor pressure and ultimately leads to a reduced final fiber length fig 2 for instance water deficit condition during flowering results in reduced fiber strength and increase in short fiber content due to low cell turgidity as drought affected the expansion of cell and cellulose deposition during fiber development abdelraheem et al 2020 transcriptomic analysis of cotton revealed that water deficit has comparatively less impact on fiber initiation but significantly affect fiber elongation through downregulation of key genes related to cell wall loosening and expansion process padmalatha et al 2012 droughts stress at the secondary wall deposition stage mainly affects fiber thickness and strength which are the main contributors to lint weight gao et al 2020 the mature fiber has thicker secondary wall smaller middle cavity and high strength zhang et al 2019 fiber thickness development involves largely synthesis and accumulation of cellulose and it depends on amount and quality of deposited cellulose pettigrew 2001 limited water availability during the fiber thickening stage of secondary wall deposition affects carbohydrate metabolism in developing fibers leading to lower fiber sucrose contents and insufficient udp glucose tang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 resulting in callose synthesis instead of cellulose and results in weak fibers zaho et al 2020 reported that sucrose contents activity of β 1 3 glucanase and susy directly correlate with fiber strength under drought stress and osmotic adjustment strategies also improve sucrose contents and enzymatic activities leading to improved fiber strength alteration in sucrose to callose ratio of bolls varies the cellulose deposition rate and affect the fiber strength zhang et al 2009 drought stress disturbs fiber development by decreasing leaf water potential cell expansion and carbohydrate metabolism resulting in reduced the quality of developing fiber of upland cotton by lowering the length uniformity and strength of developing fiber witt et al 2020 drought stress also increases the number and size of neps formed by the immature or dead fibers and seed coat fragments can also cause neps which are not desirable and deteriorate the fiber quality abdelraheem et al 2020 management of drought stress should be a top priority at the fiber development stage to produce high quality fiber 2 3 source sink relationship naturally plants have developed an intricate mechanism to balance source carbon assimilation and sink carbon utilization but drought stress imbalance this equilibrium and leads to a loss in productivity cotton has an indeterminate type of crop growth and environmental stresses e g drought can strongly influence the proportion of vegetative and reproductive growth drought stress affects the source sink relationship of cotton by influencing the source capacity of assimilates production and their assimilation in different fruiting branches of cotton pilon et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b starch and sucrose produced during photosynthesis are translocated to sink tissues from source tissues where it is transferred into hexoses and thus provides energy for active plant growth reviewed in rehman and farooq 2019 drought stress decreases the photosynthesis leaf water potential and leaf atp level in cotton loka et al 2020 furthermore drought stress caused a decline in sucrose starch and hexoses accumulation by declining activities of susy soluble acid invertase sai and sucrose phosphate synthase sps tang et al 2017 loka et al 2020 drought stress disturbed physiological mechanisms leaf water potential photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate and quantum yield fv fm of cotton plants and the effect was more pronounced in upper fruiting branches than lower ones wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019b consequently promotes carbon assimilation to older bolls and newly formed bolls are more affected by it under water deficit conditions plant changes their preference for photo assimilates translocation cotton plants prefer to accumulate more assimilates in roots followed by vegetative and reproductive parts under limited water supply shareef et al 2018 regarding the partitioning of assimilates within bolls more assimilates accumulated in seed instead of fiber fig 3 tang et al 2017 gao et al 2020 resulting in lower than optimum sucrose cleaving enzyme activities and lead to reduced fiber quality likewise water deficit conditions alter the carbohydrate distribution in flower and leaves as drought stress after the onset of flowering resulted in osmotic adjustment in reproductive parts and their subtending leaves where pistil cells accumulated higher sucrose to maintain cell turgor however subtending leaves maintained cell turgor by accumulating proline pilon et al 2019 reduction in soluble carbohydrates and sucrose in leaves leads to less accumulation of dry matter and lower productivity drought stress affects the source sink relationship of cotton by limiting assimilate production and their partitioning under water limited conditions more assimilates are translocated towards roots water uptake and leaves photosynthesis to keep the plant alive and limit the assimilate accumulation in reproductive parts bolls and fiber which results in poor fiber development and lower lint yield 3 management strategies 3 1 genetic improvements development of drought tolerance genotypes or induction of drought tolerance through genetic manipulation is the most sustainable strategy to cope with drought stress drought tolerance is a complex trait that includes physiological occurrence of water imbalances i e metabolic water bound water and cell sap etc biochemical balance of free amino acids antioxidants and carbohydrates and habitual plant structure boll shedding etc therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanism to make sustainable progress ergashovich et al 2020 plenty of genetic mechanisms have been identified that impart genetic tolerance against drought stress mahmood et al 2020 shinwari et al 2020 but are not fully understood abdelraheem et al 2019 due to the complexity of stress mechanism and involvement of many genes with small effects drought stress tolerance is comprised of two steps i e drought signaling and activation of the stress response this response includes morphological development of new roots to harvest far off the water physiological increase photosynthesis stomatal regulations etc biochemical hormonal regulation antioxidant defense system and molecular mechanisms upregulation of genes initiating cascades of stress responses mahmood et al 2020 many genes and transcription factors have been identified that control these response mechanisms shinwari et al 2020 variation in the presence of transcription factors genes and expression of the gene exist in different genotypes of the cotton shen et al 2015 iqbal et al 2017 out of the four cultivated species of cotton g hirsutum has a minimum variability for drought stress tolerance due to continuous selection and breeding of near genetic lines considerable viability against abiotic stresses especially for drought stress exists in g barbadense and g arboretum el esawi and alayafi 2019 ahmad et al 2020 which are cultivated in limited areas and have a broad genetic base there are many successful examples where drought tolerant genes have been successfully introgressed into g hirsutum to incorporate drought stress tolerance table 1 iqbal et al 2017 2019a 2019b transfer of genes by genetic engineering is another modern way to incorporate drought stress tolerance in cotton table 1 it is being done both for the incorporation of new genes and to enhance the expression of already available genes it is observed that over expression of ghabf2 which is a bzip transcription factor gene imparts drought tolerance in transgenic cotton by regulating aba liang et al 2017 mahmood et al 2020 and improves yield compared to non transgenic cotton where it is just normally expressed similarly an arabidopsis transcription factor gene atedt1 hdg11 improves drought stress tolerance in transgenic cotton by producing a larger root system and a strong antioxidant defense mechanism yu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 to scavenge ros produced in the response of drought stress several studies have expressed improved drought stress tolerance in transgenic cotton having overexpressed genes related to drought stress tolerance liang et al 2017 el esawi and alayafi 2019 guo et al 2019 a gene tsvp a h ppase derived from thellungiella halophile has shown improvement in drought tolerance in cotton by improving the photosynthetic rate overexpression of vacuolar genes of arabidopsis i e avp1 and atnhx1 produced 24 and 35 higher fiber yield respectively in transgenic plants relative to non transgenic cotton plants shen et al 2015 some more successful cotton transformation against drought stress has been reported by ullah et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 reported that genotypes engineered with iaa biosynthetic gene produce more fiber along with improved fiber fineness due to the role of iaa in cotton fiber initiation bajwa et al 2015 reported that transgenic cotton with overexpression of ghexpa8 show improved fiber length and strength by improving the cellulose contents likewise han et al 2014 reported that overexpression of a putative psk gene ghpsk improves the fiber length and fineness by regulating the reactive oxygen species the use of qtl mapping can also help in the identification loci for marker assisted breeding to impart drought tolerance in cotton these loci control are the genetic bases of several morphological and physiological responses and exhibit the combined effect of hundreds of genes many qtls have been mapped for morphological and physiological traits including early flowering fiber development fiber fineness strength uniformity and length under drought stress conditions baytar et al 2018 mahmood et al 2020 in conclusion the transgenic approach is efficient and has proved effective in inducing drought stress tolerance in cotton said et al 2013 shen et al 2015 liang et al 2017 guo et al 2019 moreover transgenic plants showed better yield and fiber quality under water deficit conditions qtl mapping based molecular breeding approach can also help in the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes with better fiber quality 3 2 agronomic management exogenous supply of plant growth regulators pgrs improves the abiotic stress tolerance in plants many pgrs have been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in cotton khan et al 2018 tanveer et al 2019 hu et al 2020b for instance melatonin application regulates carbohydrate balance in reproductive tissues by enhancing the starch and sucrose synthesis through increased susy and agpase activities higher atp generation and improved male fertility in drought stressed cotton plants hu et al 2020b which lead to better boll development and consequently higher fiber yield and quality acetic acid treatment to drought stress cotton seedlings enhanced the aba and ja contents through upregulation of aba and ja biosynthesis genes biosynthesis genes and improved the soil relative water content which helped in cotton survival under water deficit conditions li et al 2021 likewise exogenous application of aba salicylic acid proline and polyamines improved drought stress tolerance in cotton through augmenting the osmotic adjustment cell turgor pressure regulation and enhanced antioxidant defense capacity of plant against oxidative stress zahoor et al 2017 tanveer et al 2019 hu et al 2020b nitrogen n metabolism regulation is very crucial for tolerance against environmental stresses e g drought due to its involvement in the majority of the physiological processes of plants lawlor 2002 drought stress disturb the plant metabolism by affecting the uptake and translocation of n to above ground parts through reduction in transpiration xiong et al 2018 application of n to cotton plants under water deficit conditions can help in improving the drought stress tolerance through antioxidant enzymes activation leading to decrease lipid peroxidation and better root growth zhou and oosterhuis 2012 likewise exogenous n supply improved the n uptake photosynthesis relative water contents of cotton leaves under drought stress conditions further high n concentration in plants helped in mitigating the drought induced stomatal limitations enhanced the osmoprotectants synthesis soluble proteins and free amino acids activities of antioxidant sod pod and cat enzymes and n assimilating enzymes nitrogen reductase glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase iqbal et al 2020 diminished phosphorus p availability and water deficit condition decreases the cotton yield in arid areas application of p under drought stressed conditions improved the p absorption and transfer efficiency thus enhanced the stress tolerance ability with higher biomass production and cotton yield jun et al 2017 application of p increased the soil p availability which led to improvement in morphological traits of cotton and seed cotton yield in drying soil singh et al 2006a the excessive p availability increased the leaf water total free and bound water and leaf expansion rate under drought stress conditions in a severely drying soil 1 5 mpa due to excessive osmolyte supply to cell leading to accumulation of free and bound water and rapid leaf expansion singh et al 2006b potassium k is a key plant nutrient about water relations of cotton and it influences growth and development by regulating several physiological and biochemical processes khan et al 2018 zhao et al 2019a application of k under drought stress improves cell membrane recovery chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic rate an increase in k demand for drought stressed plant may be associated with the involvement of k in co2 fixation and photo assimilates translocation to sink zhao et al 2019a application of k has been effective in improving the antioxidant defense system nitrogen and sucrose metabolism in functional leaves of drought stressed cotton plants which lead to improved bud retention and higher fiber yield zahoor et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a moreover k fertilization also helps in regulating the activities of plasma membrane atpase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which are strongly correlated with fiber length and fiber strength of cotton hu et al 2018 nonetheless ali et al 2019 disclosed that combined foliar application of k magnesium mg and nitrogen n had the potential to improve cotton fiber quality under well watered and water limited conditions in another study moderate n application improved fiber quality of rainfed cotton while overdose of n curtailed fiber quality of both irrigated and rainfed cotton sui et al 2017 therefore adequate k and n fertilization may ameliorate the adverse effect of drought stress on cotton growth and fiber yield field management practices can be adopted to avoid evaporation losses for drought management in cotton addition of soil organic matter can enhance the water holding capacity of the soil minasny and mcbratney 2018 oldfield et al 2018 and avoid evaporation losses it is well known that weeds compete with crop plants for water and nutrients therefore weed management can also have a positive impact on drought stress tolerance iqbal et al 2019a 2019b reported that partial rhizosphere drying combined with mulching improves cotton growth and productivity under limited water availability it is also reported that skipping the alternative irrigation and irrigation scheduling in limited water resources can improve the water use efficiency and water productivity feike et al 2017 imran et al 2019 hussain et al 2020 depending on the water resources and availability an integrated use of above mentioned strategies can be used to mitigate the drought effects in conclusion transgenic approaches and qtls mapping for molecular breeding may be a good choice in the development of drought tolerant cotton genotypes with better fiber yield and quality application of plant growth regulators and adequate plant nutrient supply e g k mg n and field management may improve the growth fiber yield and quality of cotton plants grown in water limited environments 4 conclusions and prospects drought stress severely affects cotton growth and development especially reproductive development fiber yield and quality drought stress disrupts the carbohydrate metabolism assimilate translocation to the sink tissues pollen function and curtail the antioxidant defense system of the plant leading to shriveled boll size and inferior fiber quality cotton plants compensate vegetative growth under drought on the cost of reproductive development where maximum assimilate are translocated to roots and leaves while reproductive parts and developing fibers receive very low assimilate supply many studies have reported the influence of water deficit conditions on cotton reproductive development but still work is in progress for the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of drought stress on fruiting sites and seed fiber development application of pgrs osmoprotectants and mineral nutrients e g k helped in ameliorating the drought induced reduction in plant growth fiber yield and quality through enhanced cellular signaling hormonal homeostasis cell turgor potential regulation improved allocation of assimilate to the fruiting branches and improved carbohydrate metabolism moreover various genetic approaches like introgression of the gene from related species transformation and overexpression of drought related genes have shown promising results in inducing drought stress in cotton without compromising on fiber yield and quality the integrated use management approach i e pgrs and nutrient application field management practices complemented with a genetic approach should be tested for farthest improvement for higher cotton production in drought prone areas moreover the genetic and molecular basis of pgrs induced drought tolerance should be explored drought stress tolerance is a complex trait and controlled by several loci and genes moreover very few genes have been identified which are associated with fiber quality under drought stress therefore there is a need to identify more qtls and genes responsible for improved fiber quality traits under drought stress to develop cotton cultivars with better fiber quality under water limited environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9961,this study was aimed to improve water saving and economic productivity based on quotation with sugar percentage of sugar beet beta vulgaris l using linear move sprinkler system lmss the experiments were carried out in western central anatolia region of turkey during the growing seasons of 2012 2014 for 3 years the irrigation treatments were applied as i1 full irrigation i2 i1 0 80 i3 i1 0 60 i4 i1 0 40 and i5 i1 0 20 using 4 replications and systematically arranged due to the feature of lmss the i1 was based on deficit soil moisture in the soil depth of 90 cm according to the field capacity for each 7 days different regulated deficit irrigation levels were thus created for each irrigation cycle based on i1 the seasonal yield response factor ky was 0 50 the main reason of the lower of the ky could be because of frequent irrigation and climatic characteristics full irrigation 842 mm resulted in the highest sugar beet yield 77 8 t ha 1 but did not provide the highest net margin the main reason for this was that the sugar content of sugar beet decreased with increasing irrigation water and the sugar beet sales price was determined according to the sugar content this also enabled the lower amount of irrigation water 687 mm of 20 lower than full irrigation 842 mm irrigation water yield sugar content and net margin were thus 687 mm 73 5 t ha 1 16 5 and 1221 us ha 1 respectively sugar beet could be irrigated using lmss in high profitability in irrigation interval of 7 10 days and applying water of 45 65 mm for each irrigation cycle an appropriate net margin 1074 us ha 1 could be obtained using irrigation water less than 40 of full irrigation in case of limited water because net income was still more than about 40 of total cost the quotation of the sugar beet sales price according to the sugar content and the increase in the sugar content in the lower irrigation showed that significant water savings can be practiced in irrigation water without much loss of income graphical abstract the relationships between net margin nm actual sale price asp sugar content sc and irrigation water productivity wpi versus amount of irrigation water applied for sugar beet using linear move sprinkler irrigation ga1 keywords sugar beet quotation sugar content linear move sprinkler water saving net margin 1 introduction sugar production in the world is provided by 76 from sugar cane and 24 from sugar beet beta vulgaris l all of the sugar production in turkey is provided by sugar beet anonymous 2020 sugar beet is thus a major commercial field crop under irrigated conditions in turkey kıymaz and ertek 2015 the total cultivation area the total production and the yield are 310 000 ha 18 million tons and 58 2 t ha 1 respectively anonymous 2020 sugar beet consumes 500 800 mm of water during the growing period the seasonal water requirements depend on irrigation crop management climate and weather conditions planting density and date steduto et al 2012 sugar beet needs thus high water requirements because of high yield potential and long growing season zarski et al 2020 irrigation water requirement and crop evapotranspiration for sugar beet irrigated by furrow irrigation in the same study area were 840 mm and 1008 mm respectively gungor 1984 however the most challenge for irrigated agriculture is limited and inadequacy of water resources li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 memon et al 2021 the sugar beet had been irrigated mostly by border and or furrow irrigation up to 1980s in turkey the pressurized irrigation systems almost fixed sprinkler irrigation has been used today however drip and some moving sprinkler systems center pivot or linear sprinkler have been rarely used even in all those less than 5 are not common the types of irrigation systems has increased year by year due to many different reasons such as developing irrigation technology farmer conditions labor irrigation efficiency and water saving one of these linear move sprinkler system lmss has a higher application uniformity by adjusting the movement speed james 1993 the moving irrigation systems such as center pivot or linear move systems can easily irrigate large fields with relatively low labor and energy costs and they are also adaptable to different and changing management objectives sadeghi et al 2015 the moving sprinkler system could be worked properly in helping the sugar beets to germinate and break up any crust that may be preventing emergence thus linear move irrigation systems were developed to increase irrigation efficiencies and reduce irrigation labor costs klocke et al 2003 on the other hand the appropriate management of irrigation for a specified irrigation system is vital important to use efficiently water resources and to maximize food production per water volume irrigation scheduling is thus one of the most important tools in the development of best management practices for irrigated areas kıymaz and ertek 2015 in the arid and semi arid climate zones sugar beet irrigation is basic agronomic management therefore considerable scientific research focuses on introducing new water and energy saving irrigation systems and obtaining more precise irrigation schedules and control methods topak et al 2011 tognetti et al 2003 hassanli et al 2010 barzegari et al 2017 considering water scarcity conditions deficit irrigation di is one optimized solution for the cultivation of products and the product can be increased per unit of irrigation water sepaskhah et al 2006 the di irrigation is thus a precious production strategy commonly used in water shortage areas it maximizes the water productivity but a certain yield reduction is observed compared to the full irrigation geerts and raes 2009 sahin et al 2014 thus regulated deficit irrigation rdi the practice of applying an amount of water that is less than the required for optimal plant growth has a number of benefits including reduction of water consumption improvement in plant response to water deficit and increase of crop water productivity li et al 2019 the effect of water deficit on plant function can range from mild to severe depending on the degree and timing of the deficit tarkalson and king 2017 irrigation water productivity wpi is defined as the crop production per each irrigation water used the wpi and sugar content decrease while sugar beet yield and or production is significantly increased by irrigation water applied maralian et al 2008 topak et al 2011 tari et al 2016 li et al 2019 on the one hand the farmers and irrigation schemes want to have the highest income thus the irrigator or farmer must take into account both the farm income and water productivity for an optimum and sustainable irrigation management for this some indicators or indexes on both water productivity and the economic performance of irrigation are required at field scale pereria et al 2012 levidow et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 however the farmer must optimize water productivity not maximize all time it barker et al 2003 because besides irrigation water saving the income is also important for the farmer thus wp is not enough to evaluate the impact of agronomical applications barker et al 2003 perry 2011 sharma et al 2015 fereres et al 2017 fernández et al 2020 to decide an appropriate irrigation scheduling will be important in terms of water saving an appropriate wpi and net incomes since the prices of sugar beet sales are determined according to the sugar content of the sugar beet produced to reveal the relationships between yield and amount of irrigation water crop water yield response factor ky wpi net income and water saving will be thus important using lmss for famers and irrigation schemes this study was aimed to improve water saving and productivity based on quotation with sugar percentage of sugar beet using lmss thus the effects of rdi on sugar beet yield wpi net margin and water saving are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were carried out on the lands of transitional zone agricultural research institute in eskişehir central western anatolia region

data during the growing season of sugar beet are given in table 1 dmi 2020 some analysis results of the soils in the experiment site are given in table 2 the values of ph were between 7 4 and 8 0 and thus it was slightly alkaline the soils had a high lime content between 8 0 and 13 0 the level of organic matter was between 0 40 and 1 45 and could be classified as very lower content phosphorus content was sufficient with 4 9 19 00 p mg kg 1 and available potassium was around 120 601 k mg kg 1 for the upper soil layer 0 60 cm 2 2 lineer move sprinkler system and irrigation water the linear move sprinkler system lmss which was run by an electrical motor was used in this experiment this system consisted of the main machine the main aluminum conveying pipes soft polyethylene pipes dosatron for fertilizer fertigation gearbox electronic control panel and direction bar the working width or wing length of the system for this experiment was 60 m however the width of the experimental area including block spaces were 51 m fig 1 the sprinklers were located at the drooping end points of the soft polyethylene pipes connected to the main pipe each sprinkler was connected at every 3 m each experimental plot was irrigated by 3 irrigation sprinklers the irrigation system was operated at a total length of 100 m for this experimental plots figs 1 and 2 in order to provide a uniform and appropriate water distribution in the plots the distance between the sprinklers was placed on the conveying pipes to be at least 65 of the wetting diameter for the other sprinkler keller and bliesner 1990 a flexible hose connected to conveying pipes on the towers of the system body was used during moving for irrigation the linear move sprinkler system was adapted to apply different amounts of water using different moving speeds of the machine klocke et al 2003 the irrigation water used in this experiment was provided from a deep wells there were almost no any problem in terms of irrigation water quality considering the physical and chemical properties of the water 2 3 experimental design and treatments the experimental treatments has been based on different decreasing amount of irrigation water thus 5 different treatments were created and applied using 4 replications the treatments were applied systematically due to the feature of irrigation system used irrigations were applied for every 7 days the existing moisture in the soil depth of 0 90 cm was determined by neutron probe before each irrigation and irrigation water was applied to fill up to the field capacity for full irrigation other regulated deficit irrigation levels were also based on different decreasing percentages of the full irrigation thus the irrigation treatments were applied as i1 full irrigation i2 i1 0 80 i3 i1 0 60 i4 i1 0 40 and i5 i1 0 20 irrigation was ended in the second half of september approximately 15 20 days before the harvest each plot was the width of 9 m and length of 15 m the plot area was thus 135 m2 9 m 15 m fig 1 the lmss had 5 different speed operation modes the depth of the irrigation water applied could be varied by the speed of the moving system working pressure and irrigation head diameter in this experiment the calibration connected to those was performed by fixed the head diameter and the entrance pressure of the irrigation water was 0 3 mpa and the nozzles operating pressure was 0 15 mpa and working speed of the lmss was adjusted to apply the needed amount of irrigation water to the plots the lmss was thus operated from the speed of 60 m h 1 through 160 m h 1 depending on amount of irrigation water applied in the treatments and plots for this a calibration test was performed using catch cans for 5 different speeds of the machine before the experiment was set up thus the amount of water applied was given by irrigation sprinklers to the plots and or catch cans was tested and a curve of water amount and the speed of lmss was created depending on these results the working speed of the machine was adjusted according to the needed amount of irrigation water during the irrigation cycle for example the machine speed was the lowest in the highest application of irrigation water i1 full irrigation and the machine working speed was increased depending on the amount of irrigation water decreased as a result the speed of the machine has been decreased to provide more irrigation water and less irrigation water has been applied by increasing it 2 4 soil water content measurement and irrigation water soil water content were measured using neutron scatter method neutron meter at a depth of 0 120 cm in each layer of 30 cm however the soil water content in the first soil layer of 0 30 cm was measured by gravimetric method the aluminum pipes used for neutron meter measurement were placed in the middle of the plots all measurements were performed from planting date to the harvest date before each irrigation cycle for the neutronmeter calibration different moisture levels were established in the experimental area and neutronmeter measurements were made and all neutron readings were the results of the gravimetric soil water contents thus a neutronmeter calibration equation have been created and it was used to determine soil water content using neutron meter irrigation was applied based on deficit soil moisture in the depth of 0 90 cm considering field capacity thus the eq 1 given below was used to calculate amount of irrigation water all the experimental plots were brought to the field capacity before the first irrigation of the treatments then the treatments were applied 1 d n f c e m d ρ 100 where dn the amount of irrigation water applied mm fc field capacity based on weight em existing soil moisture before irrigation

evapotranspiration was calculated according to the water balance equation taking into account the soil depth of 90 cm jensen et al 1990 2 eta i r dp cp r f δs where eta crop evapotranspiration mm i amount of irrigation water applied mm r effective rainfall mm dp deep percolation mm cp capillary raising mm rf run off mm and δs soil water content variation mm the experimental soils had deeper profile and no any drainage salinity and water table problems under the depth of 2 0 m there was no any also run off because the sprinkling rate and irrigation machine working speed were planned based on soil infiltration rate a capillary water inlet to the root zone was omitted since there was no water table the deep infiltration losses dp were also not taken into account because irrigation water was applied based on field capacity to calculate the yield response to water the factor of ky the equation where relative yield reduction is related to the corresponding relative reduction in evapotranspiration was used stewart et al 1977 3 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya and ym are actual and maximum crop yields corresponding to eta and etm actual and maximum evapotranspiration respectively and ky is crop yield response factor 2 6 water productivity and economical analysis irrigation water productivity wpi was computed as the ratio of total sugar beet yield to irrigation water supply seasonal and water productivity wpc refers the ratio of total sugar beet yield to the crop evapotranspiration net economical water productivity newpi is defined as the ratio of the net margin to irrigation water supply seasonal per land area thus the equations given below are used to calculate wpi eq 4 wpc eq 5 net margin nm eq 6 and newpi eq 7 kijne et al 2003 oweis and hachum 2003 tavakoli et al 2012 sharma et al 2015 pereria et al 2012 cetin and kara 2019 fernández et al 2020 4 w p i y i w a 5 w p c y e t c 6 nm r c 7 n e w p i n m i w a where wpi is irrigation water productivity kg m

unit land area us ha 1 r revenue us ha 1 c is total variable and fix costs us ha 1 and newpi is net economical water productivity us m 3 the net margin for each treatment according to different amount of irrigation water applied and same agronomic treatments was computed by subtracting all the production costs from revenue the cost of lmss was 35 000 us and the economic life of it was 20 years all calculations were performed based 16 ha which could be irrigated by lmss for an irrigation season the cost of investment for the lmss per unit area and per year was derived and then the results were converted to those for 1 ha economic analysis and evaluation were thus computed by using the results of this study based on investment operation and production costs for variable and fix costs there were differences on total water cost depending on different amount irrigation water applied for that reason net margin differences among the treatments were calculated through partial budgeting approach olson 2011 fang et al 2018 cetin and kara 2019 the sales price of sugar beet has been determined by the sugar company based on base sugar content of 16 for each growing season anonymous 2021 this has been taken into account as a base sale price bsp accordingly the sale price of sugar beet which have sugar content of more than 16 was more than bsp if the sugar content of sugar beet was less than 16 actual sale price asp was less than bsp thus an additional fee of 1 16 of the bsp for each sugar content value based on sugar content of 16 and an decreasing fee of 1 16 of the base price for each sugar content lower than sugar content of 16 has been applied the sugar beet actual sale price was determined using the eq 8 given below 8 a s p s c b s p 16 where asp is actual sale price us t 1 sc is sugar content in the sugar beet and bsp is base sale price us t 1 2 7 agricultural applications the experimental land was plowed in autumn and prepared for planting in spring with a cultivator sugar beet seeds were planted at the second week of april for 3 years the sowing was performed with a planting depth of 5 7 cm and used amount of seed of 50 kg ha 1 the seeds were sown with a row spacing of 45 cm and a plant spacing on the row of 15 20 cm weed control was realized by hoeing thus the plants were sparsely spaced on the row of about 30 cm the variety of esperance for seed was used and this variety was resistant to rizommania and cyst nematodes the whole amount of phosphorus fertilizer 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 and half of the nitrogen 7 5 kg n ha 1 were applied into the soil before planting the second half of the nitrogen 7 5 kg n ha 1 was applied ulgen and yurtsever 1988 by fertigation devices during the irrigation the commercial fertilizer sources were diammonium phosphate dap 18 46 and ammonium sulphate an 21 the fertigation was started when the plants had the leaves of 7 8 at the beginning of may and applied up to the beginning of september for each irrigation cycle 7 days in the fertigation the amount of fertilizer to be given in each irrigation was applied separately into the treatment blocks considering experimental plot area for this fertigation device was closed between the blocks out of the treatment plots while the system was running and irrigating the fertigation was started again after the space of blocks were passed of the 20 plant rows in each plot one row from the edges and 0 50 m from the plot were excluded for the evaluation and the remaining plants were harvested on 8 1 m x 15 0 m 121 5 m2 fig 1 the harvests were performed in general at the end of october 2 8 statistical analysis variance analysis was performed to determine the effects of irrigation water on yield and sugar content for each experimental year using spss 10 0 computer package program the associated variance analysis for all experimental years was not performed because there were statistically differences between the experimental years thus the results of each year were evaluated using separately variance analysis duncan s multiple range test was used to reveal statistically differences between the treatments in addition the regression analysis were performed between irrigation water applied and the other dependent variables such as yield and sugar content yurtsever 2011 3 results the emergence development of root and maturity periods of the plants varied between 10 and 19 48 72 and 28 53 days depending on experimental years respectively and the total vegetation period was between 173 and 196 days for the growing seasons the reasons of minor differences on duration of the crop stages could be attributed to the climate conditions irrigation numbers were between 14 and 17 and total amount of irrigation water applied according to treatments in the experimental years are given in table 3 accordingly the amount of irrigation water varied from 170 mm to 852 mm there were no significant differences in the amount of irrigation water applied according to the experimental years considering the same treatments the values of crop water evapotranspiration eta are also given in table 3 crop evapotranspiration in the same treatments according to the experimental years was relatively different unlike irrigation water applied during experimental years the main reason for this was mainly the difference in rainfall and the other climatic data during the vegetation sugar beet yields were varied from 48 0 to 86 3 t ha 1 depending on the experimental years and treatments table 3 the fact that there was a linear relationship between irrigation water and sugar beet yield have showed how important irrigation was for sugar beet according to the results of this study sugar beet yield increased significantly and linearly while irrigation water increased however the rate of decrease in the yield is lower than the rate of decrease in irrigation water the regression curves and equations are given in fig 3 according to the results of variance analysis there was a significant difference 0 01 p among the sugar beet yields in the treatments for all the experimental years the highest sugar beet yield was obtained from the full irrigation in all the experimental years in addition the lowest irrigation level resulted in the least sugar beet yield the results of duncan s multiple range test are also shown in table 3 accordingly the treatment of full irrigation was in the first range during all the experimental years the yield decreased as the irrigation water applied decreased the yields thus placed in the statistically different significant groups according to duncan s multiple range test the sugar content percentage values of sugar beet in the treatments are given in table 3 the sugar content decreased as the amount of irrigation water applied increased and there is thus a contrast relationship between sugar percentage and sugar beet yields the highest percentage value of sugar content occurred in the lowest irrigation level and the least level of it was in the treatment which had highest irrigation level full irrigation the sugar content values varied between 15 and 20 according to the experimental years however the results were higher in 2013 than those in other all experimental years the values of irrigation water productivity wpi and water productivity wpc which are an important indicator of the yields obtained per unit irrigation water and water consumption are given in table 4 the curves obtained for these are given in fig 3 the wpi values are higher than wpc values and wpi values increased as the irrigation water decreased in other words higher wpi was obtained per irrigation water decreased the amount of irrigation water increased sugar beet yield however it significantly decreased the sugar content the values of wpi decreased as the applied irrigation water increased and conversely the economic water productivity of water has increased the yield response factor ky obtained from the regression equation which was versus the relative decreasing yield versus relative decreasing seasonal water consumption was found to be 0 50 this curve and the equation are given in fig 4 the sugar beet yield decreased approximately half unit while the eta decreased one unit thus the seasonal ky was relatively low 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water and yield relations sugar beet could not be cultivated without irrigation due to fact that the study region was a semi arid climatic condition and the lack of rainfall especially during the growing period of sugar beet in this study full irrigation resulted in the highest sugar beet yield thus decreasing irrigation water regulated deficit irrigation rdi reduced relatively throughout yield similarly many studies also pointed to the fact that deficit irrigation causes a significant decrease in root yield of sugar beet ucan and gencoglan 2004 kiziloglu et al 2006 suheri et al 2007 topak et al 2011 tari et al 2016 li et al 2019 on the other hand the sugar content decreased while sugar beet root yield increased by irrigation figs 3 and 5 the average sugar content was 15 8 in full irrigation while it increased to 20 in the most severe deficit irrigation table 3 irrigation significantly affected the sugar beet yield and quality sugar content the optimum sugar beet yield 73 5 t ha 1 was 80 of full irrigation because there was no significant differences on sugar beet yield between full irrigation i1 and deficit irrigation of 20 i2 the sugar content in this treatment was 16 5 table 3 similarly appropriate sugar content 16 3 and root yield 71 7 t ha 1 were found by kıymaz and ertek 2015 under drip irrigation the irrigation water requirement was thus 687 mm under the deficit irrigation of 20 for an optimum yield in this study as similarly indicated by maralian et al 2008 similarly özbay and yildirim 2018 reported the amount of irrigation water by drip irrigation was 553 mm to get an economical yield in case water scarcity exists this study showed that a reasonable deficit irrigation strategy can be applied as it will be discussed in the following parts of article the deficit irrigation seems thus a realistic solution for saving water which means irrigation amount less than total moisture demand at some growth stage of crops du et al 2015 it was also reported in previous studies that the irrigation water applied increased and on the contrary the sugar content of sugar beet was decreased by increasing irrigation water maralian et al 2008 tari et al 2016 haghverdi et al 2017 li et al 2019 accordingly the critical level of deficit irrigation could be decided by evaluating the total sugar production the farmer s net income and iwp in another study irrigation based on 75 etc significantly increased the root length of sugar beet and sugar content abd el all and makhlouf 2017 if water is limited and deficit irrigation is spread over growth season of the sugar beet wpi and wpc may be improved under 20 and 40 deficit irrigation schedule the findings in this study strongly recommend that even up to 25 water deficit in sugar beet would be advantageous if the farmer s goal was to maximize root yield and net income as similar findings by topak et al 2011 in addition considering the requirement of irrigation water of 840 mm for maximum yield of sugar beet carried out previously gungor 1984 the results of this study have revealed the importance of both irrigation water savings and net margin in this study the seasonal ky was 0 5 fig 4 however seasonal ky for sugar beet was found to be 0 98 kiziloglu et al 2006 0 93 topak et al 2011 1 0 utset et al 2007 1 01 shrestha et al 2010 0 73 1 32 ucan and gencoglan 2004 in the different regions the reason of the lower ky compared to the previous studies could be attributed different frequency of irrigation cycles climatic characteristic and other agronomic practices on the other hand pejić et al 2011 and kiymaz and ertek 2015 found to be 0 45 and 0 56 of crop response factor in the growing period as similar results in our study respectively thus crop yield response factor ky could be varied depending on climate conditions different geographical regions agricultural and agronomic practices and irrigation methods as mentioned before to better understanding the effects of the irrigation thresholds on effects during seasonal water shortages and how much stress the sugar beet can withstand there is a need to evaluate the effects of water deficit on physiological responses during sugar beet growth to maximize yield and promote water saving and net income li et al 2019 thus iwp can be increased by practicing rdi improving irrigation technology irrigation scheduling and improving agronomic practices that lead to yield increase hassanli et al 2010 4 2 water productivity and economic analysis sugar beet growers or irrigation scheme want to get more profit using irrigation water however irrigation water which is a limited resource is also an agricultural input as an economic value thus wpi and net margin per land should be considered together to determine the optimum level of irrigation water applied with this system when other production costs remain constant fig 3 shows that increasing irrigation water increased the yield however increasing irrigation water decreased wpi values fig 5 in addition it could be non beneficial condition after a certain and critical level of increasing water the irrigation authorities or decision makers want wpi to be at the highest level more production per unit amount of water in case irrigation water is insufficient or limited because deficit irrigation decreased crop yields at some degree and it significantly increased wpi cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 and increased sugar content mehrandish et al 2012 however the farmers wants to get a higher yield to get more profit in this case it is necessary to make a decision with a scientific approach in other word this approach may be important considering the maximum level of the production versus per irrigation unit this is considerably important for irrigation authorities or decision makers when water resources are limited however this consideration may not always be appropriate in terms of farmers or irrigation scheme profit in this case the net margin level should be considered and decided if there is no severe and or compulsory insufficiency of irrigation water thus it must be taken into consideration together wpi net margin and newpi fernández et al 2020 although full irrigation i1 842 mm provided the highest sugar beet yield 73 5 t ha 1 it did not resulted in the highest net margin the amount of irrigation water i2 687 mm which was less than about 18 compared to the full irrigation level resulted in the highest net margin 1221 ha 1 the main reasons of this were a yield decrease of only 5 versus water decrease about 18 and more the sale price of sugar beet than those in the treatment of i2 because of the higher sugar content table 3 fig 5 the third range of the net income 1074 ha 1 was in the treatment of i3 although the amount of irrigation water was less about 37 than full irrigation in this treatment the net margin was less 11 than the highest net margin if there is any insufficient water and or severe drought to decrease about 20 of water compared to i2 could be adoptable for irrigation schemes and farmers because the net income obtained in case of deficit irrigation will not be still less than 42 of the total costs thus quotation of sugar beet according to sugar content is thus very important for both net margin and water saving the main inputs including other variable costs are investment cost for lmss and water cost table 5 i e energy charges the results showed that the farmers can obtain desired net margin although all these costs of inputs are higher compared to other irrigation systems such as fixed sprinkler irrigation tables 4 and 5 thus use of lmss is an applicable at farmers and district level to optimize use of irrigation water newpi and net margin on the other hand the sugar company has standardized the sale price of sugar beet based on sugar content of 16 accordingly if the sugar content is less than 16 the sale price decreases at a decreasing rate of it and the sale price increases if the sugar content is more than 16 the farmers always want to get the highest yield but it is also important to reveal the relationship between sugar content and irrigation which has the most important place in sugar beet growing inputs accordingly it will be important to know how the pricing of production obtained according to sugar beet sugar content and full irrigation and or deficit irrigation strategies affect farmer income newpiis an important indicator showing how much production is produced per amount of irrigation water however it is not sufficient unique for sustainable agriculture for this reason irrigation practices or irrigation strategies are also important in terms of the farmers net margin however farmers need to know up to what point they can decrease irrigation water in case of a possible insufficient water quotation with sugar content of sugar beet affected directly net margin and amount of irrigation water level for optimum net margin and determination of optimum water use the actual sale price increased as the sugar content of sugar beet according to the applied pricing policy fig 6 accordingly the highest yield of sugar beet using full irrigation did not provide the highest net income because the sugar content was lower at the higher irrigation levels table 5 and fig 5 this result has enabled that the farmers could optimize both net margin and irrigation water used this is important for sustainable use of irrigation water and economic net return for farmers and irrigation schemes as a result the main factors affecting net margin are the increased yield with irrigation and sugar content of sugar beet however in order to optimize the irrigation management and the net margin it has been concluded that the some deficit irrigation 20 compared to full irrigation must be applied 5 conclusion the yield response factor ky using linear move sprinkler irrigation was found to be 0 50 the main reason of the lower of the ky could be to be by frequently irrigation and climatic characteristics full irrigation 842 mm using a linear move sprinkler irrigation system resulted in the highest sugar beet yield 77 8 t ha 1 but did not provide the highest net income the main reason for this was that the sugar content of sugar beet 15 8 decreased with increasing irrigation water and the sugar beet sale price was determined according to the sugar content this also enabled the lower amount of irrigation water 687 mm of 20 lower than full irrigation 842 mm in this treatment irrigation water yield sugar content and net margin were 687 mm 73 5 t ha 1 16 5 and 1221 us ha 1 respectively according to the average results of a 3 year in the study sugar beet could be irrigated by lmss in irrigation interval of 7 10 days and applying water of 45 65 mm for each irrigation cycle taking a minor loss of income into account an appropriate net margin 1074 us ha 1 could be obtained using irrigation water less than 40 of full irrigation the net margin in this treatment was still more than about 40 of total cost if there might be a severe shortage of irrigation water as a result the net margin is mainly depended on the irrigation water applied because the increased level of irrigation water increased the yield although the sugar content decreased relatively however total amount of sugar increased even if the sugar content decreased depending on increasing amount of irrigation water and yield thus net margin increased depending on increasing irrigation water even if the unit price decreased depends on decreasing sugar content considering the decreasing water resources the quotation of the sugar beet sale price according to the sugar content and the increase in the sugar content in the lower irrigation water application showed that significant water savings can be practiced in irrigation water without much loss of income as a result determining irrigation water yield relationships product quality indicators sugar content and sale price rather than the total highest yield obtained has been extremely important in terms of the sustainability of water resources and farmer profit in addition irrigation water productivity net margin and net economic water productivity must be taken into account together for an optimization of the irrigation schedule the further studies should be focused on

9961,this study was aimed to improve water saving and economic productivity based on quotation with sugar percentage of sugar beet beta vulgaris l using linear move sprinkler system lmss the experiments were carried out in western central anatolia region of turkey during the growing seasons of 2012 2014 for 3 years the irrigation treatments were applied as i1 full irrigation i2 i1 0 80 i3 i1 0 60 i4 i1 0 40 and i5 i1 0 20 using 4 replications and systematically arranged due to the feature of lmss the i1 was based on deficit soil moisture in the soil depth of 90 cm according to the field capacity for each 7 days different regulated deficit irrigation levels were thus created for each irrigation cycle based on i1 the seasonal yield response factor ky was 0 50 the main reason of the lower of the ky could be because of frequent irrigation and climatic characteristics full irrigation 842 mm resulted in the highest sugar beet yield 77 8 t ha 1 but did not provide the highest net margin the main reason for this was that the sugar content of sugar beet decreased with increasing irrigation water and the sugar beet sales price was determined according to the sugar content this also enabled the lower amount of irrigation water 687 mm of 20 lower than full irrigation 842 mm irrigation water yield sugar content and net margin were thus 687 mm 73 5 t ha 1 16 5 and 1221 us ha 1 respectively sugar beet could be irrigated using lmss in high profitability in irrigation interval of 7 10 days and applying water of 45 65 mm for each irrigation cycle an appropriate net margin 1074 us ha 1 could be obtained using irrigation water less than 40 of full irrigation in case of limited water because net income was still more than about 40 of total cost the quotation of the sugar beet sales price according to the sugar content and the increase in the sugar content in the lower irrigation showed that significant water savings can be practiced in irrigation water without much loss of income graphical abstract the relationships between net margin nm actual sale price asp sugar content sc and irrigation water productivity wpi versus amount of irrigation water applied for sugar beet using linear move sprinkler irrigation ga1 keywords sugar beet quotation sugar content linear move sprinkler water saving net margin 1 introduction sugar production in the world is provided by 76 from sugar cane and 24 from sugar beet beta vulgaris l all of the sugar production in turkey is provided by sugar beet anonymous 2020 sugar beet is thus a major commercial field crop under irrigated conditions in turkey kıymaz and ertek 2015 the total cultivation area the total production and the yield are 310 000 ha 18 million tons and 58 2 t ha 1 respectively anonymous 2020 sugar beet consumes 500 800 mm of water during the growing period the seasonal water requirements depend on irrigation crop management climate and weather conditions planting density and date steduto et al 2012 sugar beet needs thus high water requirements because of high yield potential and long growing season zarski et al 2020 irrigation water requirement and crop evapotranspiration for sugar beet irrigated by furrow irrigation in the same study area were 840 mm and 1008 mm respectively gungor 1984 however the most challenge for irrigated agriculture is limited and inadequacy of water resources li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 memon et al 2021 the sugar beet had been irrigated mostly by border and or furrow irrigation up to 1980s in turkey the pressurized irrigation systems almost fixed sprinkler irrigation has been used today however drip and some moving sprinkler systems center pivot or linear sprinkler have been rarely used even in all those less than 5 are not common the types of irrigation systems has increased year by year due to many different reasons such as developing irrigation technology farmer conditions labor irrigation efficiency and water saving one of these linear move sprinkler system lmss has a higher application uniformity by adjusting the movement speed james 1993 the moving irrigation systems such as center pivot or linear move systems can easily irrigate large fields with relatively low labor and energy costs and they are also adaptable to different and changing management objectives sadeghi et al 2015 the moving sprinkler system could be worked properly in helping the sugar beets to germinate and break up any crust that may be preventing emergence thus linear move irrigation systems were developed to increase irrigation efficiencies and reduce irrigation labor costs klocke et al 2003 on the other hand the appropriate management of irrigation for a specified irrigation system is vital important to use efficiently water resources and to maximize food production per water volume irrigation scheduling is thus one of the most important tools in the development of best management practices for irrigated areas kıymaz and ertek 2015 in the arid and semi arid climate zones sugar beet irrigation is basic agronomic management therefore considerable scientific research focuses on introducing new water and energy saving irrigation systems and obtaining more precise irrigation schedules and control methods topak et al 2011 tognetti et al 2003 hassanli et al 2010 barzegari et al 2017 considering water scarcity conditions deficit irrigation di is one optimized solution for the cultivation of products and the product can be increased per unit of irrigation water sepaskhah et al 2006 the di irrigation is thus a precious production strategy commonly used in water shortage areas it maximizes the water productivity but a certain yield reduction is observed compared to the full irrigation geerts and raes 2009 sahin et al 2014 thus regulated deficit irrigation rdi the practice of applying an amount of water that is less than the required for optimal plant growth has a number of benefits including reduction of water consumption improvement in plant response to water deficit and increase of crop water productivity li et al 2019 the effect of water deficit on plant function can range from mild to severe depending on the degree and timing of the deficit tarkalson and king 2017 irrigation water productivity wpi is defined as the crop production per each irrigation water used the wpi and sugar content decrease while sugar beet yield and or production is significantly increased by irrigation water applied maralian et al 2008 topak et al 2011 tari et al 2016 li et al 2019 on the one hand the farmers and irrigation schemes want to have the highest income thus the irrigator or farmer must take into account both the farm income and water productivity for an optimum and sustainable irrigation management for this some indicators or indexes on both water productivity and the economic performance of irrigation are required at field scale pereria et al 2012 levidow et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 however the farmer must optimize water productivity not maximize all time it barker et al 2003 because besides irrigation water saving the income is also important for the farmer thus wp is not enough to evaluate the impact of agronomical applications barker et al 2003 perry 2011 sharma et al 2015 fereres et al 2017 fernández et al 2020 to decide an appropriate irrigation scheduling will be important in terms of water saving an appropriate wpi and net incomes since the prices of sugar beet sales are determined according to the sugar content of the sugar beet produced to reveal the relationships between yield and amount of irrigation water crop water yield response factor ky wpi net income and water saving will be thus important using lmss for famers and irrigation schemes this study was aimed to improve water saving and productivity based on quotation with sugar percentage of sugar beet using lmss thus the effects of rdi on sugar beet yield wpi net margin and water saving are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were carried out on the lands of transitional zone agricultural research institute in eskişehir central western anatolia region of turkey during the growing seasons of 2012 2014 for 3 years considering the growing agronomy of sugar beets the places of the experimental plots have been changed every year the research site was at latitude of 39 46 n longitude of 30 32 e and the altitude was1017 m the climatic characteristic was in continental climatic zone in general summers were hot and dry winters were cold and snowy annual average temperature annual average rainfall evaporation and annual average relative humidity were 10 7 c 343 mm 976 mm and 62 respectively for the long term 1957 2005 in addition some meteorological data during the growing season of sugar beet are given in table 1 dmi 2020 some analysis results of the soils in the experiment site are given in table 2 the values of ph were between 7 4 and 8 0 and thus it was slightly alkaline the soils had a high lime content between 8 0 and 13 0 the level of organic matter was between 0 40 and 1 45 and could be classified as very lower content phosphorus content was sufficient with 4 9 19 00 p mg kg 1 and available potassium was around 120 601 k mg kg 1 for the upper soil layer 0 60 cm 2 2 lineer move sprinkler system and irrigation water the linear move sprinkler system lmss which was run by an electrical motor was used in this experiment this system consisted of the main machine the main aluminum conveying pipes soft polyethylene pipes dosatron for fertilizer fertigation gearbox electronic control panel and direction bar the working width or wing length of the system for this experiment was 60 m however the width of the experimental area including block spaces were 51 m fig 1 the sprinklers were located at the drooping end points of the soft polyethylene pipes connected to the main pipe each sprinkler was connected at every 3 m each experimental plot was irrigated by 3 irrigation sprinklers the irrigation system was operated at a total length of 100 m for this experimental plots figs 1 and 2 in order to provide a uniform and appropriate water distribution in the plots the distance between the sprinklers was placed on the conveying pipes to be at least 65 of the wetting diameter for the other sprinkler keller and bliesner 1990 a flexible hose connected to conveying pipes on the towers of the system body was used during moving for irrigation the linear move sprinkler system was adapted to apply different amounts of water using different moving speeds of the machine klocke et al 2003 the irrigation water used in this experiment was provided from a deep wells there were almost no any problem in terms of irrigation water quality considering the physical and chemical properties of the water 2 3 experimental design and treatments the experimental treatments has been based on different decreasing amount of irrigation water thus 5 different treatments were created and applied using 4 replications the treatments were applied systematically due to the feature of irrigation system used irrigations were applied for every 7 days the existing moisture in the soil depth of 0 90 cm was determined by neutron probe before each irrigation and irrigation water was applied to fill up to the field capacity for full irrigation other regulated deficit irrigation levels were also based on different decreasing percentages of the full irrigation thus the irrigation treatments were applied as i1 full irrigation i2 i1 0 80 i3 i1 0 60 i4 i1 0 40 and i5 i1 0 20 irrigation was ended in the second half of september approximately 15 20 days before the harvest each plot was the width of 9 m and length of 15 m the plot area was thus 135 m2 9 m 15 m fig 1 the lmss had 5 different speed operation modes the depth of the irrigation water applied could be varied by the speed of the moving system working pressure and irrigation head diameter in this experiment the calibration connected to those was performed by fixed the head diameter and the entrance pressure of the irrigation water was 0 3 mpa and the nozzles operating pressure was 0 15 mpa and working speed of the lmss was adjusted to apply the needed amount of irrigation water to the plots the lmss was thus operated from the speed of 60 m h 1 through 160 m h 1 depending on amount of irrigation water applied in the treatments and plots for this a calibration test was performed using catch cans for 5 different speeds of the machine before the experiment was set up thus the amount of water applied was given by irrigation sprinklers to the plots and or catch cans was tested and a curve of water amount and the speed of lmss was created depending on these results the working speed of the machine was adjusted according to the needed amount of irrigation water during the irrigation cycle for example the machine speed was the lowest in the highest application of irrigation water i1 full irrigation and the machine working speed was increased depending on the amount of irrigation water decreased as a result the speed of the machine has been decreased to provide more irrigation water and less irrigation water has been applied by increasing it 2 4 soil water content measurement and irrigation water soil water content were measured using neutron scatter method neutron meter at a depth of 0 120 cm in each layer of 30 cm however the soil water content in the first soil layer of 0 30 cm was measured by gravimetric method the aluminum pipes used for neutron meter measurement were placed in the middle of the plots all measurements were performed from planting date to the harvest date before each irrigation cycle for the neutronmeter calibration different moisture levels were established in the experimental area and neutronmeter measurements were made and all neutron readings were the results of the gravimetric soil water contents thus a neutronmeter calibration equation have been created and it was used to determine soil water content using neutron meter irrigation was applied based on deficit soil moisture in the depth of 0 90 cm considering field capacity thus the eq 1 given below was used to calculate amount of irrigation water all the experimental plots were brought to the field capacity before the first irrigation of the treatments then the treatments were applied 1 d n f c e m d ρ 100 where dn the amount of irrigation water applied mm fc field capacity based on weight em existing soil moisture before irrigation cycle for the soil depth of 0 90 cm based on weight d soil depth for irrigation 90 cm and ρ is soil bulk density g cm 3 2 5 crop evapotranspiration and crop yield response factor ky the crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to the water balance equation taking into account the soil depth of 90 cm jensen et al 1990 2 eta i r dp cp r f δs where eta crop evapotranspiration mm i amount of irrigation water applied mm r effective rainfall mm dp deep percolation mm cp capillary raising mm rf run off mm and δs soil water content variation mm the experimental soils had deeper profile and no any drainage salinity and water table problems under the depth of 2 0 m there was no any also run off because the sprinkling rate and irrigation machine working speed were planned based on soil infiltration rate a capillary water inlet to the root zone was omitted since there was no water table the deep infiltration losses dp were also not taken into account because irrigation water was applied based on field capacity to calculate the yield response to water the factor of ky the equation where relative yield reduction is related to the corresponding relative reduction in evapotranspiration was used stewart et al 1977 3 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where ya and ym are actual and maximum crop yields corresponding to eta and etm actual and maximum evapotranspiration respectively and ky is crop yield response factor 2 6 water productivity and economical analysis irrigation water productivity wpi was computed as the ratio of total sugar beet yield to irrigation water supply seasonal and water productivity wpc refers the ratio of total sugar beet yield to the crop evapotranspiration net economical water productivity newpi is defined as the ratio of the net margin to irrigation water supply seasonal per land area thus the equations given below are used to calculate wpi eq 4 wpc eq 5 net margin nm eq 6 and newpi eq 7 kijne et al 2003 oweis and hachum 2003 tavakoli et al 2012 sharma et al 2015 pereria et al 2012 cetin and kara 2019 fernández et al 2020 4 w p i y i w a 5 w p c y e t c 6 nm r c 7 n e w p i n m i w a where wpi is irrigation water productivity kg m

unit land area us ha 1 r revenue us ha 1 c is total variable and fix costs us ha 1 and newpi is net economical water productivity us m 3 the net margin for each treatment according to different amount of irrigation water applied and same agronomic treatments was computed by subtracting all the production costs from revenue the cost of lmss was 35 000 us and the economic life of it was 20 years all calculations were performed based 16 ha which could be irrigated by lmss for an irrigation season the cost of investment for the lmss per unit area and per year was derived and then the results were converted to those for 1 ha economic analysis and evaluation were thus computed by using the results of this study based on investment operation and production costs for variable and fix costs there were differences on total water cost depending on different amount irrigation water applied for that reason net margin differences among the treatments were calculated through partial budgeting approach olson 2011 fang et al 2018 cetin and kara 2019 the sales price of sugar beet has been determined by the sugar company based on base sugar content of 16 for each growing season anonymous 2021 this has been taken into account as a base sale price bsp accordingly the sale price of sugar beet which have sugar content of more than 16 was more than bsp if the sugar content of sugar beet was less than 16 actual sale price asp was less than bsp thus an additional fee of 1 16 of the bsp for each sugar content value based on sugar content of 16 and an decreasing fee of 1 16 of the base price for each sugar content lower than sugar content of 16 has been applied the sugar beet actual sale price was determined using the eq 8 given below 8 a s p s c b s p 16 where asp is actual sale price us t 1 sc is sugar content in the sugar beet and bsp is base sale price us t 1 2 7 agricultural applications the experimental land was plowed in autumn and prepared for planting in spring with a cultivator sugar beet seeds were planted at the second week of april for 3 years the sowing was performed with a planting depth of 5 7 cm and used amount of seed of 50 kg ha 1 the seeds were sown with a row spacing of 45 cm and a plant spacing on the row of 15 20 cm weed control was realized by hoeing thus the plants were sparsely spaced on the row of about 30 cm the variety of esperance for seed was used and this variety was resistant to rizommania and cyst nematodes the whole amount of phosphorus fertilizer 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 and half of the nitrogen 7 5 kg n ha 1 were applied into the soil before planting the second half of the nitrogen 7 5 kg n ha 1 was applied ulgen and yurtsever 1988 by fertigation devices during the irrigation the commercial fertilizer sources were diammonium phosphate dap 18 46 and ammonium sulphate an 21 the fertigation was started when the plants had the leaves of 7 8 at the beginning of may and applied up to the beginning of september for each irrigation cycle 7 days in the fertigation the amount of fertilizer to be given in each irrigation was applied separately into the treatment blocks considering experimental plot area for this fertigation device was closed between the blocks out of the treatment plots while the system was running and irrigating the fertigation was started again after the space of blocks were passed of the 20 plant rows in each plot one row from the edges and 0 50 m from the plot were excluded for the evaluation and the remaining plants were harvested on 8 1 m x 15 0 m 121 5 m2 fig 1 the harvests were performed in general at the end of october 2 8 statistical analysis variance analysis was performed to determine the effects of irrigation water on yield and sugar content for each experimental year using spss 10 0 computer package program the associated variance analysis for all experimental years was not performed because there were statistically differences between the experimental years thus the results of each year were evaluated using separately variance analysis duncan s multiple range test was used to reveal statistically differences between the treatments in addition the regression analysis were performed between irrigation water applied and the other dependent variables such as yield and sugar content yurtsever 2011 3 results the emergence development of root and maturity periods of the plants varied between 10 and 19 48 72 and 28 53 days depending on experimental years respectively and the total vegetation period was between 173 and 196 days for the growing seasons the reasons of minor differences on duration of the crop stages could be attributed to the climate conditions irrigation numbers were between 14 and 17 and total amount of irrigation water applied according to treatments in the experimental years are given in table 3 accordingly the amount of irrigation water varied from 170 mm to 852 mm there were no significant differences in the amount of irrigation water applied according to the experimental years considering the same treatments the values of crop water evapotranspiration eta are also given in table 3 crop evapotranspiration in the same treatments according to the experimental years was relatively different unlike irrigation water applied during experimental years the main reason for this was mainly the difference in rainfall and the other climatic data during the vegetation sugar beet yields were varied from 48 0 to 86 3 t ha 1 depending on the experimental years and treatments table 3 the fact that there was a linear relationship between irrigation water and sugar beet yield have showed how important irrigation was for sugar beet according to the results of this study sugar beet yield increased significantly and linearly while irrigation water increased however the rate of decrease in the yield is lower than the rate of decrease in irrigation water the regression curves and equations are given in fig 3 according to the results of variance analysis there was a significant difference 0 01 p among the sugar beet yields in the treatments for all the experimental years the highest sugar beet yield was obtained from the full irrigation in all the experimental years in addition the lowest irrigation level resulted in the least sugar beet yield the results of duncan s multiple range test are also shown in table 3 accordingly the treatment of full irrigation was in the first range during all the experimental years the yield decreased as the irrigation water applied decreased the yields thus placed in the statistically different significant groups according to duncan s multiple range test the sugar content percentage values of sugar beet in the treatments are given in table 3 the sugar content decreased as the amount of irrigation water applied increased and there is thus a contrast relationship between sugar percentage and sugar beet yields the highest percentage value of sugar content occurred in the lowest irrigation level and the least level of it was in the treatment which had highest irrigation level full irrigation the sugar content values varied between 15 and 20 according to the experimental years however the results were higher in 2013 than those in other all experimental years the values of irrigation water productivity wpi and water productivity wpc which are an important indicator of the yields obtained per unit irrigation water and water consumption are given in table 4 the curves obtained for these are given in fig 3 the wpi values are higher than wpc values and wpi values increased as the irrigation water decreased in other words higher wpi was obtained per irrigation water decreased the amount of irrigation water increased sugar beet yield however it significantly decreased the sugar content the values of wpi decreased as the applied irrigation water increased and conversely the economic water productivity of water has increased the yield response factor ky obtained from the regression equation which was versus the relative decreasing yield versus relative decreasing seasonal water consumption was found to be 0 50 this curve and the equation are given in fig 4 the sugar beet yield decreased approximately half unit while the eta decreased one unit thus the seasonal ky was relatively low 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water and yield relations sugar beet could not be cultivated without irrigation due to fact that the study region was a semi arid climatic condition and the lack of rainfall especially during the growing period of sugar beet in this study full irrigation resulted in the highest sugar beet yield thus decreasing irrigation water regulated deficit irrigation rdi reduced relatively throughout yield similarly many studies also pointed to the fact that deficit irrigation causes a significant decrease in root yield of sugar beet ucan and gencoglan 2004 kiziloglu et al 2006 suheri et al 2007 topak et al 2011 tari et al 2016 li et al 2019 on the other hand the sugar content decreased while sugar beet root yield increased by irrigation figs 3 and 5 the average sugar content was 15 8 in full irrigation while it increased to 20 in the most severe deficit irrigation table 3 irrigation significantly affected the sugar beet yield and quality sugar content the optimum sugar beet yield 73 5 t ha 1 was 80 of full irrigation because there was no significant differences on sugar beet yield between full irrigation i1 and deficit irrigation of 20 i2 the sugar content in this treatment was 16 5 table 3 similarly appropriate sugar content 16 3 and root yield 71 7 t ha 1 were found by kıymaz and ertek 2015 under drip irrigation the irrigation water requirement was thus 687 mm under the deficit irrigation of 20 for an optimum yield in this study as similarly indicated by maralian et al 2008 similarly özbay and yildirim 2018 reported the amount of irrigation water by drip irrigation was 553 mm to get an economical yield in case water scarcity exists this study showed that a reasonable deficit irrigation strategy can be applied as it will be discussed in the following parts of article the deficit irrigation seems thus a realistic solution for saving water which means irrigation amount less than total moisture demand at some growth stage of crops du et al 2015 it was also reported in previous studies that the irrigation water applied increased and on the contrary the sugar content of sugar beet was decreased by increasing irrigation water maralian et al 2008 tari et al 2016 haghverdi et al 2017 li et al 2019 accordingly the critical level of deficit irrigation could be decided by evaluating the total sugar production the farmer s net income and iwp in another study irrigation based on 75 etc significantly increased the root length of sugar beet and sugar content abd el all and makhlouf 2017 if water is limited and deficit irrigation is spread over growth season of the sugar beet wpi and wpc may be improved under 20 and 40 deficit irrigation schedule the findings in this study strongly recommend that even up to 25 water deficit in sugar beet would be advantageous if the farmer s goal was to maximize root yield and net income as similar findings by topak et al 2011 in addition considering the requirement of irrigation water of 840 mm for maximum yield of sugar beet carried out previously gungor 1984 the results of this study have revealed the importance of both irrigation water savings and net margin in this study the seasonal ky was 0 5 fig 4 however seasonal ky for sugar beet was found to be 0 98 kiziloglu et al 2006 0 93 topak et al 2011 1 0 utset et al 2007 1 01 shrestha et al 2010 0 73 1 32 ucan and gencoglan 2004 in the different regions the reason of the lower ky compared to the previous studies could be attributed different frequency of irrigation cycles climatic characteristic and other agronomic practices on the other hand pejić et al 2011 and kiymaz and ertek 2015 found to be 0 45 and 0 56 of crop response factor in the growing period as similar results in our study respectively thus crop yield response factor ky could be varied depending on climate conditions different geographical regions agricultural and agronomic practices and irrigation methods as mentioned before to better understanding the effects of the irrigation thresholds on effects during seasonal water shortages and how much stress the sugar beet can withstand there is a need to evaluate the effects of water deficit on physiological responses during sugar beet growth to maximize yield and promote water saving and net income li et al 2019 thus iwp can be increased by practicing rdi improving irrigation technology irrigation scheduling and improving agronomic practices that lead to yield increase hassanli et al 2010 4 2 water productivity and economic analysis sugar beet growers or irrigation scheme want to get more profit using irrigation water however irrigation water which is a limited resource is also an agricultural input as an economic value thus wpi and net margin per land should be considered together to determine the optimum level of irrigation water applied with this system when other production costs remain constant fig 3 shows that increasing irrigation water increased the yield however increasing irrigation water decreased wpi values fig 5 in addition it could be non beneficial condition after a certain and critical level of increasing water the irrigation authorities or decision makers want wpi to be at the highest level more production per unit amount of water in case irrigation water is insufficient or limited because deficit irrigation decreased crop yields at some degree and it significantly increased wpi cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 and increased sugar content mehrandish et al 2012 however the farmers wants to get a higher yield to get more profit in this case it is necessary to make a decision with a scientific approach in other word this approach may be important considering the maximum level of the production versus per irrigation unit this is considerably important for irrigation authorities or decision makers when water resources are limited however this consideration may not always be appropriate in terms of farmers or irrigation scheme profit in this case the net margin level should be considered and decided if there is no severe and or compulsory insufficiency of irrigation water thus it must be taken into consideration together wpi net margin and newpi fernández et al 2020 although full irrigation i1 842 mm provided the highest sugar beet yield 73 5 t ha 1 it did not resulted in the highest net margin the amount of irrigation water i2 687 mm which was less than about 18 compared to the full irrigation level resulted in the highest net margin 1221 ha 1 the main reasons of this were a yield decrease of only 5 versus water decrease about 18 and more the sale price of sugar beet than those in the treatment of i2 because of the higher sugar content table 3 fig 5 the third range of the net income 1074 ha 1 was in the treatment of i3 although the amount of irrigation water was less about 37 than full irrigation in this treatment the net margin was less 11 than the highest net margin if there is any insufficient water and or severe drought to decrease about 20 of water compared to i2 could be adoptable for irrigation schemes and farmers because the net income obtained in case of deficit irrigation will not be still less than 42 of the total costs thus quotation of sugar beet according to sugar content is thus very important for both net margin and water saving the main inputs including other variable costs are investment cost for lmss and water cost table 5 i e energy charges the results showed that the farmers can obtain desired net margin although all these costs of inputs are higher compared to other irrigation systems such as fixed sprinkler irrigation tables 4 and 5 thus use of lmss is an applicable at farmers and district level to optimize use of irrigation water newpi and net margin on the other hand the sugar company has standardized the sale price of sugar beet based on sugar content of 16 accordingly if the sugar content is less than 16 the sale price decreases at a decreasing rate of it and the sale price increases if the sugar content is more than 16 the farmers always want to get the highest yield but it is also important to reveal the relationship between sugar content and irrigation which has the most important place in sugar beet growing inputs accordingly it will be important to know how the pricing of production obtained according to sugar beet sugar content and full irrigation and or deficit irrigation strategies affect farmer income newpiis an important indicator showing how much production is produced per amount of irrigation water however it is not sufficient unique for sustainable agriculture for this reason irrigation practices or irrigation strategies are also important in terms of the farmers net margin however farmers need to know up to what point they can decrease irrigation water in case of a possible insufficient water quotation with sugar content of sugar beet affected directly net margin and amount of irrigation water level for optimum net margin and determination of optimum water use the actual sale price increased as the sugar content of sugar beet according to the applied pricing policy fig 6 accordingly the highest yield of sugar beet using full irrigation did not provide the highest net income because the sugar content was lower at the higher irrigation levels table 5 and fig 5 this result has enabled that the farmers could optimize both net margin and irrigation water used this is important for sustainable use of irrigation water and economic net return for farmers and irrigation schemes as a result the main factors affecting net margin are the increased yield with irrigation and sugar content of sugar beet however in order to optimize the irrigation management and the net margin it has been concluded that the some deficit irrigation 20 compared to full irrigation must be applied 5 conclusion the yield response factor ky using linear move sprinkler irrigation was found to be 0 50 the main reason of the lower of the ky could be to be by frequently irrigation and climatic characteristics full irrigation 842 mm using a linear move sprinkler irrigation system resulted in the highest sugar beet yield 77 8 t ha 1 but did not provide the highest net income the main reason for this was that the sugar content of sugar beet 15 8 decreased with increasing irrigation water and the sugar beet sale price was determined according to the sugar content this also enabled the lower amount of irrigation water 687 mm of 20 lower than full irrigation 842 mm in this treatment irrigation water yield sugar content and net margin were 687 mm 73 5 t ha 1 16 5 and 1221 us ha 1 respectively according to the average results of a 3 year in the study sugar beet could be irrigated by lmss in irrigation interval of 7 10 days and applying water of 45 65 mm for each irrigation cycle taking a minor loss of income into account an appropriate net margin 1074 us ha 1 could be obtained using irrigation water less than 40 of full irrigation the net margin in this treatment was still more than about 40 of total cost if there might be a severe shortage of irrigation water as a result the net margin is mainly depended on the irrigation water applied because the increased level of irrigation water increased the yield although the sugar content decreased relatively however total amount of sugar increased even if the sugar content decreased depending on increasing amount of irrigation water and yield thus net margin increased depending on increasing irrigation water even if the unit price decreased depends on decreasing sugar content considering the decreasing water resources the quotation of the sugar beet sale price according to the sugar content and the increase in the sugar content in the lower irrigation water application showed that significant water savings can be practiced in irrigation water without much loss of income as a result determining irrigation water yield relationships product quality indicators sugar content and sale price rather than the total highest yield obtained has been extremely important in terms of the sustainability of water resources and farmer profit in addition irrigation water productivity net margin and net economic water productivity must be taken into account together for an optimization of the irrigation schedule the further studies should be focused on drip irrigation because it is one of the methods saves irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9962,in view of water shortages the development and utilization of unconventional water resources have been studied extensively treated domestic or industrial wastewater used for agricultural irrigation is an unconventional water resource utilization method due to the particularities of water sources previous studies have mainly focused on changes in soil heavy metals microorganisms and organic substances and crop responses to toxic elements thus attention to soil salinity is of secondary importance after selecting qualifying research a meta analysis was performed to statistically analyze the data of seven variables potassium k sodium na calcium ca magnesium mg electrical conductivity ec ph and yield to 1 estimate the mean effects of treated wastewater tww irrigation on the soil salinity soil ph and crop yield and 2 identify the wastewater treatment grade primary treated wastewater ptw secondary treated wastewater stw and tertiary treated wastewater ttw and soil texture sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture that benefit tww irrigation the results showed that tww irrigation caused a significant accumulation of soil salinity and the increase in cation content from high to low was k 90 1 na 59 9 mg 25 2 and ca 17 3 ec also increased significantly by approximately 57 2 while there was no significant change in ph and even the crop yield presented an average reduction of nearly 6 5 ptw contributed to the largest salt accumulation followed by ttw and stw stw showed a significant increase in ec but did not show a significant change for the four ions in terms of yield stw can increase yield while ttw has the opposite effect in general the sandier the soil texture the higher is the salt content detected although the retention of salt in loamy textured soil may differ depending on the ions the yield of crops grown increased in the clayey textured soil and decreased in the loamy textured soil our study elucidated the response of soil salinity accumulation under tww irrigation and could provide a reference for unconventional water resource utilization keywords soil salinity crop yield treated wastewater irrigation wastewater treatment grade soil texture 1 introduction as the largest water consumer in the world the agriculture industry accounts for more than two thirds of the total water use worldwide however many irrigation areas in semiarid regions are at risk of water shortages garcia caparros et al 2017 furthermore population growth has increased the competition for water resource utilization between municipal use and agriculture however with rapid urbanization increases in water demand and wastewater discharge raise the possibility of wastewater reuse lyu et al 2016 from this perspective treated wastewater tww irrigation represents a solution to the growing shortage of agricultural water resources wastewater from wastewater treatment facilities reused for irrigation generates substantial economic and water conservation benefits in the southwestern united states more than one third of golf courses use recycled water for irrigation throssell et al 2009 globally treated wastewater has become an important irrigation water resource oki and kanae 2006 tran et al 2016 although the reuse of wastewater can help meet the demand for water in agriculture levine and asano 2004 it carries both agronomic and environmental risks that should be given more consideration efforts to reduce costs or limitations in the level of technology lead to the incomplete removal of pollutants from tww destined for reuse therefore such water retains abundant nitrogen n and phosphorus p elements higher salt contents various toxic substances in trace amounts and pathogens zhou et al 2014 thus tww has both positive and negative effects the properties of soil and groundwater such as the nutrient concentrations salinity organic carbon content and enzyme activities change under the influence of treated wastewater irrigation azouzi et al 2016 therefore previous studies have primarily focused on how using treated wastewater for irrigation affects crops e g growth yield and quality the environment e g groundwater and soil and human society a series of studies have shown that the water usage efficiency of forage irrigated with treated wastewater was higher than that irrigated with fresh water mathan 1994 gupta et al 1998 alkhamisi et al 2011 lazarova et al 2013 and jung et al 2014 concluded that nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in treated wastewater promoted plant growth enhanced crop yield and reduced the need for fertilizers similarly chen et al 2015 indicated that higher nutrient contents in wastewater were the main reason for better crop growth compared with conventional water irrigated crops however due to the high salt content the sodium na and chloride ions contained in treated wastewater may inhibit plant growth hamilton et al 2007 raveh and ben gal 2016 a previous study conducted by muyen et al 2011 in southeastern australia revealed that irrigation with wastewater increases maize and sorghum crop yield until the salinity level reaches 2330 mg l tds and then the yield slightly decreases in addition to crops soil can also be affected by increased salinity pedrero et al 2010 due to the higher electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids and major ion concentrations irrigation with wastewater increased the exchangeable sodium concentration and exchangeable sodium cation na percentage esp drechsel et al 2010 a study from western usa showed that golf courses irrigated with treated wastewater have higher electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratios sars than those irrigated with fresh water with increases of 187 and 481 respectively qian and mecham 2005 an area irrigated with treated wastewater tends to accumulate salts especially in regions that have high evaporative demand and low natural precipitation muyen et al 2011 soil salinity and sodicity tend to accumulate throughout the soil profile zartman 2011 however over 5 years of irrigation research zalacáin et al 2019 found that soil salinization did not occur in the treated wastewater irrigated plots and that the park that had been irrigated with treated wastewater for 15 years showed only slight soil salinization therefore the importance of studying soil salinity responses to irrigation with treated wastewater has become apparent current technology can treat wastewater to any level required lazarova et al 2013 however most wastewater treatments for agricultural irrigation are at the primary and secondary treatment levels wang et al 2011 which aim to retain valuable nutrients in the recycled water and minimize the retention of pathogenic factors according to acceptable salt levels of crops norton brandão et al 2013 de la cueva bueno et al 2017 differences in the reclamation process have led to high heterogeneity in the tww composition the different raw water sources also have high heterogeneity zartman 2011 as a result tww irrigation has led to inconsistent changes in the content of various soil ions correspondingly the responses of the soil ec soil ph and crop yield to tww irrigation have not been consistent following tertiary treated wastewater ttw irrigation zalacáin et al 2019 observed that the content of four base ions calcium ca sodium na magnesium mg potassium k increased in soil while masciandaro et al 2014 and libutti et al 2018 showed that the soil ca content declined a similar phenomenon occurred when primary treated wastewater ptw or secondary treated wastewater stw was used for irrigation farahat and linderholm 2013 hirzel et al 2017 libutti et al 2018 despite the contradictory changes in some soil ion contents all of these studies reported an increase in the soil ec after tww irrigation al lahham et al 2007 and de miguel et al 2013 attributed the increased soil ph to the accumulation of soil salts caused by tww irrigation and libutti et al 2018 and nicolás et al 2016 indicated that ttw irrigation had a negative effect on crop yield for the same reason however zhou et al 2014 found a decrease in the soil ec and ph under stw irrigation and petousi et al 2019 indicated that stw irrigation could increase grape yields which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2012 and tunc and sahin 2015 these results may also vary according to the soil texture even when irrigated with the same tww opposite effects of ptw irrigation on soil mg content were observed in different soils tarchouna et al 2010 petousi et al 2015 although petousi et al 2019 concluded that stw irrigation led to the accumulation of ca k and mg ions in clay loam pedrero and alarcón 2009 revealed that the content of these ions in silty loam was reduced by stw irrigation a similar positive effect on soil salt accumulation was observed in sandy loam by papadopoulos and stylianou 1988 such contradictory changes also occurred in terms of the responses of soil ec soil ph and crop yield pereira et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 bastida et al 2018 libutti et al 2018 pedrero et al 2018 crop type may be another factor that affects the changes in crop yield under tww irrigation vergine et al 2017 conducted a field scale irrigation test using treated effluents and they found that broccoli yields were approximately the same for the three water sources groundwater gw stw ttw while tomato yields were slightly higher in plots irrigated with gw 5 and 7 more than in ttw and stw plots respectively in contrast romero trigueros et al 2017 discovered that ttw irrigation could promote grape yield thus a quantitative analysis is necessary for directing wastewater irrigation meta analysis is a research method for systematic analysis and quantitative synthesis of the results from multiple independent studies with the same purpose and it originated from fisher s 1920 idea of merging p values glass 1976 in 1976 glass further developed it into a pooled effect size and named this statistical analysis meta analysis for the first time compared to a single study which has a small sample size that may lead to statistically insignificant results a meta analysis can expand the sample size and increase the accuracy of statistical testing by integrating samples from similar experiments in multiple independent studies in addition a meta analysis requires the comprehensive and systematic collection of all relevant literature undergoing strict selection criteria and quality evaluation therefore the conclusions are objective repeatable and reliable moreover this method can reveal the shortcomings of previous studies formulate the future research directions and provide a scientific basis for policy decisions more importantly a meta analysis of controversial or even contradictory similar studies can draw more obvious conclusions and estimate the effect of a certain treatment more accurately therefore such a quantitative analysis may help to develop reasonable wastewater irrigation strategies thereby reducing the harm to the soil environment and crops here we performed a meta analysis of 236 data pairs from 21 independent studies published between 1988 and 2019 to 1 identify the mean effects of tww irrigation on the soil properties and crop yield and 2 propose suggestions on the use of treated wastewater for irrigation based on wastewater treatment grade and soil texture 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a comprehensive search was conducted in databases e g science direct sd and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki for primary research papers on treated wastewater irrigation published between january 1988 and april 2019 during the literature retrieval process combinations of search terms were used including reclaimed wastewater or treated wastewater irrigation and soil or crop articles without the minimal combination of these targeted keywords in the title or abstract were excluded meta analysis refers to the statistical synthesis of results from a series of studies with the same topic with a focus on comparing the experimental groups and control groups and then determining the mean effect of a treatment and this process outputs more precise effect sizes than what could be obtained with any of the studies alone wang et al 2020 thus our targeted articles must compare tww irrigation treatment with the control conventional water irrigation under the condition that other factors remained unchanged regardless of whether the study was conducted over the whole growth stage or specific growth stages of a crop second to provide reference value for the application of tww in practical agricultural irrigation only field studies were taken into consideration third in this paper we collected studies in which the wastewater used for irrigation came from domestic sewage or food processing saline effluents due to the basically equivalent treatment processes of the two kinds of wastewater eremektar et al 1999 and because the content of heavy metals in these two kinds of wastewater is very small making them easier and more likely to be reused in agriculture shilpi et al 2018 in addition they were characterized by high salinity after being treated klay et al 2010 thus their use has received considerable attention porte et al 2010 chevremont et al 2012 the final screening criteria were the accessibility of the mean standard deviation and replicate number for both the control and tww irrigation treatments in a data pair when scrutinizing papers meeting these requirements for a meta analysis data on four soil cations ca na mg k as well as the soil ph and ec were collected as a quantitative statistical model meta analysis may enable the identification of factors associated with the treatment effect because soil texture may be an important factor affecting soil cation content transformation the data pairs were classified into three categories sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture according to the usda soil classification however most of the experimental soils involved in this study were loam which were divided into three categories according to the secondary texture for example sandy clay loam was considered clayey texture and sandy loam was considered sandy texture the wastewater treatment grade has a great influence on the soil ion content therefore these data were recorded to identify the effects of wastewater treatment grade on mean changes in soil cation content for this study irrigation water sources were categorized into three groups primary treated wastewater ptw secondary treated wastewater stw and tertiary treated wastewater ttw in this study 1 the primary treatment refers to the first step in wastewater treatment and it involves physically separating large solids from the waste stream cheremisinoff 2002 2 the secondary treatment consists of biological degradation and it involves decomposition of suspended matter and considerable reductions in pathogens al jassim et al 2015 and 3 the tertiary treatment is an additional step after the secondary treatment in which most processes involve physicochemical treatments such as coagulation filtration activated carbon adsorption of organics reverse osmosis and additional disinfection gerba and pepper 2019 in addition data on crop yield were also recorded and divided into two categories annuals or perennials in view of crop type after careful searching and filtration 21 studies from 17 different cities were included in this meta study for a total of 236 data pairs 25 on crop yield 50 on the soil ec 47 on the soil ph 24 on the soil na content 26 on the soil k content 32 on the soil mg content and 32 on the soil ca content the whole flow diagram of the review protocol is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 data analysis r http www r project org is a free integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation calculation and graphical display supported by the r foundation it provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible by allowing users to add additional functionality by defining new functions packages the process of a meta analysis can be realized in r software by installing the meta package in a meta analysis the effect size for each data pair the weight assigned to each effect size the estimate of the summary effect and the precision of the estimate are the basic elements for the seven variables studied in this paper which are unlikely to have a value of zero the response ratio r i was used to measure the effect size of the i th data pair i 1 2 k with k representing the total number of data pairs on a given variable and it was calculated as follows hedges et al 1999 1 r i x t i x c i where x t i and x c i are the mean values of a given variable under treatments with and without tww irrigation in the i th data pair respectively correspondingly different units of soil ion contents g kg mg kg meq kg etc would not affect the calculation of mean effects with the same applying to soil ec and crop yield the weight w i assigned to the effect size for the i th data pair in the fixed effect model was calculated with the following equation 2 w i 1 v i where v i is the internal variance of the i th data pair then the mean effect size m and its variance v m and 95 confidence interval 95 ci were obtained 3 m i 1 k w i r i i 1 k w i 4 v m 1 i 1 k w i 5 95 c i m 1 96 v m in a random effects model the weighting factor w i was calculated as follows 6 w i 1 v i where v i v i t 2 and t 2 is the sum of variance between all the data pairs calculated with the following equation 7 t 2 q df c where q is the weighted sum of squares of the deviation of each effect size from the mean df degrees of freedom and c are defined as follows 8 df k 1 9 c i 1 k w i i 1 k w i 2 i 1 k w i for the convenience of computations an equivalent formula of q was used 10 q i 1 k w i r i 2 i 1 k w i r i 2 i 1 k w i then similar to the fixed effect model the mean effect size m and its variance v m and 95 confidence interval 95 ci of the random effects model were calculated as follows 11 m σ i 1 k w i r i σ i 1 k w i 12 v m 1 i 1 k w i 13 95 c i m 1 96 v m however because the response ratio served as the effect size index log transformation was needed to maintain symmetry in the analysis thus we used the log response ratio ln r i and its variance v ln r i to yield the mean effect size as well as its variance and 95 confidence intervals in log units and then converted each of these values back to response ratios rather than computing in its original metric v ln r i was calculated by the following formula 14 v ln r i n t i 1 s t i 2 n c i 1 s c i 2 n t i n c i 2 1 n t i x t i 2 1 n c i x c i 2 where s t i and n t i and s c i and n c i are the standard deviation and replicate number of the tww irrigation treatment and conventional water irrigation treatment in the i th data pair respectively all the specific calculation processes are detailed in borenstein et al 2009 i 2 is the ratio of true heterogeneity to total variance across the observed effect estimates and reflects the heterogeneity between data pairs and it could be used to determine whether a fixed effect model or random effects model should be used this parameter is defined as follows 15 i 2 q df q 100 if i 2 50 the fixed effect model was used to pool the data otherwise a random effects model was performed lu et al 2019 due to the significant heterogeneity i 2 75 this meta analysis was performed in r software by using the meta package with a random effects model to calculate summary effects for the same reason it would make sense to apply a subgroup analysis to identify the reasons for the variance higgins et al 2003 thus we conducted a subgroup analysis of the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture the final result was expressed in terms of the mean effect and its 95 confidence intervals when the 95 ci did not overlap with zero then tww irrigation did not have a significant effect when the 95 cis of several categories overlapped with each other then significant differences did not occur between them to better demonstrate the changes in soil cation content ph ec and crop yield following tww irrigation all the analysis results were reported in the form of r 1 100 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset by screening the available literature around the world this study found 21 papers that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta analysis with nine providing yield data table 1 the geographical distribution of these studies was as follows europe 66 67 asia 19 05 north america 9 52 and africa 4 76 as shown in fig 2 the experimental sites were similar in latitude and were primarily located in coastal areas with a concentration around the mediterranean tww irrigation had a statistically significant effect on the soil cation content ca na mg k soil ec and crop yield although a statistically significant change in soil ph was not observed fig 3 following tww irrigation the k ion content in soil increased by approximately 90 1 on average which represented the largest increase followed by the soil na ion content 59 9 soil ec 57 2 soil mg ion content 25 2 and soil ca ion content 17 3 however crop yield decreased significantly with a grand mean decrease of 6 5 and 95 ci of 8 4 to 4 5 similarly a negative effect of tww irrigation was observed for soil ph although the reduction was insignificant 0 7 on average 95 ci 1 4 0 1 furthermore due to the significant heterogeneity between the data pairs i 2 75 we performed subgroup analyses to explore potential reasons underlying the variance 3 2 effects of tww irrigation on ca fig 4 shows the effect of tww irrigation on the ca ion content in soil with the results grouped by wastewater treatment grade and soil texture irrigation with tww promoted the accumulation of ca in soil by 30 1 8 1 and 7 5 for ptw ttw and stw respectively significant differences were not observed between the ptw and ttw categories although a statistically significant increase in soil ca content was found in the ptw category for the soil texture categories tww irrigation presented a significant positive contribution to soil ca accumulation for all three categories which are ranked from large to small as loamy texture sandy texture and clayey texture while no significant difference was observed among the categories 3 3 effects of tww irrigation on na fig 5 shows the response of the soil na ion content to tww irrigation and indicates that it varied based on the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture similar to the soil ca content the increase in soil na content with ptw 97 3 was significantly higher than stw treatment 8 1 one difference was that ttw significantly increased the na ion content in the soil and another was the significant difference between the ttw and stw categories when categorized by soil texture all the categories had a statistically significant effect although a significant difference was observed among them the soil na content increased for the sandy texture and clayey texture by 93 7 and 16 7 respectively but decreased for the loamy texture by approximately 24 0 3 4 effects of tww irrigation on mg except for the stw category and loamy texture category the remaining subgroups led to statistically significant increases in the mg content in soil fig 6 the increase in the soil mg content reached its highest level following irrigation with ttw and it was significantly higher than that after stw irrigation although the difference was not significant relative to that after ptw irrigation following tww irrigation the increase in the mg content in the sandy textured soil reached its highest value which was significantly higher than that in the loamy textured soil although the difference was not significant relative to that in the clayey textured soil 3 5 effects of tww irrigation on k the degree of increase in the soil k ion content for the wastewater treatment grade categories from large to small was ptw ttw and stw whereas that for the soil texture categories from large to small was sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture fig 7 all wastewater treatment grade categories showed a positive effect on the increase in soil na content but the increase following stw irrigation was insignificant and significantly lower than that of the remaining categories for the division by soil texture the increase in k content in the loamy textured soil was the second highest but insignificant compared to the control while the k content in the sandy textured soil and clayey textured soil increased significantly no significant difference was found between the loamy texture and the remaining categories although a significant difference was found between the remaining categories 3 6 effects of tww irrigation on ph soil ph after the stw irrigation or in the loamy textured soil decreased significantly while it was not significantly different from the remaining wastewater treatment grade categories or soil texture categories which did not show significant soil ph changes relative to the control fig 8 among the remaining categories only the effect of the ttw category on soil ph changes was positive while the others showed a negative effect 3 7 effects of tww irrigation on ec regardless of the wastewater treatment grade or the soil texture the soil ec following tww irrigation was significantly higher than that following irrigation with conventional water fig 9 for the wastewater treatment grade categories the increase in soil ec after ttw irrigation was significantly higher than that after stw irrigation while no difference was observed between the two categories and the ptw category where the highest soil ec increase was obtained in contrast for the soil texture categories the increase in ec showed a minimum value in the clayey textured soil although the gap between it and other soil texture categories was insignificant however a significant difference was found between the remaining soil texture categories 3 8 effects of tww irrigation on yield because of the limited number of papers meeting the demand for a meta analysis and providing yield data at the same time only 25 data pairs for crop yield from 9 studies were included in this meta study and they were grouped by the wastewater treatment grade stw or ttw soil texture sandy texture loamy texture or clayey texture and crop type annuals or perennials fig 10 there were highly contrasting effects between the stw category and ttw category stw irrigation led to a significant increase in crop yield of 3 4 while ttw irrigation led to a significant reduction in crop yield of 13 0 similarly ttw irrigation resulted in opposite effects between different crop types although the increase decrease in crop yield was insignificant compared to that of the control or between each other highly contrasting effects were also found between clayey texture and loamy texture categories compared with the conventional irrigation treatment the change in crop yield following tww irrigation was 7 2 95 ci 6 3 8 0 and 16 4 95 ci 23 6 to 8 5 in the clayey textured soil and loamy textured soil respectively the crop yield in sandy textured soil was reduced by 4 4 95 ci 14 8 to 7 4 clearly the effect of the sandy texture category was insignificant relative to the control and insignificantly different from that of the remaining soil texture categories 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects the results showed that soil irrigated with tww had a higher content of salinity than that with conventional water irrigation i e following tww irrigation soil was salinized fig 3 the accumulation of the four ions k na mg ca in soil varied with increases of 90 1 59 9 25 2 and 17 3 respectively thus it was inevitable that the soil ec a measure of soil salinity was significantly enhanced by tww irrigation and it reached approximately 57 2 this finding was consistent with several previous studies mohammad and mazahreh 2003 shilpi et al 2018 in terms of the changes in soil ph the effect of tww irrigation was not statistically significant which is supported by the works of wang et al 2003 and mohammad rusan et al 2007 however gelsomino et al 2006 and adrover et al 2012 found an increase in soil ph after tww irrigation totally opposite results were revealed in the studies of ndour et al 2008 and xu et al 2010 where the response of soil ph to tww irrigation was negative the differences between experimental conditions may contribute to these contradictory conclusions for the same reason conflicting results were found when studying the crop yield responses to tww irrigation in this study there was a significant decrease 6 5 on average in crop yield after tww irrigation tww irrigation brought about a series of problems such as soil salinization caused by soil salt accumulation soil compaction soil structure degradation and microbiota decline bedbabis et al 2014 obviously these changes led to a reduction in crop yield levy et al 2014 however it has been reported that the organic matter and beneficial growth ions n p k ca etc contained in wastewater have the effect of increasing crop yield jung et al 2014 bedbabis et al 2015 once irrigated with tww changes in soil properties and crop growth are mainly dependent on the ion content while the source and treatment processes of untreated wastewater determine its ion content gagné et al 2013 thus we made efforts to identify the changes in soil salt content and crop yield when irrigated with tww varied by the wastewater treatment grade soil texture was also taken into consideration in the subgroup analysis in view of its effects on moisture salinity and nutrient transport in soil lu et al 2019 2021 gao et al 2020 which may impact the effectiveness of tww irrigation in addition extra attention was given to the effect of crop type on tww irrigation in this paper in terms of crop yield due to the different salt tolerances of crops unfortunately some other potential impact variables such as irrigation methods irrigation systems and mixed irrigation water were not included in the subgroup analyses of this meta study due to the limited number of studies and observations 4 2 effects of wastewater treatment grade regulations requires the quality of irrigation water while substances contained in wastewater may lead to negative changes in soil physicochemical properties therefore before its use for irrigation wastewater is typically further treated by wastewater treatment plants wwtps to reduce harm chiou 2008 muñoz et al 2009 becerra castro et al 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 generally the wastewater treatment process in wwtps falls into three stages primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment however the soil salt accumulation did not gradually decrease with the step by step purification of wastewater as shown in fig 4a the contribution of the different treatment levels to the increase in soil ca content from large to small was ranked ptw ttw and stw the same results were observed for the changes in soil na content soil k content and soil ec after irrigation with tww varied by wastewater treatment grade fig 5a fig 7a and fig 9a while the order of soil mg accumulation from large to small was ranked ttw ptw and stw fig 6a at the tertiary stage to further remove contaminants or nutrients in wastewater some removal techniques take advantage of additional inorganic electrolytes such as nacl cacl2 and mgso4 du et al 2014 niu et al 2016 in addition alkali materials typically caco3 or naoh are used to adjust the ph of acidic wastewater in this step saritpongteeraka and chaiprapat 2008 the usage of these chemicals would result in a higher salt content in the producing water ttw leading to a higher increase in soil salinity following ttw irrigation as well as soil ec the increased salt content and reduced nutrients in ttw may also give birth to a significant reduction in crop yield fig 10a a similar negative effect of ttw irrigation was found by nicolás et al 2016 with ttw irrigation the mandarin yield decreased year by year however contrary to ttw irrigation the results showed that stw irrigation contributed to a significant increase in crop yield totally different from the conclusion reached by pedrero et al 2012 in their study lemons irrigated with stw had a lower yield than those irrigated with ttw mixing with well quality groundwater when conducting ttw irrigation was the key factor that resulted in conflicting effects and led to better use efficiency under this situation the harm of tww irrigation was reduced and less obvious than its promoting effect the comparison between the positive and negative effects of tww irrigation determines how crop yield would be affected reduced or increased by tww irrigation it calls for clarifying the boundary between harmful substances and nutrients in tww to obtain as much benefit as possible not only is the tww composition important but also the crop type different plants have different sensitivities to tww and tolerances to stress with the same stw irrigation treatment the nutrients in stw promoted the growth of pakchoi but led to stress in cotton chen et al 2012 our findings indicated that a change trend of crop yield would occur following tww irrigation but did not mean that the same result would always be obtained it must be pointed out that unless expensive desalination processes are used most mineral salts in wastewater cannot be removed even by tertiary treatment processes zalacáin et al 2019 this finding implies that the content of basic cations in tww is usually high thus increasing the alkaline reserve of the soil mancino and pepper 1992 as a result the soil ph increased with ttw irrigation fig 8a however this change in soil ph was insignificant which is consistent with previous studies al lahham et al 2007 bastida et al 2018 the adjustment of the ph during the wastewater treatment process may be a possible reason for the increase such an increase in ph was also reported by libutti et al 2018 who found that soil ph with stw irrigation was significantly higher than that in ttw irrigated plots this difference may be related to the different treatment processes compared to the secondary wastewater treatment the tertiary wastewater treatment added the step of nitrogen removal an enhanced rate of denitrification that produced hydroxyl ions contributed to the increase in soil ph tarchouna et al 2010 however a completely contrary result was obtained by our subgroup analysis in which stw significantly decreased soil ph similarly irrigation with ptw without nitrogen removal also reduced soil ph although not significantly fig 8a the same conclusion was reached by farahat and linderholm 2013 tunc and sahin 2015 and tsigoida and argyrokastritis 2020 usman and ghallab 2006 insisted that nitrification with ammonium was more likely to occur following tww irrigation due to high inputs of nitrate loads from wastewater thus leading to a decrease in soil ph in addition the absorption of ammonia ions by plants and leaching of basic cations may both lead to a decline in soil ph bedbabis et al 2014 4 3 effects of soil texture soil texture influences the retention rate of the main salt base ions azouzi et al 2016 concluded that the low permeability of dense soil led to greater salt retention following tww irrigation relative to that in the sandy loam soil lower na k and ec were found in the loamy sand when tww was used for irrigation in the study of tsigoida and argyrokastritis 2020 however in our study sandier soil showed a higher salt accumulation after tww irrigation the increases in ec and four basic ions ca na mg and k were higher in the sandy soil than the clayey soil fig 4b fig 5b fig 6b fig 7b and fig 9b the gap between the ec and four basic ions contents in tww and soil may introduce a bias for this category because the salinity level in soil was greater than that in treated wastewater azouzi et al 2016 observed a decline in the ec values of saline soil irrigated with tww which may also be the reason for the significant decrease in na content in the loamy soil observed here fig 5b thus tww seemed to represent a potentially beneficial application method for wastewater although it requires intensive study in view of the nitrification of ammonium caused by the high salt content from tww usman and ghallab 2006 the soil ph decreased in all soil texture categories higher soil salt accumulation leads to a higher decrease in soil ph resulting from the stronger nitrification of ammonium thus the decline in the ph of the sandy soil was higher than that of the clayey soil due to the greater increase in salt content fig 8b however the difference was insignificant which may be because the soil texture categories were not sufficiently different in this paper most experiments were conducted in loam which was further grouped into three categories based on the second category of texture similarly the higher accumulation of soil salinity compared to that in clayey soil contributed to a lower increase in crop yield in sandy soil relative to the control because of the harm of tww irrigation bedbabis et al 2014 crop yield was reduced in the loamy and sandy textured soil fig 10b despite wastewater containing nutrients beneficial to crop growth jung et al 2014 however clayey textured soil has a stronger ability to keep fertilizer gao et al 2020 therefore tww had a significantly positive effect on the yield of crops grown in clay however insufficient statistical data only 25 data pairs may reduce the confidence in the results 4 4 effects of crop type a reliable yield dataset is very important for assessing the average irrigation impact of tww by meta analysis unfortunately few papers met the criteria for inclusion in this study and only 9 of them focused on crop yield and they reported 25 pairwise comparisons of fruits grains and vegetables in total then based on crop type these 25 data pairs were divided into two categories annuals or perennials once planted perennials can grow for many years indicating that perennial crops will continue to suffer from the negative impact of tww irrigation before the next tww irrigation cycle while annuals germinate grow flower and then die over the course of a year therefore perennials may have worse growth performance after several continuous growth cycles with tww irrigation considering that some experiments from the studies used for this analysis were performed for more than one year it is no wonder that tww irrigation had a negative effect on perennials but a positive effect on annuals fig 10c in addition this classification under tww irrigation without considering the sensitivity of crops especially salt tolerance is one sided the yield of olive trees a perennial woody plant can also be increased by tww irrigation due to moderate tolerance to salinity petousi et al 2015 bourazanis et al 2016 for the same reason different varieties of tomato showed totally opposite responses to tww irrigation in cultivation experiments aiello et al 2007 thus tww irrigation has great potential and operability for salt tolerant crops relative to the control the change in yield of annual and perennial crops was insignificant similarly gatta et al 2015 and libutti et al 2018 found no significant difference in crop yield between tww irrigation and ground water irrigation however this finding must be treated with caution because the experimental durations were still not long enough no more than 3 years in light of the damage of lasting tww irrigation to soil physicochemical properties which is an obstacle to wastewater utilization in practice petousi et al 2015 more efforts are needed to evaluate its long term effects and then take action to gain the maximum benefits furthermore the ratio of marketable yield to nonmarketable yield was reduced in the studies of gatta et al 2015 and libutti et al 2018 implying negative changes in crop quality caused by tww irrigation which was the deficiency of this analysis 5 conclusions negative changes in the soil environment are inevitable with long term tww irrigation thus we selected 21 papers and then performed a meta analysis whose main objective was to quantify the accumulation of four salts ca na mg and k in soil following tww irrigation the results showed that irrigation with tww significantly promoted the accumulation of k na mg and ca in soil by 90 1 59 9 25 2 and 17 3 on average respectively while the effect on crop yield was negative with a significant decrease of 6 5 however the responses of the soil salt content and crop yield were dependent on the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture in general salt accumulation in soil was the highest after ptw irrigation followed by ttw and stw in terms of soil texture higher sand content in soil led to a higher increase in soil salt content following tww irrigation for crop yield a highly contrasting effect was observed between the stw category and ttw category and the same was true between the clayey texture and loamy texture crop yield significantly increased by 3 4 with stw irrigation and by 7 2 in the clayed textured soil demonstrating the potential of tww irrigation however some factors that may also affect soil salt accumulation and crop yield such as the irrigation methods irrigation systems and mixing of irrigation water were not taken into consideration in this study due to the limited amounts of studies and observations thus additional experiments are required in the future to perfect and optimize the results of this paper overall our findings provide constructive insights on wastewater utilization especially for water shortage areas such as selecting a specific irrigation environment to maximize the benefits of tww irrigation and reduce its toxic effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9962,in view of water shortages the development and utilization of unconventional water resources have been studied extensively treated domestic or industrial wastewater used for agricultural irrigation is an unconventional water resource utilization method due to the particularities of water sources previous studies have mainly focused on changes in soil heavy metals microorganisms and organic substances and crop responses to toxic elements thus attention to soil salinity is of secondary importance after selecting qualifying research a meta analysis was performed to statistically analyze the data of seven variables potassium k sodium na calcium ca magnesium mg electrical conductivity ec ph and yield to 1 estimate the mean effects of treated wastewater tww irrigation on the soil salinity soil ph and crop yield and 2 identify the wastewater treatment grade primary treated wastewater ptw secondary treated wastewater stw and tertiary treated wastewater ttw and soil texture sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture that benefit tww irrigation the results showed that tww irrigation caused a significant accumulation of soil salinity and the increase in cation content from high to low was k 90 1 na 59 9 mg 25 2 and ca 17 3 ec also increased significantly by approximately 57 2 while there was no significant change in ph and even the crop yield presented an average reduction of nearly 6 5 ptw contributed to the largest salt accumulation followed by ttw and stw stw showed a significant increase in ec but did not show a significant change for the four ions in terms of yield stw can increase yield while ttw has the opposite effect in general the sandier the soil texture the higher is the salt content detected although the retention of salt in loamy textured soil may differ depending on the ions the yield of crops grown increased in the clayey textured soil and decreased in the loamy textured soil our study elucidated the response of soil salinity accumulation under tww irrigation and could provide a reference for unconventional water resource utilization keywords soil salinity crop yield treated wastewater irrigation wastewater treatment grade soil texture 1 introduction as the largest water consumer in the world the agriculture industry accounts for more than two thirds of the total water use worldwide however many irrigation areas in semiarid regions are at risk of water shortages garcia caparros et al 2017 furthermore population growth has increased the competition for water resource utilization between municipal use and agriculture however with rapid urbanization increases in water demand and wastewater discharge raise the possibility of wastewater reuse lyu et al 2016 from this perspective treated wastewater tww irrigation represents a solution to the growing shortage of agricultural water resources wastewater from wastewater treatment facilities reused for irrigation generates substantial economic and water conservation benefits in the southwestern united states more than one third of golf courses use recycled water for irrigation throssell et al 2009 globally treated wastewater has become an important irrigation water resource oki and kanae 2006 tran et al 2016 although the reuse of wastewater can help meet the demand for water in agriculture levine and asano 2004 it carries both agronomic and environmental risks that should be given more consideration efforts to reduce costs or limitations in the level of technology lead to the incomplete removal of pollutants from tww destined for reuse therefore such water retains abundant nitrogen n and phosphorus p elements higher salt contents various toxic substances in trace amounts and pathogens zhou et al 2014 thus tww has both positive and negative effects the properties of soil and groundwater such as the nutrient concentrations salinity organic carbon content and enzyme activities change under the influence of treated wastewater irrigation azouzi et al 2016 therefore previous studies have primarily focused on how using treated wastewater for irrigation affects crops e g growth yield and quality the environment e g groundwater and soil and human society a series of studies have shown that the water usage efficiency of forage irrigated with treated wastewater was higher than that irrigated with fresh water mathan 1994 gupta et al 1998 alkhamisi et al 2011 lazarova et al 2013 and jung et al 2014 concluded that nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in treated wastewater promoted plant growth enhanced crop yield and reduced the need for fertilizers similarly chen et al 2015 indicated that higher nutrient contents in wastewater were the main reason for better crop growth compared with conventional water irrigated crops however due to the high salt content the sodium na and chloride ions contained in treated wastewater may inhibit plant growth hamilton et al 2007 raveh and ben gal 2016 a previous study conducted by muyen et al 2011 in southeastern australia revealed that irrigation with wastewater increases maize and sorghum crop yield until the salinity level reaches 2330 mg l tds and then the yield slightly decreases in addition to crops soil can also be affected by increased salinity pedrero et al 2010 due to the higher electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids and major ion concentrations irrigation with wastewater increased the exchangeable sodium concentration and exchangeable sodium cation na percentage esp drechsel et al 2010 a study from western usa showed that golf courses irrigated with treated wastewater have higher electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratios sars than those irrigated with fresh water with increases of 187 and 481 respectively qian and mecham 2005 an area irrigated with treated wastewater tends to accumulate salts especially in regions that have high evaporative demand and low natural precipitation muyen et al 2011 soil salinity and sodicity tend to accumulate throughout the soil profile zartman 2011 however over 5 years of irrigation research zalacáin et al 2019 found that soil salinization did not occur in the treated wastewater irrigated plots and that the park that had been irrigated with treated wastewater for 15 years showed only slight soil salinization therefore the importance of studying soil salinity responses to irrigation with treated wastewater has become apparent current technology can treat wastewater to any level required lazarova et al 2013 however most wastewater treatments for agricultural irrigation are at the primary and secondary treatment levels wang et al 2011 which aim to retain valuable nutrients in the recycled water and minimize the retention of pathogenic factors according to acceptable salt levels of crops norton brandão et al 2013 de la cueva bueno et al 2017 differences in the reclamation process have led to high heterogeneity in the tww composition the different raw water sources also have high heterogeneity zartman 2011 as a result tww irrigation has led to inconsistent changes in the content of various soil ions correspondingly the responses of the soil ec soil ph and crop yield to tww irrigation have not been consistent following tertiary treated wastewater ttw irrigation zalacáin et al 2019 observed that the content of four base ions calcium ca sodium na magnesium mg potassium k increased in soil while masciandaro et al 2014 and libutti et al 2018 showed that the soil ca content declined a similar phenomenon occurred when primary treated wastewater ptw or secondary treated wastewater stw was used for irrigation farahat and linderholm 2013 hirzel et al 2017 libutti et al 2018 despite the contradictory changes in some soil ion contents all of these studies reported an increase in the soil ec after tww irrigation al lahham et al 2007 and de miguel et al 2013 attributed the increased soil ph to the accumulation of soil salts caused by tww irrigation and libutti et al 2018 and nicolás et al 2016 indicated that ttw irrigation had a negative effect on crop yield for the same reason however zhou et al 2014 found a decrease in the soil ec and ph under stw irrigation and petousi et al 2019 indicated that stw irrigation could increase grape yields which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2012 and tunc and sahin 2015 these results may also vary according to the soil texture even when irrigated with the same tww opposite effects of ptw irrigation on soil mg content were observed in different soils tarchouna et al 2010 petousi et al 2015 although petousi et al 2019 concluded that stw irrigation led to the accumulation of ca k and mg ions in clay loam pedrero and alarcón 2009 revealed that the content of these ions in silty loam was reduced by stw irrigation a similar positive effect on soil salt accumulation was observed in sandy loam by papadopoulos and stylianou 1988 such contradictory changes also occurred in terms of the responses of soil ec soil ph and crop yield pereira et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 bastida et al 2018 libutti et al 2018 pedrero et al 2018 crop type may be another factor that affects the changes in crop yield under tww irrigation vergine et al 2017 conducted a field scale irrigation test using treated effluents and they found that broccoli yields were approximately the same for the three water sources groundwater gw stw ttw while tomato yields were slightly higher in plots irrigated with gw 5 and 7 more than in ttw and stw plots respectively in contrast romero trigueros et al 2017 discovered that ttw irrigation could promote grape yield thus a quantitative analysis is necessary for directing wastewater irrigation meta analysis is a research method for systematic analysis and quantitative synthesis of the results from multiple independent studies with the same purpose and it originated from fisher s 1920 idea of merging p values glass 1976 in 1976 glass further developed it into a pooled effect size and named this statistical analysis meta analysis for the first time compared to a single study which has a small sample size that may lead to statistically insignificant results a meta analysis can expand the sample size and increase the accuracy of statistical testing by integrating samples from similar experiments in multiple independent studies in addition a meta analysis requires the comprehensive and systematic collection of all relevant literature undergoing strict selection criteria and quality evaluation therefore the conclusions are objective repeatable and reliable moreover this method can reveal the shortcomings of previous studies formulate the future research directions and provide a scientific basis for policy decisions more importantly a meta analysis of controversial or even contradictory similar studies can draw more obvious conclusions and estimate the effect of a certain treatment more accurately therefore such a quantitative analysis may help to develop reasonable wastewater irrigation strategies thereby reducing the harm to the soil environment and crops here we performed a meta analysis of 236 data pairs from 21 independent studies published between 1988 and 2019 to 1 identify the mean effects of tww irrigation on the soil properties and crop yield and 2 propose suggestions on the use of treated wastewater for irrigation based on wastewater treatment grade and soil texture 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a comprehensive search was conducted in databases e g science direct sd and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki for primary research papers on treated wastewater irrigation published between january 1988 and april 2019 during the literature retrieval process combinations of search terms were used including reclaimed wastewater or treated wastewater irrigation and soil or crop articles without the minimal combination of these targeted keywords in the title or abstract were excluded meta analysis refers to the statistical synthesis of results from a series of studies with the same topic with a focus on comparing the experimental groups and control groups and then determining the mean effect of a treatment and this process outputs more precise effect sizes than what could be obtained with any of the studies alone wang et al 2020 thus our targeted articles must compare tww irrigation treatment with the control conventional water irrigation under the condition that other factors remained unchanged regardless of whether the study was conducted over the whole growth stage or specific growth stages of a crop second to provide reference value for the application of tww in practical agricultural irrigation only field studies were taken into consideration third in this paper we collected studies in which the wastewater used for irrigation came from domestic sewage or food processing saline effluents due to the basically equivalent treatment processes of the two kinds of wastewater eremektar et al 1999 and because the content of heavy metals in these two kinds of wastewater is very small making them easier and more likely to be reused in agriculture shilpi et al 2018 in addition they were characterized by high salinity after being treated klay et al 2010 thus their use has received considerable attention porte et al 2010 chevremont et al 2012 the final screening criteria were the accessibility of the mean standard deviation and replicate number for both the control and tww irrigation treatments in a data pair when scrutinizing papers meeting these requirements for a meta analysis data on four soil cations ca na mg k as well as the soil ph and ec were collected as a quantitative statistical model meta analysis may enable the identification of factors associated with the treatment effect because soil texture may be an important factor affecting soil cation content transformation the data pairs were classified into three categories sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture according to the usda soil classification however most of the experimental soils involved in this study were loam which were divided into three categories according to the secondary texture for example sandy clay loam was considered clayey texture and sandy loam was considered sandy texture the wastewater treatment grade has a great influence on the soil ion content therefore these data were recorded to identify the effects of wastewater treatment grade on mean changes in soil cation content for this study irrigation water sources were categorized into three groups primary treated wastewater ptw secondary treated wastewater stw and tertiary treated wastewater ttw in this study 1 the primary treatment refers to the first step in wastewater treatment and it involves physically separating large solids from the waste stream cheremisinoff 2002 2 the secondary treatment consists of biological degradation and it involves decomposition of suspended matter and considerable reductions in pathogens al jassim et al 2015 and 3 the tertiary treatment is an additional step after the secondary treatment in which most processes involve physicochemical treatments such as coagulation filtration activated carbon adsorption of organics reverse osmosis and additional disinfection gerba and pepper 2019 in addition data on crop yield were also recorded and divided into two categories annuals or perennials in view of crop type after careful searching and filtration 21 studies from 17 different cities were included in this meta study for a total of 236 data pairs 25 on crop yield 50 on the soil ec 47 on the soil ph 24 on the soil na content 26 on the soil k content 32 on the soil mg content and 32 on the soil ca content the whole flow diagram of the review protocol is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 data analysis r http www r project org is a free integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation calculation and graphical display supported by the r foundation it provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible by allowing users to add additional functionality by defining new functions packages the process of a meta analysis can be realized in r software by installing the meta package in a meta analysis the effect size for each data pair the weight assigned to each effect size the estimate of the summary effect and the precision of the estimate are the basic elements for the seven variables studied in this paper which are unlikely to have a value of zero the response ratio r i was used to measure the effect size of the i th data pair i 1 2 k with k representing the total number of data pairs on a given variable and it was calculated as follows hedges et al 1999 1 r i x t i x c i where x t i and x c i are the mean values of a given variable under treatments with and without tww irrigation in the i th data pair respectively correspondingly different units of soil ion contents g kg mg kg meq kg etc would not affect the calculation of mean effects with the same applying to soil ec and crop yield the weight w i assigned to the effect size for the i th data pair in the fixed effect model was calculated with the following equation 2 w i 1 v i where v i is the internal variance of the i th data pair then the mean effect size m and its variance v m and 95 confidence interval 95 ci were obtained 3 m i 1 k w i r i i 1 k w i 4 v m 1 i 1 k w i 5 95 c i m 1 96 v m in a random effects model the weighting factor w i was calculated as follows 6 w i 1 v i where v i v i t 2 and t 2 is the sum of variance between all the data pairs calculated with the following equation 7 t 2 q df c where q is the weighted sum of squares of the deviation of each effect size from the mean df degrees of freedom and c are defined as follows 8 df k 1 9 c i 1 k w i i 1 k w i 2 i 1 k w i for the convenience of computations an equivalent formula of q was used 10 q i 1 k w i r i 2 i 1 k w i r i 2 i 1 k w i then similar to the fixed effect model the mean effect size m and its variance v m and 95 confidence interval 95 ci of the random effects model were calculated as follows 11 m σ i 1 k w i r i σ i 1 k w i 12 v m 1 i 1 k w i 13 95 c i m 1 96 v m however because the response ratio served as the effect size index log transformation was needed to maintain symmetry in the analysis thus we used the log response ratio ln r i and its variance v ln r i to yield the mean effect size as well as its variance and 95 confidence intervals in log units and then converted each of these values back to response ratios rather than computing in its original metric v ln r i was calculated by the following formula 14 v ln r i n t i 1 s t i 2 n c i 1 s c i 2 n t i n c i 2 1 n t i x t i 2 1 n c i x c i 2 where s t i and n t i and s c i and n c i are the standard deviation and replicate number of the tww irrigation treatment and conventional water irrigation treatment in the i th data pair respectively all the specific calculation processes are detailed in borenstein et al 2009 i 2 is the ratio of true heterogeneity to total variance across the observed effect estimates and reflects the heterogeneity between data pairs and it could be used to determine whether a fixed effect model or random effects model should be used this parameter is defined as follows 15 i 2 q df q 100 if i 2 50 the fixed effect model was used to pool the data otherwise a random effects model was performed lu et al 2019 due to the significant heterogeneity i 2 75 this meta analysis was performed in r software by using the meta package with a random effects model to calculate summary effects for the same reason it would make sense to apply a subgroup analysis to identify the reasons for the variance higgins et al 2003 thus we conducted a subgroup analysis of the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture the final result was expressed in terms of the mean effect and its 95 confidence intervals when the 95 ci did not overlap with zero then tww irrigation did not have a significant effect when the 95 cis of several categories overlapped with each other then significant differences did not occur between them to better demonstrate the changes in soil cation content ph ec and crop yield following tww irrigation all the analysis results were reported in the form of r 1 100 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset by screening the available literature around the world this study found 21 papers that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta analysis with nine providing yield data table 1 the geographical distribution of these studies was as follows europe 66 67 asia 19 05 north america 9 52 and africa 4 76 as shown in fig 2 the experimental sites were similar in latitude and were primarily located in coastal areas with a concentration around the mediterranean tww irrigation had a statistically significant effect on the soil cation content ca na mg k soil ec and crop yield although a statistically significant change in soil ph was not observed fig 3 following tww irrigation the k ion content in soil increased by approximately 90 1 on average which represented the largest increase followed by the soil na ion content 59 9 soil ec 57 2 soil mg ion content 25 2 and soil ca ion content 17 3 however crop yield decreased significantly with a grand mean decrease of 6 5 and 95 ci of 8 4 to 4 5 similarly a negative effect of tww irrigation was observed for soil ph although the reduction was insignificant 0 7 on average 95 ci 1 4 0 1 furthermore due to the significant heterogeneity between the data pairs i 2 75 we performed subgroup analyses to explore potential reasons underlying the variance 3 2 effects of tww irrigation on ca fig 4 shows the effect of tww irrigation on the ca ion content in soil with the results grouped by wastewater treatment grade and soil texture irrigation with tww promoted the accumulation of ca in soil by 30 1 8 1 and 7 5 for ptw ttw and stw respectively significant differences were not observed between the ptw and ttw categories although a statistically significant increase in soil ca content was found in the ptw category for the soil texture categories tww irrigation presented a significant positive contribution to soil ca accumulation for all three categories which are ranked from large to small as loamy texture sandy texture and clayey texture while no significant difference was observed among the categories 3 3 effects of tww irrigation on na fig 5 shows the response of the soil na ion content to tww irrigation and indicates that it varied based on the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture similar to the soil ca content the increase in soil na content with ptw 97 3 was significantly higher than stw treatment 8 1 one difference was that ttw significantly increased the na ion content in the soil and another was the significant difference between the ttw and stw categories when categorized by soil texture all the categories had a statistically significant effect although a significant difference was observed among them the soil na content increased for the sandy texture and clayey texture by 93 7 and 16 7 respectively but decreased for the loamy texture by approximately 24 0 3 4 effects of tww irrigation on mg except for the stw category and loamy texture category the remaining subgroups led to statistically significant increases in the mg content in soil fig 6 the increase in the soil mg content reached its highest level following irrigation with ttw and it was significantly higher than that after stw irrigation although the difference was not significant relative to that after ptw irrigation following tww irrigation the increase in the mg content in the sandy textured soil reached its highest value which was significantly higher than that in the loamy textured soil although the difference was not significant relative to that in the clayey textured soil 3 5 effects of tww irrigation on k the degree of increase in the soil k ion content for the wastewater treatment grade categories from large to small was ptw ttw and stw whereas that for the soil texture categories from large to small was sandy texture loamy texture and clayey texture fig 7 all wastewater treatment grade categories showed a positive effect on the increase in soil na content but the increase following stw irrigation was insignificant and significantly lower than that of the remaining categories for the division by soil texture the increase in k content in the loamy textured soil was the second highest but insignificant compared to the control while the k content in the sandy textured soil and clayey textured soil increased significantly no significant difference was found between the loamy texture and the remaining categories although a significant difference was found between the remaining categories 3 6 effects of tww irrigation on ph soil ph after the stw irrigation or in the loamy textured soil decreased significantly while it was not significantly different from the remaining wastewater treatment grade categories or soil texture categories which did not show significant soil ph changes relative to the control fig 8 among the remaining categories only the effect of the ttw category on soil ph changes was positive while the others showed a negative effect 3 7 effects of tww irrigation on ec regardless of the wastewater treatment grade or the soil texture the soil ec following tww irrigation was significantly higher than that following irrigation with conventional water fig 9 for the wastewater treatment grade categories the increase in soil ec after ttw irrigation was significantly higher than that after stw irrigation while no difference was observed between the two categories and the ptw category where the highest soil ec increase was obtained in contrast for the soil texture categories the increase in ec showed a minimum value in the clayey textured soil although the gap between it and other soil texture categories was insignificant however a significant difference was found between the remaining soil texture categories 3 8 effects of tww irrigation on yield because of the limited number of papers meeting the demand for a meta analysis and providing yield data at the same time only 25 data pairs for crop yield from 9 studies were included in this meta study and they were grouped by the wastewater treatment grade stw or ttw soil texture sandy texture loamy texture or clayey texture and crop type annuals or perennials fig 10 there were highly contrasting effects between the stw category and ttw category stw irrigation led to a significant increase in crop yield of 3 4 while ttw irrigation led to a significant reduction in crop yield of 13 0 similarly ttw irrigation resulted in opposite effects between different crop types although the increase decrease in crop yield was insignificant compared to that of the control or between each other highly contrasting effects were also found between clayey texture and loamy texture categories compared with the conventional irrigation treatment the change in crop yield following tww irrigation was 7 2 95 ci 6 3 8 0 and 16 4 95 ci 23 6 to 8 5 in the clayey textured soil and loamy textured soil respectively the crop yield in sandy textured soil was reduced by 4 4 95 ci 14 8 to 7 4 clearly the effect of the sandy texture category was insignificant relative to the control and insignificantly different from that of the remaining soil texture categories 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects the results showed that soil irrigated with tww had a higher content of salinity than that with conventional water irrigation i e following tww irrigation soil was salinized fig 3 the accumulation of the four ions k na mg ca in soil varied with increases of 90 1 59 9 25 2 and 17 3 respectively thus it was inevitable that the soil ec a measure of soil salinity was significantly enhanced by tww irrigation and it reached approximately 57 2 this finding was consistent with several previous studies mohammad and mazahreh 2003 shilpi et al 2018 in terms of the changes in soil ph the effect of tww irrigation was not statistically significant which is supported by the works of wang et al 2003 and mohammad rusan et al 2007 however gelsomino et al 2006 and adrover et al 2012 found an increase in soil ph after tww irrigation totally opposite results were revealed in the studies of ndour et al 2008 and xu et al 2010 where the response of soil ph to tww irrigation was negative the differences between experimental conditions may contribute to these contradictory conclusions for the same reason conflicting results were found when studying the crop yield responses to tww irrigation in this study there was a significant decrease 6 5 on average in crop yield after tww irrigation tww irrigation brought about a series of problems such as soil salinization caused by soil salt accumulation soil compaction soil structure degradation and microbiota decline bedbabis et al 2014 obviously these changes led to a reduction in crop yield levy et al 2014 however it has been reported that the organic matter and beneficial growth ions n p k ca etc contained in wastewater have the effect of increasing crop yield jung et al 2014 bedbabis et al 2015 once irrigated with tww changes in soil properties and crop growth are mainly dependent on the ion content while the source and treatment processes of untreated wastewater determine its ion content gagné et al 2013 thus we made efforts to identify the changes in soil salt content and crop yield when irrigated with tww varied by the wastewater treatment grade soil texture was also taken into consideration in the subgroup analysis in view of its effects on moisture salinity and nutrient transport in soil lu et al 2019 2021 gao et al 2020 which may impact the effectiveness of tww irrigation in addition extra attention was given to the effect of crop type on tww irrigation in this paper in terms of crop yield due to the different salt tolerances of crops unfortunately some other potential impact variables such as irrigation methods irrigation systems and mixed irrigation water were not included in the subgroup analyses of this meta study due to the limited number of studies and observations 4 2 effects of wastewater treatment grade regulations requires the quality of irrigation water while substances contained in wastewater may lead to negative changes in soil physicochemical properties therefore before its use for irrigation wastewater is typically further treated by wastewater treatment plants wwtps to reduce harm chiou 2008 muñoz et al 2009 becerra castro et al 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 generally the wastewater treatment process in wwtps falls into three stages primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment however the soil salt accumulation did not gradually decrease with the step by step purification of wastewater as shown in fig 4a the contribution of the different treatment levels to the increase in soil ca content from large to small was ranked ptw ttw and stw the same results were observed for the changes in soil na content soil k content and soil ec after irrigation with tww varied by wastewater treatment grade fig 5a fig 7a and fig 9a while the order of soil mg accumulation from large to small was ranked ttw ptw and stw fig 6a at the tertiary stage to further remove contaminants or nutrients in wastewater some removal techniques take advantage of additional inorganic electrolytes such as nacl cacl2 and mgso4 du et al 2014 niu et al 2016 in addition alkali materials typically caco3 or naoh are used to adjust the ph of acidic wastewater in this step saritpongteeraka and chaiprapat 2008 the usage of these chemicals would result in a higher salt content in the producing water ttw leading to a higher increase in soil salinity following ttw irrigation as well as soil ec the increased salt content and reduced nutrients in ttw may also give birth to a significant reduction in crop yield fig 10a a similar negative effect of ttw irrigation was found by nicolás et al 2016 with ttw irrigation the mandarin yield decreased year by year however contrary to ttw irrigation the results showed that stw irrigation contributed to a significant increase in crop yield totally different from the conclusion reached by pedrero et al 2012 in their study lemons irrigated with stw had a lower yield than those irrigated with ttw mixing with well quality groundwater when conducting ttw irrigation was the key factor that resulted in conflicting effects and led to better use efficiency under this situation the harm of tww irrigation was reduced and less obvious than its promoting effect the comparison between the positive and negative effects of tww irrigation determines how crop yield would be affected reduced or increased by tww irrigation it calls for clarifying the boundary between harmful substances and nutrients in tww to obtain as much benefit as possible not only is the tww composition important but also the crop type different plants have different sensitivities to tww and tolerances to stress with the same stw irrigation treatment the nutrients in stw promoted the growth of pakchoi but led to stress in cotton chen et al 2012 our findings indicated that a change trend of crop yield would occur following tww irrigation but did not mean that the same result would always be obtained it must be pointed out that unless expensive desalination processes are used most mineral salts in wastewater cannot be removed even by tertiary treatment processes zalacáin et al 2019 this finding implies that the content of basic cations in tww is usually high thus increasing the alkaline reserve of the soil mancino and pepper 1992 as a result the soil ph increased with ttw irrigation fig 8a however this change in soil ph was insignificant which is consistent with previous studies al lahham et al 2007 bastida et al 2018 the adjustment of the ph during the wastewater treatment process may be a possible reason for the increase such an increase in ph was also reported by libutti et al 2018 who found that soil ph with stw irrigation was significantly higher than that in ttw irrigated plots this difference may be related to the different treatment processes compared to the secondary wastewater treatment the tertiary wastewater treatment added the step of nitrogen removal an enhanced rate of denitrification that produced hydroxyl ions contributed to the increase in soil ph tarchouna et al 2010 however a completely contrary result was obtained by our subgroup analysis in which stw significantly decreased soil ph similarly irrigation with ptw without nitrogen removal also reduced soil ph although not significantly fig 8a the same conclusion was reached by farahat and linderholm 2013 tunc and sahin 2015 and tsigoida and argyrokastritis 2020 usman and ghallab 2006 insisted that nitrification with ammonium was more likely to occur following tww irrigation due to high inputs of nitrate loads from wastewater thus leading to a decrease in soil ph in addition the absorption of ammonia ions by plants and leaching of basic cations may both lead to a decline in soil ph bedbabis et al 2014 4 3 effects of soil texture soil texture influences the retention rate of the main salt base ions azouzi et al 2016 concluded that the low permeability of dense soil led to greater salt retention following tww irrigation relative to that in the sandy loam soil lower na k and ec were found in the loamy sand when tww was used for irrigation in the study of tsigoida and argyrokastritis 2020 however in our study sandier soil showed a higher salt accumulation after tww irrigation the increases in ec and four basic ions ca na mg and k were higher in the sandy soil than the clayey soil fig 4b fig 5b fig 6b fig 7b and fig 9b the gap between the ec and four basic ions contents in tww and soil may introduce a bias for this category because the salinity level in soil was greater than that in treated wastewater azouzi et al 2016 observed a decline in the ec values of saline soil irrigated with tww which may also be the reason for the significant decrease in na content in the loamy soil observed here fig 5b thus tww seemed to represent a potentially beneficial application method for wastewater although it requires intensive study in view of the nitrification of ammonium caused by the high salt content from tww usman and ghallab 2006 the soil ph decreased in all soil texture categories higher soil salt accumulation leads to a higher decrease in soil ph resulting from the stronger nitrification of ammonium thus the decline in the ph of the sandy soil was higher than that of the clayey soil due to the greater increase in salt content fig 8b however the difference was insignificant which may be because the soil texture categories were not sufficiently different in this paper most experiments were conducted in loam which was further grouped into three categories based on the second category of texture similarly the higher accumulation of soil salinity compared to that in clayey soil contributed to a lower increase in crop yield in sandy soil relative to the control because of the harm of tww irrigation bedbabis et al 2014 crop yield was reduced in the loamy and sandy textured soil fig 10b despite wastewater containing nutrients beneficial to crop growth jung et al 2014 however clayey textured soil has a stronger ability to keep fertilizer gao et al 2020 therefore tww had a significantly positive effect on the yield of crops grown in clay however insufficient statistical data only 25 data pairs may reduce the confidence in the results 4 4 effects of crop type a reliable yield dataset is very important for assessing the average irrigation impact of tww by meta analysis unfortunately few papers met the criteria for inclusion in this study and only 9 of them focused on crop yield and they reported 25 pairwise comparisons of fruits grains and vegetables in total then based on crop type these 25 data pairs were divided into two categories annuals or perennials once planted perennials can grow for many years indicating that perennial crops will continue to suffer from the negative impact of tww irrigation before the next tww irrigation cycle while annuals germinate grow flower and then die over the course of a year therefore perennials may have worse growth performance after several continuous growth cycles with tww irrigation considering that some experiments from the studies used for this analysis were performed for more than one year it is no wonder that tww irrigation had a negative effect on perennials but a positive effect on annuals fig 10c in addition this classification under tww irrigation without considering the sensitivity of crops especially salt tolerance is one sided the yield of olive trees a perennial woody plant can also be increased by tww irrigation due to moderate tolerance to salinity petousi et al 2015 bourazanis et al 2016 for the same reason different varieties of tomato showed totally opposite responses to tww irrigation in cultivation experiments aiello et al 2007 thus tww irrigation has great potential and operability for salt tolerant crops relative to the control the change in yield of annual and perennial crops was insignificant similarly gatta et al 2015 and libutti et al 2018 found no significant difference in crop yield between tww irrigation and ground water irrigation however this finding must be treated with caution because the experimental durations were still not long enough no more than 3 years in light of the damage of lasting tww irrigation to soil physicochemical properties which is an obstacle to wastewater utilization in practice petousi et al 2015 more efforts are needed to evaluate its long term effects and then take action to gain the maximum benefits furthermore the ratio of marketable yield to nonmarketable yield was reduced in the studies of gatta et al 2015 and libutti et al 2018 implying negative changes in crop quality caused by tww irrigation which was the deficiency of this analysis 5 conclusions negative changes in the soil environment are inevitable with long term tww irrigation thus we selected 21 papers and then performed a meta analysis whose main objective was to quantify the accumulation of four salts ca na mg and k in soil following tww irrigation the results showed that irrigation with tww significantly promoted the accumulation of k na mg and ca in soil by 90 1 59 9 25 2 and 17 3 on average respectively while the effect on crop yield was negative with a significant decrease of 6 5 however the responses of the soil salt content and crop yield were dependent on the wastewater treatment grade and soil texture in general salt accumulation in soil was the highest after ptw irrigation followed by ttw and stw in terms of soil texture higher sand content in soil led to a higher increase in soil salt content following tww irrigation for crop yield a highly contrasting effect was observed between the stw category and ttw category and the same was true between the clayey texture and loamy texture crop yield significantly increased by 3 4 with stw irrigation and by 7 2 in the clayed textured soil demonstrating the potential of tww irrigation however some factors that may also affect soil salt accumulation and crop yield such as the irrigation methods irrigation systems and mixing of irrigation

9963,the influence of soil salinity on plant root water uptake rwu must be considered in order to promote efficient irrigation management however due to challenges in parameterization modeling rwu response to salinity is problematic we set out to characterize the influence of soil salinity on tomato rwu under conditions of irrigation with high salinity water and to improve methods for optimizing parameters of rwu model experiments were conducted in a greenhouse over two seasons 2016 and 2017 three irrigation water salinity treatments 0 4 s1 3 4 s2 and 6 4 s3 mg cm 3 were evaluated the results showed that soil water content and salinity increased with the irrigation water salinity especially in the top soil layers and that rwu was reduced by the increased root zone salinity an inverse method based on a one dimensional equation of soil water movement was used to estimate the rwu rate distribution under drip irrigation and determined to be reliable the parameter value of the normalized root length distribution nrld function was fitted through the estimated rwu rate distributions for treatment s1 without the effect of salinity stress the fitted nrld function was used to optimize the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor β through the measured soil moisture and salinity of treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 with the optimized parameters of β the rwu rates of treatments s2 and s3 in 2017 were simulated the simulated rwu rates based on the rwu model agreed well with the estimated rwu rates using the inverse method with root mean squared error rmse and normalized root mean squared error nrmse less than 0 00067 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and index of agreement ia higher than 0 94 these findings can be used to estimate the nrld distribution and determine actual crop water requirements under saline conditions with no root distribution data required this should contribute to efficient and sustainable irrigation scheduling abbreviations dat days after

distribution 1 introduction scarcity of fresh water is a serious problem for development of agriculture and social stability in semi arid areas around the world kang et al 2017 farmers in china have recently been encouraged to switch from production of field crops to greenhouse grown vegetables in order to become more economically viable the move allows increased production and improved profits but requires higher water consumption per area cultivated zhang et al 2015 reca et al 2018 the expansion of greenhouse vegetable production therefore has been accompanied by a growing scarcity of fresh water one approach to water scarcity in dry region agriculture is to turn to non conventional water resources for irrigation there are often sources of water high in salts brackish and saline in arid and semi arid regions of the world however irrigation with poor quality high salinity water may cause soil secondary salinization in the crop rootzone beltrán 1999 ning et al 2020 in greenhouse production systems natural precipitation is intercepted and does not reach the soils to aid leaching kim et al 2016 root zone salinity reduces the ability of plants to take up water ning et al 2021 and this causes rapid reduction in growth along with a suite of metabolic changes and secondary physiological responses munns 2002 knowledge regarding the response of crop root water uptake rwu to soil salinity is essential to understand soil water plant atmosphere relationships and processes and to manipulate the system to minimize the negative effects of salinity on crop production and advance efficient irrigation scheduling models developed to simulate rwu can be divided into two groups representing microscopic and macroscopic approaches li et al 1999 vogel et al 2016 peters et al 2017 the macroscopic approach is more popular due to the advantage of requiring simpler flow geometry and fewer input parameters lafolie 1991 dudley and shani 2003 in the macroscopic models under conditions of irrigation with water high in salts the negative effect of salinity stress on rwu is quantified by inducing a reduction factor which is a function of soil solution salt concentration or osmotic potential jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 coppola et al 2015 saadat and homaee 2015 the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor are influenced by many variables i e plant salt tolerance local soil conditions etc and are typically derived from the literature experientially or by trial and error using transpiration measurements hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 dudley and shani 2003 skaggs et al 2006 homaee et al 2002 reported that parameter values derived from the literature often were unsuccessful in generating acceptable simulation results and therefore considerable uncertainty remains regarding the appropriateness of parameter values for the accuracy of model performance wang et al 2012 reported a method for optimizing the parameter of salinity stress factor in a winter wheat rwu model based on the linear relationship between the root nitrogen density and the maximum rwu rate however it is difficult and expensive to measure root nitrogen mass distribution of crops the spatial distribution of rwu is closely related to root distribution often characterized by root length density rld rld distribution varies with crop growth stages measuring or simulating rld accurately is also challenging and time consuming especially under ﬁeld conditions himmelbauer et al 2004 zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 normalized rld nrld represents the root length as proportional allocation of roots relative to depth wu et al 1999 zuo et al 2013 and ning et al 2015 2019 demonstrated generality of nrld distributions independent of external factors including growing season genotype soil environment planting modes or climate clearly there remains a need for accurate and robust methods to parameterize the salinity stress reduction factor and rld distribution of rwu models tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is one of the most important and widespread cultivated vegetables including in protective structures like greenhouses water shortage affects tomato productivity and pushes famers to use alternative resources such as brackish groundwater for irrigation secondary salinization of greenhouse soil is another insidious problem inhibiting tomato yield when salty water is used although the effects of salinity on tomato plant growth yield and fruit quality have been widely described mohammad et al 1998 li and stanghellini 2001 ben gal and shani 2002 chaichi et al 2017 quantifying the response of salinity stress on tomato rwu is much less frequently studied the objectives of this study were to characterize the influence of soil salinity on tomato rwu under conditions of irrigation with high salinity water and to develop a method for optimizing parameters of a rwu model without root distribution information 2 materials and methods 2 1

of tomato rwu to salinity stress soil water and salinity dynamics under drip irrigation are inherently multidimensional but due to the relative simplicity and ease in use of one dimensional 1 d models compared to 2 d 3 d cases a 1 d model that maximizes accuracy while minimizing data requirements should be satisfactory as a tool for simulating output ﬂuxes of water balance components indeed rwu under agricultural situations including with drip irrigation has previously successfully been simulated with 1 d models tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 visconti et al 2014 er raki et al 2021 one d models have additionally been used to evaluate impact of the application of drip irrigation with salty water on soil environments chen et al 2010 phogat et al 2020 confidence in appropriateness of utilization of a 1 d numerical model in the present study was boosted due to the experimental set up that included close spacing between emitters relatively large application depths per irrigation event and low dripper discharge rate gonzález et al 2015 the following model is often employed to simulate one dimensional vertical soil water flow with rwu using the richards equation under

be 60 cm under drip irrigation most of the tomato roots were distributed within 0 40 cm of top soil layers machado and oliveira 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 we estimated the actual rwu rate s z r using an inverse method developed by zuo and zhang 2002 using the two successive measured 0 and t and t is the time interval soil water content profiles θ z 0 and θ z t the decrease in soil moisture resulting from root water uptake over the period from 0 to t at different depths is represented by δθ z 0 t the average rwu during a period from t 0 to t is calculated as s z 0 t δθ z 0 t t specifically s z t is set as 0 and eq 2 5 were solved using an implicit difference method based on initial measurements of soil moisture t 0 to obtain δθ 1 z i 0 t when t t in the 1st iteration this first iteration ignores the influence of s by letting s 0 δθ 1 z i 0 t is calculated by subtracting δθ t z i 0 t from δθ 1 z i 0 t and dividing the resulting value by t the result of this division is then input into the original equation as an approximation of the average rwu s 1 z t which is defined by s 1 z t δ θ 1 z t t to obtain s 2 z i t in the 2nd iteration if δθ 2 z i 0 t is smaller than the error threshold the mean square relative error the iterative process is terminated otherwise s 2 z i t is calculated using the relationship s 2 z t s 1 z t δ θ 1 z t t with the result inputed into the original equation for another iteration this iteration process is be repeated until the aforementioned termination criterion is met the s z r of the whole plant root zone can be approximated by the actual transpiration rate t a cm d 1 the inverse method for estimating actual transpiration rate t ae cm d 1 was calculated by 16 t a e 0 l r s z r d z r moreover the average actual evapotranspiration rate et a during the interval between two soil sampling events can be obtained by the soil water balance equation vázquez et al 2006 koksal et al 2017 liu et al 2017 in the greenhouse there was no precipitation and the run off could be considered negligible since the soil bed was flat due to the soil bed being mulched by plastic film soil evaporation e a could also be assumed negligible thus et a was approximated to t a calculated by the water balance method as t ac cm d 1 17 t a c i δ w d δ t where i is irrigation amount cm δ w is change of soil water storage in

hydraulic conductivity function cm d 1 the performance of the inverse method for estimating the rwu rate under drip irrigation condition was investigated by comparing the agreement of t ae and t ac under the non saline treatment s1 the influence of salinity stress on plant rwu could be ignored and therefore β 1 in eq 6 wang et al 2012 due to the difficulty in measuring the rld the nrld function eq 14 was fitted using the inversed rwu rate distribution of treatment s1 substituting eq 9 into eq 6 yields 19 l n r d z r s l r γ h t p where t p is calculated using eq 11 the value of a in eq 14 is fitted using the least square method the value of parameters p and φ o 50 can be subsequently optimized by the least square method through eq 15 the result allows simulation of the response of crop rwu to root zone soil salinity root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and index of agreement ia were used to assess the performance of the rwu model nrmse 15 indicates good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement suárez rey et al 2016 the range of ia varies between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates total agreement between estimated and simulated values willmott 1982 menegat et al 2018 the closer the value of ia is to 1 the better the model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions in the greenhouse daily air maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min solar radiation rs and relative humidity rh for the two growing seasons are presented in fig 2 there were similar meteorological conditions during the experimental period in 2016 and 2017 the temperature varied from 8 37 to 51 50 and 9 80 to 52 62 with average values of 28 80 and 27 74 during the experimental period in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a and b the mean values of daily rh were 63 98 and 55 01 for growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a and b the average values of rs were 112 87 and 96 48 w m 2 during the study period in 2016 and 2017 fig 2c and d comparatively lower rh and rs were observed in 2017 due to the aging of the plastic film covering the greenhouse based on the measured meteorological data in greenhouse the calculated et o using the penman monteith equation varied from 0 58 to 4 48 and 0 72 to 4 14 mm d 1 during the growing season for the two years fig 2c and d 3 2 weighted average soil water content and salinity soil water contents at equal depths from the three sampling points were used to calculate θ based on eq 1 and presented in fig 3 soil water content mainly changed within the 0 40 cm soil layer of the upper root zone consistent with the tomato root growth domain throughout the experimental period in 2016 θ for s1 s2 and s3 were 0 171 0194 and 0 205 cm3 cm 3 compared with treatment s1 θ of treatments s2 and s3 were increased by 13 45 and 19 88 respectively the same phenomenon was found in 2017 de pascale and barbieri 1995 in their study on various winter vegetable crops reported that the soil water content was significantly higher with greater irrigation water salinity which could be expected due to smaller plants and lower uptake and transpiration the e c 1 5 of treatments s2 and s3 increased gradually with time fig 4 during the study period in 2016 e c 1 5 at depths of 0 20 cm under treatments s1 s2 and s3 were 117 75 316 22 and 491 13 μs cm 1 respectively for soil layers of 20 70 cm e c 1 5 of treatments s1 s2 and s3 were 98 39 202 81 and 310 48 μs cm 1 respectively it is obvious that as irrigation water salinity increased more salt accumulated in the rootzone especially in top soil layers fig 4a c similar results were observed in 2017 fig 4d f rameshwaran et al 2016 found that soil salinity increased with the levels of irrigation water salinity within the rootzone at depths of 0 60 cm for greenhouse pepper 3 3 tomato rwu rate distribution based on the measured soil water distributions at different periods in 2016 the average rwu fig 5 was estimated using the inverse method proposed by zuo and zhang 2002 the average rwu rate decreased with increasing soil depth for each treatment moreover the average rwu rate decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity for example the values of average rwu rate at 10 20 cm soil depth were 0 0092 0 0053 and 0 0046 cm3 cm 3 d 1 for treatments s1 s2 and s3 during 72 86 dat respectively this indicates that tomato rwu was restricted by the accumulated salinity in the rootzone fig 4 and led to higher soil water content under s2 and s3 treatments fig 3 estimated t ae using eq 16 agreed well with the measured t ac using water balance eq 17 during different periods in 2016 fig 6 with a regression line slope of 1 10 and determination coefficients r 2 of 0 94 p 0 01 this indicates successful use of the inverse method to estimate average rwu rate distributions in this study this further verifies the feasibility of describing soil water flow under drip irrigation at least in this case using the 1 d numerical model 3 4 parameterization of nrld distribution function the value of a in the nrld function eq 14 was optimized through eq 19 using the weighted average soil water content distributions fig 3 and the estimated rwu rate fig 5 for treatment s1 in 2016 as a 1 71 with a r 2 of 0 87 n 25 p 0 01 fig 7 the fitted a in the generalized nlrd function was verified by simulating the rwu distribution using eq 6 under treatment s1 in 2017 β 1 in eq 6 the simulated and estimated rwu rate distribution of treatment s1 during periods of 30 44 and 46 60 dat are compared in fig 10a and d the predicted rwu rate distributions were in good agreement with the simulated values table 1 this indicates that the fitted coefficient a in the nlrd function can be used to characterize the rwu rate of tomato the reliability of the method for fitting the a parameter was also evaluated comparing the estimated and measured nrld fig 9 the estimated nrld values agreed well with the measured values with a regression line slope of 0 98 and determination coefficients r 2 of 0 87 p 0 01 the nrld distributions can be used to provide rational information concerning root distribution for root water nutrient uptake simulation and soil plant atmosphere interaction studies wu et al 1999 zuo et al 2004 2013 and ning et al 2015 2019 collected and analyzed nrld characterizes for crops e g wheat maize cotton beans and rice from field measured and published rld data under different conditions the fitted parameter values of the nrld function were optimized and determined by a large number of measured nrld data zuo et al 2004 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 we however successfully use an inverse method to determine parameter values in nrld functions without any root distribution data this indicates that nrld distribution functions in crop or eco hydrology models e g hydrus could be similarly parameterized with the inverse method thus providing an important reference for characterizing the crop rld proﬁles 3 5 optimizing the parameters in salinity stress reduction function the inversely determined rwu rate measured soil water content and measured soil salinity under treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 were used to optimize the parameters of the salinity stress reduction function and the data from 2017 were used for model verification on the basis of the fitted a 1 71 in the nrld function the measured soil water content and soil salinity the calculated t p and the inversed rwu rate s the parameters p and φ o50 eq 15 were optimized with the least squares method as p 0 95 and φ o50 8826 cm for tomato in the present research with a r 2 of 0 873 p 0 01 fig 8 these can be compared to values determined for other crops for example skaggs et al 2006 used the parameter values of p 3 and φ o50 15 000 cm for alfalfa wang et al 2012 determined p 3 03 and φ o50 13 875 cm for winter wheat in a greenhouse experiment and p 2 08 and φ o50 9200 cm for the same crop under open field conditions babazadeh et al 2017 estimated that values of p and φ o50 were 2 1 and 2833 2 cm for basil it is clear that values of p and φ o50 are soil crop and climate specific skaggs et al 2006 and therefore must be determined based on actual conditions until now it has not been possible to directly measure the parameters of the salinity stress reduction function wang et al 2012 on the basis of measured relationship between soil salinity and relative yield of a crop under its different growth stages the parameters of the salinity stress reduction functions were fitted by jalali et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 optimized the parameters of salinity stress reduction functions by measuring mean soil solution salinity and the ratio of actual transpiration rate to potential transpiration rate wang et al 2012 proposed a method for optimizing the parameters of salinity stress reduction functions based on linear relationships between maximum rwu rate and measured root nitrogen density all of these methods for optimizing parameters require either a large amount of measured data homaee et al 2002 jalali et al 2017 or expensive root analysis wang et al 2012 in contrast the proposed method for optimizing parameters in this study neither requires large amounts of data nor expensive analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted by individually fluctuating the parameters p or φ o 50 with 25 error while keeping the other parameter at its original value chang et al 2019 in this way rwu was found to be more sensitive to changes in φ o 50 than to changes in p with rwu ranging from 8 63 to 11 32 the rwu rate of treatments s2 and s3 during 30 44 and 46 60 dat in 2017 was simulated using eq 15 using the known measured distributions of soil water content and salinity the fitted nrld function with the fitting parameter a and the calculated potential transpiration comparison of simulated and inversed rwu rates of the three treatments in 2017 is shown in fig 10 the rmse nrmse and ia between the simulated and inversed rwu rates are listed in table 1 the results show that the simulated rwu rates agreed well with the inversed values with the rmse and nrmse less than 0 00052 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and with an ia higher than 0 94 this implies that the method of optimizing the salinity stress factor parameters was reliable and could be used to establish the rwu model under conditions of salinity and simulate the response of rwu to salt accumulation in crop root zone 4 conclusion a simplified inversed method based on one dimensional soil water transport was employed to estimate average rwu rate profiles through two measured average soil water content profiles the inverse method was verified to be reliable under drip irrigation the coefficient a of the nrld function was fitted through the rwu model for treatment s1 the fitted results were evaluated by simulating rwu rate of treatment s1 in 2017 the simulated results were in good agreement with the estimated rwu distributions using the fitted a the estimated rwu rates and the measured soil salinity and soil water content of treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor β were optimized as p 0 95 and φ o 50 8826 cm thereupon the response model of tomato rwu to salinity stress was established and applied to simulate the rwu rate distributions of treatments s2 and s3 in 2017 the simulated rwu rate distributions agreed well with the estimated values using the inverse method with the rmse nrmse less than 0 00067 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and the ia higher than 0 94 the proposed method for establishing the rwu model was applicable to characterize the effect of salinity stress on tomato water consumption the method also could be used to optimize irrigation strategies declaration of

9963,the influence of soil salinity on plant root water uptake rwu must be considered in order to promote efficient irrigation management however due to challenges in parameterization modeling rwu response to salinity is problematic we set out to characterize the influence of soil salinity on tomato rwu under conditions of irrigation with high salinity water and to improve methods for optimizing parameters of rwu model experiments were conducted in a greenhouse over two seasons 2016 and 2017 three irrigation water salinity treatments 0 4 s1 3 4 s2 and 6 4 s3 mg cm 3 were evaluated the results showed that soil water content and salinity increased with the irrigation water salinity especially in the top soil layers and that rwu was reduced by the increased root zone salinity an inverse method based on a one dimensional equation of soil water movement was used to estimate the rwu rate distribution under drip irrigation and determined to be reliable the parameter value of the normalized root length distribution nrld function was fitted through the estimated rwu rate distributions for treatment s1 without the effect of salinity stress the fitted nrld function was used to optimize the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor β through the measured soil moisture and salinity of treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 with the optimized parameters of β the rwu rates of treatments s2 and s3 in 2017 were simulated the simulated rwu rates based on the rwu model agreed well with the estimated rwu rates using the inverse method with root mean squared error rmse and normalized root mean squared error nrmse less than 0 00067 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and index of agreement ia higher than 0 94 these findings can be used to estimate the nrld distribution and determine

distribution 1 introduction scarcity of fresh water is a serious problem for development of agriculture and social stability in semi arid areas around the world kang et al 2017 farmers in china have recently been encouraged to switch from production of field crops to greenhouse grown vegetables in order to become more economically viable the move allows increased production and improved profits but requires higher water consumption per area cultivated zhang et al 2015 reca et al 2018 the expansion of greenhouse vegetable production therefore has been accompanied by a growing scarcity of fresh water one approach to water scarcity in dry region agriculture is to turn to non conventional water resources for irrigation there are often sources of water high in salts brackish and saline in arid and semi arid regions of the world however irrigation with poor quality high salinity water may cause soil secondary salinization in the crop rootzone beltrán 1999 ning et al 2020 in greenhouse production systems natural precipitation is intercepted and does not reach the soils to aid leaching kim et al 2016 root zone salinity reduces the ability of plants to take up water ning et al 2021 and this causes rapid reduction in growth along with a suite of metabolic changes and secondary physiological responses munns 2002 knowledge regarding the response of crop root water uptake rwu to soil salinity is essential to understand soil water plant atmosphere relationships and processes and to manipulate the system to minimize the negative effects of salinity on crop production and advance efficient irrigation scheduling models developed to simulate rwu can be divided into two groups representing microscopic and macroscopic approaches li et al 1999 vogel et al 2016 peters et al 2017 the macroscopic approach is more popular due to the advantage of requiring simpler flow geometry and fewer input parameters lafolie 1991 dudley and shani 2003 in the macroscopic models under conditions of irrigation with water high in salts the negative effect of salinity stress on rwu is quantified by inducing a reduction factor which is a function of soil solution salt concentration or osmotic potential jorenush and sepaskhah 2003 coppola et al 2015 saadat and homaee 2015 the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor are influenced by many variables i e plant salt tolerance local soil conditions etc and are typically derived from the literature experientially or by trial and error using transpiration measurements hopmans and guttièrez ravé 1988 dudley and shani 2003 skaggs et al 2006 homaee et al 2002 reported that parameter values derived from the literature often were unsuccessful in generating acceptable simulation results and therefore considerable uncertainty remains regarding the appropriateness of parameter values for the accuracy of model performance wang et al 2012 reported a method for optimizing the parameter of salinity stress factor in a winter wheat rwu model based on the linear relationship between the root nitrogen density and the maximum rwu rate however it is difficult and expensive to measure root nitrogen mass distribution of crops the spatial distribution of rwu is closely related to root distribution often characterized by root length density rld rld distribution varies with crop growth stages measuring or simulating rld accurately is also challenging and time consuming especially under ﬁeld conditions himmelbauer et al 2004 zuo et al 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 normalized rld nrld represents the root length as proportional allocation of roots relative to depth wu et al 1999 zuo et al 2013 and ning et al 2015 2019 demonstrated generality of nrld distributions independent of external factors including growing season genotype soil environment planting modes or climate clearly there remains a need for accurate and robust methods to parameterize the salinity stress reduction factor and rld distribution of rwu models tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is one of the most important and widespread cultivated vegetables including in protective structures like greenhouses water shortage affects tomato productivity and pushes famers to use alternative resources such as brackish groundwater for irrigation secondary salinization of greenhouse soil is another insidious problem inhibiting tomato yield when salty water is used although the effects of salinity on tomato plant growth yield and fruit quality have been widely described mohammad et al 1998 li and stanghellini 2001 ben gal and shani 2002 chaichi et al 2017 quantifying the response of salinity stress on tomato rwu is much less frequently studied the objectives of this study were to characterize the influence of soil salinity on tomato rwu under conditions of irrigation with high salinity water and to develop a method for optimizing parameters of a rwu model without root distribution information 2 materials and methods 2 1

of tomato rwu to salinity stress soil water and salinity dynamics under drip irrigation are inherently multidimensional but due to the relative simplicity and ease in use of one dimensional 1 d models compared to 2 d 3 d cases a 1 d model that maximizes accuracy while minimizing data requirements should be satisfactory as a tool for simulating output ﬂuxes of water balance components indeed rwu under agricultural situations including with drip irrigation has previously successfully been simulated with 1 d models tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 visconti et al 2014 er raki et al 2021 one d models have additionally been used to evaluate impact of the application of drip irrigation with salty water on soil environments chen et al 2010 phogat et al 2020 confidence in appropriateness of utilization of a 1 d numerical model in the present study was boosted due to the experimental set up that included close spacing between emitters relatively large application depths per irrigation event and low dripper discharge rate gonzález et al 2015 the following model is often employed to simulate one dimensional vertical soil water flow with rwu using the richards equation under

be 60 cm under drip irrigation most of the tomato roots were distributed within 0 40 cm of top soil layers machado and oliveira 2005 zotarelli et al 2009 we estimated the actual rwu rate s z r using an inverse method developed by zuo and zhang 2002 using the two successive measured 0 and t and t is the time interval soil water content profiles θ z 0 and θ z t the decrease in soil moisture resulting from root water uptake over the period from 0 to t at different depths is represented by δθ z 0 t the average rwu during a period from t 0 to t is calculated as s z 0 t δθ z 0 t t specifically s z t is set as 0 and eq 2 5 were solved using an implicit difference method based on initial measurements of soil moisture t 0 to obtain δθ 1 z i 0 t when t t in the 1st iteration this first iteration ignores the influence of s by letting s 0 δθ 1 z i 0 t is calculated by subtracting δθ t z i 0 t from δθ 1 z i 0 t and dividing the resulting value by t the result of this division is then input into the original equation as an approximation of the average rwu s 1 z t which is defined by s 1 z t δ θ 1 z t t to obtain s 2 z i t in the 2nd iteration if δθ 2 z i 0 t is smaller than the error threshold the mean square relative error the iterative process is terminated otherwise s 2 z i t is calculated using the relationship s 2 z t s 1 z t δ θ 1 z t t with the result inputed into the original equation for another iteration this iteration process is be repeated until the aforementioned termination criterion is met the s z r of the whole plant root zone can be approximated by the actual transpiration rate t a cm d 1 the inverse method for estimating actual transpiration rate t ae cm d 1 was calculated by 16 t a e 0 l r s z r d z r moreover the average actual evapotranspiration rate et a during the interval between two soil sampling events can be obtained by the soil water balance equation vázquez et al 2006 koksal et al 2017 liu et al 2017 in the greenhouse there was no precipitation and the run off could be considered negligible since the soil bed was flat due to the soil bed being mulched by plastic film soil evaporation e a could also be

hydraulic conductivity function cm d 1 the performance of the inverse method for estimating the rwu rate under drip irrigation condition was investigated by comparing the agreement of t ae and t ac under the non saline treatment s1 the influence of salinity stress on plant rwu could be ignored and therefore β 1 in eq 6 wang et al 2012 due to the difficulty in measuring the rld the nrld function eq 14 was fitted using the inversed rwu rate distribution of treatment s1 substituting eq 9 into eq 6 yields 19 l n r d z r s l r γ h t p where t p is calculated using eq 11 the value of a in eq 14 is

temperature t min solar radiation rs and relative humidity rh for the two growing seasons are presented in fig 2 there were similar meteorological conditions during the experimental period in 2016 and 2017 the temperature varied from 8 37 to 51 50 and 9 80 to 52 62 with average values of 28 80 and 27 74 during the experimental period in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a and b the mean values of daily rh were 63 98 and 55 01 for growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 2a and b the average values of rs were 112 87 and 96 48 w m 2 during the study period in 2016 and 2017 fig 2c and d comparatively lower rh and rs were observed in 2017 due to the aging of the plastic film covering the greenhouse based on the measured meteorological data in greenhouse the calculated et o using the penman monteith equation varied from 0 58 to 4 48 and 0 72 to 4 14 mm d 1 during the growing season for the two years fig 2c and d 3 2 weighted average soil water content and salinity soil water contents at equal depths from the three sampling points were used to calculate θ based on eq 1 and presented in fig 3 soil water content mainly changed within the 0 40 cm soil layer of the upper root zone consistent with the tomato root growth domain throughout the experimental period in 2016 θ for s1 s2 and s3 were 0 171 0194 and 0 205 cm3 cm 3 compared with treatment s1 θ of treatments s2 and s3 were increased by 13 45 and 19 88 respectively the same phenomenon was found in 2017 de pascale and barbieri 1995 in their study on various winter vegetable crops reported that the soil water content was significantly higher with greater irrigation water salinity which could be expected due to smaller plants and lower uptake and transpiration the e c 1 5 of treatments s2 and s3 increased gradually with time fig 4 during the study period in 2016 e c 1 5 at depths of 0 20 cm under treatments s1 s2 and s3 were 117 75 316 22 and 491 13 μs cm 1 respectively for soil layers of 20 70 cm e c 1 5 of treatments s1 s2 and s3 were 98 39 202 81 and 310 48 μs cm 1 respectively it is obvious that as irrigation water salinity increased more salt accumulated in the rootzone especially in top soil layers fig 4a c similar results were observed in 2017 fig 4d f rameshwaran et al 2016 found that soil salinity increased with the levels of irrigation water salinity within the rootzone at depths of 0 60 cm for greenhouse pepper 3 3 tomato rwu rate distribution based on the measured soil water distributions at different periods in 2016 the average rwu fig 5 was estimated using the inverse method proposed by zuo and zhang 2002 the average rwu rate decreased with increasing soil depth for each treatment moreover the average rwu rate decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity for example the values of average rwu rate at 10 20 cm soil depth were 0 0092 0 0053 and 0 0046 cm3 cm 3 d 1 for treatments s1 s2 and s3 during 72 86 dat respectively this indicates that tomato rwu was restricted by the accumulated salinity in the rootzone fig 4 and led to higher soil water content under s2 and s3 treatments fig 3 estimated t ae using eq 16 agreed well with the measured t ac using water balance eq 17 during different periods in 2016 fig 6 with a regression line slope of 1 10 and determination coefficients r 2 of 0 94 p 0 01 this indicates successful use of the inverse method to estimate average rwu rate distributions in this study this further verifies the feasibility of describing soil water flow under drip irrigation at least in this case using the 1 d numerical model 3 4 parameterization of nrld distribution function the value of a in the nrld function eq 14 was optimized through eq 19 using the weighted average soil water content distributions fig 3 and the estimated rwu rate fig 5 for treatment s1 in 2016 as a 1 71 with a r 2 of 0 87 n 25 p 0 01 fig 7 the fitted a in the generalized nlrd function was verified by simulating the rwu distribution using eq 6 under treatment s1 in 2017 β 1 in eq 6 the simulated and estimated rwu rate distribution of treatment s1 during periods of 30 44 and 46 60 dat are compared in fig 10a and d the predicted rwu rate distributions were in good agreement with the simulated values table 1 this indicates that the fitted coefficient a in the nlrd function can be used to characterize the rwu rate of tomato the reliability of the method for fitting the a parameter was also evaluated comparing the estimated and measured nrld fig 9 the estimated nrld values agreed well with the measured values with a regression line slope of 0 98 and determination coefficients r 2 of 0 87 p 0 01 the nrld distributions can be used to provide rational information concerning root distribution for root water nutrient uptake simulation and soil plant atmosphere interaction studies wu et al 1999 zuo et al 2004 2013 and ning et al 2015 2019 collected and analyzed nrld characterizes for crops e g wheat maize cotton beans and rice from field measured and published rld data under different conditions the fitted parameter values of the nrld function were optimized and determined by a large number of measured nrld data zuo et al 2004 2013 ning et al 2015 2019 we however successfully use an inverse method to determine parameter values in nrld functions without any root distribution data this indicates that nrld distribution functions in crop or eco hydrology models e g hydrus could be similarly parameterized with the inverse method thus providing an important reference for characterizing the crop rld proﬁles 3 5 optimizing the parameters in salinity stress reduction function the inversely determined rwu rate measured soil water content and measured soil salinity under treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 were used to optimize the parameters of the salinity stress reduction function and the data from 2017 were used for model verification on the basis of the fitted a 1 71 in the nrld function the measured soil water content and soil salinity the calculated t p and the inversed rwu rate s the parameters p and φ o50 eq 15 were optimized with the least squares method as p 0 95 and φ o50 8826 cm for tomato in the present research with a r 2 of 0 873 p 0 01 fig 8 these can be compared to values determined for other crops for example skaggs et al 2006 used the parameter values of p 3 and φ o50 15 000 cm for alfalfa wang et al 2012 determined p 3 03 and φ o50 13 875 cm for winter wheat in a greenhouse experiment and p 2 08 and φ o50 9200 cm for the same crop under open field conditions babazadeh et al 2017 estimated that values of p and φ o50 were 2 1 and 2833 2 cm for basil it is clear that values of p and φ o50 are soil crop and climate specific skaggs et al 2006 and therefore must be determined based on actual conditions until now it has not been possible to directly measure the parameters of the salinity stress reduction function wang et al 2012 on the basis of measured relationship between soil salinity and relative yield of a crop under its different growth stages the parameters of the salinity stress reduction functions were fitted by jalali et al 2017 homaee et al 2002 optimized the parameters of salinity stress reduction functions by measuring mean soil solution salinity and the ratio of actual transpiration rate to potential transpiration rate wang et al 2012 proposed a method for optimizing the parameters of salinity stress reduction functions based on linear relationships between maximum rwu rate and measured root nitrogen density all of these methods for optimizing parameters require either a large amount of measured data homaee et al 2002 jalali et al 2017 or expensive root analysis wang et al 2012 in contrast the proposed method for optimizing parameters in this study neither requires large amounts of data nor expensive analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted by individually fluctuating the parameters p or φ o 50 with 25 error while keeping the other parameter at its original value chang et al 2019 in this way rwu was found to be more sensitive to changes in φ o 50 than to changes in p with rwu ranging from 8 63 to 11 32 the rwu rate of treatments s2 and s3 during 30 44 and 46 60 dat in 2017 was simulated using eq 15 using the known measured distributions of soil water content and salinity the fitted nrld function with the fitting parameter a and the calculated potential transpiration comparison of simulated and inversed rwu rates of the three treatments in 2017 is shown in fig 10 the rmse nrmse and ia between the simulated and inversed rwu rates are listed in table 1 the results show that the simulated rwu rates agreed well with the inversed values with the rmse and nrmse less than 0 00052 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and with an ia higher than 0 94 this implies that the method of optimizing the salinity stress factor parameters was reliable and could be used to establish the rwu model under conditions of salinity and simulate the response of rwu to salt accumulation in crop root zone 4 conclusion a simplified inversed method based on one dimensional soil water transport was employed to estimate average rwu rate profiles through two measured average soil water content profiles the inverse method was verified to be reliable under drip irrigation the coefficient a of the nrld function was fitted through the rwu model for treatment s1 the fitted results were evaluated by simulating rwu rate of treatment s1 in 2017 the simulated results were in good agreement with the estimated rwu distributions using the fitted a the estimated rwu rates and the measured soil salinity and soil water content of treatments s2 and s3 in 2016 the parameters of the salinity stress reduction factor β were optimized as p 0 95 and φ o 50 8826 cm thereupon the response model of tomato rwu to salinity stress was established and applied to simulate the rwu rate distributions of treatments s2 and s3 in 2017 the simulated rwu rate distributions agreed well with the estimated values using the inverse method with the rmse nrmse less than 0 00067 cm3 cm 3 d 1 and 12 36 and the ia higher than 0 94 the proposed method for establishing the rwu model was applicable to characterize the effect of salinity stress on tomato water consumption the method also could be used to optimize irrigation strategies declaration of

9964,the morphological characteristics of crop roots especially the plasticity of fine roots are directly related to the crop s ability to obtain soil water mulched drip irrigation can effectively regulate soil water distribution to achieve high cotton yield with reduced water consumption in the previous study from the perspective of root shoot coordination we found that mulched drip irrigation reduced the growth redundancy of roots and improved the root productivity of cotton thus achieving the goal of water saving and increased yield however it is unclear if and how mulched drip irrigation enhances absorptive capacity of roots via regulating dry and wet soil areas and optimizing fine root morphology and distribution compared with traditional flood irrigation to achieve this the effects of fine root plasticity on the absorptive capacity of roots were studied in a two year field experiment mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation reduced flood irrigation and conventional flood irrigation were used and soil water distribution and root distribution were determined the results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the soil water content swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer and reduced the fluctuation amplitude of swc at the flowering and boll stage of cotton mulched drip irrigation formed different dry and wet areas in the root zone i e the swc was higher in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line and most of the cotton roots were in the wet area the higher swc increased the distribution of fine roots in this area and shaped the shallow fine root system which enhanced the cotton plant s ability to absorb soil water statistical analysis showed that the higher fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage of cotton under mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase aboveground biomass thus increasing total bolls and seed cotton yield however compared with the irrigation amount of field production 390 mm an excessive amount of irrigation 600 mm reduced the seed cotton yield of mulched drip irrigation resulting in the decrease of irrigation water use efficiency iwue therefore mulched drip irrigation optimizes the distribution of fine roots and enhances water uptake by effectively regulating the water root relationship and thus improves seed cotton yield and iwue keywords irrigation methods cotton spatial distribution of soil water fine root plasticity seed cotton yield irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction xinjiang of china is an area that is known throughout the world as a cotton planting region but the development of cotton in this region is limited by the shortage of water wang et al 2011a in the past traditional flood irrigation plastic film mulching cultivation and flood irrigation was the method most often used in xinjiang cotton production which is characterized as being labor intensive requiring a large amount of irrigation and having poor irrigation uniformity resulting in low yield and water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2016 therefore developing water saving irrigation technology is the fundamental way forward for the development of agriculture in xinjiang and similar arid areas drip irrigation is considered the most effective way to save water goldberg et al 1976 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 it can deliver water directly to the root system of crops which then slowly and evenly penetrates into the root zone soil allowing the root system to fully absorb soil water goldberg et al 1976 ibragimov et al 2007 sampathkumar et al 2012 in the late 1990s drip irrigation was introduced in xinjiang and it was combined with plastic film mulching cultivation to develop into the cotton planting technology of mulched drip irrigation li et al 2011 this technique maintains the effects of plastic film mulch cultivation including increasing temperature conserving soil moisture and reducing surface evaporation moreover it can supply water uniformly regularly and quantitatively through the drip irrigation lines during the growth period of cotton and infiltrate the area of the crop root system thus achieving the goal of saving water and increasing yield dai and dong 2014 chen et al 2018 therefore mulched drip irrigation has aided in the improvement of cotton production in arid areas of northwest china in which xinjiang is situated the root system is the most important organ through which crops absorb water goins and russelle 1996 in soil the roots tend to grow towards the direction of the water sampathkumar et al 2012 and their growth and development are greatly affected by soil water distribution gao et al 2014 ning et al 2015 root system is characterized by phenotypic plasticity which is defined as the ability of roots to change its development and growth as environmental conditions change palta and watt 2009 suralta et al 2018 moreover root plasticity promotes crop growth and development under changing soil conditions such as drought and waterlogging so as to reduce the impact of stress and maintain greater crop productivity yamauchi et al 1996 suralta et al 2018 in particular the distribution of the roots has high plasticity lynch 1995 xue et al 2003 and they can optimize their morphological character according to the environmental conditions thus absorbing more water from the soil profile coelho and or 1999 dong et al 2010 for example compared with conventional irrigation partial root zone irrigation can cause the lateral movement of water in the root zone of cotton stimulate the generation of more secondary roots and enhance the water absorption capacity du et al 2008 fine roots diameter 2 mm are the most physiologically active organs of the below ground plant system eissenstat 1992 and involved in the uptake of soil water feng et al 2017 chen et al 2018 suralta et al 2018 believed that maximizing the plasticity of fine roots could reduce the overall maintenance cost of roots which was conducive to improve the resource acquisition ability when soil resources were at a low level the optimized growth of crop root system in response to environmental changes is considered to be an important factor for increasing yield palta and watt 2009 koevoets et al 2016 it is generally believed that larger and deeper root systems allow plants to absorb more soil water thereby increasing crop yields xu et al 2016 feng et al 2017 uddin et al 2018 however some studies have found that deep roots have little effect or a negative effect on the improvement of crop yield and wue xue et al 2003 wang et al 2014a different irrigation methods significantly change the distribution of soil water in the soil goldberg et al 1976 du et al 2005 then the different soil moisture area in the root zone of crops may affect the growth and development of the root system our previous studies showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation promoted the growth of fine root and inhibited the vigorous vegetative growth of aboveground part in the early growth stage of cotton however in the late growth stage mulched drip irrigation reduced the growth redundancy of root improved root productivity and thus increased seed cotton yield and water use efficiency wang et al 2020 in addition mulched drip irrigation is categorized as local shallow irrigation and its influence on root growth is mainly concentrated in the shallow layer liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 chen et al 2018 which will lead to the change of the plant s ability to absorb soil water and nutrients du et al 2005 2008 however under mulched drip irrigation there are few studies on how soil water changes affect root plasticity and then regulate the absorptive capacity of roots we proposed that mulched drip irrigation changes the soil water distribution promotes the formation of shallow fine roots of cotton and thus enhances the absorption of soil water by cotton plants to confirm our hypothesis we carried out a comparative experiment between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation in a cotton field the main purpose of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could optimize the distribution of fine roots and improve cotton yield and wue by changing the soil moisture pattern in the root zone the research results are of great significance to further verify the water saving and yield increasing advantages of mulched drip irrigation in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted during the 2017 2018 growing season at the college

before sowing the experimental plots were covered with sheets of transparent plastic film that were 0 01 mm thick and 1 45 m wide zhang et al 2015 drip irrigation was used to provide water for seedling emergence in all test plots zhang et al 2014 on 24 april 2017 and 22 april 2018 afterwards the drip lines in the traditional flood irrigation treatment were removed during the growing season the field was irrigated by mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation 7 and 4 times respectively excluding water for seedling emergence zhang et al 2014 table 2 ridges 30 cm high were established around the traditional flood irrigation experimental plots water entered the soil from the no mulch zone and membrane holes into the soil under traditional flood irrigation fig 2 in order to prevent the flow of water and fertilizer between the two irrigation methods plastic film 70 cm wide and 1 6 mm thick was completely buried between the experimental plots before sowing and served as a barrier gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 45 was sown on 21 april in both years and harvested on 3 october 2017 and 10 october 2018 the planting modes of mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation were set following one mulch and four rows of cotton plants figs 1 and 2 wang et al 2020 which indicated that each plastic film mulch layer contained four rows of cotton plants the difference was that there were two drip lines under mulched drip irrigation fig 1 while there was no drip line under traditional flood irrigation fig 2 the fertilization conditions base fertilizers and topdressing fertilizers of this experiment have been described in detail in wang et al 2020 thus only the topdressing fertilizers were described here table 2 for mulched drip irrigation topdressing fertilizer was added to the irrigation water for traditional flood irrigation topdressing fertilizer was placed in shallow furrows with wide rows before irrigation details of the irrigation date and irrigation quantity are shown in table 2 in particular the four irrigation occurrences under traditional flood irrigation were 51 76 102 and 126 days after emergence in 2017 and 61 82 104 and 126 days after emergence in 2018 the seven irrigation occurrences under mulched drip irrigation were 52 63 75 87 101 112 and 125 days after emergence in 2017 and 60 70 81 92 103 115 and 125 days after emergence in 2018 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content volumetric water content swc was measured by a time domain reflectometer trime t3 imko ettlingen

located in the middle of the narrow row the middle of the wide row and the no mulch the interval between adjacent measuring tubes was 40 cm meanwhile five tubes were arranged for each treatment in 2018 and the interval between adjacent measuring tubes was 20 cm fig 3 chen et al 2018 swc data were collected once for every 20 cm soil layer and the depth measured was 80 cm and 100 cm in 2017 and 2018 respectively swc data were collected 24 times and 14 times during the growing season of cotton in 2017 and 2018 respectively in order to analyze the difference of swc at different depths the following three soil layers were set shallow layer 0 40 cm middle layer 40 60 cm and deep layer below 60 cm luo et al 2014 chen et al 2018 2 3 2 fluctuation amplitude of swc during the flowering and boll period the fluctuation amplitude of swc was calculated in the vertical direction soil layer and horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones during the flowering and boll period and the coefficient of variation was used to represent the fluctuation amplitude of swc the coefﬁcient of variation was calculated as follows cv sd mn 100 where cv is the coefﬁcient of variation sd is the standard deviation and mn is the mean 2 3 3 fine root length and fine root biomass fine root samples were collected by the monolith method chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 at the full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in two years four cotton plants with similar growth conditions were selected on the plot of the experiment and the aboveground parts were cut off subsequently big soil cubes with dimensions of 80 cm length 24 cm width 20 cm depth were dug individually in a depth of 100 cm in 2017 and small soil cubes with dimensions of 24 cm length 20 cm width 20 cm depth were dug individually in a depth of 100 cm in 2018 figs 1 and 2 root samples were selected from the soil cubes and separated into fine roots diameter

operation steps were described by wang et al 2020 subsequently fine roots were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the fine root biomass in order to analyze the growth and development of fine roots in different soil layers the roots were divided into shallow roots 0 40 cm middle roots 40 60 cm and deep roots below 60 cm in this study luo et al 2014 2 3 4 aboveground biomass during the root sampling period the aboveground organs of cotton plant were divided into bolls buds leaves and stems and dried at 105 c for 30 min oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the biomass per plant 2 3 5 seed cotton yield harvest index and irrigation water use efficiency a representative sample point was randomly selected from each experimental plot to calculate the crop yield based on the plot s actual seed cotton yield the ratio of seed cotton yield to biological yield is the harvest index of cotton irrigation wue iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equation iwue y i ünlü et al 2011 where y is the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and i is the total irrigation amount mm during the growing season of cotton 2 4 statistical analysis contour maps

jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 characteristics of soil water migration before and after irrigation before irrigation the swc in the vertical direction soil layer increased with the increase of depth in the horizontal direction the swc in the depth of 60 cm had little changes in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones fig 4a after flood irrigation the swc in the 60 cm soil layer under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 was about 26 27 in the vertical direction fig 4d e in the horizontal direction the swc in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones in the 0 60 cm layer was similar in contrast after drip irrigation 76 days after emergence the water of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 could infiltrate to 20 cm on both sides of the drip line and a local wet area with swc greater than 24 0 was formed in the vertical direction of the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 4b c cotton plants in the field were located in this wet area however mulched drip irrigation formed a local relatively dry area with low swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer at 20 40 cm on both sides of the drip line 3 2 dynamic change of swc during the whole growth period a total of four irrigation events were performed by traditional flood irrigation table 2 the swc in the 0 80 cm soil layer under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 immediately increased and then gradually decreased after each irrigation fig 5 due to the long irrigation cycle of traditional flood irrigation about 23 days the swc of each soil layer would drop to a lower value before the next irrigation in particular the swc of each soil layer under reduced flood irrigation fi 3 was relatively small after the third and fourth irrigation at which time it was subjected to periodic soil water deficit in contrast mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 had a shorter irrigation cycle about 12 days and two drip irrigation cycles were performed within one flood irrigation cycle table 2 the results showed that the root zone of cotton plants under mulched drip irrigation could replenish water when the swc did not decrease to a smaller value and was not subjected to periodic soil drought fig 5 3 3 average swc and fluctuation amplitude during the flowering and boll stage in different directions the flowering and boll stage is the key period for water management of cotton in the vertical direction soil layers table 3 compared with traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 the swc in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers at the flowering and boll stage under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 increased by 7 38 8 20 3 71 19 84 and 0 51 16 84 respectively but the coefficient of variation decreased by 37 14 37 82 51 91 59 53 and 49 65 68 56 respectively in addition compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 swc in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers under excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased by 4 79 4 84 4 98 10 29 and 1 62 3 28 respectively in the horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones table 4 compared with traditional flood irrigation the swc of the wide row zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers under mulched drip irrigation increased by 9 54 12 63 6 36 17 65 and 4 03 13 45 respectively the swc of the narrow row zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers increased by 2 81 11 19 1 21 22 07 and 4 19 20 15 respectively the swc of the no mulch zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers increased by 54 54 59 12 and 54 00 respectively under the same irrigation method compared with di 3 the swc of 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones under di 6 increased by 0 09 7 87 and 6 96 10 43 2 09 9 53 and 9 28 10 16 and 4 70 and 0 82 respectively the results indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer and reduced the fluctuation amplitude of swc in the vertical direction moreover mulched drip irrigation also significantly increased the swc of 0 60 cm soil layer in the wide row and narrow row zones 3 4 spatial distribution of fine roots and their response to soil water distribution the prophase full boll stage was the key period for the vegetative and reproductive growth of cotton and also the period requiring the most water and fertilizer zhan et al 2015 the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 fig 6a b was higher than that of the wide row and no mulch zones at the prophase full boll stage the positions of the wide row and no mulch zones are shown in fig 4a compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 the swc in the shallow 0 40 cm middle 40 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm layers under excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased with the increase of irrigation amount however the swc in the middle shallow layer 0 60 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the middle of the narrow row zone under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 fig 6c d was significantly lower than that of mulched drip irrigation moreover the swc in the deep layer of traditional flood irrigation was significantly higher than that of the shallow layer for the distribution of fine roots in the vertical direction the distribution of fine root length fig 6e f and fine root biomass fig 6i j under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 showed a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of soil depth compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass under excessive drip irrigation di 6 decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer but increased in the 40 100 cm soil layer however the distribution of fine root length fig 6g h and fine root biomass fig 6k l under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 was greater in the 0 40 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers but less in the 40 60 cm soil layer in the horizontal direction the fine root length and fine root biomass of di 3 and di 6 were mainly distributed below the drip lines and on the side close to the wide row zone however the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass of fi 6 and fi 3 was relatively dispersed and the fine roots were mainly distributed below the narrow row zone and on the side close to the no mulch zone the results showed that the distribution of fine roots in vertical and horizontal direction was very different between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation specifically the distribution of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation was relatively concentrated and the distribution of fine roots in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of drip line was significantly greater than that of traditional flood irrigation moreover it could be seen that the local wet area of mulched drip irrigation in the root zone was conducive to the growth of fine roots 3 5 the growth of fine roots in different soil layers figs 7 and 8 further quantified the variation of fine roots in different soil layers at different growth stages in terms of the fine root length fig 7 under different irrigation methods the fine root length in the 0 40 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage however the fine root length of conventional drip irrigation di 3 and excessive drip irrigation di 6 showed a downward trend in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage in terms of the fine root biomass fig 8 the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers under mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage and late full boll stage but smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation at the boll opening stage under the same irrigation method the fine root biomass of di 6 in the 0 40 cm soil layer was less than that of di 3 at the late full boll stage for the fine roots in the deep layer 60 100 cm the fine root length fig 7 and fine root biomass fig 8 in the 60 100 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage under the same irrigation method the fine root length and fine root biomass of di 6 in the 60 100 cm soil layer were smaller than that of di 3 at late full boll stage and boll opening stage this indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the prophase full boll stage and late full boll stage but reduced the fine root biomass in the 60 100 cm soil layer at the prophase full boll stage 3 6 aboveground biomass and its correlation with root growth parameters under the different irrigation methods there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 and traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 before full flowering stage fig 9 after full flowering stage the aboveground biomass of mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation under the same irrigation method the aboveground biomass of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was lower than that of conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the boll opening stage this indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase aboveground biomass from the prophase full boll stage to the boll opening stage the flowering and boll stage was the key period for dry matter production and yield formation of cotton han and kang 2001 tables 5 and 6 showed the correlation between the final aboveground biomass and the morphological parameters of fine roots at the flowering and boll stage grey correlation analysis showed that the maximum correlation coefficients r0i between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters fine root length and fine root biomass was the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage table 6 the correlation coefficient was 0 7104 reaching a significant level p 0 05 the second largest coefficients between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters was the fine root biomass in the 40 60 cm soil layer at late full boll stage the correlation coefficient was 0 7102 reaching a significant level p 0 05 there was no significant correlation between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters in the other growth stages the result showed that the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage determined the final aboveground biomass 3 7 seed cotton yield and iwue under different irrigation methods compared with traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 the biological yield total bolls seed cotton yield and iwue of conventional drip irrigation di 3 were significantly increased by 12 21 45 88 7 72 25 24 16 52 33 72 and 24 10 89 03 respectively table 7 in addition compared with traditional flood irrigation the biological yield and total bolls of excessive drip irrigation di 6 were significantly increased but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield the iwue of di 6 was significantly smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation under the same irrigation method compared with di 6 the biological yield seed cotton yield harvest index and iwue of di 3 were significantly increased by 9 10 18 28 16 47 32 05 6 69 8 82 and 79 20 102 99 respectively however the total bolls of di 3 and di 6 were not significantly different the results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the biological yield total bolls and seed cotton yield of cotton however the maximum seed cotton yield and iwue could only be achieved under the irrigation amount of 390 mm 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation methods on soil water condition in cotton field the spatial distribution of soil water was different under different irrigation methods goldberg et al 1976 ibragimov et al 2007 traditional flood irrigation formed a wet area with similar swc in the horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones fig 4d e lu et al 2014 however the water of mulched drip irrigation slowly penetrated into the soil in the root zone through the drip emitters and formed a wet area with high swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line fig 4b c moreover the farther the distance from drip lines the less the swc forming a local relatively dry area it could be seen that the soil in the root zone of mulched drip irrigation showed noticeable different dry and wet regions field cotton was planted in wide 60 cm and narrow 20 cm rows which could make most of the root area of cotton plants located in the soil moist area soil moisture under field conditions is often subject to fluctuating conditions fig 5 rather than persistent waterlogging or progressive drought conditions suralta et al 2018 fluctuating soil water level generally affects the growth and function of root and aboveground parts in various crops suralta and yamauchi 2008 suralta et al 2010 niones et al 2012 however excessive fluctuation of soil water conditions may adversely affect the growth of crop roots suralta and yamauchi 2008 the results of this study showed that the fluctuation amplitude of swc coefficient of variation under mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation was different in the vertical direction soil layer table 3 and horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones table 4 in other words the dry and wet alternations of the soil in the root zone were significantly different between the two irrigation methods compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm and middle layer 40 60 cm in the vertical direction soil layer and decreased the fluctuation amplitude of swc during the flowering and boll stage of cotton moreover mulched drip irrigation also significantly increased the swc of the shallow layer 0 40 cm and the middle layer 40 60 cm in the wide row and narrow row zones therefore we have shown that mulched drip irrigation provided a good soil water condition for the water absorption and growth of cotton roots 4 2 effect of irrigation methods on the distribution of fine roots and absorptive capacity of cotton roots root distribution of crops is closely related to soil water distribution wang et al 2011b chen et al 2018 moreover the growth and development of root system showed high plasticity in different soil environments palta and watt 2009 lynch 2011 koevoets et al 2016 the results of this study showed that the two irrigation methods had different soil wetting patterns in the root zone of cotton resulting in relatively concentrated distribution of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation and relatively dispersed distribution of fine roots under traditional flood irrigation specifically the distribution of fine root length fig 6e f and fine root biomass fig 6i j in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation was significantly greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage this might be due to the fact that mulched drip irrigation formed a local wet area with relatively high swc and a relatively dry area fig 4b c leading to the formation of different dry and wet areas in the root area previous studies have shown that compared with uniform soil water conditions the root system of crops under heterogeneous soil water conditions would preferentially grow in relatively wet regions and less in relatively dry regions green and clothier 1999 polverigiani et al 2011 moreover under localized irrigation the root growth and water absorption showed compensatory increases in the wet zone to maintain the water state and normal growth of the plant wakrim et al 2005 li et al 2007 luo et al 2019 therefore in the wet zone with dry and wet boundaries the swc was higher fig 6a b in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation which was more conducive to the growth of fine roots in this area lynch 2011 luo et al 2019 however excessive irrigation water resulted in a decrease in the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer and an increase in the 40 100 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation fig 6f j this might be due to the fact that excessive irrigation water of mulched drip irrigation led to the extension of the soil wet area with dry and wet boundary to the deep layer thus reducing the distribution of fine roots in the shallow layer and increasing the distribution in the deep layer in contrast the horizontal uniform soil wetting patterns of traditional flood irrigation resulted in the concentrated distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the 60 100 cm soil layer fig 6g h k l our results showed that the cotton of traditional flood irrigation experienced periodic drought during the growth period after water replenishment fig 5 the soil surface was provided with abundant water resources which stimulated the compensatory physiological response to the root system and thus induced a large number of roots to grow in the shallow layer xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 considering the long irrigation cycle of traditional flood irrigation about 23 days the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm gradually decreased which hindered the normal growth of the root system however the soil water in the deep layer under traditional flood irrigation was still sufficient fig 6c d thus promoting root growth in the deep soil 60 100 cm passioura 1983 optimization of the spatial distribution of roots can improve the plant s ability to obtain water and nutrients lynch 2007 topp et al 2016 previous studies have shown that soil nutrients were mainly concentrated in the shallow layer and the shallow root system was a necessary condition for nutrient absorption manske and vlek 2002 therefore the shallow fine root system formed by mulched drip irrigation was conducive to the cooperative absorption of soil water and nutrients by cotton roots however for the traditional flood irrigation a long irrigation cycle led to a large amount of water consumption in the shallow soil layer by absorbing of the root system and ground evaporation leading to a gradual decrease of swc this was not conducive to the growth of fine roots in shallow layers in the latter part of the flood irrigation cycle and reduced the availability of nutrients in shallow soil layers feng et al 2017 we concluded that when the soil water in the shallow layer under traditional flood irrigation was insufficient although the deep layer of fine roots could absorb the soil water in the deep layer the ability of shallow fine roots to obtain nutrients was weakened which might lead to the imbalance of water and nutrient absorption 4 3 relation of fine root growth to seed cotton yield and iwue root growth of crops is closely related to aboveground growth aguirre and johnson 1991 wang et al 2014a a well developed root system is essential to improve the water productivity and yield of crops min et al 2014 feng et al 2017 larger root length and root biomass can increase the capacity of plants to absorb soil water and nutrients so that plants can better adapt to arid and semi arid environment palta and watt 2009 mccormack et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the plasticity of root development contributes to the increase of dry matter production by promoting the elongation and branching of rice roots in shallow soil layers kano nakata et al 2013 this study showed that the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage determined the final aboveground biomass of cotton plants table 6 therefore compared with traditional flood irrigation the greater fine root biomass of mulched drip irrigation in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage fig 8 increased the final aboveground biomass fig 9 and obtained a higher biological yield which was conducive to ensuring more total bolls and thus improving seed cotton yield table 7 however there is no linear correlation between biomass and seed cotton yield ünlü et al 2011 the formation of crop yield not only depends on the biomass of the plant but also is closely related to the transport and distribution of assimilation products fader and koller 1983 tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 under the appropriate irrigation amount mulched drip irrigation increased the distribution of assimilation products to reproductive organs while excessive irrigation amount led to excessive vegetative growth and late maturation of cotton which reduced the transport and distribution efficiency of assimilation products cai et al 2002 our results showed that there was no significant difference in the total bolls between conventional drip irrigation 390 mm and excessive drip irrigation 600 mm table 7 however excessive irrigation amount 600 mm significantly reduced the harvest index table 7 and boll opening rate of mulched drip irrigation wang et al 2020 thus leading to a significant decrease in seed cotton yield and iwue 5 conclusions accordingly we thought that mulched drip irrigation optimizes the distribution of fine root by changing the distribution of soil water and forms a reasonable shallow fine root system which promotes the absorption of soil water and increases the aboveground biomass as well as total bolls and further improves seed cotton yield and irrigation water

9964,the morphological characteristics of crop roots especially the plasticity of fine roots are directly related to the crop s ability to obtain soil water mulched drip irrigation can effectively regulate soil water distribution to achieve high cotton yield with reduced water consumption in the previous study from the perspective of root shoot coordination we found that mulched drip irrigation reduced the growth redundancy of roots and improved the root productivity of cotton thus achieving the goal of water saving and increased yield however it is unclear if and how mulched drip irrigation enhances absorptive capacity of roots via regulating dry and wet soil areas and optimizing fine root morphology and distribution compared with traditional flood irrigation to achieve this the effects of fine root plasticity on the absorptive capacity of roots were studied in a two year field experiment mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation reduced flood irrigation and conventional flood irrigation were used and soil water distribution and root distribution were determined the results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the soil water content swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer and reduced the fluctuation amplitude of swc at the flowering and boll stage of cotton mulched drip irrigation formed different dry and wet areas in the root zone i e the swc was higher in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line and most of the cotton roots were in the wet area the higher swc increased the distribution of fine roots in this area and shaped the shallow fine root system which enhanced the cotton plant s ability to absorb soil water statistical analysis showed that the higher fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage of cotton under mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase aboveground biomass thus increasing total bolls and seed cotton yield however compared with the irrigation amount of field production 390 mm an excessive amount of irrigation 600 mm reduced the seed cotton yield of mulched drip irrigation resulting in the decrease of irrigation water use efficiency iwue therefore mulched drip irrigation optimizes the distribution of fine roots and enhances water uptake by effectively regulating the water root relationship and thus improves seed cotton yield and iwue keywords irrigation methods cotton spatial distribution of soil water fine root plasticity seed cotton yield irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction xinjiang of china is an area that is known throughout the world as a cotton planting region but the development of cotton in this region is limited by the shortage of water wang et al 2011a in the past traditional flood irrigation plastic film mulching cultivation and flood irrigation was the method most often used in xinjiang cotton production which is characterized as being labor intensive requiring a large amount of irrigation and having poor irrigation uniformity resulting in low yield and water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2016 therefore developing water saving irrigation technology is the fundamental way forward for the development of agriculture in xinjiang and similar arid areas drip irrigation is considered the most effective way to save water goldberg et al 1976 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 it can deliver water directly to the root system of crops which then slowly and evenly penetrates into the root zone soil allowing the root system to fully absorb soil water goldberg et al 1976 ibragimov et al 2007 sampathkumar et al 2012 in the late 1990s drip irrigation was introduced in xinjiang and it was combined with plastic film mulching cultivation to develop into the cotton planting technology of mulched drip irrigation li et al 2011 this technique maintains the effects of plastic film mulch cultivation including increasing temperature conserving soil moisture and reducing surface evaporation moreover it can supply water uniformly regularly and quantitatively through the drip irrigation lines during the growth period of cotton and infiltrate the area of the crop root system thus achieving the goal of saving water and increasing yield dai and dong 2014 chen et al 2018 therefore mulched drip irrigation has aided in the improvement of cotton production in arid areas of northwest china in which xinjiang is situated the root system is the most important organ through which crops absorb water goins and russelle 1996 in soil the roots tend to grow towards the direction of the water sampathkumar et al 2012 and their growth and development are greatly affected by soil water distribution gao et al 2014 ning et al 2015 root system is characterized by phenotypic plasticity which is defined as the ability of roots to change its development and growth as environmental conditions change palta and watt 2009 suralta et al 2018 moreover root plasticity promotes crop growth and development under changing soil conditions such as drought and waterlogging so as to reduce the impact of stress and maintain greater crop productivity yamauchi et al 1996 suralta et al 2018 in particular the distribution of the roots has high plasticity lynch 1995 xue et al 2003 and they can optimize their morphological character according to the environmental conditions thus absorbing more water from the soil profile coelho and or 1999 dong et al 2010 for example compared with conventional irrigation partial root zone irrigation can cause the lateral movement of water in the root zone of cotton stimulate the generation of more secondary roots and enhance the water absorption capacity du et al 2008 fine roots diameter 2 mm are the most physiologically active organs of the below ground plant system eissenstat 1992 and involved in the uptake of soil water feng et al 2017 chen et al 2018 suralta et al 2018 believed that maximizing the plasticity of fine roots could reduce the overall maintenance cost of roots which was conducive to improve the resource acquisition ability when soil resources were at a low level the optimized growth of crop root system in response to environmental changes is considered to be an important factor for increasing yield palta and watt 2009 koevoets et al 2016 it is generally believed that larger and deeper root systems allow plants to absorb more soil water thereby increasing crop yields xu et al 2016 feng et al 2017 uddin et al 2018 however some studies have found that deep roots have little effect or a negative effect on the improvement of crop yield and wue xue et al 2003 wang et al 2014a different irrigation methods significantly change the distribution of soil water in the soil goldberg et al 1976 du et al 2005 then the different soil moisture area in the root zone of crops may affect the growth and development of the root system our previous studies showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation promoted the growth of fine root and inhibited the vigorous vegetative growth of aboveground part in the early growth stage of cotton however in the late growth stage mulched drip irrigation reduced the growth redundancy of root improved root productivity and thus increased seed cotton yield and water use efficiency wang et al 2020 in addition mulched drip irrigation is categorized as local shallow irrigation and its influence on root growth is mainly concentrated in the shallow layer liu et al 2013 li et al 2017 chen et al 2018 which will lead to the change of the plant s ability to absorb soil water and nutrients du et al 2005 2008 however under mulched drip irrigation there are few studies on how soil water changes affect root plasticity and then regulate the absorptive capacity of roots we proposed that mulched drip irrigation changes the soil water distribution promotes the formation of shallow fine roots of cotton and thus enhances the absorption of soil water by cotton plants to confirm our hypothesis we carried out a comparative experiment between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation in a cotton field the main purpose of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could optimize the distribution of fine roots and improve cotton yield and wue by changing the soil moisture pattern in the root zone the research results are of great significance to further verify the water saving and yield increasing advantages of mulched drip irrigation in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted during the 2017 2018 growing season at the college

and treatments two irrigation methods mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation and two irrigation amounts 390 mm and 600 mm were conducted in this research 390 mm represents the amount of water from mulched drip irrigation in field production at present whereas 600 mm represents the amount of water from traditional flood irrigation in previous field production deng et al 2013 mai et al 2014 there was a total of four treatments and the experimental design was a randomized block design with three replicates the four treatments were as follows conventional drip irrigation di 3 irrigation amount 390 mm excessive drip irrigation di 6 irrigation amount 600 mm reduced flood irrigation fi 3 irrigation amount 390 mm and conventional flood irrigation fi 6 irrigation amount 600 mm before sowing the experimental plots were covered with sheets of transparent plastic film that were 0 01 mm thick and 1 45 m wide zhang et al 2015 drip irrigation was used to provide water for seedling emergence in all test plots zhang et al 2014 on 24 april 2017 and 22 april 2018 afterwards the drip lines in the traditional flood irrigation treatment were removed during the growing season the field was irrigated by mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation 7 and 4 times respectively excluding water for seedling emergence zhang et al 2014 table 2 ridges 30 cm high were established around the traditional flood irrigation experimental plots water entered the soil from the no mulch zone and membrane holes into the soil under traditional flood irrigation fig 2 in order to prevent the flow of water and fertilizer between the two irrigation methods plastic film 70 cm wide and 1 6 mm thick was completely buried between the experimental plots before sowing and served as a barrier gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 45 was sown on 21 april in both years and harvested on 3 october 2017 and 10 october 2018 the planting modes of mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation were set following one mulch and four rows of cotton plants figs 1 and 2 wang et al 2020 which indicated that each plastic film mulch layer contained four rows of cotton plants the difference was that there were two drip lines under mulched drip irrigation fig 1 while there was no drip line under traditional flood irrigation fig 2 the fertilization conditions base fertilizers and topdressing fertilizers of this experiment have been described in detail in wang et al 2020 thus only the topdressing fertilizers were described here table 2 for mulched drip irrigation topdressing fertilizer was added to the irrigation water for traditional flood irrigation topdressing fertilizer was placed in shallow furrows with wide rows before irrigation details of the irrigation date and irrigation quantity are shown in table 2 in particular the four irrigation occurrences under traditional flood irrigation were 51 76 102 and 126 days after emergence in 2017 and 61 82 104 and 126 days after emergence in 2018 the seven irrigation occurrences under mulched drip irrigation were 52 63 75 87 101 112 and 125 days after emergence in 2017 and 60 70 81 92 103 115 and 125 days after emergence in 2018 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content volumetric water content swc was measured by a time domain reflectometer trime t3 imko ettlingen

located in the middle of the narrow row the middle of the wide row and the no mulch the interval between adjacent measuring tubes was 40 cm meanwhile five tubes were arranged for each treatment in 2018 and the interval between adjacent measuring tubes was 20 cm fig 3 chen et al 2018 swc data were collected once for every 20 cm soil layer and the depth measured was 80 cm and 100 cm in 2017 and 2018 respectively swc data were collected 24 times and 14 times during the growing season of cotton in 2017 and 2018 respectively in order to analyze the difference of swc at different depths the following three soil layers were set shallow layer 0 40 cm middle layer 40 60 cm and deep layer below 60 cm luo et al 2014 chen et al 2018 2 3 2 fluctuation amplitude of swc during the flowering and boll period the fluctuation amplitude of swc was calculated in the vertical direction soil layer and horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones during the flowering and boll period and the coefficient of variation was used to represent the fluctuation amplitude of swc the coefﬁcient of variation was calculated as follows cv sd mn 100 where cv is the coefﬁcient of variation sd is the standard deviation and mn is the mean 2 3 3 fine root length and fine root biomass fine root samples were collected by the monolith method chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 at the full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in two years four cotton plants with similar growth conditions were selected on the plot of the experiment and the aboveground parts were cut off subsequently big soil cubes with dimensions of 80 cm length 24 cm width 20 cm depth were dug individually in a depth of 100 cm in 2017 and small soil cubes with dimensions of 24 cm length 20 cm width 20 cm depth were dug individually in a depth of 100 cm in 2018 figs 1 and 2 root samples were selected from the soil cubes and separated into fine roots diameter 2 mm and coarse roots diameter 2 mm roumet et al 2016 fine root images were obtained by using winrhizo image analysis software winrhizo version 2009 regent instrument quebec canada the specific operation steps were described by wang et al 2020 subsequently fine roots were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the fine root biomass in order to analyze the growth and development of fine roots in different soil layers the roots were divided into shallow roots 0 40 cm middle roots 40 60 cm and deep roots below 60 cm in this study luo et al 2014 2 3 4 aboveground biomass during the root sampling period the aboveground organs of cotton plant were divided into bolls buds leaves and stems and dried at 105 c for 30 min oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and then weighed to obtain the biomass per plant 2 3 5 seed cotton yield harvest index and irrigation water use efficiency a representative sample point was randomly selected from each experimental plot to calculate the crop yield based on the plot s actual seed cotton yield the ratio of seed cotton yield to biological yield is the harvest index of cotton irrigation wue iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equation iwue y i ünlü et al 2011 where y is the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and i is the total irrigation amount mm during the growing season of cotton 2 4 statistical analysis contour maps

jose ca usa 3 results 3 1 characteristics of soil water migration before and after irrigation before irrigation the swc in the vertical direction soil layer increased with the increase of depth in the horizontal direction the swc in the depth of 60 cm had little changes in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones fig 4a after flood irrigation the swc in the 60 cm soil layer under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 was about 26 27 in the vertical direction fig 4d e in the horizontal direction the swc in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones in the 0 60 cm layer was similar in contrast after drip irrigation 76 days after emergence the water of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 could infiltrate to 20 cm on both sides of the drip line and a local wet area with swc greater than 24 0 was formed in the vertical direction of the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 4b c cotton plants in the field were located in this wet area however mulched drip irrigation formed a local relatively dry area with low swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer at 20 40 cm on both sides of the drip line 3 2 dynamic change of swc during the whole growth period a total of four irrigation events were performed by traditional flood irrigation table 2 the swc in the 0 80 cm soil layer under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 immediately increased and then gradually decreased after each irrigation fig 5 due to the long irrigation cycle of traditional flood irrigation about 23 days the swc of each soil layer would drop to a lower value before the next irrigation in particular the swc of each soil layer under reduced flood irrigation fi 3 was relatively small after the third and fourth irrigation at which time it was subjected to periodic soil water deficit in contrast mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 had a shorter irrigation cycle about 12 days and two drip irrigation cycles were performed within one flood irrigation cycle table 2 the results showed that the root zone of cotton plants under mulched drip irrigation could replenish water when the swc did not decrease to a smaller value and was not subjected to periodic soil drought fig 5 3 3 average swc and fluctuation amplitude during the flowering and boll stage in different directions the flowering and boll stage is the key period for water management of cotton in the vertical direction soil layers table 3 compared with traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 the swc in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers at the flowering and boll stage under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 increased by 7 38 8 20 3 71 19 84 and 0 51 16 84 respectively but the coefficient of variation decreased by 37 14 37 82 51 91 59 53 and 49 65 68 56 respectively in addition compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 swc in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers under excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased by 4 79 4 84 4 98 10 29 and 1 62 3 28 respectively in the horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones table 4 compared with traditional flood irrigation the swc of the wide row zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers under mulched drip irrigation increased by 9 54 12 63 6 36 17 65 and 4 03 13 45 respectively the swc of the narrow row zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers increased by 2 81 11 19 1 21 22 07 and 4 19 20 15 respectively the swc of the no mulch zone in the 0 40 cm 40 60 cm and below 60 cm soil layers increased by 54 54 59 12 and 54 00 respectively under the same irrigation method compared with di 3 the swc of 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers in the wide row narrow row and no mulch zones under di 6 increased by 0 09 7 87 and 6 96 10 43 2 09 9 53 and 9 28 10 16 and 4 70 and 0 82 respectively the results indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer and reduced the fluctuation amplitude of swc in the vertical direction moreover mulched drip irrigation also significantly increased the swc of 0 60 cm soil layer in the wide row and narrow row zones 3 4 spatial distribution of fine roots and their response to soil water distribution the prophase full boll stage was the key period for the vegetative and reproductive growth of cotton and also the period requiring the most water and fertilizer zhan et al 2015 the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 fig 6a b was higher than that of the wide row and no mulch zones at the prophase full boll stage the positions of the wide row and no mulch zones are shown in fig 4a compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 the swc in the shallow 0 40 cm middle 40 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm layers under excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased with the increase of irrigation amount however the swc in the middle shallow layer 0 60 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the middle of the narrow row zone under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 fig 6c d was significantly lower than that of mulched drip irrigation moreover the swc in the deep layer of traditional flood irrigation was significantly higher than that of the shallow layer for the distribution of fine roots in the vertical direction the distribution of fine root length fig 6e f and fine root biomass fig 6i j under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 showed a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of soil depth compared with conventional drip irrigation di 3 the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass under excessive drip irrigation di 6 decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer but increased in the 40 100 cm soil layer however the distribution of fine root length fig 6g h and fine root biomass fig 6k l under traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 was greater in the 0 40 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers but less in the 40 60 cm soil layer in the horizontal direction the fine root length and fine root biomass of di 3 and di 6 were mainly distributed below the drip lines and on the side close to the wide row zone however the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass of fi 6 and fi 3 was relatively dispersed and the fine roots were mainly distributed below the narrow row zone and on the side close to the no mulch zone the results showed that the distribution of fine roots in vertical and horizontal direction was very different between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation specifically the distribution of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation was relatively concentrated and the distribution of fine roots in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of drip line was significantly greater than that of traditional flood irrigation moreover it could be seen that the local wet area of mulched drip irrigation in the root zone was conducive to the growth of fine roots 3 5 the growth of fine roots in different soil layers figs 7 and 8 further quantified the variation of fine roots in different soil layers at different growth stages in terms of the fine root length fig 7 under different irrigation methods the fine root length in the 0 40 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage however the fine root length of conventional drip irrigation di 3 and excessive drip irrigation di 6 showed a downward trend in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage in terms of the fine root biomass fig 8 the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers under mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage and late full boll stage but smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation at the boll opening stage under the same irrigation method the fine root biomass of di 6 in the 0 40 cm soil layer was less than that of di 3 at the late full boll stage for the fine roots in the deep layer 60 100 cm the fine root length fig 7 and fine root biomass fig 8 in the 60 100 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage under the same irrigation method the fine root length and fine root biomass of di 6 in the 60 100 cm soil layer were smaller than that of di 3 at late full boll stage and boll opening stage this indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the prophase full boll stage and late full boll stage but reduced the fine root biomass in the 60 100 cm soil layer at the prophase full boll stage 3 6 aboveground biomass and its correlation with root growth parameters under the different irrigation methods there was no significant difference in aboveground biomass between mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 and traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 before full flowering stage fig 9 after full flowering stage the aboveground biomass of mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation under the same irrigation method the aboveground biomass of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was lower than that of conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the boll opening stage this indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase aboveground biomass from the prophase full boll stage to the boll opening stage the flowering and boll stage was the key period for dry matter production and yield formation of cotton han and kang 2001 tables 5 and 6 showed the correlation between the final aboveground biomass and the morphological parameters of fine roots at the flowering and boll stage grey correlation analysis showed that the maximum correlation coefficients r0i between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters fine root length and fine root biomass was the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage table 6 the correlation coefficient was 0 7104 reaching a significant level p 0 05 the second largest coefficients between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters was the fine root biomass in the 40 60 cm soil layer at late full boll stage the correlation coefficient was 0 7102 reaching a significant level p 0 05 there was no significant correlation between final aboveground biomass and fine root parameters in the other growth stages the result showed that the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage determined the final aboveground biomass 3 7 seed cotton yield and iwue under different irrigation methods compared with traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 the biological yield total bolls seed cotton yield and iwue of conventional drip irrigation di 3 were significantly increased by 12 21 45 88 7 72 25 24 16 52 33 72 and 24 10 89 03 respectively table 7 in addition compared with traditional flood irrigation the biological yield and total bolls of excessive drip irrigation di 6 were significantly increased but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield the iwue of di 6 was significantly smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation under the same irrigation method compared with di 6 the biological yield seed cotton yield harvest index and iwue of di 3 were significantly increased by 9 10 18 28 16 47 32 05 6 69 8 82 and 79 20 102 99 respectively however the total bolls of di 3 and di 6 were not significantly different the results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the biological yield total bolls and seed cotton yield of cotton however the maximum seed cotton yield and iwue could only be achieved under the irrigation amount of 390 mm 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation methods on soil water condition in cotton field the spatial distribution of soil water was different under different irrigation methods goldberg et al 1976 ibragimov et al 2007 traditional flood irrigation formed a wet area with similar swc in the horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones fig 4d e lu et al 2014 however the water of mulched drip irrigation slowly penetrated into the soil in the root zone through the drip emitters and formed a wet area with high swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line fig 4b c moreover the farther the distance from drip lines the less the swc forming a local relatively dry area it could be seen that the soil in the root zone of mulched drip irrigation showed noticeable different dry and wet regions field cotton was planted in wide 60 cm and narrow 20 cm rows which could make most of the root area of cotton plants located in the soil moist area soil moisture under field conditions is often subject to fluctuating conditions fig 5 rather than persistent waterlogging or progressive drought conditions suralta et al 2018 fluctuating soil water level generally affects the growth and function of root and aboveground parts in various crops suralta and yamauchi 2008 suralta et al 2010 niones et al 2012 however excessive fluctuation of soil water conditions may adversely affect the growth of crop roots suralta and yamauchi 2008 the results of this study showed that the fluctuation amplitude of swc coefficient of variation under mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation was different in the vertical direction soil layer table 3 and horizontal direction wide row narrow row and no mulch zones table 4 in other words the dry and wet alternations of the soil in the root zone were significantly different between the two irrigation methods compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation significantly increased the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm and middle layer 40 60 cm in the vertical direction soil layer and decreased the fluctuation amplitude of swc during the flowering and boll stage of cotton moreover mulched drip irrigation also significantly increased the swc of the shallow layer 0 40 cm and the middle layer 40 60 cm in the wide row and narrow row zones therefore we have shown that mulched drip irrigation provided a good soil water condition for the water absorption and growth of cotton roots 4 2 effect of irrigation methods on the distribution of fine roots and absorptive capacity of cotton roots root distribution of crops is closely related to soil water distribution wang et al 2011b chen et al 2018 moreover the growth and development of root system showed high plasticity in different soil environments palta and watt 2009 lynch 2011 koevoets et al 2016 the results of this study showed that the two irrigation methods had different soil wetting patterns in the root zone of cotton resulting in relatively concentrated distribution of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation and relatively dispersed distribution of fine roots under traditional flood irrigation specifically the distribution of fine root length fig 6e f and fine root biomass fig 6i j in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation was significantly greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage this might be due to the fact that mulched drip irrigation formed a local wet area with relatively high swc and a relatively dry area fig 4b c leading to the formation of different dry and wet areas in the root area previous studies have shown that compared with uniform soil water conditions the root system of crops under heterogeneous soil water conditions would preferentially grow in relatively wet regions and less in relatively dry regions green and clothier 1999 polverigiani et al 2011 moreover under localized irrigation the root growth and water absorption showed compensatory increases in the wet zone to maintain the water state and normal growth of the plant wakrim et al 2005 li et al 2007 luo et al 2019 therefore in the wet zone with dry and wet boundaries the swc was higher fig 6a b in the shallow layer 0 40 cm at 0 20 cm on both sides of the drip line under mulched drip irrigation which was more conducive to the growth of fine roots in this area lynch 2011 luo et al 2019 however excessive irrigation water resulted in a decrease in the distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer and an increase in the 40 100 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation fig 6f j this might be due to the fact that excessive irrigation water of mulched drip irrigation led to the extension of the soil wet area with dry and wet boundary to the deep layer thus reducing the distribution of fine roots in the shallow layer and increasing the distribution in the deep layer in contrast the horizontal uniform soil wetting patterns of traditional flood irrigation resulted in the concentrated distribution of fine root length and fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer and the 60 100 cm soil layer fig 6g h k l our results showed that the cotton of traditional flood irrigation experienced periodic drought during the growth period after water replenishment fig 5 the soil surface was provided with abundant water resources which stimulated the compensatory physiological response to the root system and thus induced a large number of roots to grow in the shallow layer xu et al 2010 steinemann et al 2015 considering the long irrigation cycle of traditional flood irrigation about 23 days the swc in the shallow layer 0 40 cm gradually decreased which hindered the normal growth of the root system however the soil water in the deep layer under traditional flood irrigation was still sufficient fig 6c d thus promoting root growth in the deep soil 60 100 cm passioura 1983 optimization of the spatial distribution of roots can improve the plant s ability to obtain water and nutrients lynch 2007 topp et al 2016 previous studies have shown that soil nutrients were mainly concentrated in the shallow layer and the shallow root system was a necessary condition for nutrient absorption manske and vlek 2002 therefore the shallow fine root system formed by mulched drip irrigation was conducive to the cooperative absorption of soil water and nutrients by cotton roots however for the traditional flood irrigation a long irrigation cycle led to a large amount of water consumption in the shallow soil layer by absorbing of the root system and ground evaporation leading to a gradual decrease of swc this was not conducive to the growth of fine roots in shallow layers in the latter part of the flood irrigation cycle and reduced the availability of nutrients in shallow soil layers feng et al 2017 we concluded that when the soil water in the shallow layer under traditional flood irrigation was insufficient although the deep layer of fine roots could absorb the soil water in the deep layer the ability of shallow fine roots to obtain nutrients was weakened which might lead to the imbalance of water and nutrient absorption 4 3 relation of fine root growth to seed cotton yield and iwue root growth of crops is closely related to aboveground growth aguirre and johnson 1991 wang et al 2014a a well developed root system is essential to improve the water productivity and yield of crops min et al 2014 feng et al 2017 larger root length and root biomass can increase the capacity of plants to absorb soil water and nutrients so that plants can better adapt to arid and semi arid environment palta and watt 2009 mccormack et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the plasticity of root development contributes to the increase of dry matter production by promoting the elongation and branching of rice roots in shallow soil layers kano nakata et al 2013 this study showed that the fine root biomass in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage determined the final aboveground biomass of cotton plants table 6 therefore compared with traditional flood irrigation the greater fine root biomass of mulched drip irrigation in the 0 40 cm soil layer at the late full boll stage fig 8 increased the final aboveground biomass fig 9 and obtained a higher biological yield which was conducive to ensuring more total bolls and thus improving seed cotton yield table 7 however there is no linear correlation between biomass and seed cotton yield ünlü et al 2011 the formation of crop yield not only depends on the biomass of the plant but also is closely related to the transport and distribution of assimilation products fader and koller 1983 tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 under the appropriate irrigation amount mulched drip irrigation increased the distribution of assimilation products to reproductive organs while excessive irrigation amount led to excessive vegetative growth and late maturation of cotton which reduced the transport and distribution efficiency of assimilation products cai et al 2002 our results showed that there was no significant difference in the total bolls between conventional drip irrigation 390 mm and excessive drip irrigation 600 mm table 7 however excessive irrigation amount 600 mm significantly reduced the harvest index table 7 and boll opening rate of mulched drip irrigation wang et al 2020 thus leading to a significant decrease in seed cotton yield and iwue 5 conclusions accordingly we thought that mulched drip irrigation optimizes the distribution of fine root by changing the distribution of soil water and forms a reasonable shallow fine root system which promotes the absorption of soil water and increases the aboveground biomass as well as total bolls and further improves seed cotton yield and irrigation water
