region about 32 and 22 of groundwater samples exceeded the maximum desirable limit of cl and so4 2 for drinking purposes as prescribed by the world health organization who standards the total dissolved solids classification divulges that the 182 groundwater locations are within the enviable for drinking uses the analytical data reveals that the nitrate concentrations vary from 4 to 440 mg l with a mean of 73 mg l it is noted that the maximum value 440 mg l is one of the highest value found in medak district and 50 of the total samples show nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum permissible limit recommended by who the high fluoride concentration 1 5 mg l in about 57 of the groundwater samples are beyond the recommended limit of drinking purposes spatial distribution of high fluoride concentration is noticed in the eastern and also some parts of the western region while high nitrate concentration is shown in north and southern agricultural regions of the study area the chemical relationships in piper diagram identified ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 and ca2 hco3 are all most predominant water types while gibbs diagrams revealed that groundwater of the study region are mainly controlled by rock weathering dominance and partially evaporation dominance the gwqi indicates that 37 11 and 57 21 of groundwater samples are excellent and good in water quality for drinking uses respectively geologically 80 of the study area consists of granites and gneiss and 20 with basalts and laterites eventually groundwater quality in the medak region is fettered by geogenic and anthropogenic activities therefore people are advised to maintain a groundwater management strategy to protect further sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality hydrogeochemistry gis medak region south india 1 introduction groundwater is an essential and vital component part of our life support system and is used primarily for drinking and irrigation purposes water quality has a great impact on human health and agricultural development however groundwater can alone meet the necessary needs for two thirds of the world s population adimalla and li 2019 adimalla 2019a mukherjee and singh 2018 jousma and roelofsen 2004 in many developing countries like bangladesh india china pakistan nepal and africa where very large number of people depend on groundwater for their daily needs particularly drinking purpose adimalla 2019a singh et al 2017 ishwar et al 2014 adimalla et al 2019c however in these countries groundwater quality are typically deteriorated due to natural and anthropogenic factors sakram and adimalla 2018 khanoranga and khalid 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 li et al 2018 chen et al 2017 narsimha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 2019 it is also understood that the most considerable reasons for the deteriorating the groundwater quality in india are lack of proper groundwater management strategy uncontrolled industrial development and mismanagement of wastes vast population growth urbanization municipal wastes massive usage of fertilizers unplanned waste dumping yards etc subba rao et al 2018 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 adimalla et al 2019a b c khanoranga and khalid 2019 janardhana raju et al 2016 in specially arid and semi arid regions of india where erratic rainfall high evaporation and over exploitation typically caused in decline of the groundwater levels therefore groundwater contamination is also increased however demand for fresh and quality drinking water crisis rises in the major parts of the country machiwal and jha 2015 subba rao et al 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b adimalla et al 2018a b thus knowledge of hydrochemical characteristics and groundwater quality is essential to understand its suitability for various rationales adimalla and wu 2019 cicchella et al 2010 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 in recent years the vast number of studies on groundwater quality and its contamination have largely been carried out in different parts of india and used several methods to comprehend the groundwater contamination and source identification singh et al 2017 performed multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical modeling to understand groundwater quality in delhi india and found that rock water interaction weathering and ion exchange were the principal factors controlling groundwater quality janarhana raju et al 2016 evaluated groundwater quality in the hard rock aquifers of andhra pradesh using geostatistical techniques they stated that excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides inputs were significantly responsible for the decline the groundwater quality and also spatio temporal changes in the groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2018 implemented a pollution index of groundwater pig method to quantify the quality and degree of pollution of groundwater from wanaparthy district telangana adimalla et al 2019a studied the hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater quality in the semi arid region of central telangana using a water quality index wqi technique duraisamy et al 2018 conducted a study on hydrochemical characterization and evaluation of groundwater quality in tamil nadu india using geographical information system gis and stated that gis is an effective tool to identify the polluted and unpolluted zones furthermore groundwater quality maps may be used to assist planners managers and local officials in evaluating the potential of contamination from the various sources of pollution duraisamy et al 2018 mohamed et al 2015 geographic information system gis has emerged as a dominant tool for accumulating analyzing and displaying spatial data and using this data for decision making in several areas including geological and geoenvironmental fields the hard rock terrain of medak region is a fast urbanizing and developing district in the telangana state where groundwater is primarily used for drinking and irrigation purposes many studies have indicated that groundwater quality deteriorated due to rock water interaction and excessive usage of fertilizers and anthropogenic factors adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2017b 2018a b 2013 adimalla et al 2018a b and caused to several health risks to the residents adimalla 2019a b adimalla and qian 2019a b however a detailed geochemical classification of groundwater quality has not been assessed in the hard rock terrain of medak telangana therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to prepare the spatial distribution map of the various physicochemical parameters using geographic information system gis to locate the suitable and unsuitable groundwater quality zones for drinking purpose 2 to assess the groundwater suitability for drinking purpose by comparing the recognized parameters with the standards guidelines and also 3 to evaluate the groundwater quality through groundwater quality index gwqi the outcome of this study can be helpful for the decision makers to take necessary action against the groundwater quality protection and also useful to the scientific community 2 materials and methods

stock solution 100 mg l of sodium fluoride as per the experimental requirement 2 ml of total ionic strength adjusting buffer grade iii tisab iii was added in 20 ml of sample the ion meter was calibrated for a slop of 59 2 2 the detailed chemical analysis procedure was illustrated in table 1 2 4 accuracy of chemical analysis accuracy of the physicochemical analysis of each groundwater sample was computed by using eq 1 domenico and schwartz 1990 1 ibe Î³ c Î³ a Î³ c Î³ a 100 where ibe is the ionic balance error Î³c represents the sum of cations sum na k mg2 and ca2 and Î³a is the sum of anions hco3 cl so4 2 f and no3 all cations and anions concentrations are expressed in milliequivalent per liter meq l the highest ibe was 8 75 which was below the standard limit of 10 indicating that the physico chemical analysis was accurate domenico and schwartz 1990 2 5 spatial distribution maps exact sampling location was marked with the help of handheld global positioning system gps garman etrex 30 and the geographical coordinates were imported into geographic information system gis platform the gis based analysis of spatiotemporal behavior of the groundwater quality in the study area was executed with the assistance of the spatial analyst module of arcgis version 9 3 software spatial distribution map of water quality parameters was prepared using arcgis version 9 3 with spatial statistical analyst module and kriging interpolation technique 2 6 piper diagram for the identification of water types the chemical analysis data of the groundwater samples were plotted on the piper diagram using aquachem software aquachem v4 0 2 7 gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 basically proposed two diagrams to understand the natural mechanisms of surface water chemistry however these diagrams have widely been used to study the principal mechanisms governing the groundwater chemistry narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b adimalla et al 2018a b li et al 2018 gibbs diagrams basically depend on two ratios which are computed by the following equations 2 g i b b s r a t i o i c l c l h c o 3 3 g i b b s r a t i o i i n a k n a k c a 2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter meq l 2 8 groundwater quality index gwqi gwqi has widely been used to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking purposes in various regions of the world ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 adimalla et al 2018a the following steps are playing a major role to estimate the gwqi a assigning weights wi maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to parameters such as no3 and f due to their major importance in groundwater quality evaluation and least was given to na and k table 2 b calculation of relative weight wi a relative weight wi is computed by the following equation 4 w i w i i n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters table 2 c quality rating qi a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is derived by its concentration in each water samples by its respective standard according to the who guidelines and then multiplied by 100 eventually calculation of qi is shown below 5 q i c i s i 100 where ci is the concentration of each groundwater quality parameter qi is the quality rating si is the recommended guideline value for each chemical parameter d sub index sii and gwqi sub index sii and gwqi were computed by the following equations 6 s i i w i q i 7 g w q i i 0 n s i i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on the concentration of ith parameter and n is the total number of parameters 3 results and discussion groundwater quality is most important as it is the major factor determining its suitability for drinking purpose in the study region the various physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples were analyzed and its descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation are demonstrated in table 3 furthermore results were compared with the world health organization who 2017 to understand the suitability for drinking purpose in the study region table 3 3 1 hydrogen ion concentration ph ph is a fundamental property that describes the acidity and alkalinity of groundwater the results state that the groundwater samples are alkaline in nature with a ph varying from 6 60 to 8 79 with an average of 7 60 table 3 as per the drinking water standards who 2017 the maximum permissible limit for ph concentration in water is 8 50 among all groundwater samples only 3 of samples have ph concentration above the maximum permissible limit table 3 the spatial distribution of ph in the investigated area is depicted in fig 2 3 2 electrical conductivity ec hem 1985 stated that the ionic concentration of the groundwater samples is generally evaluated by measuring the ec which varies according to the temperature concentration and type of ions present in it the ec content in the groundwater of the study region differed from 168 to 3170 Î¼s cm with a mean of 845 Î¼s cm table 2 it was found that only 8 groundwater samples were beyond the permissible limit table 3 furthermore ec can be classified as type i if the enrichments of salts are low ec 1500 Î¼s cm type ii if the enrichment of salts are medium ec 1500 and 3000 Î¼s cm and type iii if the enrichments of salts are high ec 3000 Î¼s cm subba rao et al 2012 according to the classification 91 of samples fall under the enrichment of salts and only 8 of samples have shown type iii 3 3 total dissolved solids tds tds signifies the various types of minerals present in water in dissolved form hem 1985 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a in natural water dissolved solids are composed of large carbonates bicarbonates chlorides sulfates phosphates silica calcium magnesium sodium and potassium gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 therefore it is an important parameter in drinking water and other water quality standards table 3 indicates that the tds content varies between 107 and 2028 mg l with a mean value from 541 mg l about 42 of groundwater samples show tds content above the who 2017 standard value table 3 furthermore davis and de wiest 1966 categorized water on the basis of tds concentration into four groups table 3 which are represented as desirable for drinking tds 500 mg l permissible for drinking tds 500 1000 mg l useful irrigation tds 1000 3000 mg l and unfit for drinking and irrigation tds 3000 mg l as shown in table 4 about 57 37 and 6 of the total groundwater samples are under the desirable for drinking permissible for drinking and useful for irrigation respectively table 4 the spatial distribution map of tds was depicted in fig 3 indicating that tds exceeded the permissible limit in the north and southern part of the study region 3 4 total hardness th generally the hardness of groundwater is caused by compounds of calcium and magnesium and by a variety of other metals duraisamy et al 2018 alaya et al 2014 in a study jain et al 2010 stated that intake of higher concentration 300 mg l of th may lead to health hazards such as kidney problems and the formation of kidney stones therefore determining the th content in the drinking water or groundwater is most important which can help to ascertain the suitability of groundwater various purposes especially drinking and irrigation in the groundwater the concentration of th is in the range of 50 1550 mg l with a mean of 241 mg l in the study region table 3 only 3 of the total groundwater samples were above the maximum permissible limit of 500 mg l who 2017 table 3 furthermore sawyer and mccartly 1967 classified groundwaters based on th concentration are 75 mg l as calcium carbonate is classified as soft water 75 150 mg l as moderately hard water 150 300 mg l as hard water and larger than 300 mg l as very hard water table 5 as shown in table 5 64 and 16 of groundwater samples fall under hard and very hard water category respectively sawyer and mccarthy 1967 spatial distribution map of th fig 4 indicates that higher concentrations 500 mg l of th are observed in the eastern and southern part of the study region 3 5 magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 according to the world health organization who 2017 guidelines the permissible limit of mg2 is 150 mg l in the study region groundwater the concentration of mg2 is in the range of 6 680 mg l with an average value of 73 mg l table 3 it was noticed that mg2 concentration in the groundwater of the study 13 of groundwater samples were above the maximum permissible limit recommended by who 2006 and higher concentration was observed in the central and south western part of the study region fig 5 the higher concentration of mg2 in the groundwater of the study region could be due to magnesium bearing minerals and also animal domestic and industrial wastes the analysis results show that ca2 concentration of the study region groundwater varies from 10 to 164 mg l with an average concentration of 68 mg l and all the collected samples are well within the prescribed limits who 2017 table 3 the spatial distribution map of ca2 was depicted in fig 6 in the study it was identified that the concentration of mg2 is much higher than the ca2 which generally may occur due to the effect of ferromagnetism minerals and ion exchange hem 1991 the similar results were reported from the north eastern part of nagpur central india marghade et al 2011 and visakhapatnam india subba rao and surya rao 2010 3 6 sodium na and potassium k the spatial distribution maps of na and k are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the higher concentration of na is noticed in the middle and northern while k is the north western of the study region however the na concentration in groundwater ranged from 14 to 145 mg l with a mean value of 92 mg l table 3 results also indicated that no collected groundwater sample were exceeded the recommended limit who 2006 table 3 the k is the most important element for human nutrient sakram and adimalla 2018 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 and intake of excess may behave as a laxative alam et al 2012 k concentration in the groundwater of the study region differs from 1 to 24 mg l with an average value of 3 3 mg l table 3 however who guidelines for k has not been established as it naturally occurs in drinking water at concentrations well below those of health concern who 2017 3 7 chloride cl generally groundwater contamination occurs from both sources such as natural and anthropogenic appelo and postma 1996 the excessive concentration of cl in groundwater is considered as an index of pollution by various sources and also it makes water to salty taste marghade et al 2012 appelo and postma 1996 the cl concentration in the groundwater of medak district varies widely and ranges from 24 to 959 mg l with a mean value of 233 mg l table 3 however the mean concentration of cl in the studied groundwater samples is below the maximum permissible limit of 600 mg l who 2017 furthermore table 3 indicating that only 32 of groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible limit which is not suitable for drinking purposes these high concentrations of cl in 32 of groundwater samples could be attributed to the leaching from septic tanks domestic and animal wastes municipal effluents agricultural and fertilizers appelo and postma 1996 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 higher cl concentrations are found in the southern and north eastern part of the study region fig 9 3 8 bicarbonate hco3 the concentration of hco3 varies between 18 and 527 mg l with a mean value of 219 mg l in the groundwater of the study region table 3 spatial distribution map of hco3 was shown in fig 10 indicating that higher concentration was observed in the northern part while low concentration was noticed in the southern part of the study region 3 9 sulfate so4 2 the so4 2 concentration in groundwater samples varied between 21 and 328 the average value was 161 mg l table 3 specified that all sampling sites were within the maximum permissible limit of 400 mg l who 2017 table 3 furthermore 22 of groundwater sampling sites exceeded the highest desirable limit of 200 mg l recommended by who 2006 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution map of so4 2 in the study region 3 10 nitrate no3 groundwater no3 contamination is the most widespread problem facing the world adimalla 2019b chen et al 2016 2017 gu et al 2013 previous studies have stated that the potentially occurrence and distribution of nitrate contamination in the groundwater mainly excess the application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and manures sewer leakage from the septic tanks urbanization industrial and municipal sewage atmospheric dry and wet deposition and landfill leachates wei et al 2017 chen et al 2017 adimalla 2019b the study region groundwater the concentration of no3 is varied from 3 to 440 mg l with an average value of 73 mg l table 3 however the world health organization who has recommended the maximum safe limit of 50 mg l as nitrate ion to be protective against methemoglobinaemia and thyroid effects in the most sensitive subpopulation bottle fed infants and consequently other population subgroups who 2017 the current results indicate that 8 8 times higher than the above recommended limit and also 50 of groundwater sampling sites are above the safe limit for no3 which are not fit for drinking purposes spatial distribution map of no3 in the study region is depicted in fig 12 and a higher concentration of no3 can be seen southern and north eastern part of the study region furthermore adimalla et al 2018a have classified groundwater on the basis of no3 as 50 mg l low health risk 50 100 mg l high health risk and 100 mg l very high health risk table 6 as shown in table 6 50 30 and 20 of groundwater samples from the study region belong to low risk high risk and very high risk category respectively fig 13 3 11 fluoride f mukherjee and singh 2018 recently reviewed fluoride contamination mobilization and association in groundwater from an indian context they noticed that rajasthan telangana andhra pradesh tamil nadu gujarat and west bengal were relatively high fluoride contaminated states in india furthermore they also identified that higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater attributed to geogenic sources mainly from country rocks containing rick fluorine bearing minerals apatite fluorite biotite muscovite and hornblende however in another study adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b reported that all districts in telangana state groundwater have elevated fluoride concentration which is highly unsuitable for drinking purposes however the concentration of f ranged from 0 2 to 7 1 mg l with a mean of 1 7 mg l in the groundwater of the study region table 3 compared with the who guidelines 57 of the groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking purposes in the study region consumption of these high fluoride containing water may lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis in the study region however the higher concentration was observed in the eastern and a number of small patches were distributed throughout the study region fig 14 therefore necessary action should be taken to arrest the elevated fluoride contamination problems in the groundwater of the study region 3 12 geochemical mechanism of groundwater generally groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including rock weathering dominance or rock water interaction evaporation dominance and atmospheric precipitation dominance gibbs plot gibbs 1970 has widely been employed in various groundwater or surface water studies to assess the dominant factors that involved in the water chemistry narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b adimalla 2019a adimalla et al 2019a adimalla and li 2019 for groundwater samples in the study region the gibbs ratios i and ii range from 0 13 to 0 95 and 0 19 to 0 90 with a mean of 0 61 and 0 54 respectively as shown in fig 15 elucidates that the majority of groundwater samples of the study region plot in the boomerang zone which is also known as rock weathering dominance zone furthermore this phenomenon reveals that rock water interaction or rock weathering dominance is primarily controlled the major ion chemistry as mentioned previously the study region experiences arid and semi arid climate conditions and the occurrence of groundwater pore space of hard rocks therefore rock water interaction and slight evaporation may also influence the groundwater chemistry in the study region this extensive rock water interaction may lead to enhance the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study region narsimha and sudarshan 2017b stated that rock water interaction is the dominant factor that majorly influences the groundwater chemistry and also principal cause for elevated fluoride content in the groundwater of the basara india in another study on peddavagu in central telangana pct adimalla et al 2018b found that rock water interaction is favorable for fluoride enrichment in groundwater which mainly occurs in the hard rock terrains with semi arid climate low rainfall and also low groundwater hydraulic conductivity are all most dominant factors for dissolution of fluorine rich minerals furthermore they also stated that fluoride concentration largely depends upon groundwater chemistry na and hco3 are principal ions which are also greatly influenced in both low and high fluoride content in the pct india adimalla et al 2018b 3 13 hydro chemical evolution and groundwater types piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 unveils the most significant factors which involve in the hydro chemical characteristics of the aquifer system and also the interaction between groundwater and aquifer minerals within the lithological framework therefore in order to classify the groundwater type or hydro chemical facies of the hard rock aquifers of medak their cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl hco3 so4 2 chemical contents were plotted on piper trilinear diagram fig 16 to better understand the groundwater types the piper trilinear diagram has mainly been classified into six types 1 ca2 hco3 2 na cl 3 mixed ca2 na hco3 4 mixed ca2 mg2 cl 5 ca2 cl and 6 na hco3 fig 15 as it can be seen from fig 15 predominant cations and anions of the study are of ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 ca2 hco3 na hco3 and na cl water types respectively however more groundwater sampling locations show the ca2 na hco3 water type which indicates the dissolution of carbonates and the weathering of silicate minerals in the current study region and na hco3 water type which is due to agricultural practices in the study region it is believed that fluoride rock groundwater in hard rock terrains of the world is often found of na hco3 water type with low calcium content and neutral to alkaline ph values adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2018b olaka et al 2016 chen et al 2016 2017 mukherjee and singh 2018 li et al 2018 3 14 groundwater quality index gwqi the calculated values of gwqi for each groundwater sample were listed in table 7 as can be seen from table 7 gwqi values in the study region groundwater ranged from 10 11 to 197 16 with an average value of 58 87 the groundwater quality index gwqi classified into five categories such as excellent water wqi 50 good water wqi 50 to 100 poor water wqi 100 to 200 very poor water wqi 200 to 300 and water unsuitable for drinking wqi 300 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 based on this classification 37 11 of groundwater samples fall excellent 57 21 and 5 67 fall under good and poor for drinking purpose categories in the study region fig 17 table 8 4 conclusions groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and domestic purposes in the hard rock terrain of medak region in india therefore to understand the quality of groundwater in the study region 194 groundwater samples were collected analyzed and evaluated for drinking water quality parameters furthermore spatial distribution and water quality index were also employed to evaluate the groundwater quality in the study region the following major conclusions were listed the study region groundwater is neutral to slightly alkaline nature na and cl are the most dominant cation and anions respectively compared with the world health organization who drinking water quality guidelines ca2 na and k ions concentrations are under the maximum permissible limits in the groundwater of the study region furthermore excessive concentrations of tds th cl mg2 and ec are found at a few groundwater sampling locations in the study region the results also show no3 concentration in the groundwater of the study region is 8 8 times larger than its recommended limit of 50 mg l and higher concentration is noticed in the southern and north eastern part of the study region the results demonstrate that high fluoride concentration in groundwater is found in the eastern part of the study region where its content reached up to 7 1 mg l which is the highly unacceptable range for drinking uses based on gwqi the groundwater of the study region generally excellent to poor water quality for drinking purposes the groundwater chemistry of the study region was largely influenced by the rock water interaction or rock weathering dominance and further evaporation dominance ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 ca2 hco3 na hco3 and na cl water types were observed in the groundwater of the study region mainly dominant of na hco3 water type may be responsible for the enrichment of fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study region declaration of

fluoride concentration is noticed in the eastern and also some parts of the western region while high nitrate concentration is shown in north and southern agricultural regions of the study area the chemical relationships in piper diagram identified ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 and ca2 hco3 are all most predominant water types while gibbs diagrams revealed that groundwater of the study region are mainly controlled by rock weathering dominance and partially evaporation dominance the gwqi indicates that 37 11 and 57 21 of groundwater samples are excellent and good in water quality for drinking uses respectively geologically 80 of the study area consists of granites and gneiss and 20 with basalts and laterites eventually groundwater quality in the medak region is fettered by geogenic and anthropogenic activities therefore people are advised to maintain a groundwater management strategy to protect further sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality hydrogeochemistry gis medak region south india 1 introduction groundwater is an essential and vital component part of our life support system and is used primarily for drinking and irrigation purposes water quality has a great impact on human health and agricultural development however groundwater can alone meet the necessary needs for two thirds of the world s population adimalla and li 2019 adimalla 2019a mukherjee and singh 2018 jousma and roelofsen 2004 in many developing countries like bangladesh india china pakistan nepal and africa where very large number of people depend on groundwater for their daily needs particularly drinking purpose adimalla 2019a singh et al 2017 ishwar et al 2014 adimalla et al 2019c however in these countries groundwater quality are typically deteriorated due to natural and anthropogenic factors sakram and adimalla 2018 khanoranga and khalid 2019 narsimha and rajitha 2018 li et al 2018 chen et al 2017 narsimha 2018 subba rao et al 2012 2019 it is also understood that the most considerable reasons for the deteriorating the groundwater quality in india are lack of proper groundwater management strategy uncontrolled industrial development and mismanagement of wastes vast population growth urbanization municipal wastes massive usage of fertilizers unplanned waste dumping yards etc subba rao et al 2018 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 adimalla et al 2019a b c khanoranga and khalid 2019 janardhana raju et al 2016 in specially arid and semi arid regions of india where erratic rainfall high evaporation and over exploitation typically caused in decline of the groundwater levels therefore groundwater contamination is also increased however demand for fresh and quality drinking water crisis rises in the major parts of the country machiwal and jha 2015 subba rao et al 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b adimalla et al 2018a b thus knowledge of hydrochemical characteristics and groundwater quality is essential to understand its suitability for various rationales adimalla and wu 2019 cicchella et al 2010 adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 2018 in recent years the vast number of studies on groundwater quality and its contamination have largely been carried out in different parts of india and used several methods to comprehend the groundwater contamination and source identification singh et al 2017 performed multivariate statistical analysis and geochemical modeling to understand groundwater quality in delhi india and found that rock water interaction weathering and ion exchange were the principal factors controlling groundwater quality janarhana raju et al 2016 evaluated groundwater quality in the hard rock aquifers of andhra pradesh using geostatistical techniques they stated that excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides inputs were significantly responsible for the decline the groundwater quality and also spatio temporal changes in the groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2018 implemented a pollution index of groundwater pig method to quantify the quality and degree of pollution of groundwater from wanaparthy district telangana adimalla et al 2019a studied the hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater quality in the semi arid region of central telangana using a water quality index wqi technique duraisamy et al 2018 conducted a study on hydrochemical characterization and evaluation of groundwater quality in tamil nadu india using geographical information system gis and stated that gis is an effective tool to identify the polluted and unpolluted zones furthermore groundwater quality maps may be used to assist planners managers and local officials in evaluating the potential of contamination from the various sources of pollution duraisamy et al 2018 mohamed et al 2015 geographic information system gis has emerged as a dominant tool for accumulating analyzing and displaying spatial data and using this data for decision making in several areas including geological and geoenvironmental fields the hard rock terrain of medak region is a fast urbanizing and developing district in the telangana state where groundwater is primarily used for drinking and irrigation purposes many studies have indicated that groundwater quality deteriorated due to rock water interaction and excessive usage of fertilizers and anthropogenic factors adimalla

geochemical classification of groundwater quality has not been assessed in the hard rock terrain of medak telangana therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to prepare the spatial distribution map of the various physicochemical parameters using geographic information system gis to locate the suitable and unsuitable groundwater quality zones for drinking purpose 2 to assess the groundwater suitability for drinking purpose by comparing the recognized parameters with the standards guidelines and also 3 to evaluate the groundwater quality through groundwater quality index gwqi the outcome of this study can be helpful for the decision makers to take necessary action against the groundwater quality protection and also useful to the scientific community 2 materials and methods

groundwater sample collection and chemical analysis the groundwater samples were collected from 194 bore hand pumps during november and december 2015 the standard procedure was followed for collecting the groundwater samples apha 2012 the groundwater samples were collected in a pre cleaned high density polythene sample bottles of 1 l capacity after labeling the samples were transported to wet chemical laboratory in the applied geochemistry department stored at a temperature below 4 c prior to physicochemical analysis in the laboratory physico chemical parameters such as hydrogen ion

calibrated for a slop of 59 2 2 the detailed chemical analysis procedure was illustrated in table 1 2 4 accuracy of chemical analysis accuracy of the physicochemical analysis of each groundwater sample was computed by using eq 1 domenico and schwartz 1990 1 ibe Î³ c Î³ a Î³ c Î³ a 100 where ibe is the ionic balance error Î³c represents the sum of cations sum na k mg2 and ca2 and Î³a is the sum of anions hco3 cl so4 2 f and no3 all cations and anions concentrations are expressed in milliequivalent per liter meq l the highest ibe was 8 75 which was below the standard limit of 10 indicating that the physico chemical analysis was accurate domenico and schwartz 1990 2 5 spatial distribution maps exact sampling location was marked with the help of handheld global positioning system gps garman etrex 30 and the geographical coordinates were imported into geographic information system gis platform the gis based analysis of spatiotemporal behavior of the groundwater quality in the study area was executed with the assistance of the spatial analyst module of arcgis version 9 3 software spatial distribution map of water quality parameters was prepared using arcgis version 9 3 with spatial statistical analyst module and kriging interpolation technique 2 6 piper diagram for the identification of water types the chemical analysis data of the groundwater samples were plotted on the piper diagram using aquachem software aquachem v4 0 2 7 gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 basically proposed two diagrams to understand the natural mechanisms of surface water chemistry however these diagrams have widely been used to study the principal mechanisms governing the groundwater chemistry narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b adimalla et al 2018a b li et al 2018 gibbs diagrams basically depend on two ratios which are computed by the following equations 2 g i b b s r a t i o i c l c l h c o 3 3 g i b b s r a t i o i i n a k n a k c a 2 where all the ionic concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter meq l 2 8 groundwater quality index gwqi gwqi has widely been used to evaluate the groundwater quality for drinking purposes in various regions of the world ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 adimalla et al 2018a the following steps are playing a major role to estimate the gwqi a assigning weights wi maximum weight of 5 has been assigned to parameters such as no3 and f due to their major importance in groundwater quality evaluation and least was given to na and k table 2 b calculation of relative weight wi a relative weight wi is computed by the following equation 4 w i w i i n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter and n is the number of parameters table 2 c quality rating qi a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is derived by its concentration in each water samples by its respective standard according to the who guidelines and then multiplied by 100 eventually calculation of qi is shown below 5 q i c i s i

sii and gwqi were computed by the following equations 6 s i i w i q i 7 g w q i i 0 n s i i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on the concentration of ith parameter and n is the total number of parameters 3 results and discussion groundwater quality is most important as it is the major factor determining its suitability for drinking purpose in the study region the various physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples were analyzed and its descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean and standard deviation are demonstrated in table 3 furthermore results were compared with the world health organization who 2017 to understand the suitability for drinking purpose in the study region table 3 3 1 hydrogen ion concentration ph ph is a fundamental property that describes the acidity and alkalinity of groundwater the results state that the groundwater samples are alkaline in nature with a ph varying from 6 60 to 8 79 with an average of 7 60 table 3 as per the drinking water standards who 2017 the maximum permissible limit for ph concentration in water is 8 50 among all groundwater samples only 3 of samples have ph concentration above the maximum permissible limit table 3 the spatial distribution of ph in the investigated area is depicted in fig 2 3 2 electrical conductivity ec hem 1985 stated that the ionic concentration of the groundwater samples is generally evaluated by measuring the ec which varies according to the temperature concentration and type of ions present in it the ec content in the groundwater of the study region differed from 168 to 3170 Î¼s cm with a mean of 845 Î¼s cm table 2 it was found that only 8 groundwater samples were beyond the permissible limit table 3 furthermore ec can be classified as type i if the enrichments of salts are low ec 1500 Î¼s cm type ii if the enrichment of salts are medium ec 1500 and 3000 Î¼s cm and type iii if the enrichments of salts are high ec 3000 Î¼s cm subba rao et al 2012 according to the classification 91 of samples fall under the enrichment of salts and only 8 of samples have shown type iii 3 3 total dissolved solids tds tds signifies the various types of minerals present in water in dissolved form hem 1985 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a in natural water dissolved solids are composed of large carbonates bicarbonates chlorides sulfates phosphates silica calcium magnesium sodium and potassium gnanachandrasamy et al 2015 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 therefore it is an important parameter in drinking water and other water quality standards table 3 indicates that the tds content varies between 107 and 2028 mg l with a mean value from 541 mg l about 42 of groundwater samples show tds content above the who 2017 standard value table 3 furthermore davis and de wiest 1966 categorized water on the basis of tds concentration into four groups table 3 which are represented as desirable for drinking tds 500 mg l permissible for drinking tds 500 1000 mg l useful irrigation tds 1000 3000 mg l and unfit for drinking and irrigation tds 3000 mg l as shown in table 4 about 57 37 and 6 of the total groundwater samples are under the desirable for drinking permissible for drinking and useful for irrigation respectively table 4 the spatial distribution map of tds was depicted in fig 3 indicating that tds exceeded the permissible limit in the north and southern part of the study region 3 4 total hardness th generally the hardness of groundwater is caused by compounds of calcium and magnesium and by a variety of other metals duraisamy et al 2018 alaya et al 2014 in a study jain et al 2010 stated that intake of higher concentration 300 mg l of th may lead to health hazards such as kidney problems and the formation of kidney stones therefore determining the th content in the drinking water or groundwater is most important which can help to ascertain the suitability of groundwater various purposes especially drinking and irrigation in the groundwater the concentration of th is in the range of 50 1550 mg l with a mean of 241 mg l in the study region table 3 only 3 of the total groundwater samples were above the maximum permissible limit of 500 mg l who 2017 table 3 furthermore sawyer and mccartly 1967 classified groundwaters based on th concentration are 75 mg l as calcium carbonate is classified as soft water 75 150 mg l as moderately hard water 150 300 mg l as hard water and larger than 300 mg l as very hard water table 5 as shown in table 5 64 and 16 of groundwater samples fall under hard and very hard water category respectively sawyer and mccarthy 1967 spatial distribution map of th fig 4 indicates that higher concentrations 500 mg l of th are observed in the eastern and southern part of the study region 3 5 magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 according to the world health organization who 2017 guidelines the permissible limit of mg2 is 150 mg l in the study region groundwater the concentration of mg2 is in the range of 6 680 mg l with an average value of 73 mg l table 3 it was noticed that mg2 concentration in the groundwater of the study 13 of groundwater samples were above the maximum permissible limit recommended by who 2006 and higher concentration was observed in the central and south western part of the study region fig 5 the higher concentration of mg2 in the groundwater of the study region could be due to magnesium bearing minerals and also animal domestic and industrial wastes the analysis results show that ca2 concentration of the study region groundwater varies from 10 to 164 mg l with an average concentration of 68 mg l and all the collected samples are well within the prescribed limits who 2017 table 3 the spatial distribution map of ca2 was depicted in fig 6 in the study it was identified that the concentration of mg2 is much higher than the ca2 which generally may occur due to the effect of ferromagnetism minerals and ion exchange hem 1991 the similar results were reported from the north eastern part of nagpur central india marghade et al 2011 and visakhapatnam india subba rao and surya rao 2010 3 6 sodium na and potassium k the spatial distribution maps of na and k are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the higher concentration of na is noticed in the middle and northern while k is the north western of the study region however the na concentration in groundwater ranged from 14 to 145 mg l with a mean value of 92 mg l table 3 results also indicated that no collected groundwater sample were exceeded the recommended limit who 2006 table 3 the k is the most important element for human nutrient sakram and adimalla 2018 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 and intake of excess may behave as a laxative alam et al 2012 k concentration in the groundwater of the study region differs from 1 to 24 mg l with an average value of 3 3 mg l table 3 however who guidelines for k has not been established as it naturally occurs in drinking water at concentrations well below those of health concern who 2017 3 7 chloride cl generally groundwater contamination occurs from both sources such as natural and anthropogenic appelo and postma 1996 the excessive concentration of cl in groundwater is considered as an index of pollution by various sources and also it makes water to salty taste marghade et al 2012 appelo and postma 1996 the cl concentration in the groundwater of medak district varies widely and ranges from 24 to 959 mg l with a mean value of 233 mg l table 3 however the mean concentration of cl in the studied groundwater samples is below the maximum permissible limit of 600 mg l who 2017 furthermore table 3 indicating that only 32 of groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible limit which is not suitable for drinking purposes these high concentrations of cl in 32 of groundwater samples could be attributed to the leaching from septic tanks domestic and animal wastes municipal effluents agricultural and fertilizers appelo and postma 1996 adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 higher cl concentrations are found in the southern and north eastern part of the study region fig 9 3 8 bicarbonate hco3 the concentration of hco3 varies between 18 and 527 mg l with a mean value of 219 mg l in the groundwater of the study region table 3 spatial distribution map of hco3 was shown in fig 10 indicating that higher concentration was observed in the northern part while low concentration was noticed in the southern part of the study region 3 9 sulfate so4 2 the so4 2 concentration in groundwater samples varied between 21 and 328 the average value was 161 mg l table 3 specified that all sampling sites were within the maximum permissible limit of 400 mg l who 2017 table 3 furthermore 22 of groundwater sampling sites exceeded the highest desirable limit of 200 mg l recommended by who 2006 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution map of so4 2 in the study region 3 10 nitrate no3 groundwater no3 contamination is the most widespread problem facing the world adimalla 2019b chen et al 2016 2017 gu et al 2013 previous studies have stated that the potentially occurrence and distribution of nitrate contamination in the groundwater mainly excess the application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and manures sewer leakage from the septic tanks urbanization industrial and municipal sewage atmospheric dry and wet deposition and landfill leachates wei et al 2017 chen et al 2017 adimalla 2019b the study region groundwater the concentration of no3 is varied from 3 to 440 mg l with an average value of 73 mg l table 3 however the world health organization who has recommended the maximum safe limit of 50 mg l as nitrate ion to be protective against methemoglobinaemia and thyroid effects in the most sensitive subpopulation bottle fed infants and consequently other population subgroups who 2017 the current results indicate that 8 8 times higher than the above recommended limit and also 50 of groundwater sampling sites are above the safe limit for no3 which are not fit for drinking purposes spatial distribution map of no3 in the study region is depicted in fig 12 and a higher concentration of no3 can be seen southern and north eastern part of the study region furthermore adimalla et al 2018a have classified groundwater on the basis of no3 as 50 mg l low health risk 50 100 mg l high health risk and 100 mg l very high health risk table 6 as shown in table 6 50 30 and 20 of groundwater samples from the study region belong to low risk high risk and very high risk category respectively fig 13 3 11 fluoride f mukherjee and singh 2018 recently reviewed fluoride contamination mobilization and association in groundwater from an indian context they noticed that rajasthan telangana andhra pradesh tamil nadu gujarat and west bengal were relatively high fluoride contaminated states in india furthermore they also identified that higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater attributed to geogenic sources mainly from country rocks containing rick fluorine bearing minerals apatite fluorite biotite muscovite and hornblende however in another study adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b reported that all districts in telangana state groundwater have elevated fluoride concentration which is highly unsuitable for drinking purposes however the concentration of f ranged from 0 2 to 7 1 mg l with a mean of 1 7 mg l in the groundwater of the study region table 3 compared with the who guidelines 57 of the groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking purposes in the study region consumption of these high fluoride containing water may lead to dental and skeletal fluorosis in the study region however the higher concentration was observed in the eastern and a number of small patches were distributed throughout the study region fig 14 therefore necessary action should be taken to arrest the elevated fluoride contamination problems in the groundwater of the study region 3 12 geochemical mechanism of groundwater generally groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including rock weathering dominance or rock water interaction evaporation dominance and atmospheric precipitation dominance gibbs plot gibbs 1970 has widely been employed in various groundwater or surface water studies to assess the dominant factors that involved in the water chemistry narsimha and sudarshan 2017a b adimalla 2019a adimalla et al 2019a adimalla and li 2019 for groundwater samples in the study region the gibbs ratios i and ii range from 0 13 to 0 95 and 0 19 to 0 90 with a mean of 0 61 and 0 54 respectively as shown in fig 15 elucidates that the majority of groundwater samples of the study region plot in the boomerang zone which is also known as rock weathering dominance zone furthermore this phenomenon reveals that rock water interaction or rock weathering dominance is primarily controlled the major ion chemistry as mentioned previously the study region experiences arid and semi arid climate conditions and the occurrence of groundwater pore space of hard rocks therefore rock water interaction and slight evaporation may also influence the groundwater chemistry in the study region this extensive rock water interaction may lead to enhance the fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study region narsimha and sudarshan 2017b stated that rock water interaction is the dominant factor that majorly influences the groundwater chemistry and also principal cause for elevated fluoride content in the groundwater of the basara india in another study on peddavagu in central telangana pct adimalla et al 2018b found that rock water interaction is favorable for fluoride enrichment in groundwater which mainly occurs in the hard rock terrains with semi arid climate low rainfall and also low groundwater hydraulic conductivity are all most dominant factors for dissolution of fluorine rich minerals furthermore they also stated that fluoride concentration largely depends upon groundwater chemistry na and hco3 are principal ions which are also greatly influenced in both low and high fluoride content in the pct india adimalla et al 2018b 3 13 hydro chemical evolution and groundwater types piper trilinear diagram piper 1953 unveils the most significant factors which involve in the hydro chemical characteristics of the aquifer system and also the interaction between groundwater and aquifer minerals within the lithological framework therefore in order to classify the groundwater type or hydro chemical facies of the hard rock aquifers of medak their cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl hco3 so4 2 chemical contents were plotted on piper trilinear diagram fig 16 to better understand the groundwater types the piper trilinear diagram has mainly been classified into six types 1 ca2 hco3 2 na cl 3 mixed ca2 na hco3 4 mixed ca2 mg2 cl 5 ca2 cl and 6 na hco3 fig 15 as it can be seen from fig 15 predominant cations and anions of the study are of ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 ca2 hco3 na hco3 and na cl water types respectively however more groundwater sampling locations show the ca2 na hco3 water type which indicates the dissolution of carbonates and the weathering of silicate minerals in the current study region and na hco3 water type which is due to agricultural practices in the study region it is believed that fluoride rock groundwater in hard rock terrains of the world is often found of na hco3 water type with low calcium content and neutral to alkaline ph values adimalla and li 2019 adimalla et al 2018b olaka et al 2016 chen et al 2016 2017 mukherjee and singh 2018 li et al 2018 3 14 groundwater quality index gwqi the calculated values of gwqi for each groundwater sample were listed in table 7 as can be seen from table 7 gwqi values in the study region groundwater ranged from 10 11 to 197 16 with an average value of 58 87 the groundwater quality index gwqi classified into five categories such as excellent water wqi 50 good water wqi 50 to 100 poor water wqi 100 to 200 very poor water wqi 200 to 300 and water unsuitable for drinking wqi 300 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 based on this classification 37 11 of groundwater samples fall excellent 57 21 and 5 67 fall under good and poor for drinking purpose categories in the study region fig 17 table 8 4 conclusions groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and domestic purposes in the hard rock terrain of medak region in india therefore to understand the quality of groundwater in the study region 194 groundwater samples were collected analyzed and evaluated for drinking water quality parameters furthermore spatial distribution and water quality index were also employed to evaluate the groundwater quality in the study region the following major conclusions were listed the study region groundwater is neutral to slightly alkaline nature na and cl are the most dominant cation and anions respectively compared with the world health organization who drinking water quality guidelines ca2 na and k ions concentrations are under the maximum permissible limits in the groundwater of the study region furthermore excessive concentrations of tds th cl mg2 and ec are found at a few groundwater sampling locations in the study region the results also show no3 concentration in the groundwater of the study region is 8 8 times larger than its recommended limit of 50 mg l and higher concentration is noticed in the southern and north eastern part of the study region the results demonstrate that high fluoride concentration in groundwater is found in the eastern part of the study region where its content reached up to 7 1 mg l which is the highly unacceptable range for drinking uses based on gwqi the groundwater of the study region generally excellent to poor water quality for drinking purposes the groundwater chemistry of the study region was largely influenced by the rock water interaction or rock weathering dominance and further evaporation dominance ca2 mg2 cl ca2 na hco3 ca2 hco3 na hco3 and na cl water types were observed in the groundwater of the study region mainly dominant of na hco3 water type may be responsible for the enrichment of fluoride concentration in the groundwater of the study region declaration of

manganese intake can cause motor neuron diseases muscle tremor and mental disturbance who 2004 who 2017 irrigation with arsenic contaminated groundwater can lead to arsenic accumulation in soils and crops which eventually reduces yield up to 66 rice yield reduction has been reported in bangladesh panaullah et al 2009 presence of excess dissolved na can lead to higher sodium adsorption ratio sar of soil highly contaminated irrigation water can cause changes in soil permeability soil ph soil structure and nutrient uptake by plants suarez et al 2006 ayers and westcot 1985 even though iron does not pose any health risks unless it exceeds 200 mg l and at the levels consumed while drinking it degrades the aesthetics of water deteriorates garments and household items and may damage pipes and irrigation systems who 2017 groundwater resources are high in contaminants as well as nutrients as mentioned above groundwater plays an important role in rice production of bangladesh every year a substantial amount of money goes into rice production which includes irrigation systems fertilizers and pesticides farmers have to spend around us 67 57 bdt 5728 on fertilizers for one harvest biswas and mandal 1993 basak 2011 several studies have linked soil water status with nutrient uptake of plants from soil solution levin et al 1980 o toole and padilla 1984 tanguilig et al 1987 beyrouty et al 1994 high soil moisture content is necessary for increased diffusion rate of nutrient from the soil to the absorbing root surface tanguilig et al 1987 which means nutrients have to be in dissolved form to be absorbed by plant roots if the nutrients from groundwater can replace the nutrients from fertilizers it will be more financially efficient along with reduced water pollution from agricultural runoff groundwater quality assessment is vital to determine safe and suitable groundwater sources of the country several studies have been conducted on arsenic manganese and iron contamination alam et al 2002 bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 hasan and ali 2010 saha et al 2018 however not many studies have been conducted on assessing the groundwater quality at a large scale a suitability analysis can be conducted to calculate quality indices which depend on the weighted combination of the water quality parameters for example widely used water quality index wqi is a rating that reflects the aggregated impact of various water quality parameters ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 meireles et al 2010 wqi has been previously used in bangladesh in a smaller geographic scale by akter et al 2016 to assess the water quality in 12 upazilas and by saha et al 2018 to assess groundwater quality of tala upazila in sathkhira the objectives of this study are as follows 1 assess the groundwater quality of bangladesh to determine the suitability and usability of groundwater in bangladesh for drinking and irrigation purposes based on water quality index 2 analyse the impact of irrigation water quality on rice yield specifically dry season crop oryza sativa commonly known as boro rice 3 assess the potential for nutrient supplementation by groundwater for boro rice plants and how much cost of fertilizer can be saved if groundwater acts as nutrient supplementation 2 methods to conduct this analysis a database was compiled using publicly available water quality data of 6453 tube wells from the british geological survey bgs department of public health engineering dphe bgs and dphe 2001 and unicef bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 that covers the whole geographic region of bangladesh the database contains a number of chemical water quality parameters such as arsenic aluminium boron barium calcium chromium copper hardness iron lithium magnesium manganese potassium phosphorus sodium sulphate and zinc required for wqi calculation wqi was calculated separately for drinking and irrigation water and for both shallow tube wells stw depth 150 m and deep tube wells dtw depth 150 m saha et al 2018 ahmed et al 2004 bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 bgs and dphe 2001 out of the 6453 samples 5537 were stw and 916 were dtw the datasets lacked few parameters such as salinity ec tds bicarbonate and chloride along with the biological parameters like total coliform e coli faecal coliform etc that were required to assess water quality index precisely the parameters used in this study are the chemical parameters that are naturally present in groundwater and have adverse effects on human health and food production 2 1 drinking water quality index dwqi drinking water quality index dwqi 1 1 dwqi drinking water quality index was calculated based on a method developed by ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the parameters used for dwqi calculation were arsenic as iron fe manganese mn sodium na and hardness according to who 2017 only two of the parameters as and mn have severe health effects however all the five parameters play an important role in the acceptability of drinking water in bangladesh fe na and hardness affect the taste color and usability of water who 2017 dwqi was calculated using both who and bangladesh drinking water standards bdws 2 2 bdws bangladesh drinking water standard table 1 who guideline values for hardness and mn are based on who 2004 who excluded these parameters from the list of health based standard for naturally occurring chemicals since 2011 who 2011 however frisbie et al 2012 argued that mn should be reintroduced in the list because many countries have mn 0 4 mg l in drinking water groundwater hardness in many areas in bangladesh are also very high therefore the 2004 who guideline values for hardness and mn were used to calculate wqis in for exploratory purpose in order to calculate dwqi each of the parameters was assigned with a weight w i according to its relative impact on the overall quality of water for drinking purpose table si1 the highest weight of 5 was assigned to arsenic due to its toxicity to human health and its importance in water quality assessment hardness was assigned 1 the lowest weight as it has no harmful affect to human health who 2017 manganese was assigned with weight of 2 as it has some toxic effect to human health who 2004 iron and sodium were not used during the calculation of dwqi but it is used later to calculated drinking water acceptability weight of each parameter w i was divided by the sum of weight of n parameters to compute the relative weights w i for as mn and hardness equation 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i a quality rating scale qi for each parameter was calculated using the concentration of each parameter c i and the standard concentration of who and bdws si for respective parameter equation 2 2 q i c i s i 100 finally for computing wqi the sub index s i i of each parameter is calculated and aggregated according to equations 3 and 4 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i s i i the computed wqi values were categorized according to ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 into five types excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 101 200 very poor 201 300 and unsuitable 300 for drinking purpose 2 2 irrigation water quality index iwqi irrigation water quality index iwqi 3 3 iwqi irrigation water quality index was calculated using a method developed by meireles et al 2010 and the criteria and standards developed by ayers westcot 1985 water quality parameters that were used to calculate iwqi were arsenic as boron b copper cu iron fe lithium li manganese mn sodium na sodium adsorption ration sar and zinc zn these parameters were selected based on their impact on rice production since irrigation in bangladesh is mostly used for boro rice cultivation ahmad et al 2014 to calculate iwqi a principal component and factor analysis pc fa was conducted to identify the parameters that contribute to most variability in irrigation water quality pc fa is a mathematical procedure that reduces of large number of correlated variables into smaller number of uncorrelated variables and allows an interpretation of the several constituents separately to help find the most relevant parameters that have impacts on water quality meireles et al 2010 then quality measurement value q i and aggregated weights w i were established quality measurement value q i was the quality of each of the parameters and the values of q i were calculated based on the criteria established by ayers and westcot 1985 equation 5 was used to calculate q i based on the tolerance limits shown in table 2 samples exceeding the tolerance limit were placed in the lowest class 0 35 and the samples within acceptable limits were placed in the highest class 85 100 5 q i q i m a x x i j x i n f q i a m p x a m p qimax maximum

of each parameter used to calculate wqi was obtained from principal component and factor analysis pc fa all the factors f1 f5 were aggregated and multiplied by the commonality a of each parameter table 3 the w i values were then normalized such that their sum equals one according to equation 6 6 w i j 1 k f j a i j j 1 k i 1 n f j a i j w i weight of each parameter f factor values or factorial

calculated by the aggregated value of the products of q i and w i using equation 7 7 w q i i 1 n q i w i the iwqi values were classified into 5 types no restriction 85 100 low restriction 70 85 moderate restriction 55 70 high restriction 40 55 and severe restriction 0 40 meireles et al 2010 3 results drinking water quality index based on bdws and who standards and irrigation water quality index has been calculated and analysed for 5537 stw and 916 dtw of bangladesh results for the water quality indices for drinking and irrigation water have been presented in this section 3 1 drinking water quality index dwqi the drinking water quality indices based on bdws and who standards for shallow tube wells and deep tube wells are presented in fig 1 a and b respectively results show that the quality of water for dtws is significantly better compared to the stws for both bdws and who standards in stws samples within the permissible limit wqi 100 excellent and good quality water are in higher proportion then poor very poor and unsuitable water quality fig 1a wqi is better when who standards are used wqi for stw based on who standards have lower percentage of poor and very poor water quality compared to bdws percentage of unsuitable water quality is almost similar for both bdws and who standards fig 1a in dtws samples within the permissible limit are significantly higher for both who and bdws with a slightly higher percentage for who standards compared to stws fig 1b water unsuitable for drinking is slightly higher when who standards are used fig 1b the dwqi for stw based on bdws and who standards shows more or less similar spatial pattern except some locations fig 2 a and b the spatial distribution of dwqi for stws shows a major difference in the northeast and mid northwest part of the country marked in circles fig 2a and b according to bdws the north eastern part of the country black circled has poor and good quality water fig 2a whereas according to who guideline the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water fig 2b in the mid northwest blue and green circled of the country the water quality is very poor poor and unsuitable according to bdws fig 2a but the water quality is good and excellent in the same locations for who standards fig 2b the spatial distribution of dwqi for dtws based on bdws and who standards also have similar patterns with some exceptions fig 2c and d the southern part of the country shows excellent and good quality water for both bdws and who standards however these results might be different from the reality as salinity was not considered during dwqi calculation due to lack data availability according to bahar reza 2010 and nobi and gupta 1997 some parts the south and the coastal belt of bangladesh suffers from severe salinity intrusion a major difference can be seen in the north east of the country black circled after using bdws standard fig 2c the dtws have good and poor quality water whereas after using who standards fig 2d the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water quality another major difference can be seen in the north west of the country blue circled where the water quality is poor and very poor based on bdws but the water quality in the similar places is good and excellent based on who standards 3 2 irrigation water quality index iwqi irrigation water quality indices calculated for shallow and deep tube wells are summarized in fig 3 results show that in general irrigation water quality of dtws is slightly better than stws highest proportion of stws and dtws have moderate restrictions for irrigation more stws have high and severe restrictions for irrigation compared to dtws but the difference is not very significant a significantly higher proportion of dtws have low restrictions compared to stws proportion of tube wells with no restrictions is very low in percentage for both stws and dtws fig 4 a and b shows the spatial distribution of iwqi for stws and dtws respectively results show that iwqis for stws fig 4a have severe and high restriction in the west northwest central southwest and southeast part of the country very few parts in the northeast have low and no restriction and the rest of the stws in the country have moderate restriction on irrigation water quality fig 4a the iwqi of dtws fig 4b shows that the north northwest and southwest part of the country have high and severe restriction on irrigation water quality few parts of southeast and north east also have high restriction some parts of northeast and south of the country have low restrictions and the rest of the dtws have moderate restriction on irrigation water quality only 2 dtws in the north eastern part of the country has no restriction 4 discussion people of bangladesh are heavily dependent on groundwater resource for both drinking and irrigation purposes the presence of high levels of contaminants such as as b fe mn and na has become the limiting factors towards the sustainable use of this critical resource therefore the quality assessment of groundwater resource is crucial for public health and food production in order to assess the overall groundwater quality of bangladesh used for drinking and irrigation purposes wqis were calculated 10 important water quality parameters were used to calculate the wqis for both shallow 150 m and deep 150 m aquifers for the entire country it is important to note that wqi values for drinking purpose were calculated separately considering both bangladesh and who standards this overall water quality assessment may be critical for sustainable water resource management in bangladesh 4 1 comparison between water quality of shallow aquifers and deep aquifers water quality indices of drinking and irrigation water have one similar pattern when it comes to aquifer depth majority of deep tube wells have better water quality than shallow tube wells several studies in bangladesh have shown that arsenic and manganese contaminations in deep aquifers are far less then shallow aquifers kinniburgh and smedley 2001 hug et al 2011 an arsenic and manganese concentration decreases with aquifer depth hug et al 2011 this is why water quality is better for both drinking and irrigation purpose in deep tube wells 4 2 drinking water quality wqis for drinking purpose are significantly better when who standards are considered compared to the wqis when bdws is considered fig 1 this is because wqi reflects an aggregated impact of various water quality parameters ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 meireles et al 2010 thus individual dissolved constituents in the water and their standards have effects on the overall water quality the standard for as in drinking water according to who is 10 Î¼g l whereas it is 50 Î¼g l according to bdws the standard for mn in drinking water according to who is 0 4 mg l whereas it is 0 1 mg l according to bdws the stricter standard set by who for as puts more impact on the wqi values calculated using who standards compared to the wqi values calculated using bdws similarly mn concentration has more impact on wqi when bdws is used arsenic concentration in 1930 out of 5537 stws and 90 out of 916 dtws exceeded who limits 10 Î¼g l manganese concentration in 4140 out of 5537 stws and 234 out of 916 dtws exceeded bdws limits 0 1 mg l who sets a much strict standard for as whereas bangladesh sets a very strict standard for mn a significantly higher number of samples do not meet the bangladesh guideline for mn compared to number of samples that do not meet the who guideline for as this is the reason why groundwater quality for drinking purpose considering the who guideline is much better compared to the water quality considering the bdws fig 1 some discrepancies are observed in the wqi values in stws calculated for similar areas see circles in fig 2 considering bdws and who guidelines locations in blue and green circles show much better water quality when who standards are used compared to the water quality when bdws are considered this is due to the fact that mn concentrations in most of the locations in those areas are 0 3 to 2 5 mg l whereas as concentrations for almost all locations in those areas are within the who guideline value of 10 Î¼g l figs si1a si4b the black circled area shows better water quality when bdws are used compared to the water quality when who standards are considered the locations in black circled area have as concentrations between 30 Î¼g l to 50 Î¼g l and mn concentrations mostly between 0 mg l to 0 3 mg l figs si1a si 4b this is why locations in black circled areas show better water quality when bdws is used compared to the water quality when who standards are used in the dtws excellent and good quality water were found in the southern part of the country for both who standards and bdws however it is important to note that salinity was not taken into account while calculating dwqi as the dataset lacked salinity information according to studies done by baten et al 2015 abedin et al 2012 bahar and reza 2010 and nobi and gupta 1997 the coastal belt of the country suffers from salinity intrusion hence the groundwater in the southern region is saline since salinity was not considered when dwqis were calculated the results might be different from the reality for the southern part of the country therefore it would be safe to mention that the water quality of the southern part of the country is within the permissible limits far as as and mn are concerned similar to stws certain dtws have different results for the same locations when bdws and who standards were used the north east of the country black circled show good and poor quality water after using bdws standard fig 2c whereas after using who standards fig 2d the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water quality another difference can be seen in the north west of the country blue circled where the water quality is poor and very poor based on bdws but the water quality in the similar places is good and excellent based on who standards this is again due the impact stricter as limit for who and stricter mn limit for bdws 4 3 drinking water acceptability in section 3 1 the dwqi of bangladesh has been discussed dwqi was calculated based on water quality parameters that are harmful to health since bangladesh is highly dependent on groundwater for drinking several other factors besides toxicity need to be analysed aesthetics of drinking water is an important factor when it comes to drinking water acceptability along with arsenic and manganese iron sodium and hardness also play an important role when it comes to usage of groundwater for household purposes iron and sodium has severe impacts on appearance taste and odour of drinking water who 2017 high iron concentration in water can make water bitter or an astringent taste iron in domestic water supply can stain laundry and porcelain puri kumar 2012 who 2017 most people do not prefer to drink or use water that is reddish or yellowish in color tastes odd has certain odour and can damage household materials whelton et al 2007 high sodium in water present as nacl impacts water with a salty taste at 250 mg l nacl table salt can cause heart and kidney diseases puri kumar 2012 hardness of water affects the water capacity to precipitate soap forms scales in hot water pipes kitchen devices and water supply facilities puri kumar 2012 malakootian et al 2010 who does not have any drinking water guidelines for iron and sodium but there are guidelines for bangladesh according to bdws the permissible limit for iron is 0 3 1 mg l and for sodium 200 mg l using these standards along with bdws of as mn and hardness another wqi for drinking was calculated for drinking water acceptability using the same method as discussed in section 3 1 the depth wise iron fe distribution map fig si2a si2b shows that majority of the country suffers from iron contamination except for some parts in the northwest west southwest south and centre of the country the wqi for drinking water acceptability is shown in fig 5 separated by depth the wqi considering acceptability of drinking there is a decline in excellent quality water for both stw and dtw and an increase in very poor and unsuitable drinking water for stw and dtw compared to the results of dwqi in section 3 1 the spatial distribution map of dwqi for acceptability separated by depth fig si6 shows that stws have a similarity with the iron distribution map of the country the areas with higher iron concentration have poor very poor and unsuitable drinking water acceptability fig si2a the northwest centre and the southeast part of the country have good and excellent water quality acceptability where iron concentration is low for dtws northwest west and northeast of the country has poor very poor and unsuitable drinking water acceptability areas with higher iron concentration has lower water quality fig si2b the southern south western and eastern part of the country has fairly good and excellent water quality acceptability the south western part of the country shows some similarity between dwqi for acceptability and hardness distribution of the country figs si4a si4b areas with more hard water have poor and very poor quality water 4 4 irrigation water quality irrigation water quality index values were most influenced by b cu na sar and fe as the relative weights of these parameters computed through pc fa were higher than the rest of the parameters table 3 along with the relative weights the iwqi distribution maps also show the impacts of na sar and fe iwqi of stws has many similarities with iron and sodium distribution map fig si3a si5a areas with higher concentrations of sar sodium and iron have high and severe restriction on irrigation water quality for both stw and dtw fig 4 irrigation water quality for dtws is relatively better than stws fig 3 since fe and mn concentrations in dtws are significantly lower compared to that of stws figs si3b si4d higher sar of irrigation water has adverse effect on the water infiltration of soil suarez et al 2006 higher concentration of iron can cause soil acidification and loss of essential phosphorus and molybdenum ayers and westcot 1985 boron deficiency was seen in 5465 stws and 785 dtws which was 85 7 and 98 7 of the samples boron is an essential element for plant growth because it plays an important role in cell wall building and maintenance of other cell functions camacho cristÃ³bal et al 2008 60 4 and 15 5 of stws and dtws respectively exceeded manganese permissible limit high concentration of manganese limits plant growth in acidic soil horst 1988 iron and manganese also has a positive correlation results not shown manganese toxicity is possible in areas with high iron content since iron increases soil acidity 4 5 potential nutrient supplementation from groundwater irrigation the irrigated agriculture in bangladesh began in the early 1970s as part of the green revolution has brought the total irrigated area to 4 2 million ha in 2006 or 30 of the total land area of bangladesh approximately 3 8 million ha or 90 of the total irrigated area uses groundwater badc 2007 groundwater irrigation was seen as the most appropriate approach to develop the country s agricultural sector high yielding varieties hyvs developed by international rice research institute irri and bangladesh rice research institute brri changed the trend of food grain production in the country naher 1997 much of the development and increase in production was due to the boro rice cultivation during dry season with the help of groundwater irrigation naher 1997 the production of boro rice has increased at a rate of 1 95 per year from 1975 to 2005 bbs 2006 to meet demand of a rapidly growing population of bangladesh at 1 6 per year in 2006 boro rice accounted for 53 of the total rice production of 26 5 million metric tons bbs 2006 enabling bangladesh to be self sufficient in food supply heikens et al 2007 boro rice has the highest yield of 3437 kg per ha followed by 2350 kg per ha for aus and 1688 kg per ha for aman bbs 2006 however boro rice requires the most amount of water to irrigate at 1 m per year harvey et al 2006 a lot of nutrients are required for boro rice production the nutrient uptake of plants from soil solution is linked with the soil water status o toole and padilla 1984 tanguilig et al 1987 levin et al 1980 beyrouty et al 1994 high soil moisture content is necessary for increased diffusion rate of nutrient from the soil to the absorbing root surface tanguilig et al 1987 this means nutrients have to be in dissolved form to be absorbed by plant roots the dataset used in this study shows that a considerable amount of different essential nutrient constituents are dissolved in bangladesh groundwater which can be used by rice plants when groundwater is used for irrigation purpose this indicates that the groundwater resource of bangladesh has a great potential to be an alternative to fertilizers that can be used by the plants for their growth if the nutrients dissolved in groundwater can replace the nutrients derive from fertilizers huge amount of money can be saved along with reduced water pollution from agricultural runoff some of the important nutrients required for boro rice production are nitrogen phosphorus zinc potassium and sulphur the current practice is to supply these nutrients to crops through application of fertilizers every year farmers spend a huge amount of money on fertilizers for boro rice production urea nitrogen triple supper phosphate tsp murate of potash mop gypsum and znso4 are the major fertilizers applied in agricultural lands for boro rice basak 2011 the fertilizers that are produced within the country do not meet the demand so private companies import a large portion basak 2011 average dose of fertilizer recommended by basak 2011 and government rates of these fertilizers dae 2015 are shown in table 4 various suppliers import znso4 and their average rate is us 1 95 bangladesh taka bdt 165 per kg islam et al 2015 the farmers usually do not follow the recommended dose of fertilizer they use excess of tsp and mop basak 2011 according to biswas and mandal 1993 approximately 11 500 m 3 per hectare irrigation water is required for one harvest of boro rice according to the recommended dose of fertilizer by basak 2011 and the costs of fertilizer a total of us 67 57 bdt 5728 worth of fertilizer tsp mop and znso4 is required for one harvest of boro rice table 4 it can be assumed that for one harvest of boro rice 11500 m 3 ha irrigation water and us 67 57 bdt 5728 worth of fertilizer is required if the nutrients from the irrigation water are substituted for some of the fertilizers farmers can save from us 0 41 bdt 35 to us 67 57 bdt 5728 that is 0 6 up to 100 of the fertilizer cost the average savings could be us 12 61 bdt 1069 19 of the fertilizer cost required for one harvest bangladesh is a lower middle income country with a gross national income per capita 4040 per year world bank international comparison program database and 45 1 of the total population is involved in agriculture sector bbs 2015 the average us 12 61 bdt 1069 savings on fertilizers is ample amount of savings for the low income farmers 4 6 impact of irrigation water quality on boro rice yield irrigation plays an important role in production of boro rice therefore quality of irrigation water is also vital for proper and high yield of crops in section 3 2 the irrigation water quality index iwqi of 5537 stws and 916 dtws that covered 64 districts and 543 upazilas sub districts of the country was calculated using these iwqi this study tried to see how irrigation water quality impacts the yield of boro rice of 317 upazilas note that boro rice yield data was collected from bangladesh bureau of statistics personal communications the mean iwqi of each upazila are plotted against the boro rice yield data of each upazila for the year 2009 fig 6 it is also important to note that the water quality data from bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 are from the year 2009 and the water quality data from bgs and dphe 2001 are from the year 1999 fig 6 shows a positive correlation between rice yield and iwqi the regression line is sloped upwards with a very low r2 value of 0 00267 a major reason behind this could be the iwqi values used to determine the correlation between rice yield and irrigation water quality the rice yield data were given for each of the upazilas whereas iwqi values were calculated for each of the mauzas village for the comparison the mean iwqi values were calculated for the mauzas of each upazila the calculated mean iwqi values for each upazilas were then compared with rice yield 5 conclusion groundwater quality of bangladesh was assessed to determine the suitability usability and applicability of groundwater in bangladesh for drinking and irrigation purposes based on water quality index water quality index wqi reflects the aggregated impact of various water quality parameters which enables the assessment of overall water quality of a region publicly available water quality data of 6453 tube wells from the british geological survey bgs department of public health engineering dphe bgs and dphe 2001 and unicef bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 were used to calculate the wqi values for bangladesh groundwater wqi was calculated separately for drinking and irrigation water and for both shallow tube wells depth 150 m and deep tube wells depth 150 m drinking water quality indices were calculated based on both bdws and who standards and results were compared it has been found that majority of deep tube wells have better water quality than shallow tube wells due to lower concentrations of as and mn in the deep tube well compared to shallow tube wells the results also revealed that 40 4 stws 150 m and 88 7 dtws 150 m have safe drinking water according to bdws 57 6 stws and 90 dtws has safe drinking water based on who drinking water standards this is because a significantly higher number of samples exceeded the bangladesh guideline for mn compared to number of samples exceeded the who guideline for as the northeast northwest southeast and a portion in the southern part of the country had better quality water for stw and dtw irrigation water quality indices show that 8 1 stws and 23 1 dtws have safe water quality water quality in the southern south eastern and north eastern part of the country has been found to be safe for irrigation some of the dissolved constituents in the groundwater of bangladesh can potentially be great source of nutrients supplements required for plant growth if the nutrients dissolved in groundwater replace the nutrients in fertilizers needed for plant growth an average of us 12 61 bdt 1069 could be saved which is approximately 19 of the total fertilizer cost the results of this study may provide guidelines towards better planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources that can help communities to access safer drinking and irrigation water in future acknowledgments

and food production in bangladesh excessive concentration of various chemical constituents such as arsenic manganese iron and other toxic elements contaminate groundwater that are generally induced by natural processes and anthropogenic activities alam et al 2002 hasan and ali 2010 saha et al 2018 arsenic accumulation in blood over a long period of time can cause cancer and skin diseases and high manganese intake can cause motor neuron diseases muscle tremor and mental disturbance who 2004 who 2017 irrigation with arsenic contaminated groundwater can lead to arsenic accumulation in soils and crops which eventually reduces yield up to 66 rice yield reduction has been reported in bangladesh panaullah et al 2009 presence of excess dissolved na can lead to higher sodium adsorption ratio sar of soil highly contaminated irrigation water can cause changes in soil permeability soil ph soil structure and nutrient uptake by plants suarez et al 2006 ayers and westcot 1985 even though iron does not pose any health risks unless it exceeds 200 mg l and at the levels consumed while drinking it degrades the aesthetics of water deteriorates garments and household items and may damage pipes and irrigation systems who 2017 groundwater resources are high in contaminants as well as nutrients as mentioned above groundwater plays an important role in rice production of bangladesh every year a substantial amount of money goes into rice production which includes irrigation systems fertilizers and pesticides farmers have to spend around us 67 57 bdt 5728 on fertilizers for one harvest biswas and mandal 1993 basak 2011 several studies have linked soil water status with nutrient uptake of plants from soil solution levin et al 1980 o toole and padilla 1984 tanguilig et al 1987 beyrouty et al 1994 high soil moisture content is necessary for increased diffusion rate of nutrient from the soil to the absorbing root surface tanguilig et al 1987 which means nutrients have to be in dissolved form to be absorbed by plant roots if the nutrients from groundwater can replace the nutrients from fertilizers it will be more financially efficient along with reduced water pollution from agricultural runoff groundwater quality assessment is vital to determine safe and suitable groundwater sources of the country several studies have been conducted on arsenic manganese and iron contamination alam et al 2002 bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 hasan and ali 2010 saha et al 2018 however not many studies have been conducted on assessing the groundwater quality at a large scale a suitability analysis can be conducted to calculate quality indices which depend on the weighted combination of the water quality parameters for example widely used water quality index wqi is a rating that reflects the aggregated impact of various water quality parameters ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 meireles et al 2010 wqi has been previously used in bangladesh in a smaller geographic scale by akter et al 2016 to assess the water quality in 12 upazilas and by saha et al 2018 to assess groundwater quality of tala upazila in sathkhira the objectives of this study are as follows 1 assess the groundwater quality of bangladesh to determine the suitability and usability of groundwater in bangladesh for drinking and irrigation purposes based on water quality index 2 analyse the impact of irrigation water quality on rice yield specifically dry season crop oryza sativa commonly known as boro rice 3 assess the potential for nutrient supplementation by groundwater for boro rice plants and how much cost of fertilizer can be saved if groundwater acts as nutrient supplementation 2 methods to conduct this analysis a database was compiled using publicly available water quality data of 6453 tube wells from the british geological survey bgs department of public health engineering dphe bgs and dphe 2001 and unicef bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 that covers the whole geographic region of bangladesh the database contains a number of chemical water quality parameters such as arsenic aluminium boron barium calcium chromium copper hardness iron lithium magnesium manganese potassium phosphorus sodium sulphate and zinc required for wqi calculation wqi was calculated separately for drinking and irrigation water and for both shallow tube wells stw depth 150 m and deep tube wells dtw depth 150 m saha et al 2018 ahmed et al 2004 bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 bgs and dphe 2001 out of the 6453 samples 5537 were stw and 916 were dtw the datasets lacked few parameters such as salinity ec tds bicarbonate and chloride along with the biological parameters like total coliform e coli faecal coliform etc that were required to assess water quality index precisely the parameters used in this study are the chemical parameters that are naturally present in groundwater and have adverse effects on human health and food production 2 1 drinking water quality index dwqi drinking water quality index dwqi 1 1 dwqi drinking water quality index was calculated based on a method developed by ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the parameters used for dwqi calculation were arsenic as iron fe manganese mn sodium na and hardness according to who 2017 only two of the parameters as and mn have severe health effects however all the five parameters play an important role in the acceptability of drinking water in bangladesh fe na and hardness affect the taste color and usability of water who 2017 dwqi was calculated using both who and bangladesh drinking water standards bdws 2 2 bdws bangladesh drinking water standard table 1 who guideline values for hardness and mn are based on who 2004 who excluded these parameters from the list of health based standard for naturally occurring chemicals since 2011 who 2011 however frisbie et al 2012 argued that mn should be reintroduced in the list because many countries have mn 0 4 mg l in drinking water groundwater hardness in many areas in bangladesh are also very high therefore the 2004 who guideline values for hardness and mn were used to calculate wqis in for exploratory purpose in order to calculate dwqi each of the parameters was assigned with a weight w i according to its relative impact on the overall quality of water for drinking purpose table si1 the highest weight of 5 was assigned to arsenic due to its toxicity to human health and its importance in water quality assessment hardness was assigned 1 the lowest weight as it has no harmful affect to human health who 2017 manganese was assigned with weight of 2 as it has some toxic effect to human health who 2004 iron and sodium were not used during the calculation of dwqi but it is used later to calculated drinking water acceptability weight of each parameter w i was divided by the sum of weight of n parameters to compute the relative weights w i for as mn and hardness equation 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i a quality rating scale qi for each parameter was calculated using the concentration of each parameter c i and the standard concentration of who and bdws si for respective parameter equation 2 2 q i c i s i 100 finally for computing wqi the sub index s i i of each parameter is calculated and aggregated according to equations 3 and 4 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i s i i the computed wqi values were categorized according to ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 into five types excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 101 200 very poor 201 300 and unsuitable 300 for drinking purpose 2 2 irrigation water quality index iwqi irrigation water quality index iwqi 3 3 iwqi irrigation water quality index was calculated using a method developed by meireles et al 2010 and the criteria and standards developed by ayers westcot 1985 water quality parameters that were used to calculate iwqi were arsenic as boron b copper cu iron fe lithium li manganese mn sodium na sodium adsorption ration sar and zinc zn these parameters were selected based on their impact on rice production since irrigation in bangladesh is mostly used for boro rice cultivation ahmad et al 2014 to calculate iwqi a principal component and factor analysis pc fa was conducted to identify the parameters that contribute to most variability in irrigation water quality pc fa is a mathematical procedure that reduces of large number of correlated variables into smaller number of uncorrelated variables and allows an interpretation of the several constituents separately to help find the most relevant parameters that have impacts on water quality meireles et al 2010 then quality measurement value q i and aggregated weights w i were established quality measurement value q i was the quality of each of the parameters and the values of q i were calculated based on the criteria established by ayers and westcot 1985 equation 5 was used to calculate q i based on the tolerance limits shown in table 2 samples exceeding the tolerance limit were placed in the lowest class 0 35 and the samples within acceptable limits were placed in the highest class 85 100 5 q i q i m a x x i j x i n f q i a m p x a m p qimax maximum

of each parameter used to calculate wqi was obtained from principal component and factor analysis pc fa all the factors f1 f5 were aggregated and multiplied by the commonality a of each parameter

calculated by the aggregated value of the products of q i and w i using equation 7 7 w q i i 1 n q i w i the iwqi values were classified into 5 types no restriction 85 100 low restriction 70 85 moderate restriction 55 70 high restriction 40 55 and severe restriction 0 40 meireles et al 2010 3 results drinking water quality index based on bdws and who standards and irrigation water quality index has been calculated and analysed for 5537 stw and 916 dtw of bangladesh results for the water quality indices for drinking and irrigation water have been presented in this section 3 1 drinking water quality index dwqi the drinking water quality indices based on bdws and who standards for shallow tube wells and deep tube wells are presented in fig 1 a and b respectively results show that the quality of water for dtws is significantly better compared to the stws for both bdws and who standards in stws samples within the permissible limit wqi 100 excellent and good quality water are in higher proportion then poor very poor and unsuitable water quality fig 1a wqi is better when who standards are used wqi for stw based on who standards have lower percentage of poor and very poor water quality compared to bdws percentage of unsuitable water quality is almost similar for both bdws and who standards fig 1a in dtws samples within the permissible limit are significantly higher for both who and bdws with a slightly higher percentage for who standards compared to stws fig 1b water unsuitable for drinking is slightly higher when who standards are used fig 1b the dwqi for stw based on bdws and who standards shows more or less similar spatial pattern except some locations fig 2 a and b the spatial distribution of dwqi for stws shows a major difference in the northeast and mid northwest part of the country marked in circles fig 2a and b according to bdws the north eastern part of the country black circled has poor and good quality water fig 2a whereas according to who guideline the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water fig 2b in the mid northwest blue and green circled of the country the water quality is very poor poor and unsuitable according to bdws fig 2a but the water quality is good and excellent in the same locations for who standards fig 2b the spatial distribution of dwqi for dtws based on bdws and who standards also have similar patterns with some exceptions fig 2c and d the southern part of the country shows excellent and good quality water for both bdws and who standards however these results might be different from the reality as salinity was not considered during dwqi calculation due to lack data availability according to bahar reza 2010 and nobi and gupta 1997 some parts the south and the coastal belt of bangladesh suffers from severe salinity intrusion a major difference can be seen in the north east of the country black circled after using bdws standard fig 2c the dtws have good and poor quality water whereas after using who standards fig 2d the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water quality another major difference can be seen in the north west of the country blue circled where the water quality is poor and very poor based on bdws but the water quality in the similar places is good and excellent based on who standards 3 2 irrigation water quality index iwqi irrigation water quality indices calculated for shallow and deep tube wells are summarized in fig 3 results show that in general irrigation water quality of dtws is slightly better than stws highest proportion of stws and dtws have moderate restrictions for irrigation more stws have high and severe restrictions for irrigation compared to dtws but the difference is not very significant a significantly higher proportion of dtws have low restrictions compared to stws proportion of tube wells with no restrictions is very low in percentage for both stws and dtws fig 4 a and b shows the spatial distribution of iwqi for stws and dtws respectively results show that iwqis for stws fig 4a have severe and high restriction in the west northwest central southwest and southeast part of the country very few parts in the northeast have low and no restriction and the rest of the stws in the country have moderate restriction on irrigation water quality fig 4a the iwqi of dtws fig 4b shows that the north northwest and southwest part of the country have high and severe restriction on irrigation water quality few parts of southeast and north east also have high restriction some parts of northeast and south of the country have low restrictions and the rest of the dtws have moderate restriction on irrigation water quality only 2 dtws in the north eastern part of the country has no restriction 4 discussion people of bangladesh are heavily dependent on groundwater resource for both drinking and irrigation purposes the presence of high levels of contaminants such as as b fe mn and na has become the limiting factors towards the sustainable use of this critical resource therefore the quality assessment of groundwater resource is crucial for public health and food production in order to assess the overall groundwater quality of bangladesh used for drinking and irrigation purposes wqis were calculated 10 important water quality parameters were used to calculate the wqis for both shallow 150 m and deep 150 m aquifers for the entire country it is important to note that wqi values for drinking purpose were calculated separately considering both bangladesh and who standards this overall water quality assessment may be critical for sustainable water resource management in bangladesh 4 1 comparison between water quality of shallow aquifers and deep aquifers water quality indices of drinking and irrigation water have one similar pattern when it comes to aquifer depth majority of deep tube wells have better water quality than shallow tube wells several studies in bangladesh have shown that arsenic and manganese contaminations in deep aquifers are far less then shallow aquifers kinniburgh and smedley 2001 hug et al 2011 an arsenic and manganese concentration decreases with aquifer depth hug et al 2011 this is why water quality is better for both drinking and irrigation purpose in deep tube wells 4 2 drinking water quality wqis for drinking purpose are significantly better when who standards are considered compared to the wqis when bdws is considered fig 1 this is because wqi reflects an aggregated impact of various water quality parameters ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 meireles et al 2010 thus individual dissolved constituents in the water and their standards have effects on the overall water quality the standard for as in drinking water according to who is 10 Î¼g l whereas it is 50 Î¼g l according to bdws the standard for mn in drinking water according to who is 0 4 mg l whereas it is 0 1 mg l according to bdws the stricter standard set by who for as puts more impact on the wqi values calculated using who standards compared to the wqi values calculated using bdws similarly mn concentration has more impact on wqi when bdws is used arsenic concentration in 1930 out of 5537 stws and 90 out of 916 dtws exceeded who limits 10 Î¼g l manganese concentration in 4140 out of 5537 stws and 234 out of 916 dtws exceeded bdws limits 0 1 mg l who sets a much strict standard for as whereas bangladesh sets a very strict standard for mn a significantly higher number of samples do not meet the bangladesh guideline for mn compared to number of samples that do not meet the who guideline for as this is the reason why groundwater quality for drinking purpose considering the who guideline is much better compared to the water quality considering the bdws fig 1 some discrepancies are observed in the wqi values in stws calculated for similar areas see circles in fig 2 considering bdws and who guidelines locations in blue and green circles show much better water quality when who standards are used compared to the water quality when bdws are considered this is due to the fact that mn concentrations in most of the locations in those areas are 0 3 to 2 5 mg l whereas as concentrations for almost all locations in those areas are within the who guideline value of 10 Î¼g l figs si1a si4b the black circled area shows better water quality when bdws are used compared to the water quality when who standards are considered the locations in black circled area have as concentrations between 30 Î¼g l to 50 Î¼g l and mn concentrations mostly between 0 mg l to 0 3 mg l figs si1a si 4b this is why locations in black circled areas show better water quality when bdws is used compared to the water quality when who standards are used in the dtws excellent and good quality water were found in the southern part of the country for both who standards and bdws however it is important to note that salinity was not taken into account while calculating dwqi as the dataset lacked salinity information according to studies done by baten et al 2015 abedin et al 2012 bahar and reza 2010 and nobi and gupta 1997 the coastal belt of the country suffers from salinity intrusion hence the groundwater in the southern region is saline since salinity was not considered when dwqis were calculated the results might be different from the reality for the southern part of the country therefore it would be safe to mention that the water quality of the southern part of the country is within the permissible limits far as as and mn are concerned similar to stws certain dtws have different results for the same locations when bdws and who standards were used the north east of the country black circled show good and poor quality water after using bdws standard fig 2c whereas after using who standards fig 2d the same locations have very poor and unsuitable drinking water quality another difference can be seen in the north west of the country blue circled where the water quality is poor and very poor based on bdws but the water quality in the similar places is good and excellent based on who standards this is again due the impact stricter as limit for who and stricter mn limit for bdws 4 3 drinking water acceptability in section 3 1 the dwqi of bangladesh has been discussed dwqi was calculated based on water quality parameters that are harmful to health since bangladesh is highly dependent on groundwater for drinking several other factors besides toxicity need to be analysed aesthetics of drinking water is an important factor when it comes to drinking water acceptability along with arsenic and manganese iron sodium and hardness also play an important role when it comes to usage of groundwater for household purposes iron and sodium has severe impacts on appearance taste and odour of drinking water who 2017 high iron concentration in water can make water bitter or an astringent taste iron in domestic water supply can stain laundry and porcelain puri kumar 2012 who 2017 most people do not prefer to drink or use water that is reddish or yellowish in color tastes odd has certain odour and can damage household materials whelton et al 2007 high sodium in water present as nacl impacts water with a salty taste at 250 mg l nacl table salt can cause heart and kidney diseases puri kumar 2012 hardness of water affects the water capacity to precipitate soap forms scales in hot water pipes kitchen devices and water supply facilities puri kumar 2012 malakootian et al 2010 who does not have any drinking water guidelines for iron and sodium but there are guidelines for bangladesh according to bdws the permissible limit for iron is 0 3 1 mg l and for sodium 200 mg l using these standards along with bdws of as mn and hardness another wqi for drinking was calculated for drinking water acceptability using the same method as discussed in section 3 1 the depth wise iron fe distribution map fig si2a si2b shows that majority of the country suffers from iron contamination except for some parts in the northwest west southwest south and centre of the country the wqi for drinking water acceptability is shown in fig 5 separated by depth the wqi considering acceptability of drinking there is a decline in excellent quality water for both stw and dtw and an increase in very poor and unsuitable drinking water for stw and dtw compared to the results of dwqi in section 3 1 the spatial distribution map of dwqi for acceptability separated by depth fig si6 shows that stws have a similarity with the iron distribution map of the country the areas with higher iron concentration have poor very poor and unsuitable drinking water acceptability fig si2a the northwest centre and the southeast part of the country have good and excellent water quality acceptability where iron concentration is low for dtws northwest west and northeast of the country has poor very poor and unsuitable drinking water acceptability areas with higher iron concentration has lower water quality fig si2b the southern south western and eastern part of the country has fairly good and excellent water quality acceptability the south western part of the country shows some similarity between dwqi for acceptability and hardness distribution of the country figs si4a si4b areas with more hard water have poor and very poor quality water 4 4 irrigation water quality irrigation water quality index values were most influenced by b cu na sar and fe as the relative weights of these parameters computed through pc fa were higher than the rest of the parameters table 3 along with the relative weights the iwqi distribution maps also show the impacts of na sar and fe iwqi of stws has many similarities with iron and sodium distribution map fig si3a si5a areas with higher concentrations of sar sodium and iron have high and severe restriction on irrigation water quality for both stw and dtw fig 4 irrigation water quality for dtws is relatively better than stws fig 3 since fe and mn concentrations in dtws are significantly lower compared to that of stws figs si3b si4d higher sar of irrigation water has adverse effect on the water infiltration of soil suarez et al 2006 higher concentration of iron can cause soil acidification and loss of essential phosphorus and molybdenum ayers and westcot 1985 boron deficiency was seen in 5465 stws and 785 dtws which was 85 7 and 98 7 of the samples boron is an essential element for plant growth because it plays an important role in cell wall building and maintenance of other cell functions camacho cristÃ³bal et al 2008 60 4 and 15 5 of stws and dtws respectively exceeded manganese permissible limit high concentration of manganese limits plant growth in acidic soil horst 1988 iron and manganese also has a positive correlation results not shown manganese toxicity is possible in areas with high iron content since iron increases soil acidity 4 5 potential nutrient supplementation from groundwater irrigation the irrigated agriculture in bangladesh began in the early 1970s as part of the green revolution has brought the total irrigated area to 4 2 million ha in 2006 or 30 of the total land area of bangladesh approximately 3 8 million ha or 90 of the total irrigated area uses groundwater badc 2007 groundwater irrigation was seen as the most appropriate approach to develop the country s agricultural sector high yielding varieties hyvs developed by international rice research institute irri and bangladesh rice research institute brri changed the trend of food grain production in the country naher 1997 much of the development and increase in production was due to the boro rice cultivation during dry season with the help of groundwater irrigation naher 1997 the production of boro rice has increased at a rate of 1 95 per year from 1975 to 2005 bbs 2006 to meet demand of a rapidly growing population of bangladesh at 1 6 per year in 2006 boro rice accounted for 53 of the total rice production of 26 5 million metric tons bbs 2006 enabling bangladesh to be self sufficient in food supply heikens et al 2007 boro rice has the highest yield of 3437 kg per ha followed by 2350 kg per ha for aus and 1688 kg per ha for aman bbs 2006 however boro rice requires the most amount of water to irrigate at 1 m per year harvey et al 2006 a lot of nutrients are required for boro rice production the nutrient uptake of plants from soil solution is linked with the soil water status o toole and padilla 1984 tanguilig et al 1987 levin et al 1980 beyrouty et al 1994 high soil moisture content is necessary for increased diffusion rate of nutrient from the soil to the absorbing root surface tanguilig et al 1987 this means nutrients have to be in dissolved form to be absorbed by plant roots the dataset used in this study shows that a considerable amount of different essential nutrient constituents are dissolved in bangladesh groundwater which can be used by rice plants when groundwater is used for irrigation purpose this indicates that the groundwater resource of bangladesh has a great potential to be an alternative to fertilizers that can be used by the plants for their growth if the nutrients dissolved in groundwater can replace the nutrients derive from fertilizers huge amount of money can be saved along with reduced water pollution from agricultural runoff some of the important nutrients required for boro rice production are nitrogen phosphorus zinc potassium and sulphur the current practice is to supply these nutrients to crops through application of fertilizers every year farmers spend a huge amount of money on fertilizers for boro rice production urea nitrogen triple supper phosphate tsp murate of potash mop gypsum and znso4 are the major fertilizers applied in agricultural lands for boro rice basak 2011 the fertilizers that are produced within the country do not meet the demand so private companies import a large portion basak 2011 average dose of fertilizer recommended by basak 2011 and government rates of these fertilizers dae 2015 are shown in table 4 various suppliers import znso4 and their average rate is us 1 95 bangladesh taka bdt 165 per kg islam et al 2015 the farmers usually do not follow the recommended dose of fertilizer they use excess of tsp and mop basak 2011 according to biswas and mandal 1993 approximately 11 500 m 3 per hectare irrigation water is required for one harvest of boro rice according to the recommended dose of fertilizer by basak 2011 and the costs of fertilizer a total of us 67 57 bdt 5728 worth of fertilizer tsp mop and znso4 is required for one harvest of boro rice table 4 it can be assumed that for one harvest of boro rice 11500 m 3 ha irrigation water and us 67 57 bdt 5728 worth of fertilizer is required if the nutrients from the irrigation water are substituted for some of the fertilizers farmers can save from us 0 41 bdt 35 to us 67 57 bdt 5728 that is 0 6 up to 100 of the fertilizer cost the average savings could be us 12 61 bdt 1069 19 of the fertilizer cost required for one harvest bangladesh is a lower middle income country with a gross national income per capita 4040 per year world bank international comparison program database and 45 1 of the total population is involved in agriculture sector bbs 2015 the average us 12 61 bdt 1069 savings on fertilizers is ample amount of savings for the low income farmers 4 6 impact of irrigation water quality on boro rice yield irrigation plays an important role in production of boro rice therefore quality of irrigation water is also vital for proper and high yield of crops in section 3 2 the irrigation water quality index iwqi of 5537 stws and 916 dtws that covered 64 districts and 543 upazilas sub districts of the country was calculated using these iwqi this study tried to see how irrigation water quality impacts the yield of boro rice of 317 upazilas note that boro rice yield data was collected from bangladesh bureau of statistics personal communications the mean iwqi of each upazila are plotted against the boro rice yield data of each upazila for the year 2009 fig 6 it is also important to note that the water quality data from bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 are from the year 2009 and the water quality data from bgs and dphe 2001 are from the year 1999 fig 6 shows a positive correlation between rice yield and iwqi the regression line is sloped upwards with a very low r2 value of 0 00267 a major reason behind this could be the iwqi values used to determine the correlation between rice yield and irrigation water quality the rice yield data were given for each of the upazilas whereas iwqi values were calculated for each of the mauzas village for the comparison the mean iwqi values were calculated for the mauzas of each upazila the calculated mean iwqi values for each upazilas were then compared with rice yield 5 conclusion groundwater quality of bangladesh was assessed to determine the suitability usability and applicability of groundwater in bangladesh for drinking and irrigation purposes based on water quality index water quality index wqi reflects the aggregated impact of various water quality parameters which enables the assessment of overall water quality of a region publicly available water quality data of 6453 tube wells from the british geological survey bgs department of public health engineering dphe bgs and dphe 2001 and unicef bangladesh national drinking water quality survey 2009 were used to calculate the wqi values for bangladesh groundwater wqi was calculated separately for drinking and irrigation water and for both shallow tube wells depth 150 m and deep tube wells depth 150 m drinking water quality indices were calculated based on both bdws and who standards and results were compared it has been found that majority of deep tube wells have better water quality than shallow tube wells due to lower concentrations of as and mn in the deep tube well compared to shallow tube wells the results also revealed that 40 4 stws 150 m and 88 7 dtws 150 m have safe drinking water according to bdws 57 6 stws and 90 dtws has safe drinking water based on who drinking water standards this is because a significantly higher number of samples exceeded the bangladesh guideline for mn compared to number of samples exceeded the who guideline for as the northeast northwest southeast and a portion in the southern part of the country had better quality water for stw and dtw irrigation water quality indices show that 8 1 stws and 23 1 dtws have safe water quality water quality in the southern south eastern and north eastern part of the country has been found to be safe for irrigation some of the dissolved constituents in the groundwater of bangladesh can potentially be great source of nutrients supplements required for plant growth if the nutrients dissolved in groundwater replace the nutrients in fertilizers needed for plant growth an average of us 12 61 bdt 1069 could be saved which is approximately 19 of the total fertilizer cost the results of this study may provide guidelines towards better planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources that can help communities to access safer drinking and irrigation water in future acknowledgments

12192,egypt announced a nuclear power program to secure and diversify the country s energy supply the radiation risks to workers public and to the environment that may arise from these applications have to be assessed and if necessary controlled the radioactivity concentration of groundwater has been predicted for 50 years after a postulated accident at a proposed nuclear power reactor at el negila northwestern coast of egypt the accident is assumed to be resulting from a loss of coolant accident loca of a 1000 mwe nuclear power reactor of the pressurized water type the radioactive releases were estimated and a conservative estimate of dispersion in air and the consequent contaminant transport of radioactive pollutants through groundwater around the reactor were modeled of greatest interest in terms of long term radiation contamination hazard of the surface are 137cs and 90sr isotopes as their radiological significance increased with time the analysis results from rascal code are used as the input data to modflow mt3d model to predict radioactive contamination of groundwater for 50 years of simulation two scenarios for groundwater dispersion are assumed the 1stscenario considered no pumping while the second scenario assumes stressing of the system through pumping wells the results of groundwater modeling show that the radioactive concentration of 137cs and 90sr were higher at the point source location of the released source term compared to who limits on drinking water borne radionuclides and decreased in all directions during 50 years of simulation indicating radionuclides retention in the aquifer matrix taking into consideration that 90sr was retained more than 137cs applying the 2nd scenario revealed that still low concentrations appear in a pumping well at the coast for both 137cs and 90sr due to the fact that several factors affect the dispersion in groundwater half life time dispersion adsorption desorption graphical abstract image 1

fossil fuels decline plans for investment in renewable energy sources has been the focal point of economic and political summits for the last decade although energy sources such as solar wind and hydro are frequently talked about they do not match up to energy demands even collectively therefore many nations especially developing countries have turned to nuclear energy to serve as a source for electricity generation at a low cost according to the international atomic energy agency iaea power reactors information system pris 2019 there were 450 nuclear power reactors in operation and 55 under construction in 30 countries as of 12 april 2019 egypt is embarking an ambitious nuclear power generating program for the purpose of diversifying its electric energy generating sources egyptian strategy is based on meeting the ever increasing demand for electricity with a high degree of reliability and sustainability in addition to defining follow up energy efficiency programs in the

el shazly 1964 1972 el senoussi and shata 1969 el shamy 1968 selim 1969 taha 1973 and raslan 1995 the land form of the northwestern coastal zone is classified according to raslan 1995 into four categories these are coastal plain piedmont plain structural plateau and hydrographic basin the coastal plain varies from a few meters to some kilometers along the mediterranean coast which include beaches coastal dunes coastal depressions salt marshes and sabakha inland dunes and inland ridges the piedmont plain is occupied by thick calcareous soils of fine deposits resulting from the alluvial deposits of the many wadis the structural plateau acts as a major catchment area feeding the drainage line during winter time fig 2 finally the hydrographic basins in the study area are given as a rectangular pattern where the lithology is affected by jointing linear structural fractures and faulting that cause the streams to be perpendicular to each other also parallel pattern of hydrographic basin is found in the study area where the area is characterized by parallel topographic features folds or faults where the cliff of the plateau protrudes directly to the coast carrying with it short small wadis parallel to each other such as abu hesha el haloba el tawiela el enthely el shebiti and wakal geologically the northwestern coastal zone has been previously studied by many authors shata

2 input data to rascal code 3 2 1 accident source term st estimation rascal which stands for radiological assessment system for consequence analysis is the software developed and used by the u s nuclear regulatory commission nrc emergency operations center to evaluate atmospheric releases during nuclear power plants accidents the most important module of rascal concerning the estimation of a time dependent source term is the source term to dose module which is largely based on the accumulated us experience on pwrs and bwrs as described in mckenna and glitter 1988 and soffer et al 1995 the source term to dose model will first generate a time dependent source term this is the release rate for each radionuclide from the facility as a function of time this time dependent release rate the source term then provides the input to an atmospheric dispersion and transport model the atmospheric dispersion and transport model estimates radionuclide concentrations downwind both in the air and on the ground due to deposition the calculated concentrations are used to estimate projected doses the study assumed a hypothetical npp accident as a source term scenario with relevant parameters plant conditions core inventory containment failure mode effective release height the time that radioactivity release begins and duration of the release the source term used is assumed to be resulting from a loss of coolant accident condition of a 1000 mwe nuclear power reactor of the pressurized water type soffer et al 1995 containment by pass was considered as the release pathway as shown in fig 7 radioactivity releases are usually defined in severe accident source terms as the fractional release of the core inventory the release time considered is up to 48 h with the plume treated as being released at a constant rate and the meteorological conditions are also treated as constant the reactor safety study identified and quantified the contribution to off site radiological risks of accident sequences at pressurized water reactors pwrs in which the release of fission products may be released by bypassing the containment building containment bypass sequence risks constitute a large fraction of the total pressurized water reactor pwr in large part because estimates of competing risks from early containment failures have been greatly reduced since wash 1400 usnrc 1975 3 2 2 atmospheric dispersion and estimation of radionuclides concentration for this study we assumed that all radionuclides having been released to the atmosphere were deposited in precipitation forms on the ground surface of greatest interest in terms of radiation contamination hazard of the surface is 137cs and 90sr because the radiological significance of cesium represented by cs 137 and strontium sr 90 radionuclides was initially small but their importance increased with time becoming by far more important one year after the accident especially at the larger distances de cort et al 1998 the dispersion simulation estimates how radionuclide materials distribute along the exposure path dispersion estimates must be implemented in order to describe the distribution of radionuclide concentration at a point of interest to estimate the distribution of the radionuclide spread during npp accidents dispersion estimates are determined by using straight line gaussian plume models the calculation is done using source term to dose module of rascal code ramsdell et al 2012 rascal calculates the deposition of particles using the dry and wet deposition models used in mesorad ramsdell et al 1988 the activity deposited each time step is the product of the total deposition rate and the time step duration rascal calculates wet deposition of particles and gases using a washout model with washout coefficients that are only a function of precipitation type and a qualitative measure of intensity the model calculates the time integrated air concentration and surface deposition of airborne contaminants to the ground concentrations of radionuclides in the atmosphere are further used for estimating the doses to the environment and the public downwind the release point 3 2 3 meteorological data meteorological data are needed to model the behavior of the radioactive plume in the atmosphere the minimum required data is wind speed and direction defines the downwind transport atmospheric stability governs plume horizontal and vertical growth precipitation defines wet deposition a very important removal process the prevailing wind direction is of primary importance in determining the long spatial distribution of emitted pollutants wind speed also affects plume dispersion and therefore resultant ambient air concentration by increasing the initial dilution of pollutants or inhibiting plume rise wind direction and wind speed have opposing consequences for ambient air concentrations at ground level strong winds provide a good dispersion of the atmospheric pollutants while calm weather leads to poor dispersion and therefore an increased risk for the population one full year 2011 meteorological data for the study area was taken from the weather underground website weather underground 2019 the wind rose was created in this work using wrplot view software michael et al 2019 the wind rose reflects the predominant wind direction and the frequencies distribution of wind speed for all wind direction as shown in figures 8a and 8b rascal requires the initial weather data to be entered within a period of 2 h before the start of the release november 27 2011 weather data with high intensity rain as shown in fig 9 was employed in this study for the analysis of the nuclear accident the meteorological conditions determine where the material goes the concentrations in the environment and how fast it deposits on surfaces the meteorological data entered for the scenario are presented in table 1 3 3 usgs modflow 2000 computer code the usgs modflow computer code was used to build a three dimensional model of subsurface water flow the model describes ground water flow under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous and anisotropic medium according to equation 1 bear 1979 bear and verruijt 1987 the model is capable of simulating the time dependent flow as well as mass and heat transport the time dependent data which are included in the finite difference model fdm has to be stored outside into a database or gis systems the governing equations are derived through combination between the water balance equation and darcy s law anderson and woessner 1992 the model describes groundwater flow of constant density under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous and anisotropic medium according to the following equation which was solved using the finite difference technique 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes lt l h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume and represents sources and or sinks of water t ss is the specific storage of the porous material l l and t is time t in general ss kxx kyy and kzz may be functions of space ss ss x y z kxx kxx x y z etc and w may be a function of space and time w w x y z t moreover due to the hydrodynamic dispersion the concentration of a solute will decrease over distance generally speaking the solute will spread more in the direction of groundwater flow than in the direction normal to the groundwater flow because longitudinal dispersivity is typically 10 times higher than transverse dispersivities the transport of a conservative solute in a one dimensional system can be described by the advection dispersion equation 2 2 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where c t is the change in concentration over time the first term on the right hand side represents advection and the second term represents hydrodynamic dispersion the advection dispersion equation may be solved analytically or numerically under different initial and boundary conditions mt3dms was used to predict heavy metal transport using lead as the surrogate this engine is the best choice when biodegradation is not a factor when dealing with heavy metals that are persistent prommer et al 2002 the adsorption coefficients were also most appropriate with the mt3dms engine with heavy metal only having one oxidation state the model was run for numerous iterations and outputs were recorded at different time intervals to show the size and extent of the heavy metal plume 3 3 1 model discretization the hydrogeological data were implemented by means of modflow code harbaugh et al 2000 to develop the model in el negila area as shown in fig 10 the model encompasses an area of about 2457 km2 the grid consists of 100 rows and 100 columns with 10000 regular cells in plain view each cell is 0 55558 0 44228 km2 in the horizontal plane coastal unconfined fractured limestone middle miocene aquifer was treated as a single layer which attains a low permeability value of 0 35 m day morad et al 2014 longitudinal and lateral dispersivities were set equal to 10 m and 1 m respectively the effective porosity was set equal to 35 the northern boundary is a constant boundary in direct hydraulic contact with the mediterranean sea in which the water level is known zero at the western southern boundary the general head boundary was considered with hydraulic head about 20 m and recharge boundary of 400 mm at 2002 yousif et al 2015 the input data required for the model include well location and pumping rates aquifer configuration including top and bottom of the system hydraulic conductivity of the system amount of recharge and potentiometric head 3 3 2 steady state model calibration model calibration was achieved through trial and error by adjusting the values of recharge at the boundaries the calibration in the steady state has been conducted versus potentiometric head data in 2009 yousif et al 2015 to calibrate the spatially variable hydraulic conductivity and recharge and hydraulic conductivity of the general head boundary calibration process produced an acceptable comparison between observed vs calibrated heads fig 11 the overall root mean square error was 1 63 m and the measured minus simulation mean error was 1 27m the correlation coefficient between the simulated steady state and measured water levels for steady state conditions was 0 96 3 4 accident scenario considered the generic scenario considered is the release of radionuclides from the nuclear power plant after loca accident and containment bypass with direct release into the air and infiltration by the effect of heavy rainfall directly into the saturated zone neglecting the unsaturated zone the daughters of radionuclides the effect of chemical reactions solubility and dilution processes and transport of radionuclides by colloidal particles are not considered in the present work concerning the analysis of the two modes two test cases were constructed test case 1 applying heavy rain precipitation of 0 02 m d and the source term was imposed for 1 day and lower precipitation in the remaining 18249 days test case 2 pumping wells were imposed with pumping rate of 40 m3 day all the test cases were undertaken to analyze the concentration in space and time in the investigated area and in some specific targets concentration monitoring wells 4 results and discussion 4 1 rascal code results in a radiological assessment it is important to know rain conditions over the whole potential risk area as rain washout radioactive particles in the atmosphere the total amount of activity released to the atmosphere was estimated to be 1 8e 19 bq the plume propagation predictions of ground surface radionuclide concentrations showed that plume footprint was towards the south east results of radioactive effluents deposited in the environment are displayed as follows wind rose and wind direction versus time in hours after the release as shown in fig 12 a and b fig 12 shows that the northern and northern west winds dominated on the day of the nuclear accident therefore there are relatively higher concentrations of radioactive substances distributed in the southeastern direction of the nuclear power plant site than in other directions surface concentration of 137cs and 90sr were calculated at close in distances to the plant up to a distance of 2 km displaying plume footprints surface concentrations for 137cs and 90sr are shown in fig 13 the activity bq of 90sr and 137cs released to the environment vs time for each 15 min time period is shown in fig 14 the graph shows that the activity of the selected radionuclides in units of bq is directly proportional to the length of the release period the activity rate is greatest at about 2 am 4 2 groundwater flow modeling results after completing the steady state simulation the output of the first run was used for simulating the unsteady state condition of the system this has been done by using the simulated hydraulic head of the year 2009 under the same boundary conditions and applying the available reference period of piezometric head records the groundwater flow of the study area was analyzed by using recharge precipitation of about 0 91 inch d 0 02 m d for one day and 0 000585 m d for 18249 days the expected header values of the unsteady state for the year 2059 were predicted the simulation results were illustrated in fig 15 a c these figures show that the groundwater flow is generally from southeast to north and west directions an increment in the groundwater head 0 54 4 83 m was observed in the accident day after 731 days of simulation especially in the coastal zone due to the highly precipitation event on this day and a decline in groundwater head at 2059 was observed in some locations 3 5 to 0 09 m 4 3 contaminant transport modeling results the assumed containment bypass accident can result in failures that allow the releases of fission products from the primary system so that they bypass the containment none of the containment reduction mechanisms can be assumed to affect this release however if the release is in another structure e g auxiliary building the reduction mechanism associated with this path should be considered e g holdup in this study the behavior of contaminant transport in groundwater has been modeled in el negila using mt3d engine for contaminant transport radioactive release to groundwater from a proposed nuclear power reactor and consequent contaminant plume transport has been assessed taking into consideration geological and hydrogeological conditions of the site the engineering barriers and other boundaries that could retard or stop the radioactive release to reach the groundwater were not taken into consideration in this study a simulation period of 50 years for two common radionuclides 137cs and 90sr has been chosen for simulating the contaminant transport in the study area those radioactive isotopes are proposed to be released from a proposed npp for one day 27 11 2011 with heavy rain at a distance of 300 m from the reactor as an example and the simulation ends at the year 2059 the results of this first scenario will be discussed below the predicted plumes of two radioisotopes are illustrated in figs 16 a and b for this assessment five observation wells were proposed and traced at 30 m and 90 m in the direction of east south west south and north from the point source location of the source term released as in fig 17 the concentration results in bq l with time in days were illustrated in fig 18 a and b using log scales generally the results of the 1st scenario illustrate that on the accident day the concentration of both radionuclides 137cs and 90sr were 1 74e 06 and 2 20e 05 bq l respectively after 8 h of release at the location site of release according to rascal model these values were very high compared to who 2011 limits for drinking water that is 10 bq l for 137cs and 90sr fig 18a and b show the variation of the radioactive concentration of the two radioisotopes 137cs and 90sr at 30 m 90 m proposed concentration monitoring wells all these values are less than the recommended limits for the radioactive concentration in drinking water in all the directions around the point source release of the source term and decreased with time the eastern south direction has more concentration than other directions for both radionuclides figs 19a and b show the results of concentrations of both radionuclides in groundwater for the second scenario of increased stress applying a pumping rate of about 40 m3 h in el negila area the results of the second scenario of pumping revealed that still very low concentration appear in pumping well for both 137cs and 90sr in the year 2059 in this study of el negila area the unsaturated zone was neglected and infiltration directly to the groundwater was assumed it is generally agreed that cesium isotope cs 137 migrate very slowly in most soils barseem et al 2013 made hydro geophysical evaluation of water occurrences in el negila area suggested that five geoelectrical layers were detected from the interpretation results and the geoelectrical cross sections these layers correspond to wadi fill clay dry limestone water bearing limestone and clay respectively this suggests that cesium is strong and rapidly absorbed onto soil particles especially on clay minerals and organic matter the adsorption of cesium is mainly chemical and occurs through an ion exchange process a significant fraction of the radionuclide can be retained in the soil in a non extractable irreversible form irreversible sorption of cesium is due to the occlusion of radionuclides by soil organic matter and the diffusion into interlayer clay minerals in addition other factors affect the radioactive 137cs and 90sr transport half life time retardation factor and ion exchange 5 conclusion and recommendations to implement a nuclear power plant project numerous studies need to be conducted to ensure optimal performance and safety during the normal operation and accidental conditions therefore when dealing with radioactive releases into the atmosphere and subsequently into the groundwater accurate modeling atmospheric and groundwater dispersion modeling must be conducted in order to analyze and predict potential paths and patterns of these releases as well as their respective concentrations and consequential doses to the public to ensure that all these parameters are within acceptable standards this work presents a conceptual model of a groundwater flow and contaminant transport for a hypothetical severe npp accident containment bypass scenario during a certain meteorological conditions of heavy rain precipitation in 27 11 2011 using computer code rascal followed by using modflow 2000 and mt3dms in el negila area for the development of a numerical model all available data were integrated and processed the model was calibrated for steady state conditions in 2010 and the results of the model calibration showed reasonable agreement between observed and calculated water levels for the observation wells after 18250 days of simulation no significant concentration was observed at different distances around the proposed nuclear power plant for 137cs and 90sr and also when applying stresses on the system pumping with a rate of 40 m3 h at these conditions taking into consideration several factors affecting the behavior of these radionuclides and 90sr is more retained in aquifer matrix than 137cs el negila site needs more studies to illustrate the nature of faults or folds and hydrological connections between different aquifers beside other studies that are required for nuclear power plant installations using the international standards and detailed accident analysis in the framework of detailed site evaluation and environmental impact assessment it is also recommended to construct monitoring network for routine measurement of the groundwater heads and radioactivity concentration levels the exact locations of the monitoring wells should depend on the simulation results and the flow pattern which may change according to the pumping rate of the groundwater extraction wells it is strongly recommended to assess the environmental impacts of the routine and accident conditions when real data is available for the accident analysis with the chosen technology and the detailed evaluation of the site selection and evaluation processes 
12192,egypt announced a nuclear power program to secure and diversify the country s energy supply the radiation risks to workers public and to the environment that may arise from these applications have to be assessed and if necessary controlled the radioactivity concentration of groundwater has been predicted for 50 years after a postulated accident at a proposed nuclear power reactor at el negila northwestern coast of egypt the accident is assumed to be resulting from a loss of coolant accident loca of a 1000 mwe nuclear power reactor of the pressurized water type the radioactive releases were estimated and a conservative estimate of dispersion in air and the consequent contaminant transport of radioactive pollutants through groundwater around the reactor were modeled of greatest interest in terms of long term radiation contamination hazard of the surface are 137cs and 90sr isotopes as their radiological significance increased with time the analysis results from rascal code are used as the input data to modflow mt3d model to predict radioactive contamination of groundwater for 50 years of simulation two scenarios for groundwater dispersion are assumed the 1stscenario considered no pumping while the second scenario assumes stressing of the system through pumping wells the results of groundwater modeling show that the radioactive concentration of 137cs and 90sr were higher at the point source location of the released source term compared to who limits on drinking water borne radionuclides and decreased in all directions during 50 years of simulation indicating radionuclides retention in the aquifer matrix taking into consideration that 90sr was retained more than 137cs applying the 2nd scenario revealed that still low concentrations appear in a pumping well at the coast for both 137cs and 90sr due to the fact that several factors affect the dispersion in groundwater half life time dispersion adsorption desorption graphical abstract image 1

time dependent source term is the source term to dose module which is largely based on the accumulated us experience on pwrs and bwrs as described in mckenna and glitter 1988 and soffer et al 1995 the source term to dose model will first generate a time dependent source term this is the release rate for each radionuclide from the facility as a function of time this time dependent release rate the source term then provides the input to an atmospheric dispersion and transport model the atmospheric dispersion and transport model estimates radionuclide concentrations downwind both in the air and on the ground due to deposition the calculated concentrations are used to estimate projected doses the study assumed a hypothetical npp accident as a source term scenario with relevant parameters plant conditions core inventory containment failure mode effective release height the time that radioactivity release begins and duration of the release the source term used is assumed to be resulting from a loss of coolant accident condition of a 1000 mwe nuclear power reactor of the pressurized water type soffer et al 1995 containment by pass was considered as the release pathway as shown in fig 7 radioactivity releases are usually defined in severe accident source terms as the fractional release of the core inventory the release time considered is up to 48 h with the plume treated as being released at a constant rate and the meteorological conditions are also treated as constant the reactor safety study identified and quantified the contribution to off site radiological risks of accident sequences at pressurized water reactors pwrs in which the release of fission products may be released by bypassing the containment building containment bypass sequence risks constitute a large fraction of the total pressurized water reactor pwr in large part because estimates of competing risks from early containment failures have been greatly reduced since wash 1400 usnrc 1975 3 2 2 atmospheric dispersion and estimation of radionuclides concentration for this study we assumed that all radionuclides having been released to the atmosphere were deposited in precipitation forms on the ground surface of greatest interest in terms of radiation contamination hazard of the surface is 137cs and 90sr because the radiological significance of cesium represented by cs 137 and strontium sr 90 radionuclides was initially small but their importance increased with time becoming by far more important one year after the accident especially at the larger distances de cort et al 1998 the dispersion simulation estimates how radionuclide materials distribute along the exposure path dispersion estimates must be implemented in order to describe the distribution of radionuclide concentration at a point of interest to estimate the distribution of the radionuclide spread during npp accidents dispersion estimates are determined by using straight line gaussian plume models the calculation is done using source term to dose module of rascal code ramsdell et al 2012 rascal calculates the deposition of particles using the dry and wet deposition models used in mesorad ramsdell et al 1988 the activity deposited each time step is the product of the total deposition rate and the time step duration rascal calculates wet deposition of particles and gases using a washout model with washout coefficients that are only a function of precipitation type and a qualitative measure of intensity the model calculates the time integrated air concentration and surface deposition of airborne contaminants to the ground concentrations of radionuclides in the atmosphere are further used for estimating the doses to the environment and the public downwind the release point 3 2 3 meteorological data meteorological data are needed to model the behavior of the radioactive plume in the atmosphere the minimum required data is wind speed and direction defines the downwind transport atmospheric stability governs plume horizontal and vertical growth precipitation defines wet deposition a very important removal process the prevailing wind direction is of primary importance in determining the long spatial distribution of emitted pollutants wind speed also affects plume dispersion and therefore resultant ambient air concentration by increasing the initial dilution of pollutants or inhibiting plume rise wind direction and wind speed have opposing consequences for ambient air concentrations at ground level strong winds provide a good dispersion of the atmospheric pollutants while calm weather leads to poor dispersion and therefore an increased risk for the population one full year 2011 meteorological data for the study area was taken from the weather underground website weather underground 2019 the wind rose was created in this work using wrplot view software michael et al 2019 the wind rose reflects the predominant wind direction and the frequencies distribution of wind speed for all wind direction as shown in figures 8a and 8b rascal requires the initial weather data to be entered within a period of 2 h before the start of the release november 27 2011 weather data with high intensity rain as shown in fig 9 was employed in this study for the analysis of the nuclear accident the meteorological conditions determine where the material goes the concentrations in the environment and how fast it deposits on surfaces the meteorological data entered for the scenario are presented in table 1 3 3 usgs modflow 2000 computer code the usgs modflow computer code was used to build a three dimensional model of subsurface water flow the model describes ground water flow under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous and anisotropic medium according to equation 1 bear 1979 bear and verruijt 1987 the model is capable of simulating the time dependent flow as well as mass and heat transport the time dependent data which are included in the finite difference model fdm has to be stored outside into a database or gis systems the governing equations are derived through combination between the water balance equation and darcy s law anderson and woessner 1992 the model describes groundwater flow of constant density under non equilibrium conditions in a heterogeneous and anisotropic medium according to the following equation which was solved using the finite difference technique 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes lt l h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume and represents sources and or sinks of water t ss is the specific storage of the porous material l l and t is time t in general ss kxx kyy and kzz may be functions of space ss ss x y z kxx kxx x y z etc and w may be a function of space and time w w x y z t moreover due to the hydrodynamic dispersion the concentration of a solute will decrease over distance generally speaking the solute will spread more in the direction of groundwater flow than in the direction normal to the groundwater flow because longitudinal dispersivity is typically 10 times higher than transverse dispersivities the transport of a conservative solute in a one dimensional system can be described by the advection dispersion equation 2 2 c t v c x d 2 c x 2 where c t is the change in concentration over time the first term on the right hand side represents advection and the second term represents hydrodynamic dispersion the advection dispersion equation may be solved analytically or numerically under different initial and boundary conditions mt3dms was used to predict heavy metal transport using lead as the surrogate this engine is the best choice when biodegradation is not a factor when dealing with heavy metals that are persistent prommer et al 2002 the adsorption coefficients were also most appropriate with the mt3dms engine with heavy metal only having one oxidation state the model was run for numerous iterations and outputs were recorded at different time intervals to show the size and extent of the heavy metal plume 3 3 1 model discretization the hydrogeological data were implemented by means of modflow code harbaugh et al 2000 to develop the model in el negila area as shown in fig 10 the model encompasses an area of about 2457 km2 the grid consists of 100 rows and 100 columns with 10000 regular cells in plain view each cell is 0 55558 0 44228 km2 in the horizontal plane coastal unconfined fractured limestone middle miocene aquifer was treated as a single layer which attains a low permeability value of 0 35 m day morad et al 2014 longitudinal and lateral dispersivities were set equal to 10 m and 1 m respectively the effective porosity was set equal to 35 the northern boundary is a constant boundary in direct hydraulic contact with the mediterranean sea in which the water level is known zero at the western southern boundary the general head boundary was considered with hydraulic head about 20 m and recharge boundary of 400 mm at 2002 yousif et al 2015 the input data required for the model include well location and pumping rates aquifer configuration including top and bottom of the system hydraulic conductivity of the system amount of recharge and potentiometric head 3 3 2 steady state model calibration model calibration was achieved through trial and error by adjusting the values of recharge at the boundaries the calibration in the steady state has been conducted versus potentiometric head data in 2009 yousif et al 2015 to calibrate the spatially variable hydraulic conductivity and recharge and hydraulic conductivity of the general head boundary calibration process produced an acceptable comparison between observed vs calibrated heads fig 11 the overall root mean square error was 1 63 m and the measured minus simulation mean error was 1 27m the correlation coefficient between the simulated steady state and measured water levels for steady state conditions was 0 96 3 4 accident scenario considered the generic scenario considered is the release of radionuclides from the nuclear power plant after loca accident and containment bypass with direct release into the air and infiltration by the effect of heavy rainfall directly into the saturated zone neglecting the unsaturated zone the daughters of radionuclides the effect of chemical reactions solubility and dilution processes and transport of radionuclides by colloidal particles are not considered in the present work concerning the analysis of the two modes two test cases were constructed test case 1 applying heavy rain precipitation of 0 02 m d and the source term was imposed for 1 day and lower precipitation in the remaining 18249 days test case 2 pumping wells were imposed with pumping rate of 40 m3 day all the test cases were undertaken to analyze the concentration in space and time in the investigated area and in some specific targets concentration monitoring wells 4 results and discussion 4 1 rascal code results in a radiological assessment it is important to know rain conditions over the whole potential risk area as rain washout radioactive particles in the atmosphere the total amount of activity released to the atmosphere was estimated to be 1 8e 19 bq the plume propagation predictions of ground surface radionuclide concentrations showed that plume footprint was towards the south east results of radioactive effluents deposited in the environment are displayed as follows wind rose and wind direction versus time in hours after the release as shown in fig 12 a and b fig 12 shows that the northern and northern west winds dominated on the day of the nuclear accident therefore there are relatively higher concentrations of radioactive substances distributed in the southeastern direction of the nuclear power plant site than in other directions surface concentration of 137cs and 90sr were calculated at close in distances to the plant up to a distance of 2 km displaying plume footprints surface concentrations for 137cs and 90sr are shown in fig 13 the activity bq of 90sr and 137cs released to the environment vs time for each 15 min time period is shown in fig 14 the graph shows that the activity of the selected radionuclides in units of bq is directly proportional to the length of the release period the activity rate is greatest at about 2 am 4 2 groundwater flow modeling results after completing the steady state simulation the output of the first run was used for simulating the unsteady state condition of the system this has been done by using the simulated hydraulic head of the year 2009 under the same boundary conditions and applying the available reference period of piezometric head records the groundwater flow of the study area was analyzed by using recharge precipitation of about 0 91 inch d 0 02 m d for one day and 0 000585 m d for 18249 days the expected header values of the unsteady state for the year 2059 were predicted the simulation results were illustrated in fig 15 a c these figures show that the groundwater flow is generally from southeast to north and west directions an increment in the groundwater head 0 54 4 83 m was observed in the accident day after 731 days of simulation especially in the coastal zone due to the highly precipitation event on this day and a decline in groundwater head at 2059 was observed in some locations 3 5 to 0 09 m 4 3 contaminant transport modeling results the assumed containment bypass accident can result in failures that allow the releases of fission products from the primary system so that they bypass the containment none of the containment reduction mechanisms can be assumed to affect this release however if the release is in another structure e g auxiliary building the reduction mechanism associated with this path should be considered e g holdup in this study the behavior of contaminant transport in groundwater has been modeled in el negila using mt3d engine for contaminant transport radioactive release to groundwater from a proposed nuclear power reactor and consequent contaminant plume transport has been assessed taking into consideration geological and hydrogeological conditions of the site the engineering barriers and other boundaries that could retard or stop the radioactive release to reach the groundwater were not taken into consideration in this study a simulation period of 50 years for two common radionuclides 137cs and 90sr has been chosen for simulating the contaminant transport in the study area those radioactive isotopes are proposed to be released from a proposed npp for one day 27 11 2011 with heavy rain at a distance of 300 m from the reactor as an example and the simulation ends at the year 2059 the results of this first scenario will be discussed below the predicted plumes of two radioisotopes are illustrated in figs 16 a and b for this assessment five observation wells were proposed and traced at 30 m and 90 m in the direction of east south west south and north from the point source location of the source term released as in fig 17 the concentration results in bq l with time in days were illustrated in fig 18 a and b using log scales generally the results of the 1st scenario illustrate that on the accident day the concentration of both radionuclides 137cs and 90sr were 1 74e 06 and 2 20e 05 bq l respectively after 8 h of release at the location site of release according to rascal model these values were very high compared to who 2011 limits for drinking water that is 10 bq l for 137cs and 90sr fig 18a and b show the variation of the radioactive concentration of the two radioisotopes 137cs and 90sr at 30 m 90 m proposed concentration monitoring wells all these values are less than the recommended limits for the radioactive concentration in drinking water in all the directions around the point source release of the source term and decreased with time the eastern south direction has more concentration than other directions for both radionuclides figs 19a and b show the results of concentrations of both radionuclides in groundwater for the second scenario of increased stress applying a pumping rate of about 40 m3 h in el negila area the results of the second scenario of pumping revealed that still very low concentration appear in pumping well for both 137cs and 90sr in the year 2059 in this study of el negila area the unsaturated zone was neglected and infiltration directly to the groundwater was assumed it is generally agreed that cesium isotope cs 137 migrate very slowly in most soils barseem et al 2013 made hydro geophysical evaluation of water occurrences in el negila area suggested that five geoelectrical layers were detected from the interpretation results and the geoelectrical cross sections these layers correspond to wadi fill clay dry limestone water bearing limestone and clay respectively this suggests that cesium is strong and rapidly absorbed onto soil particles especially on clay minerals and organic matter the adsorption of cesium is mainly chemical and occurs through an ion exchange process a significant fraction of the radionuclide can be retained in the soil in a non extractable irreversible form irreversible sorption of cesium is due to the occlusion of radionuclides by soil organic matter and the diffusion into interlayer clay minerals in addition other factors affect the radioactive 137cs and 90sr transport half life time retardation factor and ion exchange 5 conclusion and recommendations to implement a nuclear power plant project numerous studies need to be conducted to ensure optimal performance and safety during the normal operation and accidental conditions therefore when dealing with radioactive releases into the atmosphere and subsequently into the groundwater accurate modeling atmospheric and groundwater dispersion modeling must be conducted in order to analyze and predict potential paths and patterns of these releases as well as their respective concentrations and consequential doses to the public to ensure that all these parameters are within acceptable standards this work presents a conceptual model of a groundwater flow and contaminant transport for a hypothetical severe npp accident containment bypass scenario during a certain meteorological conditions of heavy rain precipitation in 27 11 2011 using computer code rascal followed by using modflow 2000 and mt3dms in el negila area for the development of a numerical model all available data were integrated and processed the model was calibrated for steady state conditions in 2010 and the results of the model calibration showed reasonable agreement between observed and calculated water levels for the observation wells after 18250 days of simulation no significant concentration was observed at different distances around the proposed nuclear power plant for 137cs and 90sr and also when applying stresses on the system pumping with a rate of 40 m3 h at these conditions taking into consideration several factors affecting the behavior of these radionuclides and 90sr is more retained in aquifer matrix than 137cs el negila site needs more studies to illustrate the nature of faults or folds and hydrological connections between different aquifers beside other studies that are required for nuclear power plant installations using the international standards and detailed accident analysis in the framework of detailed site evaluation and environmental impact assessment it is also recommended to construct monitoring network for routine measurement of the groundwater heads and radioactivity concentration levels the exact locations of the monitoring wells should depend on the simulation results and the flow pattern which may change according to the pumping rate of the groundwater extraction wells it is strongly recommended to assess the environmental impacts of the routine and accident conditions when real data is available for the accident analysis with the chosen technology and the detailed evaluation of the site selection and evaluation processes 
12193,traditional water coagulants cause many problems in drinking water treatment processes and the quality of the produced water in this current research cationic starches csts were prepared with different degree of substitutions ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 the efficiency of the as prepared cst and the commercial polyaluminum chlorides pac were evaluated in nile water turbidity reduction the application of coagulants in the treatment of nile river water showed that the turbidity caused by algal biomass were decreased to 61 5 by using 0 5 ppm of cst ds 0 85 for effective algal cells removal pre chlorination process is required the maximum treatment was obtained through pre chlorination coagulation process using cst ds 0 97 with turbidity removal percentage 73 1 and total algal removal reached 94 8 all tested coagulants have a great effect on total bacteria counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant without any significant changes in drinking water quality criteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords cationic starch polyaluminum chloride drinking water turbidity 1 introduction since the rapid economic development as a result of increased population the insufficiency of water resources has been a serious problem for many decades daghighi et al 2017 safe and pure drinking water is a must for any community where water resources must have some form of purification before utilization treatment of drinking water aims to produce safe biologically and chemically water for human consumption and applicable in terms of odor appearance and taste so the method involved in water treatment depends on the source of the raw water haghiri et al 2018 the process of water treatment affected greatly by seasonal variation in turbidity mcconnachie et al 1999 saritha et al 2017 turbidity caused by particulate suspended material such as clay minerals silt viruses bacteria algae some organic matters as well as inorganic matters in addition to contamination with pathogenic organisms heavy metals that affect human health and artificial organic chemicals that may be found and increase turbidity thus it is important to remove turbidity efficiently by removing contaminants that affect human health daryabeigi zand and hoveidi 2015 the final cost of water treatment must be taken into account in terms of water quality produced and operating efficiency haghiri et al 2018 ng et al 2016 standard turbidity in drinking water can be reached by conventional treatment technologies such as coagulation precipitation and filtration coagulation precipitation are considered as methods for drinking water treatment therefore the selection of coagulant is one of the most important factors for successful water treatment folkard et al 1996 liao and zhang 2018 nidheesh et al 2017 and have a pronounced influence on the treatment efficiency zheng et al 2011 2008 there are two stages to perform coagulation first rapid mixing of the coagulant with water takes place followed by a slow mixing process for flocculation process coagulation and flocculation occur successively until the adhesion between the molecules and formation of floc then sedimentation takes place dealing with low cost and high coagulation efficiency inorganic coagulants mainly aluminum salt and iron salts are widely applied wang et al 2017 the higher the positive charge of a coagulant the highest its removal efficiency of suspended solids the main drawbacks of the use of inorganic coagulant may alter the ph of water since they consume alkalinity in addition the formation of large amount of sludge after the treatment and the residual metal salt which would affect the safety of drinking water chen et al 2018 recently the research related to coagulation processes was focused on the use and production of environmentally friendly new and more effective coagulants therefore the researchers worked on polymeric aluminum termed polyaluminum chloride pac that could be used as an alternative for alum proposed for drinking water treatment zouboulis et al 2008 pac is an inorganic coagulant as aluminum sulphate that was used in water treatment to remove turbidity color and taste and had no effect on ph of treated water since 1980s pac not only used in water treatment but also in wastewater treatment it was reported that pac proved to be efficient in removing the precipitated phosphate heavy metals suspended solids and also to tends to virus inactivation jiang 2001 matsui et al 2003 mertens et al 2012 there are many types available commercially coagulants such as of polyaluminum that used for the treatment of water and wastewater nominated as pac and aluminum sulphate as consequently the use of polymers leads to higher effective density floc densification and thereby improved sedimentation velocity the properties of the settling process can be improved by using biopolymers as flocculants aids krentz et al 2006 vandamme et al 2014 the parameters such as size charge density are mostly affected on the activity of the utilized polymers krentz et al 2006 roselet et al 2015 it is preferred to use organic polymers more than metal salts since organic polymers used in a much lower dosage biodegradable organic flocculants do not result in residual accumulation does not affect the quality of water produced and is economically better than other coagulants pal et al 2005 vandamme et al 2010 the charge of those quaternary ammonium groups is independent of ph and therefore cst works over a broader ph range than chitosan vandamme 2013 vandamme et al 2010 starch is effective and cheap source and can be used in the coagulation process but its use is very limited because it has the ability to form gel and pastes bleeke et al 2015 pi xin et al 2009 accordingly ns should be altered chemically so that we can obtain desirable properties in the coagulation process el feky et al 2015 el hamshary et al 2015 2014 el naggar et al 2018 2015 el rafie et al 2011 the hydroxyl groups on the backbones of starch molecules are substituted by positively charged groups of quaternary ammonium cations glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cst has been prepared with different degree of substitutions ds depending on the amount of gtac that added to starch hereby the current research work was designed to compare the turbidity removal rate of 6 coagulant materials for removing and flocculating microalgae and suspended particles from river nile raw water intended for drinking water using traditional jar test coagulant materials conducted through this research are the most common inorganic coagulant aluminum sulphate as the synthesized cst with three different degree of substitutions ds and two concentrations of pac 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials native maize starch ns was kindly provided by the company of starch and yeast egypt glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac was purchased from sigma aldrich company usa two types of pac were obtained as a gift from gongyi xin qi chemical plant co china aluminum sulphate as was purchased from across fischer co germany all other materials or chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further modification 2 2 preparation of coagulant compounds 2 2 1 preparation of aluminum sulphate solution as aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o 1 solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g in 100 ml distilled water accordingly each one ml equivalent to 10mgal l aluminum sulphate solution as as coagulant agent was freshly prepared prior to its use in each experiment 2 2 2 preparation of polyaluminum chloride solution pac both types depend on its color as yellow pac and white pac a 1 g from each one was dissolved in 250 ml distilled water so each one ml equivalent to 0 25 mg al l 2 2 3 preparation of cationic starch cst native maize starch ns 5g was dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water containing 1 g of sodium hydroxide naoh and kept under mechanical stirring for 2 h at 40 c after complete dispersion of ns in naoh solution different concentrations of cationizing agent glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac 2 ml 4 ml and 6 ml was added dropwise to starch solution the solution was kept again under continuous mechanical stirring for another 6 h keeping into consideration the ph of the whole solution was adjusted to 7 via using acetic acid 0 001 m at the end of cationization process absolute ethanol was added dropwise to the solution to terminate the reaction and to precipitate cst the wet powder was added three times with ethanol h2o 70 30 to remove the unreacted compounds and to purify the formed cst for further purification dialysis against water was carried out the final dialyzed cst was dried using lab refrigerator at 80 c for 12 h and dried using freeze drying at 60 c the as produced fine powder was kept for further characterization and application the prepared samples of cst with different degree of substitutions ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 57 are coded with cst 0 34 cst 0 85 and cst 0 97 respectively 2 3 physical and chemical characterization 2 3 1 characterization of cationic starch cst the nitrogen content of the chemically modified starch etherified with glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac to yield cationic starch was determined via kjeldahl method and thus calculated as follow scanning electron microscope sem a jms 5600 electron microscope germany was used as a tool in order to characterize the morphologies of granular starch and cationic starches in order to examine the crystallinity of cationic starches and compared with that of native maize starch x ray diffraction xrd a philips pw1710 based diffractometer was used the formation of newly functional groups or the creation of newly bonds are for the as synthesized cationic starch are investigated using ftir technique a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrometer germany 2 3 2 characterization the efficiency of different coagulant determination the optimum coagulant concentration by jar test experiments subsurface raw water sample were collected from river nile and three jar tests replicates were carried out for each flocculent in order to determine the optimal concentration for 5 coagulant materials used the tests are performed according to the protocol of the jar test bulusu and sharma 1967 cohen 1957 and also according to the water treatment plant practice rapid mixing of 1 min at 200 rpm flash mixing of 20 min at 20 rpm settling time of 30 min the protocol includes using a flocculator which results in six beakers of a liter from raw water strictly identical and adjustable stirring period through a central control this method comprises introducing a coagulant material into a series of six 1 l beakers containing raw water with stirring for a short time 1 min but with a very high speed 200 rpm min and to ensure a very good dispersion of the reactants and a good chemical destabilization of colloids rapid stirring is followed by a flash stirring 20 rpm min for 20 min with a stirrer blades in order to promote contacting contiguous particles and avoid breaking the flocks formed flocculants concentrations were added as 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mg l for as and concentrations of 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 and 1 5 mg l for cationic starches yellow pac and white pac after 30 min of sedimentation the supernatant was siphoned to be analyzed the water turbidity removal rate after the reaction was used as the evaluation index for different flocculant used in addition to the change in ph and physico chemical parameters of water according to drinking water quality criteria pre chlorination experiment in egypt conventional drinking water treatment plants are including pre chlorination coagulation flocculation filtration and disinfection so after determination of the optimum dose of each coagulant pre chlorination experiment was carried out to determine the optimum chlorine dose mixed with the optimum dose of the different coagulants chlorine a saturated chlorine water solution was used the power of the available chlorine concentration was determined iodometrically before running experiment according to apha 2005 effect of coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacteria in this experiment a comparison was made to examine the effect of the tested coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacterial counts in surface water samples the experiments were conducted using pour plate method according to apha 2005 phytoplankton enumeration and taxonomic identification the phytoplankton present in the river nile water samples were identified and counted according to the key of freshwater algae hofbauer et al 2003 2 4 analytical methods parameters checked according to the who kurup et al 2010 and egyptian standards law no for 2007 for each of the quality of surface water used as a source of drinking water and the criteria of the quality drinking water after treatment with different coagulant materials the parameters include ph color temperature tr alkalinity ammonia sulphate nitrate do cod bod fluoride iron manganese for raw water criteria measured for treated water at this phase as turbidity ph residual aluminum total dissolved solids tds nitrate iron and manganese were analyzed in accordance with standard methods 3 result and discussion starch is categorized as insoluble carbohydrate polymers comprise linear and branched molecules amylose and amylopectin respectively the insolubility in water limits its application in many different domains however its modification through chemical reactions facilitate its widely application el feky et al 2015 el naggar et al 2018 2015 el rafie et al 2011 hebeish et al 2014b the reaction of maize starch with cationic agent gtac in presence of alkalizing agent naoh is called etherification reaction the etherification reaction can be occurred through the reaction of hydroxy functional groups of the anhydro glucose units of starch with the nucleophilic groups of gtac el naggar et al 2018 such cationic starch by and large has physicochemical properties that are significantly not quite the same as those of the native maize starch as great solubility and more functional groups starch bearing cationic groups scheme 1 a represent the schematic steps for the preparation and utilization of cationic starch different ds and pac as coagulants river nile water treatment while scheme 1 b displays the chemical structure of the utilized compounds for this purpose of coagulants csts with different ds was prepared using naoh 0 2 g g starch after many trials it is observed that above this concentration the hydrolysis of gtac can be occurred which in turn leads to opening the epoxide ring and cause the formation of side products diol product thus the amount of naoh was selected to minimize these side reactions 3 1 effect of gtac concentration on the ds of csts in terms of the nitrogen percent the degree of substitution of cst fig 1 displays the change of ds as a function with the change in the volume of gtac used for starch cationization it is detected that the ds of cst is 0 34 when the volume of gtac is 2 ml 5 g starch up on increasing the volume of gtac to 4 ml sharply increases the ds of the prepared csts 0 85 however a further increase in the volume of gtac to 6 ml the ds of cst is nearly constant 0 97 when compared with the value produced with using 4 ml of gtac 3 2 morphological structure of native maize starch and different cationic starches utilization of scanning electron microscopy sem aimed to contemplate the surface morphology of the native maize starch and after cationization process the images for native starch are taken at two different magnifications 400 and 1500 x as displayed in fig 2 a b respectively after starch modification the samples were submitted to morphological examination at two low and high magnifications 10 000 and 20 000 x cst prepared with different ds are shown in fig 2 b c for ds 0 34 d e for 0 85 and f g for ds 0 97 as shown from fig 2 a b that the granules of unmodified native maize starch have round and polygonal structure with well defined integrity on the other hand the effect of gtac as etherifying agent cause extensively changes the starch granule morphology at the point when the ds of cst 0 34 the cationic reagent penetrates the interior of the starch molecule and the starch granules are notably enlarged and begin to disintegrate as presented in fig 2 c d meanwhile the granules of the cst with ds 0 85 fig 2 e f is completely disintegrate or break down and their edges drastically lose definition it is also observed that there is no significant change in the structure of granules when the ds of cst increases to 0 97 fig 2 g h based on sem observations gtac destroys the structure of the maize granule starch and reduces hydrogen bonding accordingly the disintegration of starch granules enhances the swelling of cst which facilitates it dissolution in water 3 3 xrd of native and cationic starches to examine the change in crystallinity for native starch after etherification reaction with different concentration of gtac to yield cst with different degree of substitution xrd is performed for this matter and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the native maize starch exhibits an a type crystallinity pattern and the strong reflections are presented at 150 and 230 and unresolved doublet appears at 170 and 180 hebeish et al 2014a puchongkavarin et al 2003 it is clearly noted that the cationic agent has significant impact on the crystallinity of native starch gtac according to its concentration can damage the crystallinity pattern of the starches at ds 0 34 as shown from the upper figure on the right side that the crystallinity the a type crystallinity pattern of the starches is slightly weakened this result suggests that the crystallinity pattern of starch is partly damaged cst prepared with ds 0 85 exhibits single and broad peaks affirming the disappearance of crystallinity pattern of starch after modification up on increasing the concentration of gtac to 6 ml to prepare cst with ds 0 97 leads to completely damage the crystallinity pattern overall the formation of amorphous granules of cst encourage and affirm the utilization of cst as flocculants the reason for its utilization could be attributed to the colloidal solution during the addition to water it is notable that the solubility of polymers enhancing its utilization in wastewater treatment 3 4 ftir spectroscopy of native maize starch and cationic starches to define the structure of csts ftir spectra is urgently needed fig 4 displays the ftir spectra of native starch and csts prepared with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 as shown from the graph of native maize starch the typical absorptions appear at 3295 cm 1 and 2926 cm 1 are endorsed to hydroxyl groups o h and c h stretching vibration of the anhydro glucose units additionally the bands presented at 1167 cm 1 and 1015 cm 1 are ascribed to the c o bond stretching vibration regarding to the ftir spectra of csts they have characteristic bands which are nearly similar to the characteristic starch backbone peaks but with minor shift as shown in fig 4 in addition to the existence of band at 1510 cm 1 related to the quaternary ammonium groups c n pi xin et al 2009 in addition with an increasing ds the intensity of peaks at 1510 cm 1 is gradually strengthened which is clear evidence for the incorporation of a cationic moiety onto the backbone of the starch pal et al 2005 3 5 characterization of river nile water intended for potable water there is no doubt that surface water cannot be used as drinking water without treatment as surface water has a high turbidity high content of microorganisms such as algae and bacteria in addition to other substances that may cause danger to human health thus the water must go through treatment stages that make it suitable to the standard specifications for drinking water postolachi et al 2015 table 1 presents the average characteristic properties of raw river nile water the results indicate that river nile water is moderately alkaline and most of surface water criteria are in the allowable range except for the chemical oxygen demand cod values are out of the acceptable range this is may be attributed to the increase and change in algal count and algal biomass of river nile water ramadan and shehata ramadan and shehata 1976 and shehata et al shehata et al 1997 stated that when comparing to the amount of algae before and after the construction of the high dam it was found that the numbers of algae have increased to tenfold after the construction of the high dam due to the change in flow rate and turbidity levels turbidity a measure of the scattering and absorption of light in water is dependent on the characteristics of the particles that are scattering the light specifically concentration grain size grain shape refractive index and color voichick et al 2018 3 6 finding the optimum coagulant dosages for turbidity removal turbidity can also provide food and may lead to the formation of pathogenic organisms and water borne diseases in the distribution system moreover coagulant materials and coagulation dosage are considered the most important factors on which the success of the coagulation process is based on therefore it is significant to determine the best coagulant and optimum dosage to minimize the dosing cost and sludge formation and also to obtain the optimum performance in drinking water treatment plant patel and vashi 2013 fig 5 illustrates a comparison of turbidity removal efficiency of 6 coagulant materials used to specify its optimum coagulant dose with the initial turbidity and ph of the water sample are 7 8 ntu and 7 6 ntu the use of aluminum sulphate as a most common coagulant in a gradual increase of concentrations showed a proportional increase in turbidity removal of the treated samples fig 5a also the figure indicated the optimum aluminum sulphate dose can be detected at 20 mg al l with percentage removal of turbidity was 69 2 the most important drawback of alum as a coagulant is the change in ph value where it decreases by increase in alum concentration the obtained results are in accordance with those obtained by volk et al 2000 and dominguez et al 2007 indicated that within all the factors involved in coagulation flocculation process those that most affect the process efficiency are ph and coagulant dose turbidity removal efficiency as a function of 3 types of csts and at different doses and at the same initial turbidity and ph values is observed in fig 5b the results indicated that the three type of cst have different optimum doses and different turbidity removal efficiency the optimum coagulant dose of csts prepared with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 with removal percentage 46 2 61 5 and 61 5 is 0 75 0 5 and 1 mg l respectively fig 5c reveal the results of using pac yellow and white in coagulation process the results showed that the optimum dose for both compounds were 20 mg l where turbidity removal percentage reached 77 2 and 84 6 for pac yellow and white respectively in addition fig 6 shows the sem images for algae flocs formed after the coagulation process using different coagulants as we can see from fig 6a the algae cells were loosely bound by flocs formed in the al2 so4 3 however in fig 6 b c d the algae cells were easily captured by the flocs formed in cst with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 respectively which benefited the floc aggregation for formation of tightly bounded algae flocs concerning to pac chlorides as in fig 6 e f it was found that the flocs formed in the 2 pacs were different fewer cells imbedded small flocs formed in yellow pac fig 6e however flocs of larger cells were formed in white pac fig 6f this result can directly prove the positive function of csts and yellow pac in improving coagulation and aggregation of algae cell without damage cell membrane integrity and agglomerate the suspended matter from the raw water the coagulation behavior of pac yellow and white was also evaluated as mentioned before the initial turbidity and ph value of the raw nile river water was 7 8 ntu and 7 6 since the applied coagulant doses were 0 25 1 5 mg pac l for both compounds various dosages of pac were examined for the treatment of surface water and for the removal of suspended solids ranging from 0 25 up to1 5 mg al l the percentage removal of turbidity to determine the optimum dose are 65 4 and 71 8 for both pac compounds and it obtained at concentration of 0 25mgal l annadurai et al 2004 found that the application of slightly increased pac dosages e g 1 35 mg al l resulted in treated water with a turbidity similar to water quality was obtained as by the addition of higher alum dosage e g 1 70 mg al l in addition zand and hoveidi daryabeigi zand and hoveidi 2015 results showed that the highest turbidity removal efficiency was within 82 9 99 0 for alum and 93 8 99 6 for poly aluminum chloride over the applied range of turbidity both applied coagulants demonstrated promising performance in turbidity removal from water however poly aluminum chloride showed better performance compared to aluminum sulphate the results of the current study can be used as a baseline data for drinking water treatment facilities which uses these two types of flocculants 3 7 changes in water quality criteria as a function of different coagulant materials drinking water quality criteria including ph turbidity total dissolved solids temperature total hardness calcium hardness magnesium hardness chloride sulphate ammonia nitrite nitrate iron and manganese in addition to residual aluminum were determined to detect the effect of different flocculent materials used all coagulant materials used in this investigation have no pronounced change on drinking water quality criteria e g total dissolved solids nitrate iron and manganese table 2 a pronounced change can be detected in ph as well as residual aluminum although residual al after coagulation with al2 so4 3 still comply with quality standard but it higher than that obtained after coagulation with both pac used no change in ph value can be detected after coagulation with the three cst compounds and two pac compounds in a comparison with that occurred in alum coagulation turbidity removal after chlorination reached maximum percentage 73 using cst 0 97 3 8 conventional treatment the following results cover the information yielded from river nile water algal removal using prechlorination followed by chemical coagulants chlorine break point chlorination during the period of investigation was 3 4 mg l which is suitable for algal content of raw nile water algae table 3 the percentage for algal removal was 100 for blue green algae after mixing the optimum chlorine dose with the optimum dose of the different coagulants for total algal removal csts were better than pacs where the percentage of algal removal reached 94 8 using cst 0 97 which clarify that the reduction of turbidity to 73 as mentioned in table 3 3 9 effect of coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacteria adequate water treatment for surface water to meet the stipulated drinking water standards is essential to remove impurities turbidity and bacteria this can be guided through the addition of coagulants and disinfectants so a bench scale study for testing the effect of coagulants on total heterotrophic bacterial counts was conducted the results obtained by comparing with the control raw water without any addition bench scale testing of coagulants effect on total heterotrophic bacterial counts show that all tested coagulants have a great effect on total counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant table 4 without using chlorine the results indicated that all coagulants have a weak antibacterial effect reduction of total heterotrophic bacterial counts ranged from 99 5 to 99 9 in the presence of chlorine fig 7 without using chlorine total heterotrophic bacterial counts reduced by 79 8 97 81 9 79 8 92 2 and 88 8 with using aluminum sulphate alum white pac yellow pac cst 0 34 cst 0 85 and cst 0 97 respectively as coagulants 4 conclusion the main factor in the efficacy of the coagulation process in water treatment is the removal of turbidity preliminary jar test was carried out to determine the optimum dose for five coagulants al so4 3 cst 0 34 0 85 0 97 and pac yellow and white chlorination coagulation process was then done using the optimum dose of each compound to figure out the best coagulant in treatment process native starch is a carbohydrate polymer an abundant in nature cost effective its utilization in many different applications is inadequate due to its insolubility in water thus chemical modification in necessity to enhance its solubility beside to create active functional groups suitable for water purification cationic agent such as glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac was used as etherifying agent to generate positive charges on starch glucose treatment of raw water with cationic starch cst and pac is achieved with an improvement of the water quality without addition of aluminum sulphate ions using chlorination coagulation process improved the treatment process and proved that cst 0 97 has the highest percentage of turbidity and total algal count removal 73 and 94 8 respectively coagulants effect on total heterotrophic bacterial counts show that all tested coagulants have a great effect on total counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant especially cst 0 97 where percentage of removal reached 99 8 in other words applied cst demonstrated promising performance in turbidity and bacterial removal without any significant changes in drinking water quality and so the use of cationic starch cst for drinking water treatment is environmentally benign polymer declaration of competing interest we wish

12193,traditional water coagulants cause many problems in drinking water treatment processes and the quality of the produced water in this current research cationic starches csts were prepared with different degree of substitutions ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 the efficiency of the as prepared cst and the commercial polyaluminum chlorides pac were evaluated in nile water turbidity reduction the application of coagulants in the treatment of nile river water showed that the turbidity caused by algal biomass were decreased to 61 5 by using 0 5 ppm of cst ds 0 85 for effective algal cells removal pre chlorination process is required the maximum treatment was obtained through pre chlorination coagulation process using cst ds 0 97 with turbidity removal percentage 73 1 and total algal removal reached 94 8 all tested coagulants have a great effect on total bacteria counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant without any significant changes in drinking water quality criteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords cationic starch polyaluminum chloride drinking water turbidity 1 introduction since the rapid economic development as a result of increased population the insufficiency of water resources has been a serious problem for many decades daghighi et al 2017 safe and pure drinking water is a must for any community where water resources must have some form of purification before utilization treatment of drinking water aims to produce safe biologically and chemically water for human consumption and applicable in terms of odor appearance and taste so the method involved in water treatment depends on the source of the raw water haghiri et al 2018 the process of water treatment affected greatly by seasonal variation in turbidity mcconnachie et al 1999 saritha et al 2017 turbidity caused by particulate suspended material such as clay minerals silt viruses bacteria algae some organic matters as well as inorganic matters in addition to contamination with pathogenic organisms heavy metals that affect human health and artificial organic chemicals that may be found and increase turbidity thus it is important to remove turbidity efficiently by removing contaminants that affect human health daryabeigi zand and hoveidi 2015 the final cost of water treatment must be taken into account in terms of water quality produced and operating efficiency haghiri et al 2018 ng et al 2016 standard turbidity in drinking water can be reached by conventional treatment technologies such as coagulation precipitation and filtration coagulation precipitation are considered as methods for drinking water treatment therefore the selection of coagulant is one of the most important factors for successful water treatment folkard et al 1996 liao and zhang 2018 nidheesh et al 2017 and have a pronounced influence on the treatment efficiency zheng et al 2011 2008 there are two stages to perform coagulation first rapid mixing of the coagulant with water takes place followed by a slow mixing process for flocculation process coagulation and flocculation occur successively until the adhesion between the molecules and formation of floc then sedimentation takes place dealing with low cost and high coagulation efficiency inorganic coagulants mainly aluminum salt and iron salts are widely applied wang et al 2017 the higher the positive charge of a coagulant the highest its removal efficiency of suspended solids the main drawbacks of the use of inorganic coagulant may alter the ph of water since they consume alkalinity in addition the formation of large amount of sludge after the treatment and the residual metal salt which would affect the safety of drinking water chen et al 2018 recently the research related to coagulation processes was focused on the use and production of environmentally friendly new and more effective coagulants therefore the researchers worked on polymeric aluminum termed polyaluminum chloride pac that could be used as an alternative for alum proposed for drinking water treatment zouboulis et al 2008 pac is an inorganic coagulant as aluminum sulphate that was used in water treatment to remove turbidity color and taste and had no effect on ph of treated water since 1980s pac not only used in water treatment but also in wastewater treatment it was reported that pac proved to be efficient in removing the precipitated phosphate heavy metals suspended solids and also to tends to virus inactivation jiang 2001 matsui et al 2003 mertens et al 2012 there are many types available commercially coagulants such as of polyaluminum that used for the treatment of water and wastewater nominated as pac and aluminum sulphate as consequently the use of polymers leads to higher effective density floc densification and thereby improved sedimentation velocity the properties of the settling process can be improved by using biopolymers as flocculants aids krentz et al 2006 vandamme et al 2014 the parameters such as size charge density are mostly affected on the activity of the utilized polymers krentz et al 2006 roselet et al 2015 it is preferred to use organic polymers more than metal salts since organic polymers used in a much lower dosage biodegradable organic flocculants do not result in residual accumulation does not affect the quality of water produced and is economically better than other coagulants pal et al 2005 vandamme et al 2010 the charge of those quaternary ammonium groups is independent of ph and therefore cst works over a broader ph range than chitosan vandamme 2013 vandamme et al 2010 starch is effective and cheap source and can be used in the coagulation process but its use is very limited because it has the ability to form gel and pastes bleeke et al 2015 pi xin et al 2009 accordingly ns should be altered chemically so that we can obtain desirable properties in the coagulation process el feky et al 2015 el hamshary et al 2015 2014 el naggar et al 2018 2015 el rafie et al 2011 the hydroxyl groups on the backbones of starch molecules are substituted by positively charged groups of quaternary ammonium cations glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cst has been prepared with different degree of substitutions ds depending on the amount of gtac that added to starch hereby the current research work was designed to compare the turbidity removal rate of 6 coagulant materials for removing and flocculating microalgae and suspended particles from river nile raw water intended for drinking water using traditional jar test coagulant materials conducted through this research are the most common inorganic coagulant aluminum sulphate as the synthesized cst with three different degree of substitutions ds and two concentrations of pac 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials native maize starch ns was kindly provided by the company of starch and yeast egypt glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac was purchased from sigma aldrich company usa two types of pac were obtained as a gift from gongyi xin qi chemical plant co china aluminum sulphate as was purchased from across fischer co germany all other materials or chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further modification 2 2 preparation of coagulant compounds 2 2 1 preparation of aluminum sulphate solution as aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o 1 solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g in 100 ml distilled water accordingly each one ml equivalent to 10mgal l aluminum sulphate solution as as coagulant agent was freshly prepared prior to its use in each experiment 2 2 2 preparation of polyaluminum chloride solution pac both types depend on its color as yellow pac and white pac a 1 g from each one was dissolved in 250 ml distilled water so each one ml equivalent to 0 25 mg al l 2 2 3 preparation of cationic starch cst native maize starch ns 5g was dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water containing 1 g of sodium hydroxide naoh and kept under mechanical stirring for 2 h at 40 c after complete dispersion of ns in naoh solution different concentrations of cationizing agent glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac 2 ml 4 ml and 6 ml was added dropwise to starch solution the solution was kept again under continuous mechanical stirring for another 6 h keeping into consideration the ph of the whole solution was adjusted to 7 via using acetic acid 0 001 m at the end of cationization process absolute ethanol was added dropwise to the solution to terminate the reaction and to precipitate cst the wet powder was added three times with ethanol h2o 70 30 to remove the unreacted compounds and to purify the formed cst for further purification dialysis against water was carried out the final dialyzed cst was dried using lab refrigerator at 80 c for 12 h and dried using freeze drying at 60 c the as produced fine powder was kept for further characterization and application the prepared samples of cst with different degree of substitutions ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 57 are coded with cst 0 34 cst 0 85 and cst 0 97 respectively 2 3 physical and chemical characterization 2 3 1 characterization of cationic starch cst the nitrogen content of the chemically modified starch etherified with glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac to yield cationic starch was determined via kjeldahl method and thus calculated as follow scanning electron microscope sem a jms 5600 electron microscope germany was used as a tool in order to characterize the morphologies of granular starch and cationic starches in order to examine the crystallinity of cationic starches and compared with that of native maize starch x ray diffraction xrd a philips pw1710 based diffractometer was used the formation of newly functional groups or the creation of newly bonds are for the as synthesized cationic starch are investigated using ftir technique a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrometer germany 2 3 2 characterization the efficiency of different coagulant determination the optimum coagulant concentration by jar test experiments subsurface raw water sample were collected from river nile and three jar tests replicates were carried out for each flocculent in order to determine the optimal concentration for 5 coagulant materials used the tests are performed according to the protocol of the jar test bulusu and sharma 1967 cohen 1957 and also according to the water treatment plant practice rapid mixing of 1 min at 200 rpm flash mixing of 20 min at 20 rpm settling time of 30 min the protocol includes using a flocculator which results in six beakers of a liter from raw water strictly identical and adjustable stirring period through a central control this method comprises introducing a coagulant material into a series of six 1 l beakers containing raw water with stirring for a short time 1 min but with a very high speed 200 rpm min and to ensure a very good dispersion of the reactants and a good chemical destabilization of colloids rapid stirring is followed by a flash stirring 20 rpm min for 20 min with a stirrer blades in order to promote contacting contiguous particles and avoid breaking the flocks formed flocculants concentrations were added as 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mg l for as and concentrations of 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 and 1 5 mg l for cationic starches yellow pac and white pac after 30 min of sedimentation the supernatant was siphoned to be analyzed the water turbidity removal rate after the reaction was used as the evaluation index for different flocculant used in addition to the change in ph and physico chemical parameters of water according to drinking water quality criteria pre chlorination experiment in egypt conventional drinking water treatment plants are including pre chlorination coagulation flocculation filtration and disinfection so after determination of the optimum dose of each coagulant pre chlorination experiment was carried out to determine the optimum chlorine dose mixed with the optimum dose of the different coagulants chlorine a saturated chlorine water solution was used the power of the available chlorine concentration was determined iodometrically before running experiment according to apha 2005 effect of coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacteria in this experiment a comparison was made to examine the effect of the tested coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacterial counts in surface water samples the experiments were conducted using pour plate method according to apha 2005 phytoplankton enumeration and taxonomic identification the phytoplankton present in the river nile water samples were identified and counted according to the key of freshwater algae hofbauer et al 2003 2 4 analytical methods parameters checked according to the who kurup et al 2010 and egyptian standards law no for 2007 for each of the quality of surface water used as a source of drinking water and the criteria of the quality drinking water after treatment with different coagulant materials the parameters include ph color temperature tr alkalinity ammonia sulphate nitrate do cod bod fluoride iron manganese for raw water criteria measured for treated water at this phase as turbidity ph residual aluminum total dissolved solids tds nitrate iron and manganese were analyzed in accordance with standard methods 3 result and discussion starch is categorized as insoluble carbohydrate polymers comprise linear and branched molecules amylose and amylopectin respectively the insolubility in water limits its application in many different domains however its modification through chemical reactions facilitate its widely application el feky et al 2015 el naggar et al 2018 2015 el rafie et al 2011 hebeish et al 2014b the reaction of maize starch with cationic agent gtac in presence of alkalizing agent naoh is called etherification reaction the etherification reaction can be occurred through the reaction of hydroxy functional groups of the anhydro glucose units of starch with the nucleophilic groups of gtac el naggar et al 2018 such cationic starch by and large has physicochemical properties that are significantly not quite the same as those of the native maize starch as great solubility and more functional groups starch bearing cationic groups scheme 1 a represent the schematic steps for the preparation and utilization of cationic starch different ds and pac as coagulants river nile water treatment while scheme 1 b displays the chemical structure of the utilized compounds for this purpose of coagulants csts with different ds was prepared using naoh 0 2 g g starch after many trials it is observed that above this concentration the hydrolysis of gtac can be occurred which in turn leads to opening the epoxide ring and cause the formation of side products diol product thus the amount of naoh was selected to minimize these side reactions 3 1 effect of gtac concentration on the ds of csts in terms of the nitrogen percent the degree of substitution of cst fig 1 displays the change of ds as a function with the change in the volume of gtac used for starch cationization it is detected that the ds of cst is 0 34 when the volume of gtac is 2 ml 5 g starch up on increasing the volume of gtac to 4 ml sharply increases the ds of the prepared csts 0 85 however a further increase in the volume of gtac to 6 ml the ds of cst is nearly constant 0 97 when compared with the value produced with using 4 ml of gtac 3 2 morphological structure of native maize starch and different cationic starches utilization of scanning electron microscopy sem aimed to contemplate the surface morphology of the native maize starch and after cationization process the images for native starch are taken at two different magnifications 400 and 1500 x as displayed in fig 2 a b respectively after starch modification the samples were submitted to morphological examination at two low and high magnifications 10 000 and 20 000 x cst prepared with different ds are shown in fig 2 b c for ds 0 34 d e for 0 85 and f g for ds 0 97 as shown from fig 2 a b that the granules of unmodified native maize starch have round and polygonal structure with well defined integrity on the other hand the effect of gtac as etherifying agent cause extensively changes the starch granule morphology at the point when the ds of cst 0 34 the cationic reagent penetrates the interior of the starch molecule and the starch granules are notably enlarged and begin to disintegrate as presented in fig 2 c d meanwhile the granules of the cst with ds 0 85 fig 2 e f is completely disintegrate or break down and their edges drastically lose definition it is also observed that there is no significant change in the structure of granules when the ds of cst increases to 0 97 fig 2 g h based on sem observations gtac destroys the structure of the maize granule starch and reduces hydrogen bonding accordingly the disintegration of starch granules enhances the swelling of cst which facilitates it dissolution in water 3 3 xrd of native and cationic starches to examine the change in crystallinity for native starch after etherification reaction with different concentration of gtac to yield cst with different degree of substitution xrd is performed for this matter and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the native maize starch exhibits an a type crystallinity pattern and the strong reflections are presented at 150 and 230 and unresolved doublet appears at 170 and 180 hebeish et al 2014a puchongkavarin et al 2003 it is clearly noted that the cationic agent has significant impact on the crystallinity of native starch gtac according to its concentration can damage the crystallinity pattern of the starches at ds 0 34 as shown from the upper figure on the right side that the crystallinity the a type crystallinity pattern of the starches is slightly weakened this result suggests that the crystallinity pattern of starch is partly damaged cst prepared with ds 0 85 exhibits single and broad peaks affirming the disappearance of crystallinity pattern of starch after modification up on increasing the concentration of gtac to 6 ml to prepare cst with ds 0 97 leads to completely damage the crystallinity pattern overall the formation of amorphous granules of cst encourage and affirm the utilization of cst as flocculants the reason for its utilization could be attributed to the colloidal solution during the addition to water it is notable that the solubility of polymers enhancing its utilization in wastewater treatment 3 4 ftir spectroscopy of native maize starch and cationic starches to define the structure of csts ftir spectra is urgently needed fig 4 displays the ftir spectra of native starch and csts prepared with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 as shown from the graph of native maize starch the typical absorptions appear at 3295 cm 1 and 2926 cm 1 are endorsed to hydroxyl groups o h and c h stretching vibration of the anhydro glucose units additionally the bands presented at 1167 cm 1 and 1015 cm 1 are ascribed to the c o bond stretching vibration regarding to the ftir spectra of csts they have characteristic bands which are nearly similar to the characteristic starch backbone peaks but with minor shift as shown in fig 4 in addition to the existence of band at 1510 cm 1 related to the quaternary ammonium groups c n pi xin et al 2009 in addition with an increasing ds the intensity of peaks at 1510 cm 1 is gradually strengthened which is clear evidence for the incorporation of a cationic moiety onto the backbone of the starch pal et al 2005 3 5 characterization of river nile water intended for potable water there is no doubt that surface water cannot be used as drinking water without treatment as surface water has a high turbidity high content of microorganisms such as algae and bacteria in addition to other substances that may cause danger to human health thus the water must go through treatment stages that make it suitable to the standard specifications for drinking water postolachi et al 2015 table 1 presents the average characteristic properties of raw river nile water the results indicate that river nile water is moderately alkaline and most of surface water criteria are in the allowable range except for the chemical oxygen demand cod values are out of the acceptable range this is may be attributed to the increase and change in algal count and algal biomass of river nile water ramadan and shehata ramadan and shehata 1976 and shehata et al shehata et al 1997 stated that when comparing to the amount of algae before and after the construction of the high dam it was found that the numbers of algae have increased to tenfold after the construction of the high dam due to the change in flow rate and turbidity levels turbidity a measure of the scattering and absorption of light in water is dependent on the characteristics of the particles that are scattering the light specifically concentration grain size grain shape refractive index and color voichick et al 2018 3 6 finding the optimum coagulant dosages for turbidity removal turbidity can also provide food and may lead to the formation of pathogenic organisms and water borne diseases in the distribution system moreover coagulant materials and coagulation dosage are considered the most important factors on which the success of the coagulation process is based on therefore it is significant to determine the best coagulant and optimum dosage to minimize the dosing cost and sludge formation and also to obtain the optimum performance in drinking water treatment plant patel and vashi 2013 fig 5 illustrates a comparison of turbidity removal efficiency of 6 coagulant materials used to specify its optimum coagulant dose with the initial turbidity and ph of the water sample are 7 8 ntu and 7 6 ntu the use of aluminum sulphate as a most common coagulant in a gradual increase of concentrations showed a proportional increase in turbidity removal of the treated samples fig 5a also the figure indicated the optimum aluminum sulphate dose can be detected at 20 mg al l with percentage removal of turbidity was 69 2 the most important drawback of alum as a coagulant is the change in ph value where it decreases by increase in alum concentration the obtained results are in accordance with those obtained by volk et al 2000 and dominguez et al 2007 indicated that within all the factors involved in coagulation flocculation process those that most affect the process efficiency are ph and coagulant dose turbidity removal efficiency as a function of 3 types of csts and at different doses and at the same initial turbidity and ph values is observed in fig 5b the results indicated that the three type of cst have different optimum doses and different turbidity removal efficiency the optimum coagulant dose of csts prepared with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 with removal percentage 46 2 61 5 and 61 5 is 0 75 0 5 and 1 mg l respectively fig 5c reveal the results of using pac yellow and white in coagulation process the results showed that the optimum dose for both compounds were 20 mg l where turbidity removal percentage reached 77 2 and 84 6 for pac yellow and white respectively in addition fig 6 shows the sem images for algae flocs formed after the coagulation process using different coagulants as we can see from fig 6a the algae cells were loosely bound by flocs formed in the al2 so4 3 however in fig 6 b c d the algae cells were easily captured by the flocs formed in cst with different ds 0 34 0 85 and 0 97 respectively which benefited the floc aggregation for formation of tightly bounded algae flocs concerning to pac chlorides as in fig 6 e f it was found that the flocs formed in the 2 pacs were different fewer cells imbedded small flocs formed in yellow pac fig 6e however flocs of larger cells were formed in white pac fig 6f this result can directly prove the positive function of csts and yellow pac in improving coagulation and aggregation of algae cell without damage cell membrane integrity and agglomerate the suspended matter from the raw water the coagulation behavior of pac yellow and white was also evaluated as mentioned before the initial turbidity and ph value of the raw nile river water was 7 8 ntu and 7 6 since the applied coagulant doses were 0 25 1 5 mg pac l for both compounds various dosages of pac were examined for the treatment of surface water and for the removal of suspended solids ranging from 0 25 up to1 5 mg al l the percentage removal of turbidity to determine the optimum dose are 65 4 and 71 8 for both pac compounds and it obtained at concentration of 0 25mgal l annadurai et al 2004 found that the application of slightly increased pac dosages e g 1 35 mg al l resulted in treated water with a turbidity similar to water quality was obtained as by the addition of higher alum dosage e g 1 70 mg al l in addition zand and hoveidi daryabeigi zand and hoveidi 2015 results showed that the highest turbidity removal efficiency was within 82 9 99 0 for alum and 93 8 99 6 for poly aluminum chloride over the applied range of turbidity both applied coagulants demonstrated promising performance in turbidity removal from water however poly aluminum chloride showed better performance compared to aluminum sulphate the results of the current study can be used as a baseline data for drinking water treatment facilities which uses these two types of flocculants 3 7 changes in water quality criteria as a function of different coagulant materials drinking water quality criteria including ph turbidity total dissolved solids temperature total hardness calcium hardness magnesium hardness chloride sulphate ammonia nitrite nitrate iron and manganese in addition to residual aluminum were determined to detect the effect of different flocculent materials used all coagulant materials used in this investigation have no pronounced change on drinking water quality criteria e g total dissolved solids nitrate iron and manganese table 2 a pronounced change can be detected in ph as well as residual aluminum although residual al after coagulation with al2 so4 3 still comply with quality standard but it higher than that obtained after coagulation with both pac used no change in ph value can be detected after coagulation with the three cst compounds and two pac compounds in a comparison with that occurred in alum coagulation turbidity removal after chlorination reached maximum percentage 73 using cst 0 97 3 8 conventional treatment the following results cover the information yielded from river nile water algal removal using prechlorination followed by chemical coagulants chlorine break point chlorination during the period of investigation was 3 4 mg l which is suitable for algal content of raw nile water algae table 3 the percentage for algal removal was 100 for blue green algae after mixing the optimum chlorine dose with the optimum dose of the different coagulants for total algal removal csts were better than pacs where the percentage of algal removal reached 94 8 using cst 0 97 which clarify that the reduction of turbidity to 73 as mentioned in table 3 3 9 effect of coagulant substances on total heterotrophic bacteria adequate water treatment for surface water to meet the stipulated drinking water standards is essential to remove impurities turbidity and bacteria this can be guided through the addition of coagulants and disinfectants so a bench scale study for testing the effect of coagulants on total heterotrophic bacterial counts was conducted the results obtained by comparing with the control raw water without any addition bench scale testing of coagulants effect on total heterotrophic bacterial counts show that all tested coagulants have a great effect on total counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant table 4 without using chlorine the results indicated that all coagulants have a weak antibacterial effect reduction of total heterotrophic bacterial counts ranged from 99 5 to 99 9 in the presence of chlorine fig 7 without using chlorine total heterotrophic bacterial counts reduced by 79 8 97 81 9 79 8 92 2 and 88 8 with using aluminum sulphate alum white pac yellow pac cst 0 34 cst 0 85 and cst 0 97 respectively as coagulants 4 conclusion the main factor in the efficacy of the coagulation process in water treatment is the removal of turbidity preliminary jar test was carried out to determine the optimum dose for five coagulants al so4 3 cst 0 34 0 85 0 97 and pac yellow and white chlorination coagulation process was then done using the optimum dose of each compound to figure out the best coagulant in treatment process native starch is a carbohydrate polymer an abundant in nature cost effective its utilization in many different applications is inadequate due to its insolubility in water thus chemical modification in necessity to enhance its solubility beside to create active functional groups suitable for water purification cationic agent such as glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac was used as etherifying agent to generate positive charges on starch glucose treatment of raw water with cationic starch cst and pac is achieved with an improvement of the water quality without addition of aluminum sulphate ions using chlorination coagulation process improved the treatment process and proved that cst 0 97 has the highest percentage of turbidity and total algal count removal 73 and 94 8 respectively coagulants effect on total heterotrophic bacterial counts show that all tested coagulants have a great effect on total counts in the presence of chlorine as a disinfectant especially cst 0 97 where percentage of removal reached 99 8 in other words applied cst demonstrated promising performance in turbidity and bacterial removal without any significant changes in drinking water quality and so the use of cationic starch cst for drinking water treatment is environmentally benign polymer declaration of competing interest we wish

12194,the delineation of the groundwater resource gwr zone is one of the challenging tasks for the research domain of hydrogeologists and decision makers in this study thematic inventory of existing ancillary data and remotely sensed data sets were used for targeting the gwr zones at microscale different geology geomorphological and hydrological parameters thematic layers have been prepared to determine the groundwater resources zones further gwr zones were validated with the results carried out by the resistivity imaging tomography data wenner dipole dipole and pole dipole array methods portraying six electrical resistivity tomography ert characterised by 40 electrodes channels was used for geophysical analysis the study result discovers two aquifer pockets in perched condition in good association with hydrogeomorphological variables to enhance the groundwater supply in study area a few recharged pits and trenches are being suggested for immediate construction in the upper reaches of the jnv campus thus the search for a suitable location of groundwater source in the small basin located at active tectonic area of the lesser himalaya i e simar watershed covering 4 62 km2 was carried out as stated by the result of geospatial analysis showing two strong accumulations cum recharging pockets located in the nnw portion of jnv campus which are big source of groundwater further validated by the 2 d resistivity as high potential groundwater zone graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater resource thematic inventory active tectonic zone ert hydrogeomorphology 1 introduction groundwater resource is an unenduring natural component of the environment particularly in the tropical climo morphogenic region of the world rather it is very much confined within its unique geological setting in the folded mountainous region like the himalaya it has grabbed in selected places based on its neotectonic actions on the other hand growing population concentration along with various anthropogenic activities has already been created a wide demand of potable water as it plays an important role not only for survival of the organisms but also for civilization growth of modern human society even till the last decade of 20th century the large part of european countries was depended on groundwater for water supply chilton 1996 gyeltshen et al 2019 groundwater is the most valuable natural resource but limited in nature the chance to hold the water in the rock bodies is a function of their types origin age voids in forms of fractures or fissures and consolidated nature todd and mays 2012 its availability varies from place to place and season to season under the influence of different hydrological settings suhag 2016 rahmati et al 2016 for folded mountain regions due to its complex geometry sometimes it is quite difficult to find water below the surface so this is also linked with the identification of geological barriers in the hilly terrain which became a hindrance to groundwater accumulation presently all the hilly regions of himalayas are under water stressed areas for the drinking water supply and india is going to face a severe water crisis for drinking purposes due to improper management of water resources singh et al 2017 thakkar 2019 still a large chunk of the himalayan population is dependent on the groundwater for its domestic and agricultural needs and the main source of water supply in the mountainous regions arise chiefly from excavated wells and from boreholes that are placed along major streams and valleys jasrotia and kumar 2014 jasrotia et al 2019b bhat et al 2019 prior to the installation of boreholes or wells in the mountainous region the identification and targeting of the groundwater zone are vital for decision makers the folded mountain region like the himalaya exhibits extensive hydrogeological varieties and thus storage flow and movement process of groundwater are also highly controlled by the complex geomorphological and structural characteristics although it is also found that in the mountain region the groundwater ejects on the surface in the forms of springs either as seasonal or permanent chilton 1996 from the last three decades remote sensing and geographic information systems gis have opened new paths for groundwater studies krishnamurthy et al 2000 satellite imageries offer quick and useful baseline information on parameters like lineaments geology geomorphology drainage and land use land cover etc saraf and choudhary 1998 remote sensing and gis techniques have been applied successfully for groundwater prospecting and recharge sites karanth 1987 jasrotia et al 2011 2019a naghibi et al 2016 and integrated remote sensing and gis techniques have also been used to delineate groundwater potential zones srinivasa and jugran 2003 anuradha and prabhavathy 2010 oh et al 2011 jasrotia et al 2016 gyeltshen et al 2019 in hard rock topography groundwater availability is limited and groundwater occurrence in such rocks is mainly restricted to fractured and weathered horizons kumar and kumar 2010 the evaluation of groundwater reserves require studies and surveys that identify areas with high potential for exploration to anticipate the imminent geophysical surveys which are expensive and time consuming practice neal 2004 arabameri et al 2019 in the present day scenario implementing remote sensing techniques in the field of groundwater hydrogeology becomes one of the broadly accepted attempts in domain of earth sciences bonham carter 1994 neal 2004 ganapuram et al 2009 jasrotia et al 2013 2018 nampak et al 2014 lee et al 2018 adimalla and taloor 2020 the integration of geological and hydrogeological surveys along with the remote sensing inputs can provide better result for such type of investigation depending upon the slope nature gradient and direction rock types vegetations adaptation presence of lineaments surface water bodies drainage systems network of channels flow accumulation over the surface the availability and nature of groundwater also differ the electrical resistivity tomography ert has already shown its efficiency for the assessment of groundwater condition stan and stan kleczek 2014 the integration between remote sensing and geophysical measures can give a fair understanding of all these physical factors using remote sensing techniques it is very effective to delineate geological and geomorphological structures over the earth surface alam et al 2017 2018 taloor et al 2017 2019 chen et al 2019 kothyari et al 2019 the advanced utility of resistivity techniques to monitor the groundwater scenario in the piedmont zone of himalayas revealed excellent results israil et al 2006 as such types of geo structural settings put interesting issues for the delineation of groundwater source point especially in the water crisis areas located near human habitats using this integrated approach the present study shows the scope to use freely available remotely sensed data along with resistivity survey a way towards the cost effective inventory work which helps in exploring the location having high possibility of groundwater resources and its long term sustainability the major objectives of the present study are to determine the geohydrological evolution of high gradient hilly land surface in lesser himalaya developed on hard metasedimentary rocks highly controlled by the active tectonic activity to investigate the present hydrogeomorphological scenario in and around simar watershed a small watershed located in the left bank of river gomti and to find out the groundwater zones for sustainable supply of water resources in the study area 2 study area the present study area located 17 km northwest of bageshwar town in the left bank of gomti river known as simar watershed fig 1 a c being located in the lap of lesser and central himalaya zone on rugged diversified and steep topography temperate to sub humid climatic conditions with severe and long winter which creates a dry hydrological environment the groundwater is highly discontinued due to the unfavourable geohydrological conditions and repeated tectonic disturbance besides steep ground slope the formation of hard rock strata with lineaments develops poor groundwater recharge probability in the study area the occurrence and movement of groundwater depends not only on the nature of the litho units and the nature of the interspaces interstices but also on the degree of interconnection between them vertical and aerial extension of joints faults and or shear zones and the local and regional geomorphology groundwater emerges as springs and seepage locally called srots and naolas under favourable physiographic conditions such as in gently sloping areas broad valleys of rivers and along with the lithological contacts the dominant occupant of simar watershed is jawahar navodaya vidyalaya jnv along with few isolated human settlements like simar village in the northwest and bimrari in southeast geologically the study area is found in the baijnath crystalline unit a part of almora nappe which is constituted of mesograde metasediments and intimately associated with granitic rock valdiya 1980 according to heim and gansser 1939 gansser 1964 the limits of this nappe are respectively marked by the outcrops of the folded almora and baijnath thrust plane the baijnath crystalline unit is surrounded by bilani and sandra formations in the south composed of shale siltstone and slate the northern part of study area is covered by sandra formation and upper deoban formation composed of thin limestone shale and quartzite fig 1c 3 dataset and methodology high spatial resolution earth observatory eo freely available data have been used from different open source and free downloadable data domains table 1 along with various large to medium scale thematic maps an integrated conceptual method framework has been carried out in the study fig 2 divided into three parts thematic inventory and spatial data mining based on the various secondary sources have been carried out in the pre field stage after preparing different thematic maps one map regarding the groundwater resource zone has been prepared using geo visualization and simple overlay techniques using the soft computing platform earth resistivity tomography ert instrument used for collection of ground based resistivity data finally the validation of gis based output with geophysical data and field investigations 3 1 geovisualization and thematic inventory of hydrogeomorphological parameters for the geological understanding eo data of different bands of landsat 8 oli have been used for the band rationing and band combination tools the band combination of landsat 8 oli band 10 tir band7 swir and band 3 visible green has been used for after high pass filtering 3 3 after the suppression of speckles in the images with the function of co efficient of var 1 0 for the features extraction of the local landscape on the other hand the combination between band 7 swir 5 nir and 1 visible blue is used for the wet and dry characteristics of the surface i e soil and crystalline rocky surface respectively generally these two surface conditions are found in a similar tone in other bands of optical image by using pca 1 on sfcc of natural colour and nir different mineralogical compositions of surface components have been extracted for the study area fig 3 a b for the understanding of the hydrological environment the entire simar watershed area has been divided into ten sub watersheds based on the existing lower ordered river channels to gain the total picture all the existing channels ephemeral seasonal and permanent have been considered for delineating the sub watershed and these all are marked a to j arbitrarily fig 4 a based on the geo visualizing method all the streams have been mapped from the landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 data to make a base map of channel networks for the study area on the basis of the base map different hydrological assessment measures have been carried out sub watershed scale using soft computation tools based on the various formula table 2 by using remote sensing data sentinel 2 the ratio of specific bands is able to delineate the fixed theme like the ratio between visible red and nir known as ndvi depicts the ground scenario of photosynthesis active vegetation and its concentration the ndvi has been calculated by the following formula after serrano et al 2019 ndvi nir visible red nir visible red where ndvi normalized difference vegetation index nir near infrared similarly rationing between green band 3 of sentinel 2 and nir band 8 of sentinel 2 has been used for the estimation of surface moisture condition using the following formula after mcfeeters 1996 du et al 2016 ndwi green nir green nir where ndvi normalized difference vegetation index nir near infrared where ndwi normalized difference water index nir near infrared after preparation of the surface water accumulation the geo morphological and lineaments map have been overlaid and subsequently all the map superimposed on the landsat in google engine for extracting the exact location for the groundwater source point 3 2 collection of field data through geological and geophysical survey during the field survey different instruments both minor and geophysical have been used for assessing and validate the exact position of groundwater source point for the structural assessment simple geological techniques have been implied with the help of measuring tape compass etc resistivity is now a well accepted technique which is also equal to the recertocal of conductivity Ï 1 Ï in geophysical survey table 3 classifies orientation and direction of geoelectric resistivity sections portrayed by six electrical resistivity tomography ert profiles characterized with 40 electrodes channels which has been carried out a b c d e f g h i j and k l in the different parts of the jnv campus and its surroundings fig 4b based on the nature of ground gradient repeated surveys with different arrays have been performed and the array with lowest root mean square rms has been considered for final assessment and thus the electrical properties of the area the associated imprints of groundwater zone and resistivity of rocks were determined 2 d multiple ert profiles have been prepared with the help of wenner dipole dipole and wenner dipole array and used on the bases of accessibility based on the space availability and surface gradient electrodes are placed at 1 m 5 m distance and the depth of the sections varies 12 36 m from the surface graphical representation of all the geo spatial and geophysical understanding is made by using different soft computation softwares all pseudo section data used for tomography mapping 2 d has undergone necessary topographic corrections and removal of errors talking about wenner array method where all the 40 electrodes are collinear and the separations between adjacent electrodes are equal the potential electrodes are between the current electrodes the advantage of this array is that it has excellent vertical resolution but poor lateral resolution by increasing the electrode number sensitivity of horizontal changes can also be improved loke et al 2010 the dipole dipole array has the advantage of relatively low em coupling between the current and potential electrodes loke 2011 it is very sensitive to horizontal changes in resistivity and in two dimensional survey it gives better horizontal coverage loke 2011 on the other hand wenner dipole dipole shows both the horizontal as well as vertical resolution in this geoelectric resistivity survey two sets of cables comprising 40 multi electrode switch boxes using two sets of 20 electrodes are used at 2 5 1 1 5 1 1 and 2 m spacing along straight lines of a b c d e f g h i j and k l respectively the last electrode at the end of section was attached with the earth resistivity meter for the uninterrupted current supply the measurements survey parameters and type of array adopted was monitored by geotest version 2 44 which also controls the geoelectric equipment in combination with many electrodes through multi electrode geo electrics it produced a graphical representation of the recorded subsurface apparent resistivity the measured apparent resistivity data was processed in a two dimensional 2d inversion software res2dinv geotomo based on smoothness constrain gauss newton least squares inversion of apparent resistivity pseudo sections loke and barker 1996 to check the calculated resistivity section a finite difference finite element forward modelling subroutine was used to calculate the true resistivity values of the model the readings were cross checked by repeating the survey in forward as well as backward directions to obtain the true resistivity 13 to 25 iterations have been performed and the rms error found to be 1 56 4 3 3 3 validation and integration of eo data with geophysical output the outputs of gis thematic layers and geophysical assessments have been integrated through overlaid analysis using soft computation tools during this validation the resistivity sections have also been considered along with the other associated variable like the concentration of vegetation patches agricultural practices spring location and their permanency perception of local people etc the final map shows the exact location of groundwater aquifer with its approximate volume 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 hydrogeomorphological characteristics of the study area being located in active tectonic belt of himalaya different types of geological complexity have been found through geospatial understanding since it is also located in the southern face of the lesser himalaya its geohydrological characteristics are also very much significance for the groundwater condition after all the unique geological setup along with the active tectonic features in and around the study area gives a complete portray fig 5 a d 4 1 1 geological characteristics the strike arrangement is found in nne to ssw direction and the dip is stretched towards nnw having the amount of 10â° to 40â° in the jnv campus and surrounding area but in the northern portion the simar watershed dip is 55â° towards sw direction based on the relation between lineaments fig 5a underground geological structure and topographic formation it can be assessed that one kind of inversion of topography has evolved in this study area by using pca 1 on standard false colour composition sfcc of natural colour and nir different mineralogical composition of surface component has been extracted fig 5b by using the band combination technique of landsat 8 oli band no 10 tir 7 swir and 3 visible green various kinds of geological features have been extracted from the local landscape fig 5c and the wet and dry characteristics of surface i e soil and crystalline rocky surface in the image output the light blue colour represents the settlement area built up environment i e building roads and other infrastructures deep blue shows the water flow portion of the river channel and cyan indicates the sand deposited area in the river channel and also in its surroundings yellow coloured patches show the alluvium deposited piedmonts of hills here all the hills are precipitous in nature which are appeared in red to brown colour fig 5d as shown in false colour composite fcc whereas the combination between band 7 swir 5 nir and 1 visible blue shows structural output of major features using speckle suppression and high pass 3 3 technique fig 5d in fcc the detail surface mineralogical composition has been proposed in table 4 as the simar watershed is developed by outlier formation of almora nappe located on the syncline belt its geological succession is fully inversion of topography in nature the hills and ridges are made off by older crystalline rocks through the process of metamorphism the eroded ferrous leached components are deposited on the piedmont area a few streams have able to developed fans in the foothills areas where ground slopes are found in abrupt change these fans are mainly composed by pebbles rock fragments and debris i e colluvial fans the narrow and wide are also developed in the study area mainly composed with pebbles and coarse sands 4 1 2 geomorphological characteristics the simar watershed has a fifth order drainage system of the gomti river ranges from 950 to 1466 m fig 6 a wide morphological variation has been found within the little span of coverage has been described in table 5 since the simar watershed is located in the southern face of baijnath ridge which is fully controlled and evolved by under the influence of baijnath formation valdiya 1980 different types of complex fluvial processes are found in this watershed fig 6b escarpment slope scarp faces are also noticed in the steep and highly dissected area through the rapid and high energetic down cutting process of the fluvial system the ruggedness development of the watershed shows that the scarp faces have a high level of ratio value more than 75 along with the high slope a few isolated narrow valleys are also developed near to these scarp faces and formed gorge like narrow valley structure on the other hand areas occupied by structural hill slopes have high to moderate ruggedness ratio values rages from 41 to 58 and ground slope is also moderate with varying direction with wide valley fig 6c d head ward eroded areas are also clearly noticed in few pockets located near to the steep and scarp faces areas in the downhill portion two different pockets of colluvial fans have been marked over the gentle to moderate slope areas one is located in the sub watershed d at the north western portion of jnv campus and two another colluvial fans are found in the down valley of i and j sub watersheds at bamrari these are developed over the fragmented quartzite basement with 36â° 41â° dipping at nnw direction the composition of these two fans is mixed shared with boulders debris and granulated regoliths with the metasedimentary rocks in its basement the soil profile is not well developed here but the soil depth is found 5 cm 12 cm during field observation these fans are used for the fruits orchard and seasonal cultivation the drainage system is quite complex in nature primarily the rectangular pattern has been initiated due to the alternate position of soft and hard rock but different kinds of tectonic activity along with the development of fracture joints and isolated slip surface created the structural controlled drainage patterns 4 1 3 hydrological characteristics the analysis of hydrological variables has been carried out with the help of arc gis software for this characterization drainage density length of overland flow in km km2 constant of channel maintenance channel flow accumulation and mean bifurcation ratio rb the direction of flow have been determined by grid based measurement technique the drainage density dd lay emphasis on spacing among the streams thus providing quantitative measure of length of stream within square grid of the area in terms of km km2 strahler 1964 being considered as an inverse function of permeability the drainage density indirectly indicates the permeability and porosity of the terrain due to its relationship with surface runoff fig 7 a and the drainage density in the study area varies from 4 4 to 8 4km km2 the simar area has very low drainage density whereas the area located above the jnv campus has a high drainage density length of overland flow lof is a length of water over the ground before it gets concentrated into certain stream channels used as a measure of non channel water flow above the earth s surface horton 1945 it independently influences the topsoil detachment transportation and more effective on gently sloped areas rather than steep slope areas low value of lof indicates high relief short flow paths more runoff and less infiltration which leads to more vulnerable to the flash flooding meanwhile a high value of lof means gentle slopes and long flow paths more infiltration and reduced runoff in the study area lof values ranges from 0 125 to 0 058 higher lof value areas indicating high chance of seepage flow and found near the simar settlement area as it is located in the foothill portion and having a gentle slope condition along with the loose materials the process of lof is quite strong compared to the other area of watershed fig 7b owing to the presence of hard rock surface in the upper portion of study area lof is very negligible schumm 1954 introduced constant of channel maintenance as the ratio between the area of a drainage basin and total length of all the channels the constant of channel maintenance ccm plays an important role for the accumulation of surface flow through the runoff process the importance of this constant is that it provides a quantitative expression of the minimum limiting area required for the development of a length of channel high value of ccm denotes that large area is required to produce surface flow since this area is fully covered with the hard crystalline rock and characterized by steep slope the ccm value in the most of the study area is low and lower value of ccm represents less chances of infiltration with high surface runoff the study area fig 7c shows that the maximum area has a very low value of ccm and high discharge of surface runoff occurs only during the rainy season on the other hand accumulation of channel flow cfa denotes the water accumulation capacity in the channel during the time of peak discharge cells with a high flow accumulation are areas of concentrated flow and may be used to identify stream channels in the study area high accumulation is found along the higher order streams fig 7d bifurcation ratio rb is the proportion of the total number of streams in a given order to the total number streams of the next higher order horton 1945 low rb value point towards less geologic controls and direct the less distortion in drainage development higher values of rb denoted the dominance of overland flow and flash flood risk during heavy rainstorm event kanth and hassan 2012 the rb values throughout the simar watershed ranges from and 1 to 3 75 fig 8 a the highest value of the bifurcation ratio is found in the e stream system which denotes the utmost controlled of the geological activity and complex river system besides the j stream system d is also contribution more balanced rb it is determined by materials of underlying surface type and amount of vegetation cover and relief properties based on the direction of flow map fig 8b it can be concluded that maximum area has the south directional flow regime and only a few pockets have northern flowing capacity which is also being highly controlled by structural constraints of local geology 4 1 4 other associated variables there are certainly a few other variables that play an important role in the assessment of the groundwater resources and its associated characterization vegetation related associations like its development arrangement types and seasonal variation were measured by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi by using the optical remote sensing data fig 8c very low values of ndvi 0 1 and below correspond to barren areas rocky surface sand or snow moderate values represent shrub and grassland 0 2 0 3 while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests 0 6 0 8 in the study area value ranges from 0 17 to 0 58 the value of ndvi in the lying area of the simar watershed area is quite high as most of the area is covered with seasonal shrubs in the upper reaches owing to the presence of bare ground composed with hard crystalline rocks it is low the area under bare surface have also been noticed throughout the year and these areas are basically located in the steep cum scarp slope dissected types of morphological units results in the scatter vegetation mainly pine has been grown over most of the study area but the patches of orchards of pyrus naspati and banana trees are also noticed in the western portion jnv campus these are also found in the area composed of debris boulder and loose unconsolidated material the ability to holding the moisture over the land surface area was also measured by the normalized difference water index ndwi is a satellite derived index from the near infrared nir and green bands are known to be strongly related to the plant water content considered as a very good proxy for plant water stress fig 8d particularly in the hilly terrain and these all variables are more vital for the targeting the underground water assessment in the piedmont plain and the area covered by the colluvial fan large land segments has compact vegetation fig 9 a c which is suitable for soil moisture bearing activity the ndwi value has also shown same characteristics in the simar watershed outside the simar locality the maximum negative values of ndwi which means a high probability of moisture concentration is found in three pockets which are the pour points or mouth portions of c subwatershed two spots are located in extreme northwest side of jnv campus and in the bamrari locality out of these three places simar and bamrari are old settlement areas located in the piedmont zone and local inhabitants are completely depended on the groundwater resource on these pockets on the other hand jnv campus is located on the colluvial fan developed over the meta sedimentary rocky surface and it is observed from the lineament map that jnv campus is surrounded by high lineament concentration fig 9d which makes the locality a good prospect zone of groundwater occurrence although the sub watershed e and j also have moderate nature of surface water accumulation and the rest of the other sub watershed area has low to very low nature of ndwi 4 2 geophysical characteristics geophysical techniques play a pivotal role in investigating the groundwater prospects with very high accuracy the resistivity outputs in the study area show a significant result in section a b designed in the dry bed of the gomti river fig 10 a b with rms error 2 4 and located on the left side of river permanent channel the wenner dipole dipole array output shows an almost negligible presence of groundwater in this section a thin pocket of water concentration zone has been noticed in this section but it is confined in three pockets within the depth up to 14 m from the ground having less than 184 Ï m the reason behind this is surface infiltration from various channels underneath this region there was high conductive material concentration covering rest of the section at the surface 0 7 45 m the haphazard concentration of large buried boulders of quartzite found in the area also indicates the very high conductivity nature two very small spots are also demarcated at the surface portion which indicates the channels of small tributaries gomti river since the wenner dipole dipole method creates better vertical and horizontal resolutions it clearly demarcates the thin pocket of soil moisture concentration section c d shows a well built accumulation of groundwater which stretches from surface of the section at 8 m depth since the section was developed on the playground and the ground has a strong retaining wall at near to c point a vast water storage zone has been developed towards c it is actually a stock of infiltrated water stored in the filling portion of playground in the same way channels of sub watershed d water infiltrated strongly and formed pursed water storage at the surface portion of e f section located at 25 m 55 m distance from e station but due to the presence of a large hard and metamorphic rock having more than 3100 ohm m resistivity beneath this storage this pursed storage is not able to develop permanent aquifer on the other way an aquifer pocket has been noticed towards f station 79 m from the first electrode foot of scarp cliff location along with the deposition of loose materials creates this aquifer in a long sustainable condition section g h shows the absence of strong groundwater pocket although the section was developed across the colluvial fan associated with agriculture firm but the section i j which was expanded along the colluvial fan confirms the presence of one strong and big aquifer along with one moist cum porous pocket and surface accumulation zone similarly the section k l indicates one big aquifer at 5 m 13 m depth and it extends about 41 m 92 m from the first electrode and just beneath this aquifer lies a giant impervious hard rock mass having the resistivity more than 4000 Ï m as well as bounded by porous materials in three sides refer to fig 4b as the surface has 10â° to 25â° slope towards the k station it has the ability to recharge very frequently by the surface flow and spring owing to the favourable condition and good soil water plant interaction the adaptation and growth of banana trees fig 11 a has also much sustained particularly on the surface portion of this section targeted groundwater source area marked by orange colour circle fig 9a d indicates the location aquifers at a distance of 130 m from the first electrode there is a permanent spring which further validates the remote sensing based earth observations fig 11b 5 conclusion in this study intensive and scientific investigations were made based on the integration of geospatial and geophysical techniques which able to investigate the groundwater prospects with very high accuracy the techniques of remote sensing made it possible to spatially analysis the micro zoning imprints of water availability which can easily be validated through the geophysical information as groundwater resources is not well distributed for mass consumption in the study area but the engineering and technical measures are the only possible ways to sustain these aquifers for long term as these are located on the hard and meta sedimentary rock aquifers can easily be recharged through the surface accumulated water so a few recharged pits and trenches are being suggested for immediate construction in the upper reaches of the jvn campus the colluvial fan area of the upper reaches of jvn campus which are located along the section k l has the capability to recharge the ground surface with very good infiltration capacity from the sheet flow and spring discharge for the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the jnv area structural measures along with engineering inputs are being needed to recharge the groundwater resource and aquifer as active based on the results study has exhumed a few observations that the hydrogeomorphology of the study area is totally different from the beijnath formation and there is a wide range of variability in terms of geomorphology and tectonic imprints the local slope is very steep at the hill portion there is little chance to infiltrate meanwhile the rocks of hills are meta sedimentary quartzite dominated so the piedmont plain and downhill areas have significant capacity to infiltrate the surface water and due to the presence of hard rocks during the rainy season these infiltrated water leached out to the main channel of gomti river the area of jnv campus surrounded by two small tributaries of gomti river with quite extended catchment area which have a good scope to accumulate rainwater during monsoon period and supported by the good number of lineaments the uniqueness of vegetation concentration is indicating the good amount of surface water accumulation in the nnw portion of jnv campus with lithology structure slope lineaments the result of geospatial analysis shows two strong accumulations cum recharging pockets located in the nnw parts of jnv campus which is a big source of groundwater further validated by the

introduction groundwater resource is an unenduring natural component of the environment particularly in the tropical climo morphogenic region of the world rather it is very much confined within its unique geological setting in the folded mountainous region like the himalaya it has grabbed in selected places based on its neotectonic actions on the other hand growing population concentration along with various anthropogenic activities has already been created a wide demand of potable water as it plays an important role not only for survival of the organisms but also for civilization growth of modern human society even till the last decade of 20th century the large part of european countries was depended on groundwater for water supply chilton 1996 gyeltshen et al 2019 groundwater is the most valuable natural resource but limited in nature the chance to hold the water in the rock bodies is a function of their types origin age voids in forms of fractures or fissures and consolidated nature todd and mays 2012 its availability varies from place to place and season to season under the influence of different hydrological settings suhag 2016 rahmati et al 2016 for folded mountain regions due to its complex geometry sometimes it is quite difficult to find water below the surface so this is also linked with the identification of geological barriers in the hilly terrain which became a hindrance to groundwater accumulation presently all the hilly regions of himalayas are under water stressed areas for the drinking water supply and india is going to face a severe water crisis for drinking purposes due to improper management of water resources singh et al 2017 thakkar 2019 still a large chunk of the himalayan population is dependent on the groundwater for its domestic and agricultural needs and the main source of water supply in the mountainous regions arise chiefly from excavated wells and from boreholes that are placed along major streams and valleys jasrotia and kumar 2014 jasrotia et al 2019b bhat et al 2019 prior to the installation of boreholes or wells in the mountainous region the identification and targeting of the groundwater zone are vital for decision makers the folded mountain region like the himalaya exhibits extensive hydrogeological varieties and thus storage flow and movement process of groundwater are also highly controlled by the complex geomorphological and structural characteristics although it is also found that in the mountain region the groundwater ejects on the surface in the forms of springs either as seasonal or permanent chilton 1996 from the last three decades remote sensing and geographic information systems gis have opened new paths for groundwater studies krishnamurthy et al 2000 satellite imageries offer quick and useful baseline information on parameters like lineaments geology geomorphology drainage and land use land cover etc saraf and choudhary 1998 remote sensing and gis techniques have been applied successfully for groundwater prospecting and recharge sites karanth 1987 jasrotia et al 2011 2019a naghibi et al 2016 and integrated remote sensing and gis techniques have also been used to delineate groundwater potential zones srinivasa and jugran 2003 anuradha and prabhavathy 2010 oh et al 2011 jasrotia et al 2016 gyeltshen et al 2019 in hard rock topography groundwater availability is limited and groundwater occurrence in such rocks is mainly restricted to fractured and weathered horizons kumar and kumar 2010 the evaluation of groundwater reserves require studies and surveys that identify areas with high potential for exploration to anticipate the imminent geophysical surveys which are expensive and time consuming practice neal 2004 arabameri et al 2019 in the present day scenario implementing remote sensing techniques in the field of groundwater hydrogeology becomes one of the broadly accepted attempts in domain of earth sciences bonham carter 1994 neal 2004 ganapuram et al 2009 jasrotia et al 2013 2018 nampak et al 2014 lee et al 2018 adimalla and taloor 2020 the integration of geological and hydrogeological surveys along with the remote sensing inputs can provide better result for such type of investigation depending upon the slope nature gradient and direction rock types vegetations adaptation presence of lineaments surface water bodies drainage systems network of channels flow accumulation over the surface the availability and nature of groundwater also differ the electrical resistivity tomography ert has already shown its efficiency for the assessment of groundwater condition stan and stan kleczek 2014 the integration between remote sensing and geophysical measures can give a fair understanding of all these physical factors using remote sensing techniques it is very effective to delineate geological and geomorphological structures over the earth surface alam et al 2017 2018 taloor et al 2017 2019 chen et al 2019 kothyari et al 2019 the advanced utility of resistivity techniques to monitor the groundwater scenario in the piedmont zone of himalayas revealed excellent results israil et al 2006 as such types of geo structural settings put interesting issues for the delineation of groundwater source point especially in the water crisis areas located near human habitats using this integrated approach the present study shows the scope to use freely available remotely sensed data along with resistivity survey a way towards the cost effective inventory work which helps in exploring the location having high possibility of groundwater resources and its long term sustainability the major objectives of the present study are to determine the geohydrological evolution of high gradient hilly land surface in lesser himalaya developed on hard metasedimentary rocks highly controlled by the active tectonic activity to investigate the present hydrogeomorphological scenario in and around simar watershed a small watershed located in the left bank of river gomti and to find out the groundwater zones for sustainable supply of water resources in the study area 2 study area the present study area located 17 km northwest of bageshwar town in the left bank of gomti river known as simar watershed fig 1 a c being located in the lap of lesser and central himalaya zone on rugged diversified and steep topography temperate to sub humid climatic conditions with severe and long winter which creates a dry hydrological environment the groundwater is highly discontinued due to the unfavourable geohydrological conditions and repeated tectonic disturbance besides steep ground slope the formation of hard rock strata with lineaments develops poor groundwater recharge probability in the study area the occurrence and movement of groundwater depends not only on the nature of the litho units and the nature of the interspaces interstices but also on the degree of interconnection between them vertical and aerial extension of joints faults and or shear zones and the local and regional geomorphology groundwater emerges as springs and seepage locally called srots and naolas under favourable physiographic conditions such as in gently sloping areas broad valleys of rivers and along with the lithological contacts the dominant occupant of simar watershed is jawahar navodaya vidyalaya jnv along with few isolated human settlements like simar village in the northwest and bimrari in southeast geologically the study area is found in the baijnath crystalline unit a part of almora nappe which is constituted of mesograde metasediments and intimately associated with granitic rock valdiya 1980 according to heim and gansser 1939 gansser 1964 the limits of this nappe are respectively marked by the outcrops of the folded almora and baijnath thrust plane the baijnath crystalline unit is surrounded by bilani and sandra formations in the south composed of shale siltstone and slate the northern part of study area is covered by sandra formation and upper deoban formation composed of thin limestone shale and quartzite fig 1c 3 dataset and methodology high spatial resolution earth observatory eo freely available data have been used from different open source and free downloadable data domains table 1 along with various large to medium scale thematic maps an integrated conceptual method framework has been carried out in the study fig 2 divided into three parts thematic inventory and spatial data mining based on the various secondary sources have been carried out in the pre field stage after preparing different thematic maps one map regarding the groundwater resource zone has been prepared using geo visualization and simple overlay techniques using the soft computing platform earth resistivity tomography ert instrument used for collection of ground based resistivity data finally the validation of gis based output with geophysical data and field investigations 3 1 geovisualization and thematic inventory of hydrogeomorphological parameters for the geological understanding eo data of different bands of landsat 8 oli have been used for the band rationing and band combination tools the band combination of landsat 8 oli band 10 tir band7 swir and band 3 visible green has been used for after high pass filtering 3 3 after the suppression of speckles in the images with the function of co efficient of var 1 0 for the features extraction of the local landscape on the other hand the combination between band 7 swir 5 nir and 1 visible blue is used for the wet and dry characteristics of the surface i e soil and crystalline rocky surface respectively generally these two surface conditions are found in a similar tone in other bands of optical image by using pca 1 on sfcc of natural colour and nir different mineralogical compositions of surface components have been extracted for the study area fig 3 a b for the understanding of the hydrological environment the entire simar watershed area has been divided into ten sub watersheds based on the existing lower ordered river channels to gain the total picture all the existing channels ephemeral seasonal and permanent have been considered for delineating the sub watershed and these all are marked a to j arbitrarily fig 4 a based on the geo visualizing method all the streams have been mapped from the landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 data to make a base map of channel networks for the study area on the basis of the base map different hydrological assessment measures have been carried out sub watershed scale using soft computation tools based on the various formula table 2 by using remote sensing data sentinel 2 the ratio of specific bands is able to delineate the fixed theme like the ratio between visible red and nir known as ndvi depicts the ground scenario of photosynthesis active vegetation and its concentration the ndvi has been calculated by the following formula after serrano et al 2019 ndvi nir visible red nir visible red where ndvi normalized difference vegetation index nir near infrared similarly rationing between green band 3 of sentinel 2 and nir band 8 of sentinel 2 has been used for the estimation of surface moisture condition using the following formula after mcfeeters 1996 du et al 2016 ndwi green nir green nir where ndvi normalized difference vegetation index nir near infrared where ndwi normalized difference water index nir near infrared after preparation of the surface water accumulation the geo morphological and lineaments map have been overlaid and subsequently all the map superimposed on the landsat in google engine for extracting the exact location for the groundwater source point 3 2 collection of field data through geological and geophysical survey during the field survey different instruments both minor and geophysical have been used for assessing and validate the exact position of groundwater source point for the structural assessment simple geological techniques have been implied with the help of measuring tape compass etc resistivity is now a well accepted technique which is also equal to the recertocal of conductivity Ï 1 Ï in geophysical survey table 3 classifies orientation and direction of geoelectric resistivity sections portrayed by six electrical resistivity tomography ert profiles characterized with 40 electrodes channels which has been carried out a b c d e f g h i j and k l in the different parts of the jnv campus and its surroundings fig 4b based on the nature of ground gradient repeated surveys with different arrays have been performed and the array with lowest root mean square rms has been considered for final assessment and thus the electrical properties of the area the associated imprints of groundwater zone and resistivity of rocks were determined 2 d multiple ert profiles have been prepared with the help of wenner dipole dipole and wenner dipole array and used on the bases of accessibility based on the space availability and surface gradient electrodes are placed at 1 m 5 m distance and the depth of the sections varies 12 36 m from the surface graphical representation of all the geo spatial and geophysical understanding is made by using different soft computation softwares all pseudo section data used for tomography mapping 2 d has undergone necessary topographic corrections and removal of errors talking about wenner array method where all the 40 electrodes are collinear and the separations between adjacent electrodes are equal the potential electrodes are between the current electrodes the advantage of this array is that it has excellent vertical resolution but poor lateral resolution by increasing the electrode number sensitivity of horizontal changes can also be improved loke et al 2010 the dipole dipole array has the advantage of relatively low em coupling between the current and potential electrodes loke 2011 it is very sensitive to horizontal changes in resistivity and in two dimensional survey it gives better horizontal coverage loke 2011 on the other hand wenner dipole dipole shows both the horizontal as well as vertical resolution in this geoelectric resistivity survey two sets of cables comprising 40 multi electrode switch boxes using two sets of 20 electrodes are used at 2 5 1 1 5 1 1 and 2 m spacing along straight lines of a b c d e f g h i j and k l respectively the last electrode at the end of section was attached with the earth resistivity meter for the uninterrupted current supply the measurements survey parameters and type of array adopted was monitored by geotest version 2 44 which also controls the geoelectric equipment in combination with many electrodes through multi electrode geo electrics it produced a graphical representation of the recorded subsurface apparent resistivity the measured apparent resistivity data was processed in a two dimensional 2d inversion software res2dinv geotomo based on smoothness constrain gauss newton least squares inversion of apparent resistivity pseudo sections loke and barker 1996 to check the calculated resistivity section a finite difference finite element forward modelling subroutine was used to calculate the true resistivity values of the model the readings were cross checked by repeating the survey in forward as well as backward directions to obtain the true resistivity 13 to 25 iterations have been performed and the rms error found to be 1 56 4 3 3 3 validation and integration of eo data with geophysical output the outputs of gis thematic layers and geophysical assessments have been integrated through overlaid analysis using soft computation tools during this validation the resistivity sections have also been considered along with the other associated variable like the concentration of vegetation patches agricultural practices spring location and their permanency perception of local people etc the final map shows the exact location of groundwater aquifer with its approximate volume 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 hydrogeomorphological characteristics of the study area being located in active tectonic belt of himalaya different types of geological complexity have been found through geospatial understanding since it is also located in the southern face of the lesser himalaya its geohydrological characteristics are also very much significance for the groundwater condition after all the unique geological setup along with the active tectonic features in and around the study area gives a complete portray fig 5 a d 4 1 1 geological characteristics the strike arrangement is found in nne to ssw direction and the dip is stretched towards nnw having the amount of 10â° to 40â° in the jnv campus and surrounding area but in the northern portion the simar watershed dip is 55â° towards sw direction based on the relation between lineaments fig 5a underground geological structure and topographic formation it can be assessed that one kind of inversion of topography has evolved in this study area by using pca 1 on standard false colour composition sfcc of natural colour and nir different mineralogical composition of surface component has been extracted fig 5b by using the band combination technique of landsat 8 oli band no 10 tir 7 swir and 3 visible green various kinds of geological features have been extracted from the local landscape fig 5c and the wet and dry characteristics of surface i e soil and crystalline rocky surface in the image output the light blue colour represents the settlement area built up environment i e building roads and other infrastructures deep blue shows the water flow portion of the river channel and cyan indicates the sand deposited area in the river channel and also in its surroundings yellow coloured patches show the alluvium deposited piedmonts of hills here all the hills are precipitous in nature which are appeared in red to brown colour fig 5d as shown in false colour composite fcc whereas the combination between band 7 swir 5 nir and 1 visible blue shows structural output of major features using speckle suppression and high pass 3 3 technique fig 5d in fcc the detail surface mineralogical composition has been proposed in table 4 as the simar watershed is developed by outlier formation of almora nappe located on the syncline belt its geological succession is fully inversion of topography in nature the hills and ridges are made off by older crystalline rocks through the process of metamorphism the eroded ferrous leached components are deposited on the piedmont area a few streams have able to developed fans in the foothills areas where ground slopes are found in abrupt change these fans are mainly composed by pebbles rock fragments and debris i e colluvial fans the narrow and wide are also developed in the study area mainly composed with pebbles and coarse sands 4 1 2 geomorphological characteristics the simar watershed has a fifth order drainage system of the gomti river ranges from 950 to 1466 m fig 6 a wide morphological variation has been found within the little span of coverage has been described in table 5 since the simar watershed is located in the southern face of baijnath ridge which is fully controlled and evolved by under the influence of baijnath formation valdiya 1980 different types of complex fluvial processes are found in this watershed fig 6b escarpment slope scarp faces are also noticed in the steep and highly dissected area through the rapid and high energetic down cutting process of the fluvial system the ruggedness development of the watershed shows that the scarp faces have a high level of ratio value more than 75 along with the high slope a few isolated narrow valleys are also developed near to these scarp faces and formed gorge like narrow valley structure on the other hand areas occupied by structural hill slopes have high to moderate ruggedness ratio values rages from 41 to 58 and ground slope is also moderate with varying direction with wide valley fig 6c d head ward eroded areas are also clearly noticed in few pockets located near to the steep and scarp faces areas in the downhill portion two different pockets of colluvial fans have been marked over the gentle to moderate slope areas one is located in the sub watershed d at the north western portion of jnv campus and two another colluvial fans are found in the down valley of i and j sub watersheds at bamrari these are developed over the fragmented quartzite basement with 36â° 41â° dipping at nnw direction the composition of these two fans is mixed shared with boulders debris and granulated regoliths with the metasedimentary rocks in its basement the soil profile is not well developed here but the soil depth is found 5 cm 12 cm during field observation these fans are used for the fruits orchard and seasonal cultivation the drainage system is quite complex in nature primarily the rectangular pattern has been initiated due to the alternate position of soft and hard rock but different kinds of tectonic activity along with the development of fracture joints and isolated slip surface created the structural controlled drainage patterns 4 1 3 hydrological characteristics the analysis of hydrological variables has been carried out with the help of arc gis software for this characterization drainage density length of overland flow in km km2 constant of channel maintenance channel flow accumulation and mean bifurcation ratio rb the direction of flow have been determined by grid based measurement technique the drainage density dd lay emphasis on spacing among the streams thus providing quantitative measure of length of stream within square grid of the area in terms of km km2 strahler 1964 being considered as an inverse function of permeability the drainage density indirectly indicates the permeability and porosity of the terrain due to its relationship with surface runoff fig 7 a and the drainage density in the study area varies from 4 4 to 8 4km km2 the simar area has very low drainage density whereas the area located above the jnv campus has a high drainage density length of overland flow lof is a length of water over the ground before it gets concentrated into certain stream channels used as a measure of non channel water flow above the earth s surface horton 1945 it independently influences the topsoil detachment transportation and more effective on gently sloped areas rather than steep slope areas low value of lof indicates high relief short flow paths more runoff and less infiltration which leads to more vulnerable to the flash flooding meanwhile a high value of lof means gentle slopes and long flow paths more infiltration and reduced runoff in the study area lof values ranges from 0 125 to 0 058 higher lof value areas indicating high chance of seepage flow and found near the simar settlement area as it is located in the foothill portion and having a gentle slope condition along with the loose materials the process of lof is quite strong compared to the other area of watershed fig 7b owing to the presence of hard rock surface in the upper portion of study area lof is very negligible schumm 1954 introduced constant of channel maintenance as the ratio between the area of a drainage basin and total length of all the channels the constant of channel maintenance ccm plays an important role for the accumulation of surface flow through the runoff process the importance of this constant is that it provides a quantitative expression of the minimum limiting area required for the development of a length of channel high value of ccm denotes that large area is required to produce surface flow since this area is fully covered with the hard crystalline rock and characterized by steep slope the ccm value in the most of the study area is low and lower value of ccm represents less chances of infiltration with high surface runoff the study area fig 7c shows that the maximum area has a very low value of ccm and high discharge of surface runoff occurs only during the rainy season on the other hand accumulation of channel flow cfa denotes the water accumulation capacity in the channel during the time of peak discharge cells with a high flow accumulation are areas of concentrated flow and may be used to identify stream channels in the study area high accumulation is found along the higher order streams fig 7d bifurcation ratio rb is the proportion of the total number of streams in a given order to the total number streams of the next higher order horton 1945 low rb value point towards less geologic controls and direct the less distortion in drainage development higher values of rb denoted the dominance of overland flow and flash flood risk during heavy rainstorm event kanth and hassan 2012 the rb values throughout the simar watershed ranges from and 1 to 3 75 fig 8 a the highest value of the bifurcation ratio is found in the e stream system which denotes the utmost controlled of the geological activity and complex river system besides the j stream system d is also contribution more balanced rb it is determined by materials of underlying surface type and amount of vegetation cover and relief properties based on the direction of flow map fig 8b it can be concluded that maximum area has the south directional flow regime and only a few pockets have northern flowing capacity which is also being highly controlled by structural constraints of local geology 4 1 4 other associated variables there are certainly a few other variables that play an important role in the assessment of the groundwater resources and its associated characterization vegetation related associations like its development arrangement types and seasonal variation were measured by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi by using the optical remote sensing data fig 8c very low values of ndvi 0 1 and below correspond to barren areas rocky surface sand or snow moderate values represent shrub and grassland 0 2 0 3 while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests 0 6 0 8 in the study area value ranges from 0 17 to 0 58 the value of ndvi in the lying area of the simar watershed area is quite high as most of the area is covered with seasonal shrubs in the upper reaches owing to the presence of bare ground composed with hard crystalline rocks it is low the area under bare surface have also been noticed throughout the year and these areas are basically located in the steep cum scarp slope dissected types of morphological units results in the scatter vegetation mainly pine has been grown over most of the study area but the patches of orchards of pyrus naspati and banana trees are also noticed in the western portion jnv campus these are also found in the area composed of debris boulder and loose unconsolidated material the ability to holding the moisture over the land surface area was also measured by the normalized difference water index ndwi is a satellite derived index from the near infrared nir and green bands are known to be strongly related to the plant water content considered as a very good proxy for plant water stress fig 8d particularly in the hilly terrain and these all variables are more vital for the targeting the underground water assessment in the piedmont plain and the area covered by the colluvial fan large land segments has compact vegetation fig 9 a c which is suitable for soil moisture bearing activity the ndwi value has also shown same characteristics in the simar watershed outside the simar locality the maximum negative values of ndwi which means a high probability of moisture concentration is found in three pockets which are the pour points or mouth portions of c subwatershed two spots are located in extreme northwest side of jnv campus and in the bamrari locality out of these three places simar and bamrari are old settlement areas located in the piedmont zone and local inhabitants are completely depended on the groundwater resource on these pockets on the other hand jnv campus is located on the colluvial fan developed over the meta sedimentary rocky surface and it is observed from the lineament map that jnv campus is surrounded by high lineament concentration fig 9d which makes the locality a good prospect zone of groundwater occurrence although the sub watershed e and j also have moderate nature of surface water accumulation and the rest of the other sub watershed area has low to very low nature of ndwi 4 2 geophysical characteristics geophysical techniques play a pivotal role in investigating the groundwater prospects with very high accuracy the resistivity outputs in the study area show a significant result in section a b designed in the dry bed of the gomti river fig 10 a b with rms error 2 4 and located on the left side of river permanent channel the wenner dipole dipole array output shows an almost negligible presence of groundwater in this section a thin pocket of water concentration zone has been noticed in this section but it is confined in three pockets within the depth up to 14 m from the ground having less than 184 Ï m the reason behind this is surface infiltration from various channels underneath this region there was high conductive material concentration covering rest of the section at the surface 0 7 45 m the haphazard concentration of large buried boulders of quartzite found in the area also indicates the very high conductivity nature two very small spots are also demarcated at the surface portion which indicates the channels of small tributaries gomti river since the wenner dipole dipole method creates better vertical and horizontal resolutions it clearly demarcates the thin pocket of soil moisture concentration section c d shows a well built accumulation of groundwater which stretches from surface of the section at 8 m depth since the section was developed on the playground and the ground has a strong retaining wall at near to c point a vast water storage zone has been developed towards c it is actually a stock of infiltrated water stored in the filling portion of playground in the same way channels of sub watershed d water infiltrated strongly and formed pursed water storage at the surface portion of e f section located at 25 m 55 m distance from e station but due to the presence of a large hard and metamorphic rock having more than 3100 ohm m resistivity beneath this storage this pursed storage is not able to develop permanent aquifer on the other way an aquifer pocket has been noticed towards f station 79 m from the first electrode foot of scarp cliff location along with the deposition of loose materials creates this aquifer in a long sustainable condition section g h shows the absence of strong groundwater pocket although the section was developed across the colluvial fan associated with agriculture firm but the section i j which was expanded along the colluvial fan confirms the presence of one strong and big aquifer along with one moist cum porous pocket and surface accumulation zone similarly the section k l indicates one big aquifer at 5 m 13 m depth and it extends about 41 m 92 m from the first electrode and just beneath this aquifer lies a giant impervious hard rock mass having the resistivity more than 4000 Ï m as well as bounded by porous materials in three sides refer to fig 4b as the surface has 10â° to 25â° slope towards the k station it has the ability to recharge very frequently by the surface flow and spring owing to the favourable condition and good soil water plant interaction the adaptation and growth of banana trees fig 11 a has also much sustained particularly on the surface portion of this section targeted groundwater source area marked by orange colour circle fig 9a d indicates the location aquifers at a distance of 130 m from the first electrode there is a permanent spring which further validates the remote sensing based earth observations fig 11b 5 conclusion in this study intensive and scientific investigations were made based on the integration of geospatial and geophysical techniques which able to investigate the groundwater prospects with very high accuracy the techniques of remote sensing made it possible to spatially analysis the micro zoning imprints of water availability which can easily be validated through the geophysical information as groundwater resources is not well distributed for mass consumption in the study area but the engineering and technical measures are the only possible ways to sustain these aquifers for long term as these are located on the hard and meta sedimentary rock aquifers can easily be recharged through the surface accumulated water so a few recharged pits and trenches are being suggested for immediate construction in the upper reaches of the jvn campus the colluvial fan area of the upper reaches of jvn campus which are located along the section k l has the capability to recharge the ground surface with very good infiltration capacity from the sheet flow and spring discharge for the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the jnv area structural measures along with engineering inputs are being needed to recharge the groundwater resource and aquifer as active based on the results study has exhumed a few observations that the hydrogeomorphology of the study area is totally different from the beijnath formation and there is a wide range of variability in terms of geomorphology and tectonic imprints the local slope is very steep at the hill portion there is little chance to infiltrate meanwhile the rocks of hills are meta sedimentary quartzite dominated so the piedmont plain and downhill areas have significant capacity to infiltrate the surface water and due to the presence of hard rocks during the rainy season these infiltrated water leached out to the main channel of gomti river the area of jnv campus surrounded by two small tributaries of gomti river with quite extended catchment area which have a good scope to accumulate rainwater during monsoon period and supported by the good number of lineaments the uniqueness of vegetation concentration is indicating the good amount of surface water accumulation in the nnw portion of jnv campus with lithology structure slope lineaments the result of geospatial analysis shows two strong accumulations cum recharging pockets located in the nnw parts of jnv campus which is a big source of groundwater further validated by the 2 d resistivity as high potential groundwater zone in the study area acknowledgements authors are thankful to the editor in chief for constructive approach through the review process authors would like to thank all the anonymous reviewers for constructive and thought provoking comments which helps in improving the quality of the manuscript
