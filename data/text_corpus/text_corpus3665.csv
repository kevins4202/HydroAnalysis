18325,pilot testing of direct potable reuse dpr using multi stage ozone and biological filtration as an alternative treatment train without reverse osmosis ro was investigated this study examined four blending ratios of advanced treated reclaimed water from the f wayne hill water resources center fwh wrc in gwinnett county georgia combined with the existing drinking water treatment plant raw water supply lake lanier for potable water production baseline testing with 100 percent lake lanier water was initially conducted followed by testing blends of 15 25 50 and 100 reclaimed water from fwh wrc finished water quality from the dpr pilot was compared to drinking water standards and emerging microbial and chemical contaminants were also evaluated results were benchmarked against a parallel indirect potable reuse ipr pilot receiving 100 of the raw water from lake lanier finished water quality from the dpr pilot at the 15 blend complied with the united states primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels mcls and smcls respectively however exceedances of one or more mcls or smcls were observed at higher blends importantly reclaimed water from fwh wrc was of equal or better quality for all microbiological targets tested compared to lake lanier indicating that a dpr scenario could lower acute risks from microbial pathogens compared to current practices finished water from the dpr pilot had no detections of microorganisms even at the 100 fwh wrc effluent blend microbiological targets tested included heterotrophic plate counts total and fecal coliforms escherichia coli somatic and male specific coliphage clostridium perfringens enterococci legionella cryptosporidium and giardia there were water quality challenges primarily associated with nitrate originating from incomplete denitrification and bromate formation from ozonation at the fwh wrc these challenges highlight the importance of upstream process monitoring and control at the advanced wastewater treatment facility if dpr is considered this research demonstrated that ozone with biological filtration could achieve potable water quality criteria without the use of ro in cases where nitrate is below the mcl of 10 mg nitrogen per liter and total dissolved solids are below the smcl of 500 mg per liter graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone biofiltration potable reuse direct potable reuse indirect potable reuse emerging contaminants 1 introduction as increasing population creates greater demands on available water supplies and regulatory requirements for treated wastewater effluent discharges become more stringent many utilities are considering potable reuse as an alternative water supply advanced treated reclaimed water has the potential to meet future water demands as well as provide resiliency in diversifying water supply portfolios as a result potable reuse practices are gaining in both interest and application indirect potable reuse ipr involves the introduction of advanced treated reclaimed water into an environmental buffer e g reservoir river lake aquifer or wetland before being withdrawn for potable water treatment direct potable reuse dpr involves use of advanced treated reclaimed water as a potable raw water supply dpr has been implemented in limited capacity in the united states there are facilities that have been operated for emergency production of potable water or for intermittent supply chanute kansas in the 1950s metzler et al 1958 big spring colorado river municipal water district texas in 2013 which was operated intermittently as dpr and wichita falls texas in 2014 which has since transitioned to ipr lahnsteiner et al 2018 additional dpr facilities are being investigated with the el paso advanced water purification facility texas under construction lahnsteiner et al 2018 in california full advanced treatment fat with reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes are required for ipr that is currently permitted for groundwater injection california state water resources control board 2013 2018 while surface water augmentation is now allowed in the state of california sbddw 16 02 surface water augmentation regulations there have been no permitted facilities that have yet come online the coastal communities in california that implement ipr often only provide secondary biological treatment prior to use as a source for advanced treatment with aquifer recharge agencies including orange county water district city of san diego west basin municipal water district monterrey and the water replenishment district of southern california that practice ipr through groundwater recharge also typically have high total dissolved solids tds as a result ro is necessary to achieve the tds requirements typically 200 1000 mg l established in groundwater basin plans under the california water code ro is highly effective at reduction of concentrations of a wide variety of dissolved constituents drewes et al 2006 wintgens et al 2005 though low molecular weight neutrally charged compounds such as 1 4 dioxane and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma have poor rejection while it provides excellent treatment for a range of constituents ro is capital and operationally cost intensive particularly for inland facilities where the brine concentrate cannot be disposed through a marine discharge the operational costs associated with brine management can render the use of ro technology infeasible schimmoller and kealy 2014 gerrity et al 2014 found that using ozone biologically active filtration baf as part of a non ro treatment train could save 400 000 to 800 000 in energy costs per year compared to fat at a 10 million gallon per day mgd facility gerrity et al 2014 ozone baf is an accepted treatment process at drinking water treatment plants for removal of natural organic matter nom pharand et al 2015 disinfection byproduct dbp precursors emelko et al 2006 evans et al 2013 pharand et al 2015 sun et al 2018

baf as part of a potable reuse treatment train depends on a variety of water quality factors including the presence of dbp precursors such as nom dissolved organic nitrogen and bromide the concentration of tds and nitrogenous species as well as the temperature and ph kadmi et al 2015 kosaka et al 2014 sgroi et al 2014 advanced treated reclaimed water with either high tds or with either bromate or nitrate concentrations near the national primary drinking water regulation primary maximum contaminant levels mcls should not rely on ozone baf treatment for removal of these constituents modifications can be made to advanced treatment process operations to reduce nitrate or mitigate bromate formation but tds removal is more difficult to address paredes et al 2007 soltermann et al 2017 if water contains tds greater than the secondary maximum contaminant level smcl of 500 mg l fat may prove to be a better option similarly if the source water is high in nitrogen ro is more effective at removing nitrogen species than ozone baf stanford et al 2017 ozone baf without ro has been implemented for dpr full scale at the 2 mgd goreangab water reclamation plant in windhoek namibia since 2002 which provides 35 of the local potable water supply du pisani 2006 the 92 mgd eastern treatment plant in melbourne australia also incorporates ozone baf without ro for non potable reuse blackbeard et al 2016 found that melbourne water s advanced treatment facility reduced below detection limits 55 of 91 trace chemical constituents detected in the municipal secondary effluent and baf alone removed 91 percent of ndma ozone baf without ro has been incorporated into the planned potable reuse treatment scheme at gwinnett county since 2010 where up to 40 mgd of advanced treated reclaimed water from gwinnett county department of water resources f wayne hill water resources center fwh wrc discharges into lake lanier the county s sole drinking water supply the fwh wrc includes primary and secondary treatment with partial denitrification followed by advanced treatment using chemical clarification and settling ultrafiltration granular media filtration pre ozone bac and ozone disinfection yang et al 2011 found that the fwh wrc treatment train removed 13 of 16 emerging contaminants to below detection limits several recent pilot research studies have been conducted to further characterize the treatment efficacy of ozone baf gerrity et al 2011 2014 2018 lee et al 2012 li et al 2015 sundaram et al 2018 vatankhah et al 2019 the objective of this study was to evaluate treatment efficacy using five blending ratios of advanced treated reclaimed water from fwh wrc combined with surface water from lake lanier the raw water source for the drinking water treatment shoal creek filter plant scfp treated water quality was compared to a parallel pilot receiving source water solely from lake lanier for mcls and smcls as well as emerging biological and chemical compounds 2 materials and methods conceptual experimental design the dpr and ipr piloting facilities were installed and commissioned in april 2016 the biofilters were acclimated during a baseline phase using 100 lake lanier water as pilot influent source water over three months similitude testing between the dpr and ipr pilots and the full scale scfp was conducted for one month using 100 lake lanier pilot influent source water over the following nine months four blending ratios 15 25 50 and 100 advanced treated reclaimed water from the fwh wrc were tested through the dpr pilot the 25 and 50 blends were tested during multiple seasons to evaluate temporal variability on pilot water quality blend ratio testing was initiated in september 2016 on the dpr pilot with a 50 blend of fwh wrc reclaimed water from october through mid december 2016 changes in source water quality significantly shifted due to a deepening of the epilimnion layer in lake lanier the ipr pilot fed with lake lanier water only was operated in parallel with the dpr pilot until january 2017 when pilot operating conditions were modified for a different research project lauderdale et al 2018 the treatment trains at fwh wrc and pilot facilities are depicted in fig 1 the fwh wrc advanced treatment process consisted of two parallel trains that provided additional removal of solids and phosphorus the first train had a design flow of 20 mgd and was comprised of two stage chemical clarification followed by granular media filtration gmf loading rate of 3 6 gpm sq ft the second train had a design flow of 40 mgd and used lamella plate settling after chemical clarification the liquid fraction flowed by gravity to ultrafiltration uf membranes flows from the two trains were combined prior to pre ozonation where an ozone dose of 2 5 3 mg l was applied average ozone to toc ratio of 1 2 0 2 ozonated water was filtered using biologically activated carbon bac at a loading rate of 2 69 gpm sq ft effluent from the bac was ozonated again for disinfection at a dose of 1 5 mg l average ozone to toc ratio of 1 4 0 4 prior to discharge pilot plant design and process equipment the 6 gallon per minute gpm dpr and ipr pilot plants replicated the full scale scfp drinking water treatment processes and each included an influent equalization and or blending tank ozonation two stage coagulation two stage flocculation direct biofiltration and chlorine disinfection fig 1 the pilots were manufactured and installed by intuitech salt lake city utah both pilots were installed inside an enclosed building at the scfp the flow equalization blending tanks were covered 1000 gallon 64 inch diameter and 80 inch tall opaque polypropylene tanks norwesco water from the fwh wrc was conveyed seven miles through a 72 inch ductile iron pipe and routed to the pilot room through a 1500 foot two inch diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe water from lake lanier was routed to the pilot plant from the scfp upstream of the inlet channel to the first treatment process ozone and through a 2 inch diameter pvc pipe prior to discharge to the ipr and dpr equalization tanks both water sources passed through a 5 Œºm Œºm bag filter eaton ecoline on the dpr pilot a flow control valve asahi and flowmeter ifm effector sm7001 were used to maintain proportional flow from each water source flow was blended using a 1 inch diameter 7 inch long clear pvc in line static mixer koflo 6 mixing elements prior to entering the blending tank the residence time in the equalization or blending tank was approximately 2 h mainstream ozone injection was performed for the ipr and dpr pilots prior to a contactor consisting of four 18 foot tall 8 inch diameter pvc columns in series the total contactor volume for each pilot was approximately 180 gallons with a detention time of approximately 30 min at 6 gpm sample ports were located on the ozone contactors at approximately 1 min intervals for the first 10 min and 5 min intervals thereafter ozone was generated using a plasma block ozone generator plasma technics fed with 99 pure oxygen from a cylinder airgas ozone produced by the generator was monitored via high concentration ozone analyzer in usa mini hicon analyzer ozone gas flow rate to the venturi injection system was controlled with a combination thermal mass flow meter and valve alicat scientific the ozone dose for each pilot was calculated based upon contactor water flow rate ozone feed gas flow rate and ozone gas concentration two online ozone residual analyzers thermo scientific oz31b were used to monitor dissolved ozone residual in water at two points within the contactors for the ipr and dpr pilots the coagulation stage of both pilot systems used two 2 1 gallon rapid mix tanks where ferric chloride 37 45 by weight national sanitation foundation nsf certified pvs technologies inc was dosed at approximately 0 5 mg per liter mg l with 50 s of mixing velocity gradient of 1000 per second sec followed by 126 sec in the second tank flocculation included two 47 gallon tanks where clarifloc polydimethylsiloxane polymer 20 by weight nsf certified polydyne inc was fed at a typical dose of 1 1 1 2 mg l neat solution with 19 min of mixing velocity gradient of 10 1 sec followed by 5 sec flocculated water was gravity fed to two biofilters operated in parallel the biofilter columns were 6 inch diameter 18 foot tall clear pvc with leopold ims cap underdrains xylem inc the biofilters were filled with 60 inches of media over 12 inches of sand the anthracite biofilter had 12 year old media collected from the scfp 1 39 mm mm effective size uniformity coefficient 1 34 bed depth to average filter media effective size l d10 ratio of 1185 the bac filter contained exhausted 16 year old media from the john f kubala water treatment plant in arlington texas 1 00 mm effective size uniformity coefficient 1 53 l d ratio of 1185 the sand support media effective size was 0 72 0 75 mm with a uniformity coefficient of 1 75 flow through the filter columns was controlled at the filter effluent using an electrically actuated ball valve asahi and flow meter ifm effector to maintain 11 5 feet of head above the filter media to replicate the scfp filters were backwashed three times per week monday wednesday and friday with 0 8 mg l of chlorinated water nsf certified calcium hypochlorite 65 75 by weight powder axiall llc at the beginning of the 25 fwh wrc blend chlorine for backwashing and disinfection was switched to non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite 12 5 vwr chemicals bdh the filter backwashing sequence included air scouring at 3 7 standard cubic feet per minute per square foot scfm sq ft for 10 min a low rate wash at 6 gallons per minute per square foot gpm sq ft during the last minute of air scour a high rate wash at 25 gpm sq ft for 10 min 20 gpm sq ft for the bac filter and low rate wash at 11 2 gpm sq ft for 5 min the bac filter had a slightly lower high rate backwash to prevent media loss per manufacturer specifications disinfection was achieved by dosing a stock concentration of nsf certified calcium hypochlorite 65 75 by weight powder axiall llc in line upstream of an opaque 25 gallon tank with a 43 min detention time at typical flows of 0 6 gpm the hypochlorite chemical was switched to a non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite 12 5 vwr chemicals bdh during the 12 25 and 100 blend test periods chlorine disinfection targeted a 1 8 mg l residual in the disinfection tank similar to that achieved in full scale scfp operations however the full scale scfp had a longer detention time in the clearwell at 500 min testing approach each phase was operated until pseudo steady state conditions were achieved for a minimum of one month steady state was achieved when the total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 removal across ozone and coagulation flocculation baf and the biofilter effluent turbidity changed by less than 20 over a one week period routine monitoring was conducted at the dpr pilot influent post ozone post biofiltration and post disinfection sampling ports similitude testing similitude between the ipr and dpr pilot and the scfp was conducted for one month with all pilot influent source water from lake lanier ipr and dpr pilots exhibited no significant difference student s two tailed t test in ultraviolet transmittance uvt p 0 56 dissolved organic carbon doc p 0 43 or total organic carbon toc p 0 25 the pilots and full scale scfp had similar filter effluent turbidities of approximately 0 04

different between the pilots and the full scale p 2 10 6 1 11 0 0 mg l with n 13 for the ipr pilot 1 14 0 00 mg l with n 13 for the dpr pilot and 1 00 0 00 mg l with n 6 for the scfp possibly due to slight differences in contact times ph temperature uvt turbidity and toc were tested three times per week and doc was tested weekly on the dpr and ipr pilot plants where comparable data were collected at the scfp results were consistent table 1 compares the dpr and ipr pilot operational conditions with the scfp the ozone doses for the pilots were 1 3 mg l and at the scfp was 1 4 mg l first order ozone decay rate constants averaged 0 05 0 03 min 1 0 04 0 01 min 1 and 0 08 0 02 min 1 for the ipr pilot dpr pilot and scfp respectively the slightly higher scfp decay rate was likely attributable to the slightly higher ozone dose and differences in the physical configuration of the full scale ozone residual sampling system the filter hydraulic loading rate was similar for the pilots 3 06 0 09 gpm sq ft compared to the scfp 2 98 0 6 gpm sq ft with an empty bed contact time ebct of approximately 12 min filter headloss accumulation rate hlar for the pilot anthracite filters ranged from 0 019 to 0 027 feet per hour ft hr and the scfp anthracite filters were 0 091 0 013 ft h the difference in hlar was likely due to hydraulic difference in the pilot 6 inch diameter compared to the full scale 1500 sq ft filters the pilot bac filter hlar was slightly higher than the anthracite filters at 0 059 0 015 ft h and 0 082 0 018 ft h for the dpr and ipr pilots respectively the difference in hlar was due to the smaller particle size of the bac media adenosine triphosphate atp was measured on biofilter media from the top 5 inches of the filter bed using the luminultra deposit surface analysis dsa test kit measurements were performed weekly during similitude testing and at the end of each blend ratio test period atp concentrations stabilized after approximately 1 month of operations samples collected monthly thereafter indicated concentrations remained consistent for the remainder of testing with 1 84 105 8 8 104 pg of atp per gram filter media pg g on the pilot anthracite filters 8 83 105 2 5 105 pg g on the pilot bac filters and 3 2 105 2 5 105 pg g for the scfp anthracite filters this was equivalent to 2 75 105 1 3 105 pg per milliliter pg ml on the pilot anthracite filters 5 46 105 1 5 105 pg ml on the pilot bac filters and 4 79 105 3 7 105 pg ml on the scfp anthracite filters these concentrations are typical of biofilters in drinking water treatment plants which have been shown to range between to 102 108 pg g for a one time sampling event at 17 full scale facilities evans et al 2013 and 103 106 pg g for sampling over 9 months at seven full scale facilities hooper et al 2019 once the biofilm was established biomass tended to remain consistent over time which is consistent with previous research on drinking water biofilters pharand et al 2015 hooper et al 2019 lauderdale et al 2018 evans et al 2013 the dpr pilot bac filters had slightly higher atp than the anthracite filters bac media generally supports higher biomass due to its irregular surface structure which allows for attachment biofilm formation and protection from fluid shear stress huck et al 2000 lauderdale et al 2018 the scfp anthracite media had slightly higher atp compared to the dpr pilot anthracite filters this result may have been associated with differences in backwashing frequency while filter backwashing chlorine concentration flow rates and durations were the same the scfp filters were backwashed approximately every 4 days primarily triggered by a terminal headloss of 10 feet the dpr pilot filters were backwashed three times per week typically at a terminal headloss of 2 feet filter effluent water was subsequently disinfected with chlorine the 5 min chlorine demand was similar at 2 68 0 09 2 83 0 02 and 2 76 mg l for the dpr pilot ipr pilot and scfp respectively the first order chlorine decay rates were also similar 0 18 0 03 0 21 0 0 5 and 0 2 for the dpr pilot ipr pilot and scfp respectively dpr pilot blend ratio testing four blending ratios were evaluated with 15 25 50 and 100 fwh wrc reclaimed water as source water for the dpr pilot each blend was run until steady state conditions were achieved or a minimum duration of one month the 25 and 50 blends were evaluated during multiple seasons to assess temporal variations of pilot influent water quality on treatment efficacy in some cases process adjustments were made to optimize the treatment train specific to each blend ratio table 2 summarizes operating conditions of the dpr pilot the ozone dose was set to achieve a 1 log removal credit of cryptosporidium which matched full scale scfp operations the average applied ozone dose 0 86 1 4 mg l and ozone to toc ratio 0 32 0 89 for each blend ratio is summarized in fig s1 the applied ozone dose and ozone to toc ratio declined with increasing blend ratio because fwh wrc effluent had been ozonated twice already which lowered the ozone demand at the pilot however during the 50 blend warm and lake stratification test periods the unusually high ozone demand from lake lanier s epilimnion layer increased the overall blend s applied dose and ozone to toc ratio ferric chloride was fed at 0 5 mg l through the 50 blend cold water period and then was adjusted to 0 55 mg l the polymer dose was 1 15 mg l neat solution through the middle of the 100 blend cold water condition and was then adjusted to 1 2 mg l neat solution to maintain filter effluent turbidity anthracite and bac biofilters maintained the same loading rate as the scfp 3 1 gpm sq ft and 12 2 min ebct operations of the ipr pilot were consistent with the dpr pilot except during the 50 blend during the lake stratification phase for this test period the ipr pilot ozone dose increased from a baseline of 1 36 mg l same as the dpr pilot to 3 mg l and the polymer dose increased to between 1 15 and 1 35 mg l neat solution during this time the fwh wrc maintained consistent operations except for slight differences in alum dose 10 35 mg l ferric dose 20 50 mg l and degree of denitrification in secondary clarifiers from changes in the recycle rate the fwh wrc effluent nitrate concentration that fed the dpr pilot prior to blending was on average 16 2 5 2

international organization for standardization method 11731 2017 carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps were measured at the georgia institute of technology following methods described previously fu et al 2017 3 results and discussion blend ratio testing pilot influent temperature increased with increasing blend ratio as the fwh wrc effluent was slightly warmer than lake lanier the dpr pilot influent temperature at the 15 25 50 and 100 blends were 60 4 1 2 f f 56 9 3 1 66 3 7 1 f and 63 3 1 8 f respectively fig 2 the ipr pilot was slightly lower at an average of 58 5 1 3 54 4 2 6 63 4 7 9 and 53 3 0 7 f during the 15 25 50 and 100 blends respectively increased temperatures may be beneficial to treatment because increased temperatures have faster ozone oxidation kinetics and could increase the rate of biodegradation of contaminants through the biofilters fig 2b shows a substantial decrease in pilot influent and filter effluent turbidity at higher blend ratios as compared to the ipr pilot with 100 lake lanier water fig 2a during the 0 blend baseline testing period the average dpr pilot influent turbidity was 0 65 0 07 nephelometric turbidity units ntu and anthracite filter effluent turbidity was 0 06 0 04 ntu at the 100 blend pilot influent turbidity was an order of magnitude lower at 0 06 0 20 ntu and the filter effluent turbidity was 0 01 0 02 ntu when water quality changes occurred in lake lanier due to changes in lake stratification the temperature increased by 8 f in five days and the turbidity increased by 0 6 ntu since this facility used direct filtration the differential in turbidity was significant during this period the dpr pilot was operated with a 50 fwh wrc blend an increase of 3 f in temperature and 0 3 ntu of turbidity was observed in addition the average toc from lake lanier increased from 1 47 0 06 mg l to 1 79 0 1 mg l the ipr pilot operating conditions were modified to meet increased ozone demand and to maintain filter effluent turbidity which required increasing the ozone dose from 1 2 to 3 mg l and increasing the flocculant dose 1 15 1 35 mg l neat solution while operations on the dpr pilot did not change the ipr pilot filter effluent turbidity averaged 0 14 ntu fig 2a compared to 0 04 ntu on the dpr pilot filter effluent fig 2b the higher quality feed water from the fwh wrc compared to lake lanier provided more consistent operations at the dpr pilot including chemical dose requirements and filter run times and produced better filter effluent turbidity compared to ipr funk et al 2018 fig 2 shows the ipr and dpr pilot filter effluents had periodic spikes in turbidity which were associated with filter backwashing as the set point for placing the filter online after ripening was 0 2 ntu backwashing events accounted for greater than 85 of the turbidity peaks despite these spikes filter effluent turbidity on both pilots was below 0 1 ntu which met the epa long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr requirement of less than 0 3 ntu in 95 percent of monthly samples epa 2010 the dpr pilot effluent turbidity 95th percentile was approximately 0 07 ntu and 0 06 ntu for the anthracite and bac filters respectively while the ipr pilot effluent turbidity 95th percentile was approximately 0 15 ntu and 0 17 ntu for the anthracite and bac filters respectively over the full duration of testing these findings for turbidity chemical doses and filter run times provide a key example of how dpr could be used to improve aspects of water quality and operations particularly during challenging water quality excursions from changes in lake stratification dpr pilot influent and effluent alkalinity and hardness increased at higher blend ratios fig 3 shows the alkalinity of lake lanier water was low ranging from 16 to 20 mg l while the fwh wrc reclaimed water ranged from 85 to 139 mg l the higher alkalinity in the fwh wrc reclaimed water is likely due to the addition of magnesium hydroxide to the fwh treatment process to maintain ph for biological treatment calcium and magnesium were approximately 5 mg l as caco3 in lake lanier and 20 25 mg l as calcium carbonate caco3 in the fwh wrc reclaimed water alkalinity for the dpr pilot blended influent and filter effluent ranged from 37 to 112 mg l as caco3 and did not change appreciably through the pilot the higher calcium magnesium and alkalinity on the dpr pilot could be beneficial for stabilizing ph during treatment and ultimately producing more stable less corrosive water ph remained relatively stable between 6 5 and 7 5 su through the pilot over the full duration of testing toc and doc were generally similar at each monitoring location where doc was approximately 95 of the toc r2 0 97 p 8 8 10 14 n 183 fig 4 shows an increase in toc at the dpr pilot influent at higher blend ratios while the organic carbon loading increased the net toc removal remained similar and there was a slight downward trend in toc percent removal at the dpr pilot effluent with increasing blend ratio there was 25 1 toc removal at the 0 and 15 blends compared to 15 8 toc removal for the 50 and 100 blends there was likely a lower percentage of reactive carbon present with higher blends due to prior ozone bac treatment at the fwh wrc temperature may have been confounding variable because the lowest toc percent removals were also observed during the coldest temperatures toc net removal was highest during the 50 blend warm period with lake stratification effects due to a higher influent toc loading from lake lanier fig 4 toc net removal during the 0 blend averaged 0 37 0 09 mg l 25 removal the 50 blend warm condition averaged 0 41 0 03 mg l 22 removal and the 50 lake stratification period increased to an average of 0 48 0 05 mg l 25 removal toc removal from the pilot influent to bac effluent 24 2 was higher than the anthracite filter 19 8 which may have been attributable to higher biomass as measured via atp supported on the bac media fig 5 shows that while pilot influent toc increased with increasing blend ratio uvt decreased and there was a slight decrease in specific uv absorbance suva these results indicate that the character of the carbon in lake lanier was different from the fwh wrc reclaimed water the average uvt of fwh wrc reclaimed water was 91 7 1 3 which was slightly less than that of lake lanier 92 3 6 7 thus uvt decreased from 94 2 at the 0 blend all lake lanier source water to 91 5 at the 100 fwh wrc blend ratio these differences had implications on treatment ozone demand was lower at higher blend ratios 0 34 0 04 mg l at 100 fwh wrc effluent n 27 compared to lower blend ratios 0 75 0 02 mg l at 0 fwh wrc effluent baseline n 40 the change in carbon content and quality at the dpr pilot influent during higher blend ratios is likely due to the two stage ozonation process with bac at fwh wrc this finding highlights the importance of upstream advanced treatment processes operations on treatment for potable water production in a dpr scenario the dpr pilot finished water quality was below the majority of mcls table 3 summarizes exceedances by blend ratio for a complete list of results see table s1 eighty of the 92 contaminants with mcls or lt2eswtr regulatory levels or guidance levels were monitored during pilot testing this equated to a total of 972 analytical results for samples collected from the dpr pilot effluent of which 16 samples or 1 6 of all samples collected had concentrations exceeding mcls exceedances of nitrate n mcl 9 23 of samples bromate n mcl 3 25 of samples cyanide n mcl 3 30 of samples and the plasticizer di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp n mcl 1 10 of samples were observed for blend ratios of 25 50 and 100 table 3 no exceedances were observed at the 15 blend it is of note that the mcls and smcls under the safe drinking water act address treatment as the means of providing safe drinking water at the tap and that there are amendments that enhanced the law by requiring consumer confidence reports a cost benefit analysis for every new standard an assessment of threats that may warrant source water protection operator training significant infrastructure funding for water system improvements and controls over microbial contaminants and disinfection by products epa 2017 under a dpr scenario there are potentially different source water threats such as improperly disposed of household and industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products or other wastewater derived contaminants that may also pose a health risk thus while drinking water mcls were evaluated as a point of comparison for this study there were other parameters that were also measured and are compared to applicable standards such as health advisory levels and therapeutic doses in a separate publication funk et al 2018 nitrate was conserved through the dpr pilot train fig 6 and was directly impacted by operations at the fwh wrc fwh wrc reclaimed water which did not have a discharge limit for nitrate and was not optimized for denitrification had average nitrate concentrations of 16 2 5 2 mg n l over the duration of testing by contrast nitrate concentrations in lake lanier were less than 0 5 mg n l nitrite and ammonia were typically at or below detection limits the pilot treatment trains were not designed for nitrate removal and nitrate was conserved through the process for example during the 50 blend the average pilot influent nitrate was 8 2 3 3 mg n l and the finished water nitrate was 8 5 3 2 mg n l the primary drinking water limit of 10 mg n l nitrate would limit the blend percentage to less than 50 unless the fwh wrc optimized processes for denitrification fig 7 shows fwh wrc reclaimed water bromate concentrations averaged 6 2 4 8 Œºg per liter Œºg l and ranged between 2 6 Œºg l and 17 Œºg l fwh wrc has two stage ozonation as part of the treatment process so detections of bromate were expected lake lanier bromate was below the detection limit in all samples bromate was detected in the dpr pilot finished water at all blend ratios from a combination of the fwh wrc and from formation during pilot ozonation and chlorination bromate exceeded the 10 Œºg l mcl at the pilot effluent three times during the 50 and 100 blends with the highest detected value at 13 Œºg l during the 50 blend bromide was detected in both lake lanier average of 54 21 Œºg l and fwh wrc reclaimed water average of 55 39 Œºg l the pilot ozone dose was set to maintain 1 log inactivation of cryptosporidium which requires an ozone ct of 8 5 mg min l at the lowest water temperature of 11 7 c this matched the full scale plant s operational practice although not required by regulation if dpr were implemented for potable water production pathogen log removal values would require additional investigation and optimization likely including a quantitative microbial risk assessment to achieve regulatory requirements amoueyan et al 2017 ander and forss 2011 barker et al 2013 soller et al 2017 soller et al 2018 fig 7 shows there was less than 1 3 Œºg l of bromate formed through ozonation for all blend ratios tested however higher bromate formation was observed after disinfection with hypochlorite which was higher for blended water up to 4 17 Œºg l formed from chlorination than lake lanier alone 0 4 Œºg l formed bromate formation from ozone may be mitigated using several methods including ozone dose and dissolution method wert et al 2017 ph depression pinkernell and von gunten 2001 gillogly et al 2001 von gunten 2003 ammonia addition pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 jarvis et al 2007 wert et al 2007 chloramine addition wert et al 2007 buffle et al 2004 chlorine dioxide addition mcguire et al 1999 and hydrogen peroxide addition amy and siddiqui 1999 arvai et al 2012 de vera et al 2016 bromate formation may also occur during chlorination though typically less significant than ozonation bromide can be oxidized by hypochlorite to form hypobromite in alkaline conditions ph between 7 and 10 su and high chlorine concentrations up to 4 5 mg l lewin and avrahami 1954 xin et al 2008 however neither of these conditions existed during pilot testing the presence of metal oxides such as copper and nickel may also result in the catalytic conversion of bromide to hypobromous acid hobr and subsequently form bromate liu et al 2012 2013 however copper and nickel were both below detection over the full duration of testing the increased bromate formation observed during chlorination was most likely attributable to contamination from bulk sodium hypochlorite weinberg et al 2003 nsf certified hypochlorite requires less than 5 Œº g l of bromate or 50 of the bromate epa mcl nsf 2013 the hypochlorite used for the first half of the testing during the 0 and 50 blends was nsf certified however non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite was used during the 15 25 and 100 blends thus contamination from stock hypochlorite solutions should be investigated to avoid potential unintended consequences of bromate formation during disinfection there were no detections of cyanide at the pilot influent or through the treatment process but cyanide formation was observed in finished water from the dpr pilot during the 25 and 100 blends finished water cyanide concentrations exceeded the mcl 0 2 mg l cyanide can form during chlorine disinfection stanley and antonio 2012 pandit et al 2006 in particular if oxidized nitrogen ions such as nitrate are present carr et al 1997 higher nitrate concentrations could be expected in advanced treated recycled water where denitrification or ro are not utilized in the presence of chlorine nitrate and nitrite can be converted to nitric and nitrous acid which can subsequently react with organic compounds to form intermediate oximes nitro alkenes and hydroxamic acids these compounds can break down to produce cyanide carr et al 1997 cyanide formation could be mitigated by optimizing for full denitrification at the fwh wrc table 4 shows detections of microbiological targets in the fwh wrc reclaimed water lake lanier and dpr pilot finished water fwh wrc reclaimed water had three detections of hpcs 7380 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml nine detections of total coliforms 199 198 most probable number per 100 ml mpn 100 ml and one detection of e coli 158 mpn 100 ml but all other regulated and unregulated microbiological targets tested were below detection limits interestingly lake lanier had more detections at higher concentrations than the fwh wrc reclaimed water the dpr pilot finished water had no detections of any biological indicators for all blending ratios evaluated including the 100 blend pathogens represent the greatest acute risk to public health dpr pilot testing in this study demonstrated that microbiological targets were of equal or better quality than source water for gwinnett county s current ipr scenario these results are consistent with the findings of a hazard analysis and critical control points analysis conducted showing that the combined treatment trains could achieve greater than 9 5 log removal of cryptosporidium the california based target is 10 log 12 5 log removal of giardia the ca based target is 10 log and 13 5 log virus the ca based target is 12 log such treatment went beyond the minimum level needed to ensure public health protection from pathogenic microorganisms stanford et al 2015 table s2 summarizes the complete list of smcl results from the fwh effluent lake lanier and the dpr pilot effluent for all blends the dpr pilot effluent was below smcls for most samples except during the 50 fwh effluent blend when lake stratification effects impacted lake lanier water quality true color was detected above the smcl of 15 color units cu during the 0 fwh wrc blend baseline testing 56 cu and the 50 blend lake stratification period 95 103 cu the ipr effluent true color was similar at 98 124 cu in the same period manganese was below the smcl for most samples at the pilot however there was one detection above the smcl 0 05 mg l during the 50 fwh effluent blend at 0 052 mg l and two detections above the smcl during the 100 fwh effluent blend at 0 06 and 0 067 mg l these detections were slightly above the smcl which could have minor impacts to color taste and odor and thus impact some end users more significantly for example industrial fabric cleaners concentrations were well below epa health advisory drinking water equivalent level dwel of 1 6 mg l epa 2018 4 conclusions though results generally demonstrated that ozone baf can be used for dpr there are some situations where it may not be ideal the tds in the fwh wrc reclaimed water averaged 402 25 mg l and was below the smcl in cases where tds is near or above the smcl an ozone baf treatment train may not meet potable water quality criteria the ability of ozone baf to remove toc is dependent on site specific factors such as water temperature ph biodegradability of organic carbon ebct and nutrient availability source waters that are cold for extended durations or low in organic carbon compounds may limit biomass formation and bioactivity on the filter media if nom is recalcitrant or only slightly biodegradable it may not be biodegraded or may require longer ebcts additionally reclaimed water with high tds bromide bromate or nitrogen species may not be the best sources for ozone baf modifications can be made to the wastewater treatment process to add denitrification to lower nitrogen in the effluent but tds removal is more difficult to address also alkalinity shifts during nitrification and denitrification processes warrant additional investigation on the associated impacts to bromate formation with more complex matrices in advanced treated water compared to drinking water the use of ozone in reclaimed water is also of concern with respect to dbps including bromate hence these site specific factors need to be taken into consideration if a utility is determining the feasibility of dpr using ozone baf an overall key finding was ozone baf treatment without the use of ro provided potable water of equal or higher quality than current ipr practices when operating as dpr at a 15 blend of advanced treated reclaimed water for the primary and secondary mcls measured during this study an additional benefit was enhanced water quality and operational performance observed when water quality diminished during seasonal changes to lake stratification for inland facilities where use of ro is not an economically viable alternative dpr using advanced treated reclaimed water and two stage ozone biofiltration may be a viable alternative for producing potable water

18325,pilot testing of direct potable reuse dpr using multi stage ozone and biological filtration as an alternative treatment train without reverse osmosis ro was investigated this study examined four blending ratios of advanced treated reclaimed water from the f wayne hill water resources center fwh wrc in gwinnett county georgia combined with the existing drinking water treatment plant raw water supply lake lanier for potable water production baseline testing with 100 percent lake lanier water was initially conducted followed by testing blends of 15 25 50 and 100 reclaimed water from fwh wrc finished water quality from the dpr pilot was compared to drinking water standards and emerging microbial and chemical contaminants were also evaluated results were benchmarked against a parallel indirect potable reuse ipr pilot receiving 100 of the raw water from lake lanier finished water quality from the dpr pilot at the 15 blend complied with the united states primary and secondary maximum contaminant levels mcls and smcls respectively however exceedances of one or more mcls or smcls were observed at higher blends importantly reclaimed water from fwh wrc was of equal or better quality for all microbiological targets tested compared to lake lanier indicating that a dpr scenario could lower acute risks from microbial pathogens compared to current practices finished water from the dpr pilot had no detections of microorganisms even at the 100 fwh wrc effluent blend microbiological targets tested included heterotrophic plate counts total and fecal coliforms escherichia coli somatic and male specific coliphage clostridium perfringens enterococci legionella cryptosporidium and giardia there were water quality challenges primarily associated with nitrate originating from incomplete denitrification and bromate formation from ozonation at the fwh wrc these challenges highlight the importance of upstream process monitoring and control at the advanced wastewater treatment facility if dpr is considered this research demonstrated that ozone with biological filtration could achieve potable water quality criteria without the use of ro in cases where nitrate is below the mcl of 10 mg nitrogen per liter and total dissolved solids are below the smcl of 500 mg per liter graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone biofiltration potable reuse direct potable reuse indirect potable reuse emerging contaminants 1 introduction as increasing population creates greater demands on available water supplies and regulatory requirements for treated wastewater effluent discharges become more stringent many utilities are considering potable reuse as an alternative water supply advanced treated reclaimed water has the potential to meet future water demands as well as provide resiliency in diversifying water supply portfolios as a result potable reuse practices are gaining in both interest and application indirect potable reuse ipr involves the introduction of advanced treated reclaimed water into an environmental buffer e g reservoir river lake aquifer or wetland before being withdrawn for potable water treatment direct potable reuse dpr involves use of advanced treated reclaimed water as a potable raw water supply dpr has been implemented in limited capacity in the united states there are facilities that have been operated for emergency production of potable water or for intermittent supply chanute kansas in the 1950s metzler et al 1958 big spring colorado river municipal water district texas in 2013 which was operated intermittently as dpr and wichita falls texas in 2014 which has since transitioned to ipr lahnsteiner et al 2018 additional dpr facilities are being investigated with the el paso advanced water purification facility texas under construction lahnsteiner et al 2018 in california full advanced treatment fat with reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes are required for ipr that is currently permitted for groundwater injection california state water resources control board 2013 2018 while surface water augmentation is now allowed in the state of california sbddw 16 02 surface water augmentation regulations there have been no permitted facilities that have yet come online the coastal communities in california that implement ipr often only provide secondary biological treatment prior to use as a source for advanced treatment with aquifer recharge agencies including orange county water district city of san diego west basin municipal water district monterrey and the water replenishment district of southern california that practice ipr through groundwater recharge also typically have high total dissolved solids tds as a result ro is necessary to achieve the tds requirements typically 200 1000 mg l established in groundwater basin plans under the california water code ro is highly effective at reduction of concentrations of a wide variety of dissolved constituents drewes et al 2006 wintgens et al 2005 though low molecular weight neutrally charged compounds such as 1 4 dioxane and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma have poor rejection while it provides excellent treatment for a range of constituents ro is capital and operationally cost intensive particularly for inland facilities where the brine concentrate cannot be disposed through a marine discharge the operational costs associated with brine management can render the use of ro technology infeasible schimmoller and kealy 2014 gerrity et al 2014 found that using ozone biologically active filtration baf as part of a non ro treatment train could save 400 000 to 800 000 in energy costs per year compared to fat at a 10 million gallon per day mgd facility gerrity et al 2014 ozone baf is an accepted treatment process at

baf as part of a potable reuse treatment train depends on a variety of water quality factors including the presence of dbp precursors such as nom dissolved organic nitrogen and bromide the concentration of tds and nitrogenous species as well as the temperature and ph kadmi et al 2015 kosaka et al 2014 sgroi et al 2014 advanced treated reclaimed water with either high tds or with either bromate or nitrate concentrations near the national primary drinking water regulation primary maximum contaminant levels mcls should not rely on ozone baf treatment for removal of these constituents modifications can be made to advanced treatment process operations to reduce nitrate or mitigate bromate formation but tds removal is more difficult to address paredes et al 2007 soltermann et al 2017 if water contains tds greater than the secondary maximum contaminant level smcl of 500 mg l fat may prove to be a better option similarly if the source water is high in nitrogen ro is more effective at removing nitrogen species than ozone baf stanford et al 2017 ozone baf without ro has been implemented for dpr full scale at the 2 mgd goreangab water reclamation plant in windhoek namibia since 2002 which provides 35 of the local potable water supply du pisani 2006 the 92 mgd eastern treatment plant in melbourne australia also incorporates ozone baf without ro for non potable reuse blackbeard et al 2016 found that melbourne water s advanced treatment facility reduced below detection limits 55 of 91 trace chemical constituents detected in the municipal secondary effluent and baf alone removed 91 percent of ndma ozone baf without ro has been incorporated into the planned potable reuse treatment scheme at gwinnett county since 2010 where up to 40 mgd of advanced treated reclaimed water from gwinnett county department of water resources f wayne hill water resources center fwh wrc discharges into lake lanier the county s sole drinking water supply the fwh wrc includes primary and secondary treatment with partial denitrification followed by advanced treatment using chemical clarification and settling ultrafiltration granular media filtration pre ozone bac and ozone disinfection yang et al 2011 found that the fwh wrc treatment train removed 13 of 16 emerging contaminants to below detection limits several recent pilot research studies have been conducted to further characterize the treatment efficacy of ozone baf gerrity et al 2011 2014 2018 lee et al 2012 li et al 2015 sundaram et al 2018 vatankhah et al 2019 the objective of this study was to evaluate treatment efficacy using five blending ratios of advanced treated reclaimed water from fwh wrc combined with surface water from lake lanier the raw water source for the drinking water treatment shoal creek filter plant scfp treated water quality was compared to a parallel pilot receiving source water solely from lake lanier for mcls and smcls as well as emerging biological and chemical compounds 2 materials and methods conceptual experimental design the dpr and ipr piloting facilities were installed and commissioned in april 2016 the biofilters were acclimated during a baseline phase using 100 lake lanier water as pilot influent source water over three months similitude testing between the dpr and ipr pilots and the full scale scfp was conducted for one month using 100 lake lanier pilot influent source water over the following nine months four blending ratios 15 25 50 and 100 advanced treated reclaimed water from the fwh wrc were tested through the dpr pilot the 25 and 50 blends were tested during multiple seasons to evaluate temporal variability on pilot water quality blend ratio testing was initiated in september 2016 on the dpr pilot with a 50 blend of fwh wrc reclaimed water from october through mid december 2016 changes in source water quality significantly shifted due to a deepening of the epilimnion layer in lake lanier the ipr pilot fed with lake lanier water only was operated in parallel with the dpr pilot until january 2017 when pilot operating conditions were modified for a different research project lauderdale et al 2018 the treatment trains at fwh wrc and pilot facilities are depicted in fig 1 the fwh wrc advanced treatment process consisted of two parallel trains that provided additional removal of solids and phosphorus the first train had a design flow of 20 mgd and was comprised of two stage chemical clarification followed by granular media filtration gmf loading rate of 3 6 gpm sq ft the second train had a design flow of 40 mgd and used lamella plate settling after chemical clarification the liquid fraction flowed by gravity to ultrafiltration uf membranes flows from the two trains were combined prior to pre ozonation where an ozone dose of 2 5 3 mg l was applied average ozone to toc ratio of 1 2 0 2 ozonated water was filtered using biologically activated carbon bac at a loading rate of 2 69 gpm sq ft effluent from the bac was ozonated again for disinfection at a dose of 1 5 mg l average ozone to toc ratio of 1 4 0 4 prior to discharge pilot plant design and process equipment the 6 gallon per minute gpm dpr and ipr pilot plants replicated the full scale scfp drinking water treatment processes and each included an influent equalization and or blending tank ozonation two stage coagulation two stage flocculation direct biofiltration and chlorine disinfection fig 1 the pilots were manufactured and installed by intuitech salt lake city utah both pilots were installed inside an enclosed building at the scfp the flow equalization blending tanks were covered 1000 gallon 64 inch diameter and 80 inch tall opaque polypropylene tanks norwesco water from the fwh wrc was conveyed seven miles through a 72 inch ductile iron pipe and routed to the pilot room through a 1500 foot two inch diameter polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe water from lake lanier was routed to the pilot plant from the scfp upstream of the inlet channel to the first treatment process ozone and through a 2 inch diameter pvc pipe prior to discharge to the ipr and dpr equalization tanks both water sources passed through a 5 Œºm Œºm bag filter eaton ecoline on the dpr pilot a flow control valve asahi and flowmeter ifm effector sm7001 were used to maintain proportional flow from each water source flow was blended using a 1 inch diameter 7 inch long clear pvc in line static mixer koflo 6 mixing elements prior to entering the blending tank the residence time in the equalization or blending tank was approximately 2 h mainstream ozone injection was performed for the ipr and dpr pilots prior to a contactor consisting of four 18 foot tall 8 inch diameter pvc columns in series the total contactor volume for each pilot was approximately 180 gallons with a detention time of approximately 30 min at 6 gpm sample ports were located on the ozone contactors at approximately 1 min intervals for the first 10 min and 5 min intervals thereafter ozone was generated using a plasma block ozone generator plasma technics fed with 99 pure oxygen from a cylinder airgas ozone produced by the generator was monitored via high concentration ozone analyzer in usa mini hicon analyzer ozone gas flow rate to the venturi injection system was controlled with a combination thermal mass flow meter and valve alicat scientific the ozone dose for each pilot was calculated based upon contactor water flow rate ozone feed gas flow rate and ozone gas concentration two online ozone residual analyzers thermo scientific oz31b were used to monitor dissolved ozone residual in water at two points within the contactors for the ipr and dpr pilots the coagulation stage of both pilot systems used two 2 1 gallon rapid mix tanks where ferric chloride 37 45 by weight national sanitation foundation nsf certified pvs technologies inc was dosed at approximately 0 5 mg per liter mg l with 50 s of mixing velocity gradient of 1000 per second sec followed by 126 sec in the second tank flocculation included two 47 gallon tanks where clarifloc polydimethylsiloxane polymer 20 by weight nsf certified polydyne inc was fed at a typical dose of 1 1 1

75 by weight powder axiall llc at the beginning of the 25 fwh wrc blend chlorine for backwashing and disinfection was switched to non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite 12 5 vwr chemicals bdh the filter backwashing sequence included air scouring at 3 7 standard cubic feet per minute per square foot scfm sq ft for 10 min a low rate wash at 6 gallons per minute per square foot gpm sq ft during the last minute of air scour a high rate wash at 25 gpm sq ft for 10 min 20 gpm sq ft for the bac filter and low rate wash at 11 2 gpm sq ft for 5 min the bac filter had a slightly lower high rate backwash to prevent media loss per manufacturer specifications disinfection was achieved by dosing a stock concentration of nsf certified calcium hypochlorite 65 75 by weight powder axiall llc in line upstream of an opaque 25 gallon tank with a 43 min detention time at typical flows of 0 6 gpm the hypochlorite chemical was switched to a non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite 12 5 vwr chemicals bdh during the 12 25 and 100 blend test periods chlorine disinfection targeted a 1 8 mg l residual in the disinfection tank similar to that achieved in full scale scfp operations however the full scale scfp had a longer detention time in the clearwell at 500 min testing approach each phase was operated until pseudo steady state conditions were achieved for a minimum of one month steady state was achieved when the total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 removal across ozone and coagulation flocculation baf and the biofilter effluent turbidity changed by less than 20 over a one week period routine monitoring was conducted at the dpr pilot influent post ozone post biofiltration and post disinfection sampling ports similitude testing similitude between the ipr and

slight differences in contact times ph temperature uvt turbidity and toc were tested three times per week and doc was tested weekly on the dpr and ipr pilot plants where comparable data were collected at the scfp results were consistent table 1 compares the dpr and ipr pilot operational conditions with the scfp the ozone doses for the pilots were 1 3 mg l and at the scfp was 1 4 mg l first order ozone decay rate constants averaged 0 05 0 03 min 1 0 04 0 01 min 1 and 0 08 0 02 min 1 for the ipr pilot dpr pilot and scfp respectively the slightly higher scfp decay rate was likely attributable to the slightly higher ozone dose and differences in the physical configuration of the full scale ozone residual sampling system the filter hydraulic loading rate was similar for the pilots 3 06 0 09 gpm sq ft compared to the scfp 2 98 0 6 gpm sq ft with an empty bed contact time ebct of approximately 12 min filter headloss accumulation rate hlar for the pilot anthracite filters ranged from 0 019 to 0 027 feet per hour ft hr and the scfp anthracite filters were 0 091 0 013 ft h the difference in hlar was likely due to hydraulic difference in the pilot 6 inch diameter compared to the full scale 1500 sq ft filters the pilot bac filter hlar was slightly higher than the anthracite filters at 0 059 0 015 ft h and 0 082 0 018 ft h for the dpr and ipr pilots respectively the difference in hlar was due to the smaller particle size of the bac media adenosine triphosphate atp was measured on biofilter media from the top 5 inches of the filter bed using the luminultra deposit surface analysis dsa test kit measurements were performed weekly during similitude testing and at the end of each blend ratio test period atp concentrations stabilized after approximately 1 month of operations samples collected monthly thereafter indicated concentrations remained consistent for the remainder of testing with 1 84 105 8 8 104 pg of atp per gram filter media pg g on the pilot anthracite filters 8 83 105 2 5 105 pg g on the pilot bac filters and 3 2 105 2 5 105 pg g for the scfp anthracite filters this was equivalent to 2 75 105 1 3 105 pg per milliliter pg ml on the pilot anthracite filters 5 46 105 1 5 105 pg ml on the pilot bac filters and 4 79 105 3 7 105 pg ml on the scfp anthracite filters these concentrations are typical of biofilters in drinking water treatment plants which have been shown to range between to 102 108 pg g for a one time sampling event at 17 full scale facilities evans et al 2013 and 103 106 pg g for sampling over 9 months at seven full scale facilities hooper et al 2019 once the biofilm was established biomass tended to remain consistent over time which is consistent with previous research on drinking water biofilters pharand et al 2015 hooper et al 2019 lauderdale et al 2018 evans et al 2013 the dpr pilot bac filters had slightly higher atp than the anthracite filters bac media generally supports higher biomass due to its irregular surface structure which allows for attachment biofilm formation and protection from fluid shear stress huck et al 2000 lauderdale et al 2018 the scfp anthracite media had slightly higher atp compared to the dpr pilot anthracite filters this result may have been associated with differences in backwashing frequency while filter backwashing chlorine concentration flow rates and durations were the same the scfp filters were backwashed approximately every 4 days primarily triggered by a terminal headloss of 10 feet the dpr pilot filters were backwashed three times per week typically at a terminal headloss of 2 feet filter effluent water was subsequently disinfected with chlorine the 5 min chlorine demand was similar at 2 68 0 09 2 83 0 02 and 2 76 mg l for the dpr pilot ipr pilot and scfp respectively the first order chlorine decay rates were also similar 0 18 0 03 0 21 0 0 5 and 0 2 for the dpr pilot ipr pilot and scfp respectively dpr pilot blend ratio testing four blending ratios were evaluated with 15 25 50 and 100 fwh wrc reclaimed water as source water for the dpr pilot each blend was run until steady state conditions were achieved or a minimum duration of one month the 25 and 50 blends were evaluated during multiple seasons to assess temporal variations of pilot influent water quality on treatment efficacy in some cases process adjustments were made to optimize the treatment train specific to each blend ratio table 2 summarizes operating conditions of the dpr pilot the ozone dose was set to achieve a 1 log removal credit of cryptosporidium which matched full scale scfp operations the average applied ozone dose 0 86 1 4 mg l and ozone to toc ratio 0 32 0 89 for each blend ratio is summarized in fig s1 the applied ozone dose and ozone to toc ratio declined with increasing blend ratio because fwh wrc effluent had been ozonated twice already which lowered the ozone demand at the pilot however during the 50 blend warm and lake stratification test periods the unusually high ozone demand from lake lanier s epilimnion layer increased the overall blend s applied dose and ozone to toc ratio ferric chloride was fed at 0 5 mg l through the 50 blend cold water period and then was adjusted to 0 55 mg l the polymer dose was 1 15 mg l neat solution through the middle of the 100 blend cold water condition and was then adjusted to 1 2 mg l neat solution to maintain filter effluent turbidity anthracite and bac biofilters maintained the same loading rate as the scfp 3 1 gpm sq ft and 12 2 min ebct operations of the ipr pilot were consistent with the dpr pilot except during the 50 blend during the lake stratification phase for this test period the ipr pilot ozone dose increased from a baseline of 1 36 mg l same as the dpr pilot to 3 mg l and the polymer dose increased to between 1 15 and 1 35 mg l neat solution during this time the fwh wrc maintained consistent operations except for slight differences in alum dose 10 35 mg l ferric dose 20 50 mg l and degree of denitrification in secondary clarifiers from changes in the recycle rate the fwh wrc effluent nitrate concentration that fed the dpr pilot prior to blending was on average 16 2 5 2

international organization for standardization method 11731 2017 carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps were measured at the georgia institute of technology following methods described previously fu et al 2017 3 results and discussion blend ratio testing pilot influent temperature increased with increasing blend ratio as the fwh wrc effluent was slightly warmer than lake lanier the dpr pilot influent temperature at the 15 25 50 and 100 blends were 60 4 1 2 f f 56 9 3 1 66 3 7 1 f and 63 3 1 8 f respectively fig 2 the ipr pilot was slightly lower at an average of 58 5 1 3 54 4 2 6 63 4 7 9 and 53 3 0 7 f during the 15 25 50 and 100 blends respectively increased temperatures may be beneficial to treatment because increased temperatures have faster ozone oxidation kinetics and could increase the rate of biodegradation of contaminants through the biofilters fig 2b shows a substantial decrease in pilot influent and filter effluent turbidity at higher blend ratios as compared to the ipr pilot with 100 lake lanier water fig 2a during the 0 blend baseline testing period the average dpr pilot influent turbidity was 0 65 0 07 nephelometric turbidity units ntu and anthracite filter effluent turbidity was 0 06 0 04 ntu at the 100 blend pilot influent turbidity was an order of magnitude lower at 0 06 0 20 ntu and the filter effluent turbidity was 0 01 0 02 ntu when water quality changes occurred in lake lanier due to changes in lake stratification the temperature increased by 8 f in five days and the turbidity increased by 0 6 ntu since this facility used direct filtration the differential in turbidity was significant during this period the dpr pilot was operated with a 50 fwh wrc blend an increase of 3 f in temperature and 0 3 ntu of turbidity was observed in addition the average toc from lake lanier increased from 1 47 0 06 mg l to 1 79 0 1 mg l the ipr pilot operating conditions were modified to meet increased ozone demand and to maintain filter effluent turbidity which required increasing the ozone dose from 1 2 to 3 mg l and increasing the flocculant dose 1 15 1 35 mg l neat solution while operations on the dpr pilot did not change the ipr pilot filter effluent turbidity averaged 0 14 ntu fig 2a compared to 0 04 ntu on the dpr pilot filter effluent fig 2b the higher quality feed water from the fwh wrc compared to lake lanier provided more consistent operations at the dpr pilot including chemical dose requirements and filter run times and produced better filter effluent turbidity compared to ipr funk et al 2018 fig 2 shows the ipr and dpr pilot filter effluents had periodic spikes in turbidity which were associated with filter backwashing as the set point for placing the filter online after ripening was 0 2 ntu backwashing events accounted for greater than 85 of the turbidity peaks despite these spikes filter effluent turbidity on both pilots was below 0 1 ntu which met the epa long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr requirement of less than 0 3 ntu in 95 percent of monthly samples epa 2010 the dpr pilot effluent turbidity 95th percentile was approximately 0 07 ntu and 0 06 ntu for the anthracite and bac filters respectively while the ipr pilot effluent turbidity 95th percentile was approximately 0 15 ntu and 0 17 ntu for the anthracite and bac filters respectively over the full duration of testing these findings for turbidity chemical doses and filter run times provide a key example of how dpr could be used to improve aspects of water quality and operations particularly during challenging water quality excursions from changes in lake stratification dpr pilot influent and effluent alkalinity and hardness increased at higher blend ratios fig 3 shows the alkalinity of lake lanier water was low ranging from 16 to 20 mg l while the fwh wrc reclaimed water ranged from 85 to 139 mg l the higher alkalinity in the fwh wrc reclaimed water is likely due to the addition of magnesium hydroxide to the fwh treatment process to maintain ph for biological treatment calcium and magnesium were approximately 5 mg l as caco3 in lake lanier and 20 25 mg l as calcium carbonate caco3 in the fwh wrc reclaimed water alkalinity for the dpr pilot blended influent and filter effluent ranged from 37 to 112 mg l as caco3 and did not change appreciably through the pilot the higher calcium magnesium and alkalinity on the dpr pilot could be beneficial for stabilizing ph during treatment and ultimately producing more stable less corrosive water ph remained relatively stable between 6 5 and 7 5 su through the pilot over the full duration of testing toc and doc were generally similar at each monitoring location where doc was approximately 95 of the toc r2 0 97 p 8 8 10 14 n 183 fig 4 shows an increase in toc at the dpr pilot influent at higher blend ratios while the organic carbon loading increased the net toc removal remained similar and there was a slight downward trend in toc percent removal at the dpr pilot effluent with increasing blend ratio there was 25 1 toc removal at the 0 and 15 blends compared to 15 8 toc removal for the 50 and 100 blends there was likely a lower percentage of reactive carbon present with higher blends due to prior ozone bac treatment at the fwh wrc temperature may have been confounding variable because the lowest toc percent removals were also observed during the coldest temperatures toc net removal was highest during the 50 blend warm period with lake stratification effects due to a higher influent toc loading from lake lanier fig 4 toc net removal during the 0 blend averaged 0 37 0 09 mg l 25 removal the 50 blend warm condition averaged 0 41 0 03 mg l 22 removal and the 50 lake stratification period increased to an average of 0 48 0 05 mg l 25 removal toc removal from the pilot influent to bac effluent 24 2 was higher than the anthracite filter 19 8 which may have been attributable to higher biomass as measured via atp supported on the bac media fig 5 shows that while pilot influent toc increased with increasing blend ratio uvt decreased and there was a slight decrease in specific uv absorbance suva these results indicate that the character of the carbon in lake lanier was different from the fwh wrc reclaimed water the average uvt of fwh wrc reclaimed water was 91 7 1 3 which was slightly less than that of lake lanier 92 3 6 7 thus uvt decreased from 94 2 at the 0 blend all lake lanier source water to 91 5 at the 100 fwh wrc blend ratio these differences had implications on treatment ozone demand was lower at higher blend ratios 0 34 0 04 mg l at 100 fwh wrc effluent n 27 compared to lower blend ratios 0 75 0 02 mg l at 0 fwh wrc effluent baseline n 40 the change in carbon content and quality at the dpr pilot influent during higher blend ratios is likely due to the two stage ozonation process with bac at fwh wrc this finding highlights the importance of upstream advanced treatment processes operations on treatment for potable water production in a dpr scenario the dpr pilot finished water quality was below the majority of mcls table 3 summarizes exceedances by blend ratio for a complete list of results see table s1 eighty of the 92 contaminants with mcls or lt2eswtr regulatory levels or guidance levels were monitored during pilot testing this equated to a total of 972 analytical results for samples collected from the dpr pilot effluent of which 16 samples or 1 6 of all samples collected had concentrations exceeding mcls exceedances of nitrate n mcl 9 23 of samples bromate n mcl 3 25 of samples cyanide n mcl 3 30 of samples and the plasticizer di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp n mcl 1 10 of samples were observed for blend ratios of 25 50 and 100 table 3 no exceedances were observed at the 15 blend it is of note that the mcls and smcls under the safe drinking water act address treatment as the means of providing safe drinking water at the tap and that there are amendments that enhanced the law by requiring consumer confidence reports a cost benefit analysis for every new standard an assessment of threats that may warrant source water protection operator training significant infrastructure funding for water system improvements and controls over microbial contaminants and disinfection by products epa 2017 under a dpr scenario there are potentially different source water threats such as improperly disposed of household and industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products or other wastewater derived contaminants that may also pose a health risk thus while drinking water mcls were evaluated as a point of comparison for this study there were other parameters that were also measured and are compared to applicable standards such as health advisory levels and therapeutic doses in a separate publication funk et al 2018 nitrate was conserved through the dpr pilot train fig 6 and was directly impacted by operations at the fwh wrc fwh wrc reclaimed water which did not have a discharge limit for nitrate and was not optimized for denitrification had average nitrate concentrations of 16 2 5 2 mg n l over the duration of testing by contrast nitrate concentrations in lake lanier were less than 0 5 mg n l nitrite and ammonia were typically at or below detection limits the pilot treatment trains were not designed for nitrate removal and nitrate was conserved through the process for example during the 50 blend the average pilot influent nitrate was 8 2 3 3 mg n l and the finished water nitrate was 8 5 3 2 mg n l the primary drinking water limit of 10 mg n l nitrate would limit the blend percentage to less than 50 unless the fwh wrc optimized processes for denitrification fig 7 shows fwh wrc reclaimed water bromate concentrations averaged 6 2 4 8 Œºg per liter Œºg l and ranged between 2 6 Œºg l and 17 Œºg l fwh wrc has two stage ozonation as part of the treatment process so detections of bromate were expected lake lanier bromate was below the detection limit in all samples bromate was detected in the dpr pilot finished water at all blend ratios from a combination of the fwh wrc and from formation during pilot ozonation and chlorination bromate exceeded the 10 Œºg l mcl at the pilot effluent three times during the 50 and 100 blends with the highest detected value at 13 Œºg l during the 50 blend bromide was detected in both lake lanier average of 54 21 Œºg l and fwh wrc reclaimed water average of 55 39 Œºg l the pilot ozone dose was set to maintain 1 log inactivation of cryptosporidium which requires an ozone ct of 8 5 mg min l at the lowest water temperature of 11 7 c this matched the full scale plant s operational practice although not required by regulation if dpr were implemented for potable water production pathogen log removal values would require additional investigation and optimization likely including a quantitative microbial risk assessment to achieve regulatory requirements amoueyan et al 2017 ander and forss 2011 barker et al 2013 soller et al 2017 soller et al 2018 fig 7 shows there was less than 1 3 Œºg l of bromate formed through ozonation for all blend ratios tested however higher bromate formation was observed after disinfection with hypochlorite which was higher for blended water up to 4 17 Œºg l formed from chlorination than lake lanier alone 0 4 Œºg l formed bromate formation from ozone may be mitigated using several methods including ozone dose and dissolution method wert et al 2017 ph depression pinkernell and von gunten 2001 gillogly et al 2001 von gunten 2003 ammonia addition pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 jarvis et al 2007 wert et al 2007 chloramine addition wert et al 2007 buffle et al 2004 chlorine dioxide addition mcguire et al 1999 and hydrogen peroxide addition amy and siddiqui 1999 arvai et al 2012 de vera et al 2016 bromate formation may also occur during chlorination though typically less significant than ozonation bromide can be oxidized by hypochlorite to form hypobromite in alkaline conditions ph between 7 and 10 su and high chlorine concentrations up to 4 5 mg l lewin and avrahami 1954 xin et al 2008 however neither of these conditions existed during pilot testing the presence of metal oxides such as copper and nickel may also result in the catalytic conversion of bromide to hypobromous acid hobr and subsequently form bromate liu et al 2012 2013 however copper and nickel were both below detection over the full duration of testing the increased bromate formation observed during chlorination was most likely attributable to contamination from bulk sodium hypochlorite weinberg et al 2003 nsf certified hypochlorite requires less than 5 Œº g l of bromate or 50 of the bromate epa mcl nsf 2013 the hypochlorite used for the first half of the testing during the 0 and 50 blends was nsf certified however non nsf certified sodium hypochlorite was used during the 15 25 and 100 blends thus contamination from stock hypochlorite solutions should be investigated to avoid potential unintended consequences of bromate formation during disinfection there were no detections of cyanide at the pilot influent or through the treatment process but cyanide formation was observed in finished water from the dpr pilot during the 25 and 100 blends finished water cyanide concentrations exceeded the mcl 0 2 mg l cyanide can form during chlorine disinfection stanley and antonio 2012 pandit et al 2006 in particular if oxidized nitrogen ions such as nitrate are present carr et al 1997 higher nitrate concentrations could be expected in advanced treated recycled water where denitrification or ro are not utilized in the presence of chlorine nitrate and nitrite can be converted to nitric and nitrous acid which can subsequently react with organic compounds to form intermediate oximes nitro alkenes and hydroxamic acids these compounds can break down to produce cyanide carr et al 1997 cyanide formation could be mitigated by optimizing for full denitrification at the fwh wrc table 4 shows detections of microbiological targets in the fwh wrc reclaimed water lake lanier and dpr pilot finished water fwh wrc reclaimed water had three detections of hpcs 7380 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml nine detections of total coliforms 199 198 most probable number per 100 ml mpn 100 ml and one detection of e coli 158 mpn 100 ml but all other regulated and unregulated microbiological targets tested were below detection limits interestingly lake lanier had more detections at higher concentrations than the fwh wrc reclaimed water the dpr pilot finished water had no detections of any biological indicators for all blending ratios evaluated including the 100 blend pathogens represent the greatest acute risk to public health dpr pilot testing in this study demonstrated that microbiological targets were of equal or better quality than source water for gwinnett county s current ipr scenario these results are consistent with the findings of a hazard analysis and critical control points analysis conducted showing that the combined treatment trains could achieve greater than 9 5 log removal of cryptosporidium the california based target is 10 log 12 5 log removal of giardia the ca based target is 10 log and 13 5 log virus the ca based target is 12 log such treatment went beyond the minimum level needed to ensure public health protection from pathogenic microorganisms stanford et al 2015 table s2 summarizes the complete list of smcl results from the fwh effluent lake lanier and the dpr pilot effluent for all blends the dpr pilot effluent was below smcls for most samples except during the 50 fwh effluent blend when lake stratification effects impacted lake lanier water quality true color was detected above the smcl of 15 color units cu during the 0 fwh wrc blend baseline testing 56 cu and the 50 blend lake stratification period 95 103 cu the ipr effluent true color was similar at 98 124 cu in the same period manganese was below the smcl for most samples at the pilot however there was one detection above the smcl 0 05 mg l during the 50 fwh effluent blend at 0 052 mg l and two detections above the smcl during the 100 fwh effluent blend at 0 06 and 0 067 mg l these detections were slightly above the smcl which could have minor impacts to color taste and odor and thus impact some end users more significantly for example industrial fabric cleaners concentrations were well below epa health advisory drinking water equivalent level dwel of 1 6 mg l epa 2018 4 conclusions though results generally demonstrated that ozone baf can be used for dpr there are some situations where it may not be ideal the tds in the fwh wrc reclaimed water averaged 402 25 mg l and was below the smcl in cases where tds is near or above the smcl an ozone baf treatment train may not meet potable water quality criteria the ability of ozone baf to remove toc is dependent on site specific factors such as water temperature ph biodegradability of organic carbon ebct and nutrient availability source waters that are cold for extended durations or low in organic carbon compounds may limit biomass formation and bioactivity on the filter media if nom is recalcitrant or only slightly biodegradable it may not be biodegraded or may require longer ebcts additionally reclaimed water with high tds bromide bromate or nitrogen species may not be the best sources for ozone baf modifications can be made to the wastewater treatment process to add denitrification to lower nitrogen in the effluent but tds removal is more difficult to address also alkalinity shifts during nitrification and denitrification processes warrant additional investigation on the associated impacts to bromate formation with more complex matrices in advanced treated water compared to drinking water the use of ozone in reclaimed water is also of concern with respect to dbps including bromate hence these site specific factors need to be taken into consideration if a utility is determining the feasibility of dpr using ozone baf an overall key finding was ozone baf treatment without the use of ro provided potable water of equal or higher quality than current ipr practices when operating as dpr at a 15 blend of advanced treated reclaimed water for the primary and secondary mcls measured during this study an additional benefit was enhanced water quality and operational performance observed when water quality diminished during seasonal changes to lake stratification for inland facilities where use of ro is not an economically viable alternative dpr using advanced treated reclaimed water and two stage ozone biofiltration may be a viable alternative for producing potable water

18326,for the control of sulfide and methane in sewers it is favorable to reduce their production rather than to remove them after generation in this study we revealed rapid and strong biocidal effect of ferrate fe vi on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms leading to control of sulfide and methane production in sewer the inactivation of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms by fe vi could be accomplished within 15 min for a single dosing event and the biocidal effect could be enhanced by applying pulse dosing strategy the microbiological analysis showed that the key functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production i e dsra and mcra in the viable cells after fe vi dosing were decreased substantially by 84 2 and 86 6 respectively significant drops were also observed in the relative abundances of viable sulfide reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma the direct dosing of fe vi into a sewer reactor led to instant and complete suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities and the recovery of the activities resembled the regrowth of residual srb and ma the results of this study suggested the feasibility for developing an efficient and cost effective sulfide and methane control strategy using fe vi graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm ferrate biocidal effect sulfate reducing bacteria methanogenic archaea 1 introduction sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour have long been considered as major problems in sewer management the rehabilitation or replacement of corroded sewer pipes always brings heavy financial burdens on water industries and local governments pikaar et al 2014 meanwhile the malodor caused by sulfide emission can arouse plenty of complaints from the neighborhoods jiang et al 2017 sun et al 2015b in addition high concentration of hydrogen sulfide in sewers may pose health risks to related workers due to its toxicity a common practice to control sulfide in sewers to date is the dose of chemicals jiang et al 2015a for example oxidants such as oxygen air nitrate and hydrogen peroxide are usually added into sewers to oxidize sulfide metal salts mainly including ferrous chloride and ferric chloride are also frequently applied to precipitate sulfide in sewers elevation of ph by dosing alkali is another commonly used method to reduce sulfide emission from sewer however most of the chemical dosing strategies for sulfide control in sewers involve constant chemical addition to remove sulfide already formed and therefore resulting in high operational cost due to large chemical consumptions ganigue et al 2011 methane emission from sewers has also been recognized as a potential environmental issue since the last decade methane is a potent greenhouse gas with around 21 times global warming potential of carbon dioxide ipcc 2006 its emission from sewers could contribute considerably to the overall greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater systems guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2015 even worse the release of methane from sewers can pose serious safety risks because of its relatively low explosion limit lower explosive level is approximately 5 spencer et al 2006 moreover the loss of soluble cod due to methanogenic activity may cause adverse effect on biological nutrient removal at the downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps guisasola et al 2008 sun et al 2015a therefore the control of methane emission should also be included in the sewer management to control the sulfide and methane in sewer systems effectively and economically it is favorable to reduce sulfide and methane production rather than to remove them after their production in fact the production of sulfide and methane in sewer is mainly caused by the metabolism of microorganisms in biofilms attached on the sewer pipe walls specifically under the anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria srb in sewer biofilms use various kinds of organic matters and hydrogen as electron donors and sulfate as electron acceptor to produce sulfide li et al 2018 besides methane can be generated through the anaerobic respiration of methanogenic archaea ma using hydrogen and acetate as common substrates sun et al 2014 therefore suppressing the metabolic activities of microorganisms in sewer biofilms especially these of srb and ma is of vital importance for establishing cost effective sulfide and methane control strategies in sewers to this end antimicrobial agents including metabolic inhibitors and broad spectrum biocides have been under investigation cheung and beech 1996 studied the effect of three different biocides i e formaldehyde glutaraldehyde and isothiozolone on sessile srb they found that activities of srb biofilm were decreased by 74 100 after exposure to these three compounds at 400 mg l for 24 h similarly gardner and stewart 2002 reported that a dose of glutaraldehyde at 500 mg l for 7 h could completely suppress the sulfide production by a mixed culture biofilm molybdate a metabolic inhibitor for srb has also been used to control sulfide production in swine manure municipal solid wastes and anaerobic digesters isa and anderson 2005 zahedi et al 2014 nevertheless the application of these chemicals in sewer systems could have adverse impact on the downstream wwtps and receiving water due to their generic toxicity and low biodegradability recent studies revealed that free nitrous acid fna was able to decrease the number of viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms substantially thus suppressing the sulfide and methane production jiang et al 2011 however to ensure a satisfactory biocidal effect of fna a long exposure time 6 24 h was often required it is therefore desirable to develop a new chemical dosing strategy to inactivate sewer biofilm in a more rapid and safe way ferrate fe vi a high valent tetraoxy iron has recently come to the forefront as a multifunctional water treatment chemical chen et al 2018a 2018b fe vi could be used as oxidant and disinfectant in water and wastewater treatment leaving nontoxic fe iii oxides hydroxides after its application which initiates the process of coagulation sharma et al 2015 in particular fe vi can effectively kill various bacteria and viruses such as escherichia coli sphaerotilus bacillus salmonella and bacteriophage ms2 cho et al 2006 jiang et al 2007 sharma 2007 it has been observed that fe vi could achieve 99 9 kill rates of total coliforms at the dosage of 0 5 12 5 ppm in water sources collected worldwide sharma 2007 in addition a pioneering study on biofilm showed that a ferrate vi concentration of 10 5 m can effectively prevent biofilm growth on a condenser with only 5 min contact time every 12 h fagan and waite 1983 the strong disinfection effect of fe vi suggested the possibility of its use to control the metabolic activities of microorganisms in sewer biofilms within short contact time also as the use of fe vi does not produce any mutagenic carcinogenic by products sharma et al 2015 its application in sewer system could avoid adverse impact on water environment therefore an in depth understanding of the biocidal effect of fe vi on the microorganisms situated in sewer biofilms would have great practical significance for sulfide and methane control in sewer management the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fe vi on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the effects of fe vi concentrations exposure time dosing modes and ph on the viability of microorganisms in the biofilm were evaluated the differences in abundances of functional genes of viable cells related to sulfide and methane production and microbial community in the biofilm with and without fe vi treatment were also explored by means of propidium monoazide treatment combined with real time polymerase chain reactions pma qpcr and high throughput sequencing respectively in addition direct dosing of fe vi into the sewer reactor was conducted for assessing its effects on sulfide and methane production activities the results of this study are expected to lay a fundamental basis for developing efficient and cost effective sulfide and methane control strategies by applying fe vi 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer reactor setup and operation lab scale sewer reactors namely r1 r2 and r3 made of perspextm were set up in parallel to develop sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms under anaerobic conditions fig s1 supplementary information the reactor has a diameter of 80 mm and a height of 200 mm resulting in an effective volume of 1 l a small reservoir is connected to the top of the reactor to ensure air tightness three strings of plastic carriers of approximately 1 cm in diameter were mounted in the reactors to provide additional surface for biofilm growth and to allow the sampling of intact biofilms the total biofilm area in each reactor including the inner wall inner surface of the lid and the carriers was approximately 0 1 m2 resulting in the area to 100 m2 m3 the reactors were fed with real wastewater collected every three days from a wet well in shanghai china the sewage typically contained sulfide at concentration of 1 2 mg s l sulfate at concentration between 50 and 60 mg s l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 50 100 mg cod l after the collection the wastewater was stored immediately in a freezer at 4 c to minimize the change of water composition it was then heated up to 20 c and fed to the reactors through a peristaltic pump every 6 h during each pumping event 1 l of wastewater was transferred into the reactor over 2 min the wastewater in the reactor was mixed with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm to produce a moderate shear force and avoid solids settling at the bottom batch tests were conducted every two weeks to measure the sulfide and methane production activities of each reactor at the start of the tests fresh wastewater was pumping into reactors for 6 min to ensure a thorough replacement of liquid in the reactors wastewater was sampled at 0 20 40 60 min after the pumping events to analyze sulfide sulfate and dissolved methane concentrations using method described in section 2 7 sulfide and methane production rates spr and mpr were calculated using linear regression of sulfide and methane concentrations the following experiments were commenced when all three reactors reached the pseudo steady state as suggested by the relatively stable spr and mpr 2 2 viability tests on the biocidal effect of fe vi three sets of viability tests i e experiment i iii were carried out to investigate the biocidal effects of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the fe vi concentration exposure time initial ph and dosing mode applied in each test were listed in table 1 in experiment i the effect of fe vi concentration and exposure time on cell viability in biofilms were evaluated the fe vi concentrations applied on the biofilms varied from 0 to 200 mg fe l and the exposure time ranged from 15 to 60 min while the initial ph of the wastewater remained unadjusted at 7 5 the experiment ii explored the effect of ph on the biocidal effect of fe vi in the test the fe vi concentration was kept at 120 mg fe l while the initial ph of the wastewater varied from 5 to 9 the exposure time was kept at 60 min experiment iii was designed to assess that if pulse dosing mode could enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm in this study a high concentration dosing event was split into three low concentration dosing events with the concentration and exposure duration for each event listed in table 1 the tests were carried in the 50 ml tubes filled with filtered 0 22 Œºm wastewater the ph of wastewater was adjusted by hcl 1 m when necessary according to the experimental design table 1 a plastic carrier with attached biofilm was transferred from the biofilm reactor r1 into each tube different volume of stock solution of k2feo4 1 g fe l was added to each tube to achieve the designed fe vi concentrations according to table 1 then the tubes were capped to avoid contacting of air and gently mixed by an orbital shaker at 60 rpm after a certain duration of incubation used in each set of tests as described in table 1 the biofilm on the carriers were sampled for live dead staining using the method illustrated in section 2 4 also pma qpcr and illumina miseq sequencing were performed to evaluate the effect of fe vi on the functional genes for sulfide and methane production as well as microbial community in the sewer biofilm with the method to be further described 2 3 direct fe vi dosing to sewer biofilm reactors fe vi was directly added to the lab scale sewer reactor r2 and the loss of sulfide and methane production activities was monitored after fe vi dosing during subsequent recovery period the fe vi dosing strategy in the reactor fe concentration and exposure time dosing mode was deterimined based on the above viability tests results specifically k2feo4 was immediately dosed into the reactor after a pumping event to reach a fe vi concentration of 60 mg fe l the dosing event was repeated for another two times in every 15 min resulted in a total fe vi dosage of 180 mg fe l the batch tests for determining spr and mpr in the reactor as described in section 2 1 were conducted immediately after the fe vi treatment and in the next 60 days with intervals of two days to two weeks the spr and mpr of r3 without fe vi dosing were also monitored during the same period serving as a control in addition the volatile suspended solids vss in the influent and effluent of the reactors were also monitored to assess the effect of fe vi dosing on integrity of the biofilm structure 2 4 live dead staining the viability of bacterial cells in biofilms was determined using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 the viability kit involves two nucleic acid stains namely green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi the syto 9 could label all cells while pi could only penetrate cells with damaged membrane and resulted in a reduction in the syto 9 stain fluorescence as a result the viable cells are stained green whereas the dead cells are stained red before the staining process the plastic carriers were transferred to filtered 0 22 Œºm wastewater and the biofilms were detached through vigorous vortex mixing vortex 5 kylin bell the staining of cells was conducted based on protocols provided by the manufacturer basically 3 Œºl mixture of syto 9 and pi volume ratio 1 1 was added into 200 Œºl of biofilm suspension and mixed thoroughly the sample was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min then 5 Œºl of the stained biofilm suspension was transferred to a microscope slide and photographed using a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon corp japan with a halogen lamp 30 w 6 v boulos et al 1999 hu et al 2017 twenty images of randomly chosen areas of the stained biofilm samples were taken for quantification the ratio of live and dead microorganisms was deterimined by the relative abundance of green and red pixels via the image analysis software daime version 1 3 2 5 pma qpcr pma qpcr analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of fe vi on the abundance of functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production in the viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms pma can selectively enter dead cells and inhibit the dna amplification during subsequent qpcr as a result only abundance of genes in living cells will be quantified the biofilm treated by pulse dosing of fe vi at 60 mg fe l for three times as described in section 2 2 and the biofilms without fe vi treatment were examined for this purpose the abundances of key genes in srb and ma i e dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsra and methyl coenzyme m reductase mcra genes were tested in addition the 16s rrna genes of total bacteria and total archaea in living cells were also quantified and compared the primers used for each targeting gene were listed in tables s1 and si the pma qpcr analysis was carried out in the following steps firstly the biofilms were detached from the carries in pbs using the method described in section 2 4 subsequently the samples were centrifuged and resuspended in pbs to allow the vss concentrations of biofilm suspensions in the recommended range for pma cross linking tian et al 2017 the pma treatment of the samples was then carried out based on protocal described by taskin et al 2011 and the details of the protocal were illustrated in si afterwards dna extractions were conducted using tiannamp soil dna kit tiangen beijing china according to the manufacturer s instruction the qpcr was then performed using the steponeplus real time pcr detection system with the reaction condition further described in si each pcr reaction was run in triplicate for quality assurance and statistical analysis purposes 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis the high throughput sequencing was conducted on the same biofilm sample used for pma qpcr analysis to explore the effect of fe vi dosing on the viable microbial community structure of sewer biofilm the samples were firstly undergone with pma treatment to ensure only viable cells were analyzed then dna was extracted and a pair of universal primes 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 designed to target the variable regions v4 v5 of the microbial 16s rrna gene was applied for pcr amplification walters et al 2016 the sequencing was performed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china on illumina hiseq2500 platform date analysis was implemented on the online i sanger sever http www i sanger com of majorbio bio pharmtechnology co ltd detailed procedures of the analysis were described in si the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number srp186539 2 7 chemical analysis the sulfate concentration was measured by an ion chromatograph with a conductivity dector dionex ics 1000 and the sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method sharma et al 1997 the wastewater samples were firstly filtered 0 22 Œºm membrane before sulfate and sulfide measurement dissolved methane concentration in wastewater was analyzed using gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector gc fid shimadzu gc 2010 plus based on the method previously reported by sturm et al 2015 the detection limit of the method is 0 4 Œºg l and the recovery ratio is 93 vfa concentration was measured using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 2010 plus and the vss of the wastewater were measured according to standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid biocidal effect of ferrate on the sewer biofilm the effects of fe vi concentration and exposure time on the microorganisms viability in sewer biofilms were illustrated in fig 1 the results showed that the viable cells in biofilms dropped significantly from 82 to 35 with the increase of fe vi concentration from 0 to 120 mg fe l at all tested fe vi exposure time whereas a further increase of fe vi dosage to 200 mg fe l did not decrease the viability of microorganisms in biofilms anymore more importantly the results showed no significant difference p 0 05 in the percentage of viable cells in the biofilms with the exposure time decreased from 60 min to 15 min at all tested fe vi dosing rates fig 1a this indicated that fe vi could achieve substantial inactivation rate of microorganisms in sewer biofilms with relatively high efficiency i e within 15 min the dependency of the percentage of viable microorganisms in the biofilm on the ferrate concentration under different exposure times could be satisfactorily described using the exponential decay model y y 0 a e b x as shown in fig 1b the estimated parameters with the standard errors were listed in tables s2 and si the high correlation between experimentally measured results and model predicts r2 0 95 in all three cases further confirmed that there was no significant difference in microorganism viabilities under different fe vi exposure times the biocidal effect of fe vi is believed to mainly rely on its oxidation capacity the redox potential of fe vi e0 2 20 v is the highest among the chemicals used for water and wastewater treatment jiang 2014 the strong oxidation capacity of fe vi enables it to pose damaging effect on cell wall protoplasm genome and other vital microorganism organs thus leading to the instantaneous death of the microorganisms talaiekhozani et al 2017 in addition reactive oxygen species of o2 and h2o2 could also be produced during the decomposition of fe vi which could also contribute to the rapid biocidal effect of fe vi hu et al 2012 the high inactivation efficiency of fe vi on microorganisms revealed in this study was in accordance with those observed by other researchers for example jiang et al 2007 found that a fe vi dosage of 8 mg l can achieve 90 100 inactivation efficiency on e coli in model water samples with exposure times between 5 and 30 min also it has been reported that exposure time required to obtain 2 log10 inactivation of bacteriophages f2 and qŒ≤ was only 5 min hu et al 2012 it is worthwhile to note that the minimum exposure time used in this study was 15 min it is also likely that the exposure time less than 15 min could also achieve the same biocidal effect on the sewer biofilms which required further investigation in this study the minimal fe vi dosing amount through a single dosing event to achieving lowest viability of microorganisms in sewer biofilms was 120 mg fe l which was much high than that required for drinking water and wastewater disinfection 10 50 mg fe l jiang et al 2006 talaiekhozani et al 2017 one possible reason is that the abundance of microorganisms in the sewer biofilm was much higher than that in drinking water or treated wastewater it may also attribute to the penetration limitation caused by the biofilm matrix sun et al 2014 the microorganisms in drinking water or freshwater were mostly in suspension so that fe vi can easily get access to them however the microorganisms in sewer biofilms were aggregated within a slimy extracellular matrix which could hamper the chemical penetration therefore a higher dosing rate is required for fe vi to reach the microorganisms located in the inner layer of the biofilms moreover the reactions between fe vi and organic matters in the wastewater are also likely to weaken the biocidal effect of fe vi on sewer biofilm deng et al 2018 fan et al 2018 notably a further increase of fe vi dosing rate to 200 mg l did not significantly reduce the microbial viability in sewer biofilms this is possibly due to that fe vi could be fast self decomposed under high concentration resulted in a similar effective fe vi amount acting on the biofilm lee et al 2014 therefore in order to enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi other approaches rather than simply increasing the fe vi dosing rate should be explored see details in section 3 2 3 2 enhancing the biocidal effect of ferrate through pulse dosing strategy the pulse dosing strategy i e split a single high rate dosing event into three low rate dosing events table 1 was applied to explore if it could enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilms the viability of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms after pulse dosing was compared with that obtained after a single high rate dosing and the results were summarized in fig 2 the results clearly show that the percentage of viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms can be significantly reduced by applying the pulse dosing strategy with different fe vi dosing rates from low to high in particular the viability of the microorganisms decreased from 61 5 with a single dosing of 60 mg fe l to 36 8 with three dosing of 20 mg fe l also the percentage of viable microorganisms reduced from 41 4 to 33 1 when a single dosage of 120 mg fe l was divided into 40 mg fe l for three times dosing when applying a dosage of 60 mg fe l for three times 180 mg fe l in total on the biofilm the overall viability of the microorganisms could further reduced to 17 6 which is only about half of that achieved with a single dosage of 200 mg fe l the results above suggested that the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm could be reinforced by applying pulse dosing strategy during the fe vi treatment its self decomposition is recognized as an unfavorable factor to its treatment effectiveness it has been reported that the self decomposition rate of fe vi followed the second order kinetics with respect to fe vi concentration lee et al 2014 sarma et al 2012 this suggested that fe vi will be decomposed more rapidly with a higher initial concentration therefore if the pulse dosing of fe vi with a low concentration was applied the fast self decomposition of fe vi under high concentration conditions could be avoid based on the second order kinetics it could be estimated that the maximum lasting duration of fe vi in the system could be increased about 3 time if a high rate dosing event being divided into three low rate dosing event with a potential longer lasting duration the actual fe vi loadings taking effect on the biofilm may be increased as a result the biocidal effect of fe vi could be enhanced in addition as fe vi has been found to change the extracellular polymeric substances eps components in sewage sludge zhang et al 2016 it may also be able to react with the eps of sewer biofilm and resulted in a loose structure after the first or second dosing event therefore the penetration depth of fe vi into the biofilm could increase during the following treatment and its biocidal effect was consequently improved the highest inactivation rate achieved by fe vi dosing revealed in this study viability of 17 6 was slightly lower than that achieved by fna dosing viability 15 as reported by jiang et al 2011 however it should be noted that the optimization of the pulse dosing strategy was not included in this study it is quite possible that the viability of the microorganisms in biofilms could further decreased after optimizing the fe vi dosing rate and frequency which is worthy to be investigated in future 3 3 the effect of ph on the biocidal effect of fe vi the viability of the microorganisms in biofilms treated with fe vi 120 mg fe l for 60 min at different initial ph was evaluated with the results presented in fig 3 overall the ph of the wastewater did not significantly affect the viability of the microorganisms at the tested range the drop of ph from 9 to 6 slightly decreased the percentage of the viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms while a more notable decrease from 36 3 to 28 0 was observed when the ph is changing from 6 to 5 it has been reported that the effectiveness of fe vi treatment under acidic conditions is much better than that under basic conditions shin et al 2018 however in this study we did not observe of significant enhancement in biocidal effect of fe vi on sewer biofilm when the ph changing from 9 to 5 this is probably due to the increase of ph of wastewater to basic range after fe vi dosing fig s2 actually the effectiveness of fe vi treatment was also related to the proportion of different fe vi species in the water fe vi can be disassociated into different species feo4 2 hfeo4 and h2feo4 according to the ph and the protonated forms of fe vi hfeo4 and h2feo4 were found to be more reactive than feo4 2 cho et al 2006 the fraction of different fe vi species in the experiments in this section was calculated based on the ph profiles and its disassociation constants pka1 3 50 and pka2 7 23 the results show that the average proportion of hfeo4 was changed in a narrow range between 0 4 and 5 fig 3 resulted in the unobvious enhancement in the biocidal effect of fe vi in fact in most cases the inactivation of microorganisms by protonated fe vi was achieved under buffered condition phosphate buffer cho et al 2006 hu et al 2012 however to maintain the ph of wastewater with phosphate buffer would induce great amount of phosphate into the sewer system it may consequently increase the burden of phosphorus removal on the downstream wwtps as phosphorus is an essential nutrient for organisms without proper treatment its discharged could cause eutrophication in receiving water jiang and yuan 2015 since fe vi could already pose considerable biocidal effect on the sewer biofilm under natural ph through pulse dosing strategy to enhance its biocidal effect by adjusting the ph of wastewater is unnecessary 3 4 fe vi reduces the abundances of functional genes responsible for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis the abundances of bacterial 16s rrna archaeal 16s rrna dsra and mcra genes in the viable cells in sewer biofilms with and without fe vi treatment 60 mg fe l three times dosing were compared in fig 4 the bacterial 16s rrna and archaeal 16s rrna genes decreased by 74 4 and 84 2 respectively indicating that archaea are more vulnerable to fe vi treatment than bacteria overall the decreases of total viable bacteria and archaea in the sewer biofilms revealed by pma qpcr analysis were in good agreement with that suggested by live dead staining fig 2 which further confirmed the strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm the abundances of dsra and mcra genes were also decreased significantly after fe vi treatment as shown in fig 4 the abundance of dsra in the viable microorganism with fe vi treatment was only 15 8 of that without fe vi treatment and the abundance of mcra remained only 13 4 after fe vi exposure the dsra gene encodes the dissimilatory sulfate reductase which catalyses the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate to sulfite during sulfidogenic processes ben dov et al 2007 similarly mcra is a key gene responsible for methanogenesis it encodes the terminal enzyme complex in the methane generation pathway i e methyl coenzyme m reductase which catalyses the reduction of a methyl group bound to coenzyme m with the concomitant release of methane luton et al 2002 the decreases of dsra and mcra abundances in sewer biofilms indicated its sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities were strongly inhibited by fe vi dosing 3 5 relative abundances of viable srb and ma decreasing after fe vi exposure the microbial communities with viable cells in the sewer biofilms with and without fe vi treatment 60 mg fe l three times dosing were evaluated through illumina miseq sequencing and compared in figs s3 and si with their alpha diversity indices listed in tables s3 and si the relative abundances of viable srb and ma in sewer biofilms were explored in detail and compared in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a the srb in sewer biofilms were mainly affiliated within seven genera desulforhabdus desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacterium desulfobulbus desulfomonile desulfomicrobium with desulforhabdus 1 7 being predominant in the untreated biofilm after fe vi treatment the abundances of five srb genera desulforhabdus desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacterium desulfomicrobium were decreased while the relative abundances of desulfobulbus and desulfomonile increased slightly however the relative abundances of total srb were still decreased by 63 as presented in fig 6 b which indicated that srb in the biofilms were more sensitive to fe vi treatment than other microorganisms this is probably due to that srb are located in the out layer of the sewer biofilm sun et al 2014 where the fe vi concentration was higher than that in the inner layer similarly the relative abundance of ma was significantly decreased by 90 after fe vi treatment fig 5b specifically the proportions of three ma genera found in the tested biofilm i e methanobacterium methanosaeta and methano methylovorans were all dropped with the methanobacterium became almost negligible after fe vi dosing fig 5a ma usually showed a lower tolerance than bacteria to many chemicals such as oxygen sulfide and long chain fatty acids due to their special compositions of cell membrane dong et al 2019 this is also true in the case of fe vi as suggested by the results of this study the decreases of relative abundances of srb and ma in the sewer biofilm were consistent with that revealed by pma qpcr as numbers of dsra and mcra genes decreased more substantially than total bacterial 16s rrna gene these results indicated that fe vi posed strong biocidal effect on srb and ma in sewer biofilms the complete suppression of sulfate reduction and methane production in sewer biofilms could be achieved even when not all microorganisms were inactivated 3 6 suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities after fe vi dosage to sewer reactors the sulfide and methane production rates in the fe vi dosed sewer reactor r2 relative to the control reactor r3 were shown in fig 6a the sulfide and methane production were completely suppressed after fe vi dosage commerced on day 0 afterwards the spr and mpr were slowly recovered without significant lag phase the recovery phase could be well described by the gompertz growth model huang 2003 suggested that the recovery process was similar to microbial regrowth according to the model prediction the time required for 50 recovery rt50 of spr was 10 1 days while the rt50 of mpr would took much longer 44 5 days the rt50 of spr and mpr after fe vi dosage were comparable to that after fna dosage as reported by jiang et al 2011 despite that the viability of the biofilm after fe vi treatment observed in this study was slightly higher one possible reason is that fe vi dosing may destroy the eps produced by the microorganisms situated in the sewer biofilm and consequently result in a loose biofilm structure wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 fe vi dosing could cause significant biofilm detachment in the reactor as suggested by a substantial increase in the vss concentration of the effluent after fe vi dosage fig 6b therefore the viable microorganisms attached on the sewer reactor became less and the recovery period was prolonged 3 7 practical implication this study for the first time demonstrated the rapid and strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the inactivation of microorganisms in the sewer biofilm could be accomplished within 15 min for every single dosing by innovatively applying the pulse dosing strategy the biocidal effect could be significantly enhanced and satisfactory inactivation efficiency could be realized the detailed investigation into srb and ma revealed decreases in both functional genes copies and relative abundances after fe vi exposure this indicated that srb and ma might be more vulnerable to fe vi exposure than other microorganisms in sewer biofilms all these results indicated that fe vi has a promising perspective in controlling sulfide and methane in sewer systems and thus a new method for sulfide and methane control using fe vi can be proposed the traditional chemical strategies for sulfide control in sewer mainly rely on the oxidation precipitation and reducing gas liquid transfer of sulfide already generated and constant dosing is required ganigue et al 2011 the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm can result in a long recovery period for sulfide and methane production which makes intermittent dosing of fe vi possible consequently the chemical dosing amount could be largely reduced besides as the wastewater in sewers is usually flowing continous dosing is needed to ensure the exposure time long enough for the inactivation process the short exposure time required for fe vi treatment suggested that chemcial usage for each dosing event is low which further guarantees the low chemcial consumption and also improves the ease of operation there are many other potential advantages regarding the fe vi dosing the reduction of fe vi would produce nontoxic fe iii hydroxides which could precipitate sulfide in sewers at the downstream location zhang et al 2009 adding iron salts in sewers could also be beneficial to phosphorus removal at the downstream wwtp where iron sulfide precipitates are oxidised in aeration tanks regenerating iron phosphate precipitates gutierrez et al 2010 a more recent study also demonstrated iron salts dosed in sewers could decrease sulfide generation in sludge digestions and promote the dewatering performance of anaerobic digested sludge rebosura et al 2018 during the practical application of fe vi its relatively high price used to be a concern however based on the intermittent dosing strategy and short exposure time the total cost for the chemical is expected to be low we estimated the chemical cost of fe vi dosing to achieve 80 sulfide control is 0 02 m3 or 1 6 kg s based on the results in section 3 5 total fe vi dosage of 180 mg fe l with an exposure time of 45 min and a dosing interval of 4 5 days for achieving sulfide control efficiency of 80 it is much lower than the chemcial costs of many other chemical dosing methods such as using ferric ferrous and nitrate tables s4 and si also studies have suggested that fe vi could be generate in situ through wet chemical method by the reactions of fe iii oxides or their salts with hypochlorite ocl in highly alkaline solution waite 2012 alternatively it could be produced through electrochemical synthesis with the use of iron electrodes jiang et al 2015b nikoliƒá bujanoviƒá et al 2016 by applying these methods the costs for the chemcial consumption might be further reduced the effects of fe vi dosing on the wastewater characteristics such as the cod decrease and ph elevation were not included in this study which should be fully evaluated in the future however it should be noted that fe vi would not be added to the entire sewer network at the same time by adding fe vi to different sections of a network at different times the impacts on wastewater characteristics at the downstream wwtps could be alleviated and the ph would be neutralized therefore further optimization of the fe vi dosing strategy at the network scale should be carried out to achieve effective sulfide and methane control in sewer with the minimal chemical consumption rate and avoiding potential adverse impact on downstream wwtps overall the intermittent dosing of fe vi with pulse dosing strategy can be a cost effective strategy for sewer corrosion odour and greenhouse gas control which bears great application potential in the sewer management 4 conclusions this study evaluated the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilm and the following conclusions can be drawn fe vi has a rapid biocidal effect on the microorganisms in the sewer biofilm with the inactivation process achieved within 15 min through a single dosing the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm could be enhanced through pulse dosing strategy and is not affected by the ph of the wastewater fe vi significantly decreased the functional genes responsible for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis and also reduced the relative abundances of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the rapid and strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm suggested that it could be intermittently added for controlling sulfide and methane production in sewers which is a cost effective strategy for sewer corrosion odour and greenhouse gas control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18326,for the control of sulfide and methane in sewers it is favorable to reduce their production rather than to remove them after generation in this study we revealed rapid and strong biocidal effect of ferrate fe vi on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms leading to control of sulfide and methane production in sewer the inactivation of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms by fe vi could be accomplished within 15 min for a single dosing event and the biocidal effect could be enhanced by applying pulse dosing strategy the microbiological analysis showed that the key functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production i e dsra and mcra in the viable cells after fe vi dosing were decreased substantially by 84 2 and 86 6 respectively significant drops were also observed in the relative abundances of viable sulfide reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma the direct dosing of fe vi into a sewer reactor led to instant and complete suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities and the recovery of the activities resembled the regrowth of residual srb and ma the results of this study suggested the feasibility for developing an efficient and cost effective sulfide and methane control strategy using fe vi graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm ferrate biocidal effect sulfate reducing bacteria methanogenic archaea 1 introduction sulfide induced sewer corrosion and odour have long been considered as major problems in sewer management the rehabilitation or replacement of corroded sewer pipes always brings heavy financial burdens on water industries and local governments pikaar et al 2014 meanwhile the malodor caused by sulfide emission can arouse plenty of complaints from the neighborhoods jiang et al 2017 sun et al 2015b in addition high concentration of hydrogen sulfide in sewers may pose health risks to related workers due to its toxicity a common practice to control sulfide in sewers to date is the dose of chemicals jiang et al 2015a for example oxidants such as oxygen air nitrate and hydrogen peroxide are usually added into sewers to oxidize sulfide metal salts mainly including ferrous chloride and ferric chloride are also frequently applied to precipitate sulfide in sewers elevation of ph by dosing alkali is another commonly used method to reduce sulfide emission from sewer however most of the chemical dosing strategies for sulfide control in sewers involve constant chemical addition to remove sulfide already formed and therefore resulting in high operational cost due to large chemical consumptions ganigue et al 2011 methane emission from sewers has also been recognized as a potential environmental issue since the last decade methane is a potent greenhouse gas with around 21 times global warming potential of carbon dioxide ipcc 2006 its emission from sewers could contribute considerably to the overall greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater systems guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2015 even worse the release of methane from sewers can pose serious safety risks because of its relatively low explosion limit lower explosive level is approximately 5 spencer et al 2006 moreover the loss of soluble cod due to methanogenic activity may cause adverse effect on biological nutrient removal at the downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps guisasola et al 2008 sun et al 2015a therefore the control of methane emission should also be included in the sewer management to control the sulfide and methane in sewer systems effectively and economically it is favorable to reduce sulfide and methane production rather than to remove them after their production in fact the production of sulfide and methane in sewer is mainly caused by the metabolism of microorganisms in biofilms attached on the sewer pipe walls specifically under the anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria srb in sewer biofilms use various kinds of organic matters and hydrogen as electron donors and sulfate as electron acceptor to produce sulfide li et al 2018 besides methane can be generated through the anaerobic respiration of methanogenic archaea ma using hydrogen and acetate as common substrates sun et al 2014 therefore suppressing the metabolic activities of microorganisms in sewer biofilms especially these of srb and ma is of vital importance for establishing cost effective sulfide and methane control strategies in sewers to this end antimicrobial agents including metabolic inhibitors and broad spectrum biocides have been under investigation cheung and beech 1996 studied the effect of three different biocides i e formaldehyde glutaraldehyde and isothiozolone on sessile srb they found that activities of srb biofilm were decreased by 74 100 after exposure to these three compounds at 400 mg l for 24 h similarly gardner and stewart 2002 reported that a dose of glutaraldehyde at 500 mg l for 7 h could completely suppress the sulfide production by a mixed culture biofilm molybdate a metabolic inhibitor for srb has also been used to control sulfide production in swine manure municipal solid wastes and anaerobic digesters isa and anderson 2005 zahedi et al 2014 nevertheless the application of these chemicals in sewer systems could have adverse impact on the downstream wwtps and receiving water due to their generic toxicity and low biodegradability recent studies revealed that free nitrous acid fna was able to decrease the number of viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms substantially thus suppressing the sulfide and methane production jiang et al 2011 however to ensure a satisfactory biocidal effect of fna a long exposure time 6 24 h was often required it is therefore desirable to develop a new chemical dosing strategy to inactivate sewer biofilm in a more rapid and safe way ferrate fe vi a high valent tetraoxy iron has recently come to the forefront as a multifunctional water treatment chemical chen et al 2018a 2018b fe vi could be used as oxidant and disinfectant in water and wastewater treatment leaving nontoxic fe iii oxides hydroxides after its application which initiates the process of coagulation sharma et al 2015 in particular fe vi can effectively kill various bacteria and viruses such as escherichia coli sphaerotilus bacillus salmonella and bacteriophage ms2 cho et al 2006 jiang et al 2007 sharma 2007 it has been observed that fe vi could achieve 99 9 kill rates of total coliforms at the dosage of 0 5 12 5 ppm in water sources collected worldwide sharma 2007 in addition a pioneering study on biofilm showed that a ferrate vi concentration of 10 5 m can effectively prevent biofilm growth on a condenser with only 5 min contact time every 12 h fagan and waite 1983 the strong disinfection effect of fe vi suggested the possibility of its use to control the metabolic activities of microorganisms in sewer biofilms within short contact time also as the use of fe vi does not produce any mutagenic carcinogenic by products sharma et al 2015 its application in sewer system could avoid adverse impact on water environment therefore an in depth understanding of the biocidal effect of fe vi on the microorganisms situated in sewer biofilms would have great practical significance for sulfide and methane control in sewer management the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fe vi on sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the effects of fe vi concentrations exposure time dosing modes and ph on the viability of microorganisms in the biofilm were evaluated the differences in abundances of functional genes of viable cells related to sulfide and methane production and microbial community in the biofilm with and without fe vi treatment were also explored by means of propidium monoazide treatment combined with real time polymerase chain reactions pma qpcr and high throughput sequencing respectively in addition direct dosing of fe vi into the sewer reactor was conducted for assessing its effects on sulfide and methane production activities the results of this study are expected to lay a fundamental basis for developing efficient and cost effective sulfide and methane control strategies by applying fe vi 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer reactor setup and operation lab scale sewer reactors namely r1 r2 and r3 made of perspextm were set up in parallel to develop sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms under anaerobic conditions fig s1 supplementary information the reactor has a diameter of 80 mm and a height of 200 mm resulting in an effective volume of 1 l a small reservoir is connected to the top of the reactor to ensure air tightness three strings of plastic carriers of approximately 1 cm in diameter were mounted in the reactors to provide additional surface for biofilm growth and to allow the sampling of intact biofilms the total biofilm area in each reactor including the inner wall inner surface of the lid and the carriers was approximately 0 1 m2 resulting in the area to 100 m2 m3 the reactors were fed with real wastewater collected every three days from a wet well in shanghai china the sewage typically contained sulfide at concentration of 1 2 mg s l sulfate at concentration between 50 and 60 mg s l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 50 100 mg cod l after the collection the wastewater was stored immediately in a freezer at 4 c to minimize the change of water composition it was then heated up to 20 c and fed to the reactors through a peristaltic pump every 6 h during each pumping event 1 l of wastewater was transferred into the reactor over 2 min the wastewater in the reactor was mixed with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm to produce a moderate shear force and avoid solids settling at the bottom batch tests were conducted every two weeks to measure the sulfide and methane production activities of each reactor at the start of the tests fresh wastewater was pumping into reactors for 6 min to ensure a thorough replacement of liquid in the reactors wastewater was sampled at 0 20 40 60 min after the pumping events to analyze sulfide sulfate and dissolved methane concentrations using method described in section 2 7 sulfide and methane production rates spr and mpr were calculated using linear regression of sulfide and methane concentrations the following experiments were commenced when all three reactors reached the pseudo steady state as suggested by the relatively stable spr and mpr 2 2 viability tests on the biocidal effect of fe vi three sets of viability tests i e experiment i iii were carried out to investigate the biocidal effects of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the fe vi concentration exposure time initial ph and dosing mode applied in each test were listed in table 1 in experiment i the effect of fe vi concentration and exposure time on cell viability in biofilms were evaluated the fe vi concentrations applied on the biofilms varied from 0 to 200 mg fe l and the exposure time ranged from 15 to 60 min while the initial ph of the wastewater remained unadjusted at 7 5 the experiment ii explored the effect of ph on the biocidal effect of fe vi in the test the fe vi concentration was kept at 120 mg fe l while the initial ph of the wastewater varied from 5 to 9 the exposure time was kept at 60 min experiment iii was designed to assess that if pulse dosing mode could enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm in this study a high concentration dosing event was split into three low concentration dosing events with the concentration and exposure duration for each event listed in table 1 the tests were carried in the 50 ml tubes filled with filtered 0 22 Œºm wastewater the ph of wastewater was adjusted by hcl 1 m when necessary according to the experimental design table 1 a plastic carrier with attached biofilm was transferred from the biofilm reactor r1 into each tube different volume of stock solution of k2feo4 1 g fe l was added to each tube to achieve the designed fe vi concentrations according to table 1 then the tubes were capped to avoid contacting of air and gently mixed by an orbital shaker at 60 rpm after a certain duration of incubation used in each set of tests as described in table 1 the biofilm on the carriers were sampled for live dead staining using the method illustrated in section 2 4 also pma qpcr and illumina miseq sequencing were performed to evaluate the effect of fe vi on the functional genes for sulfide and methane production as well as microbial community in the sewer biofilm with the method to be further described 2 3 direct fe vi dosing to sewer biofilm reactors fe vi was directly added to the lab scale sewer reactor r2 and the loss of sulfide and methane production activities was monitored after fe vi dosing during subsequent recovery period the fe vi dosing strategy in the reactor fe concentration and exposure time dosing mode was deterimined based on the above viability tests results specifically k2feo4 was immediately dosed into the reactor after a pumping event to reach a fe vi concentration of 60 mg fe l the dosing event was repeated for another two times in every 15 min resulted in a total fe vi dosage of 180 mg fe l the batch tests for determining spr and mpr in the reactor as described in section 2 1 were conducted immediately after the fe vi treatment and in the next 60 days with intervals of two days to two weeks the spr and mpr of r3 without fe vi dosing were also monitored during the same period serving as a control in addition the volatile suspended solids vss in the influent and effluent of the reactors were also monitored to assess the effect of fe vi dosing on integrity of the biofilm structure 2 4 live dead staining the viability of bacterial cells in biofilms was determined using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 the viability kit involves two nucleic acid stains namely green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi the syto 9 could label all cells while pi could only penetrate cells with damaged membrane and resulted in a reduction in the syto 9 stain fluorescence as a result the viable cells are stained green whereas the dead cells are stained red before the staining process the plastic carriers were transferred to filtered 0 22 Œºm wastewater and the biofilms were detached through vigorous vortex mixing vortex 5 kylin bell the staining of cells was conducted based on protocols provided by the manufacturer basically 3 Œºl mixture of syto 9 and pi volume ratio 1 1 was added into 200 Œºl of biofilm suspension and mixed thoroughly the sample was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min then 5 Œºl of the stained biofilm suspension was transferred to a microscope slide and photographed using a fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon corp japan with a halogen lamp 30 w 6 v boulos et al 1999 hu et al 2017 twenty images of randomly chosen areas of the stained biofilm samples were taken for quantification the ratio of live and dead microorganisms was deterimined by the relative abundance of green and red pixels via the image analysis software daime version 1 3 2 5 pma qpcr pma qpcr analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of fe vi on the abundance of functional genes involved in sulfide and methane production in the viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms pma can selectively enter dead cells and inhibit the dna amplification during subsequent qpcr as a result only abundance of genes in living cells will be quantified the biofilm treated by pulse dosing of fe vi at 60 mg fe l for three times as described in section 2 2 and the biofilms without fe vi treatment were examined for this purpose the abundances of key genes in srb and ma i e dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsra and methyl coenzyme m reductase mcra genes were tested in addition the 16s rrna genes of total bacteria and total archaea in living cells were also quantified and compared the primers used for each targeting gene were listed in tables s1 and si the pma qpcr analysis was carried out in the following steps firstly the biofilms were detached from the carries in pbs using the method described in section 2 4 subsequently the samples were centrifuged and resuspended in pbs to allow the vss concentrations of biofilm suspensions in the recommended range for pma cross linking tian et al 2017 the pma treatment of the samples was then carried out based on protocal described by taskin et al 2011 and the details of the protocal were illustrated in si afterwards dna extractions were conducted using tiannamp soil dna kit tiangen beijing china according to the manufacturer s instruction the qpcr was then performed using the steponeplus real time pcr detection system with the reaction condition further described in si each pcr reaction was run in triplicate for quality assurance and statistical analysis purposes 2 6 high throughput sequencing analysis the high throughput sequencing was conducted on the same biofilm sample used for pma qpcr analysis to explore the effect of fe vi dosing on the viable microbial community structure of sewer biofilm the samples were firstly undergone with pma treatment to ensure only viable cells were analyzed then dna was extracted and a pair of universal primes 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 designed to target the variable regions v4 v5 of the microbial 16s rrna gene was applied for pcr amplification walters et al 2016 the sequencing was performed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china on illumina hiseq2500 platform date analysis was implemented on the online i sanger sever http www i sanger com of majorbio bio pharmtechnology co ltd detailed procedures of the analysis were described in si the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database accession number srp186539 2 7 chemical analysis the sulfate concentration was measured by an ion chromatograph with a conductivity dector dionex ics 1000 and the sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method sharma et al 1997 the wastewater samples were firstly filtered 0 22 Œºm membrane before sulfate and sulfide measurement dissolved methane concentration in wastewater was analyzed using gas chromatography equipped with flame ionization detector gc fid shimadzu gc 2010 plus based on the method previously reported by sturm et al 2015 the detection limit of the method is 0 4 Œºg l and the recovery ratio is 93 vfa concentration was measured using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 2010 plus and the vss of the wastewater were measured according to standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid biocidal effect of ferrate on the sewer biofilm the effects of fe vi concentration and exposure time on the microorganisms viability in sewer biofilms were illustrated in fig 1 the results showed that the viable cells in biofilms dropped significantly from 82 to 35 with the increase of fe vi concentration from 0 to 120 mg fe l at all tested fe vi exposure time whereas a further increase of fe vi dosage to 200 mg fe l did not decrease the viability of microorganisms in biofilms anymore more importantly the results showed no significant difference p 0 05 in the percentage of viable cells in the biofilms with the exposure time decreased from 60 min to 15 min at all tested fe vi dosing rates fig 1a this indicated that fe vi could achieve substantial inactivation rate of microorganisms in sewer biofilms with relatively high efficiency i e within 15 min the dependency of the percentage of viable microorganisms in the biofilm on the ferrate concentration under different exposure times could be satisfactorily described using the exponential decay model y y 0 a e b x as shown in fig 1b the estimated parameters with the standard errors were listed in tables s2 and si the high correlation between experimentally measured results and model predicts r2 0 95 in all three cases further confirmed that there was no significant difference in microorganism viabilities under different fe vi exposure times the biocidal effect of fe vi is believed to mainly rely on its oxidation capacity the redox potential of fe vi e0 2 20 v is the highest among the chemicals used for water and wastewater treatment jiang 2014 the strong oxidation capacity of fe vi enables it to pose damaging effect on cell wall protoplasm genome and other vital microorganism organs thus leading to the instantaneous death of the microorganisms talaiekhozani et al 2017 in addition reactive oxygen species of o2 and h2o2 could also be produced during the decomposition of fe vi which could also contribute to the rapid biocidal effect of fe vi hu et al 2012 the high inactivation efficiency of fe vi on microorganisms revealed in this study was in accordance with those observed by other researchers for example jiang et al 2007 found that a fe vi dosage of 8 mg l can achieve 90 100 inactivation efficiency on e coli in model water samples with exposure times between 5 and 30 min also it has been reported that exposure time required to obtain 2 log10 inactivation of bacteriophages f2 and qŒ≤ was only 5 min hu et al 2012 it is worthwhile to note that the minimum exposure time used in this study was 15 min it is also likely that the exposure time less than 15 min could also achieve the same biocidal effect on the sewer biofilms which required further investigation in this study the minimal fe vi dosing amount through a single dosing event to achieving lowest viability of microorganisms in sewer biofilms was 120 mg fe l which was much high than that required for drinking water and wastewater disinfection 10 50 mg fe l jiang et al 2006 talaiekhozani et al 2017 one possible reason is that the abundance of microorganisms in the sewer biofilm was much higher than that in drinking water or treated wastewater it may also attribute to the penetration limitation caused by the biofilm matrix sun et al 2014 the microorganisms in drinking water or freshwater were mostly in suspension so that fe vi can easily get access to them however the microorganisms in sewer biofilms were aggregated within a slimy extracellular matrix which could hamper the chemical penetration therefore a higher dosing rate is required for fe vi to reach the microorganisms located in the inner layer of the biofilms moreover the reactions between fe vi and organic matters in the wastewater are also likely to weaken the biocidal effect of fe vi on sewer biofilm deng et al 2018 fan et al 2018 notably a further increase of fe vi dosing rate to 200 mg l did not significantly reduce the microbial viability in sewer biofilms this is possibly due to that fe vi could be fast self decomposed under high concentration resulted in a similar effective fe vi amount acting on the biofilm lee et al 2014 therefore in order to enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi other approaches rather than simply increasing the fe vi dosing rate should be explored see details in section 3 2 3 2 enhancing the biocidal effect of ferrate through pulse dosing strategy the pulse dosing strategy i e split a single high rate dosing event into three low rate dosing events table 1 was applied to explore if it could enhance the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilms the viability of the microorganisms in sewer biofilms after pulse dosing was compared with that obtained after a single high rate dosing and the results were summarized in fig 2 the results clearly show that the percentage of viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms can be significantly reduced by applying the pulse dosing strategy with different fe vi dosing rates from low to high in particular the viability of the microorganisms decreased from 61 5 with a single dosing of 60 mg fe l to 36 8 with three dosing of 20 mg fe l also the percentage of viable microorganisms reduced from 41 4 to 33 1 when a single dosage of 120 mg fe l was divided into 40 mg fe l for three times dosing when applying a dosage of 60 mg fe l for three times 180 mg fe l in total on the biofilm the overall viability of the microorganisms could further reduced to 17 6 which is only about half of that achieved with a single dosage of 200 mg fe l the results above suggested that the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm could be reinforced by applying pulse dosing strategy during the fe vi treatment its self decomposition is recognized as an unfavorable factor to its treatment effectiveness it has been reported that the self decomposition rate of fe vi followed the second order kinetics with respect to fe vi concentration lee et al 2014 sarma et al 2012 this suggested that fe vi will be decomposed more rapidly with a higher initial concentration therefore if the pulse dosing of fe vi with a low concentration was applied the fast self decomposition of fe vi under high concentration conditions could be avoid based on the second order kinetics it could be estimated that the maximum lasting duration of fe vi in the system could be increased about 3 time if a high rate dosing event being divided into three low rate dosing event with a potential longer lasting duration the actual fe vi loadings taking effect on the biofilm may be increased as a result the biocidal effect of fe vi could be enhanced in addition as fe vi has been found to change the extracellular polymeric substances eps components in sewage sludge zhang et al 2016 it may also be able to react with the eps of sewer biofilm and resulted in a loose structure after the first or second dosing event therefore the penetration depth of fe vi into the biofilm could increase during the following treatment and its biocidal effect was consequently improved the highest inactivation rate achieved by fe vi dosing revealed in this study viability of 17 6 was slightly lower than that achieved by fna dosing viability 15 as reported by jiang et al 2011 however it should be noted that the optimization of the pulse dosing strategy was not included in this study it is quite possible that the viability of the microorganisms in biofilms could further decreased after optimizing the fe vi dosing rate and frequency which is worthy to be investigated in future 3 3 the effect of ph on the biocidal effect of fe vi the viability of the microorganisms in biofilms treated with fe vi 120 mg fe l for 60 min at different initial ph was evaluated with the results presented in fig 3 overall the ph of the wastewater did not significantly affect the viability of the microorganisms at the tested range the drop of ph from 9 to 6 slightly decreased the percentage of the viable microorganisms in sewer biofilms while a more notable decrease from 36 3 to 28 0 was observed when the ph is changing from 6 to 5 it has been reported that the effectiveness of fe vi treatment under acidic conditions is much better than that under basic conditions shin et al 2018 however in this study we did not observe of significant enhancement in biocidal effect of fe vi on sewer biofilm when the ph changing from 9 to 5 this is probably due to the increase of ph of wastewater to basic range after fe vi dosing fig s2 actually the effectiveness of fe vi treatment was also related to the proportion of different fe vi species in the water fe vi can be disassociated into different species feo4 2 hfeo4 and h2feo4 according to the ph and the protonated forms of fe vi hfeo4 and h2feo4 were found to be more reactive than feo4 2 cho et al 2006 the fraction of different fe vi species in the experiments in this section was calculated based on the ph profiles and its disassociation constants pka1 3 50 and pka2 7 23 the results show that the average proportion of hfeo4 was changed in a narrow range between 0 4 and 5 fig 3 resulted in the unobvious enhancement in the biocidal effect of fe vi in fact in most cases the inactivation of microorganisms by protonated fe vi was achieved under buffered condition phosphate buffer cho et al 2006 hu et al 2012 however to maintain the ph of wastewater with phosphate buffer would induce great amount of phosphate into the sewer system it may consequently increase the burden of phosphorus removal on the downstream wwtps as phosphorus is an essential nutrient for organisms without proper treatment its discharged could cause eutrophication in receiving water jiang and yuan 2015 since fe vi could already pose considerable biocidal effect on the sewer biofilm under natural ph through pulse dosing strategy to enhance its biocidal effect by adjusting the ph of wastewater is unnecessary 3 4 fe vi reduces the abundances of functional genes responsible for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis the abundances of bacterial 16s rrna archaeal 16s rrna dsra and mcra genes in the viable cells in sewer biofilms with and without fe vi treatment 60 mg fe l three times dosing were compared in fig 4 the bacterial 16s rrna and archaeal 16s rrna genes decreased by 74 4 and 84 2 respectively indicating that archaea are more vulnerable to fe vi treatment than bacteria overall the decreases of total viable bacteria and archaea in the sewer biofilms revealed by pma qpcr analysis were in good agreement with that suggested by live dead staining fig 2 which further confirmed the strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm the abundances of dsra and mcra genes were also decreased significantly after fe vi treatment as shown in fig 4 the abundance of dsra in the viable microorganism with fe vi treatment was only 15 8 of that without fe vi treatment and the abundance of mcra remained only 13 4 after fe vi exposure the dsra gene encodes the dissimilatory sulfate reductase which catalyses the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate to sulfite during sulfidogenic processes ben dov et al 2007 similarly mcra is a key gene responsible for methanogenesis it encodes the terminal enzyme complex in the methane generation pathway i e methyl coenzyme m reductase which catalyses the reduction of a methyl group bound to coenzyme m with the concomitant release of methane luton et al 2002 the decreases of dsra and mcra abundances in sewer biofilms indicated its sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities were strongly inhibited by fe vi dosing 3 5 relative abundances of viable srb and ma decreasing after fe vi exposure the microbial communities with viable cells in the sewer biofilms with and without fe vi treatment 60 mg fe l three times dosing were evaluated through illumina miseq sequencing and compared in figs s3 and si with their alpha diversity indices listed in tables s3 and si the relative abundances of viable srb and ma in sewer biofilms were explored in detail and compared in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a the srb in sewer biofilms were mainly affiliated within seven genera desulforhabdus desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacterium desulfobulbus desulfomonile desulfomicrobium with desulforhabdus 1 7 being predominant in the untreated biofilm after fe vi treatment the abundances of five srb genera desulforhabdus desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacterium desulfomicrobium were decreased while the relative abundances of desulfobulbus and desulfomonile increased slightly however the relative abundances of total srb were still decreased by 63 as presented in fig 6 b which indicated that srb in the biofilms were more sensitive to fe vi treatment than other microorganisms this is probably due to that srb are located in the out layer of the sewer biofilm sun et al 2014 where the fe vi concentration was higher than that in the inner layer similarly the relative abundance of ma was significantly decreased by 90 after fe vi treatment fig 5b specifically the proportions of three ma genera found in the tested biofilm i e methanobacterium methanosaeta and methano methylovorans were all dropped with the methanobacterium became almost negligible after fe vi dosing fig 5a ma usually showed a lower tolerance than bacteria to many chemicals such as oxygen sulfide and long chain fatty acids due to their special compositions of cell membrane dong et al 2019 this is also true in the case of fe vi as suggested by the results of this study the decreases of relative abundances of srb and ma in the sewer biofilm were consistent with that revealed by pma qpcr as numbers of dsra and mcra genes decreased more substantially than total bacterial 16s rrna gene these results indicated that fe vi posed strong biocidal effect on srb and ma in sewer biofilms the complete suppression of sulfate reduction and methane production in sewer biofilms could be achieved even when not all microorganisms were inactivated 3 6 suppression of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities after fe vi dosage to sewer reactors the sulfide and methane production rates in the fe vi dosed sewer reactor r2 relative to the control reactor r3 were shown in fig 6a the sulfide and methane production were completely suppressed after fe vi dosage commerced on day 0 afterwards the spr and mpr were slowly recovered without significant lag phase the recovery phase could be well described by the gompertz growth model huang 2003 suggested that the recovery process was similar to microbial regrowth according to the model prediction the time required for 50 recovery rt50 of spr was 10 1 days while the rt50 of mpr would took much longer 44 5 days the rt50 of spr and mpr after fe vi dosage were comparable to that after fna dosage as reported by jiang et al 2011 despite that the viability of the biofilm after fe vi treatment observed in this study was slightly higher one possible reason is that fe vi dosing may destroy the eps produced by the microorganisms situated in the sewer biofilm and consequently result in a loose biofilm structure wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 fe vi dosing could cause significant biofilm detachment in the reactor as suggested by a substantial increase in the vss concentration of the effluent after fe vi dosage fig 6b therefore the viable microorganisms attached on the sewer reactor became less and the recovery period was prolonged 3 7 practical implication this study for the first time demonstrated the rapid and strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilms the inactivation of microorganisms in the sewer biofilm could be accomplished within 15 min for every single dosing by innovatively applying the pulse dosing strategy the biocidal effect could be significantly enhanced and satisfactory inactivation efficiency could be realized the detailed investigation into srb and ma revealed decreases in both functional genes copies and relative abundances after fe vi exposure this indicated that srb and ma might be more vulnerable to fe vi exposure than other microorganisms in sewer biofilms all these results indicated that fe vi has a promising perspective in controlling sulfide and methane in sewer systems and thus a new method for sulfide and methane control using fe vi can be proposed the traditional chemical strategies for sulfide control in sewer mainly rely on the oxidation precipitation and reducing gas liquid transfer of sulfide already generated and constant dosing is required ganigue et al 2011 the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm can result in a long recovery period for sulfide and methane production which makes intermittent dosing of fe vi possible consequently the chemical dosing amount could be largely reduced besides as the wastewater in sewers is usually flowing continous dosing is needed to ensure the exposure time long enough for the inactivation process the short exposure time required for fe vi treatment suggested that chemcial usage for each dosing event is low which further guarantees the low chemcial consumption and also improves the ease of operation there are many other potential advantages regarding the fe vi dosing the reduction of fe vi would produce nontoxic fe iii hydroxides which could precipitate sulfide in sewers at the downstream location zhang et al 2009 adding iron salts in sewers could also be beneficial to phosphorus removal at the downstream wwtp where iron sulfide precipitates are oxidised in aeration tanks regenerating iron phosphate precipitates gutierrez et al 2010 a more recent study also demonstrated iron salts dosed in sewers could decrease sulfide generation in sludge digestions and promote the dewatering performance of anaerobic digested sludge rebosura et al 2018 during the practical application of fe vi its relatively high price used to be a concern however based on the intermittent dosing strategy and short exposure time the total cost for the chemical is expected to be low we estimated the chemical cost of fe vi dosing to achieve 80 sulfide control is 0 02 m3 or 1 6 kg s based on the results in section 3 5 total fe vi dosage of 180 mg fe l with an exposure time of 45 min and a dosing interval of 4 5 days for achieving sulfide control efficiency of 80 it is much lower than the chemcial costs of many other chemical dosing methods such as using ferric ferrous and nitrate tables s4 and si also studies have suggested that fe vi could be generate in situ through wet chemical method by the reactions of fe iii oxides or their salts with hypochlorite ocl in highly alkaline solution waite 2012 alternatively it could be produced through electrochemical synthesis with the use of iron electrodes jiang et al 2015b nikoliƒá bujanoviƒá et al 2016 by applying these methods the costs for the chemcial consumption might be further reduced the effects of fe vi dosing on the wastewater characteristics such as the cod decrease and ph elevation were not included in this study which should be fully evaluated in the future however it should be noted that fe vi would not be added to the entire sewer network at the same time by adding fe vi to different sections of a network at different times the impacts on wastewater characteristics at the downstream wwtps could be alleviated and the ph would be neutralized therefore further optimization of the fe vi dosing strategy at the network scale should be carried out to achieve effective sulfide and methane control in sewer with the minimal chemical consumption rate and avoiding potential adverse impact on downstream wwtps overall the intermittent dosing of fe vi with pulse dosing strategy can be a cost effective strategy for sewer corrosion odour and greenhouse gas control which bears great application potential in the sewer management 4 conclusions this study evaluated the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sulfidogenic and methanogenic sewer biofilm and the following conclusions can be drawn fe vi has a rapid biocidal effect on the microorganisms in the sewer biofilm with the inactivation process achieved within 15 min through a single dosing the biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm could be enhanced through pulse dosing strategy and is not affected by the ph of the wastewater fe vi significantly decreased the functional genes responsible for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis and also reduced the relative abundances of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the rapid and strong biocidal effect of fe vi on the sewer biofilm suggested that it could be intermittently added for controlling sulfide and methane production in sewers which is a cost effective strategy for sewer corrosion odour and greenhouse gas control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18327,bacterial contamination of drinking water is a considerable concern for public health tryptophan like fluorescence tlf has been widely suggested to enable fast and inexpensive monitoring and quantification of bacterial contamination of water typically tlf is determined at a certain excitation ex emission em wavelengths pair the aim of this study was to assess fluorescence spectroscopy supported with partial least squares pls algorithms as a tool for a rapid evaluation of the microbial quality of water by comparing the use of a single ex em wavelengths pair of the spectrum of emission obtained at a single excitation wavelength to that of whole excitation emission matrices eems for that laboratory grown escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied as the model systems as well as 90 groundwater samples from 6 different wells in israel the groundwater samples were characterized for fluorescence emission coliforms fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and heterotrophic plate counts the pls analysis of emission spectra and especially of eems was capable of meaningfully reducing the detection limit of microorganisms in model systems as compared with the single ex em wavelengths pair based determination commonly used reaching a detection threshold as low as 10 cfu ml use of pls analyzed eems becomes beneficial also in terms of correlation and similarity between the actual and predicted bacterial concentrations similarly improved detection of bacteria was also achieved in groundwater samples furthermore at a level of 104 cfu

limit 1 introduction bacterial contamination of drinking water caused approximately 40 000 hospitalizations yearly in the united states with costs estimated at 1 b collier et al 2012 bacteria can reach the drinking water system from source contamination or via defective pipelines the main challenge in the prevention of waterborne pathogens from reaching consumers is improving pollution detection ashbolt 2015 baker et al 2015 this challenge is intensified as contamination events are sporadic and transient and can occur at any point along the supply chain cabral 2010 frolich et al 2017 obtaining rapid and affordable estimates of the microbial quality of drinking water is a widely discussed problem aw and rose 2012 heibati et al 2017 ram√≠rez castillo et al 2015 microbial indicators such as escherichia coli coliforms and fecal coliforms are used as proxies for the presence of human pathogens while heterotrophic bacterial counts hpc provide estimates for bacterial load in water allen et al 2004 edberg et al 2000 the standard testing methods are labor intensive may produce false positive results have low sensitivity and viable microorganisms may not be culturable ram√≠rez castillo et al 2015 deshmukh et al 2016 since the standard methods used to detect bacterial contamination of drinking water demand long incubation times during that time water flows through the system and hence contaminations can only be detected long after the water had reached consumers and likely contaminated the water distribution system therefore there is a need for a simple on line and accurate tool for detection and quantification of bacteria in drinking water fluorescence spectroscopy has been used for decades to characterize organic matter in various water sources and specifically water fluorescence was linked to water quality indicators such as biochemical and chemical oxygen demands hudson et al 2008 cohen et al 2014 wang et al 2017 goffin et al 2019 microorganisms contain intrinsic fluorescent components such as amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and oxidized flavins

microbial and sewage contamination of natural and freshwater including riverine and groundwater sources tedetti et al 2013 baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015a b sorensen et al 2018a b multiple studies have focused on the presence of e coli in water samples which signifies a major contamination event although the measured tlf signal contributed by e coli in many cases is likely to represent the occurrence of other microorganisms bridgeman et al 2015 risk assessment by tlf measurements showed some disagreements with that based on e coli enumeration however the tlf interpretation challenges were considered minimal in low organic c groundwater samples nowicki et al 2019 typically tlf is related to the bacterial concentration by using fluorescence intensity measured at a single excitation ex emission em wavelengths pair e g at 280 ex 350 em nm baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 280 ex 360 em nm cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a or 280 ex 365 em sorensen et al 2018b alternatively instead of focusing on one or several specific ex em wavelength pairs the entire eem may be analyzed using certain algorithms such as parallel factor parafac analysis principal component analysis self organizing maps partial least squares pls artificial neural networks and others e g giana et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 carstea et al 2010 bieroza et al 2011 faassen and hitzmann 2015 heibati et al 2017 fox et al 2017 demonstrated the production of various non tryptophan like fluorescent organic matter by growing escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in non fluorescent media by examining emission at certain excitation emission wavelengths peak picking within eems although microbially driven production of fluorescent organic matter was related to metabolic activity rather than to bacterial numbers per se fox et al 2017 yet this study prompts that simultaneous use of signals recorded in the broad ranges of excitation emission wavelengths not limited by typical tlf may be useful for detection of microbial contamination such an approach would presume using chemometric techniques to the best of our knowledge no study so far has compared peak picking measurements at selected ex em wavelength pairs with the use of an emission spectrum and the whole eem of water samples for the quantification of bacteria therefore the aim of this study was to assess fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for a rapid evaluation of the microbial quality of water by comparing the use of a single ex em wavelengths pair of the spectrum of emission obtained at a single excitation wavelength and of the eems analyzed with the pls algorithm the study was conducted both in a laboratory model system using pure cultures of bacteria and with natural groundwater samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and sample preparation for fluorescence measurements the bacterial strains used in this study included two gram negative bacteria escherichia coli dh5Œ± and pseudomonas aeruginosa pa14 and one gram positive bacterium bacillus subtilis ncib 3610 which are common environmental microorganisms costa et al 2015 fox et al 2017 bacterial cultures were stored in 20 glycerol stocks at 20 c for each experiment frozen bacteria were spread on luria bertani lb agar medium difco sparks md usa and incubated overnight at 37 c individual colonies were used to inoculate 15 ml of lb broth difco and incubated with shaking 150 rpm overnight at 37 c for fluorescence measurements freshly prepared bacterial cultures were washed by centrifugation at 4990g for 10 min heraeus primo r thermo scientific waltham ma usa and resuspension of the bacterial pellet in 15 ml of distilled hplc grade water biolab jerusalem israel the washing step was repeated 3 times and the final pellet was re suspended in distilled hplc grade water to a final concentration of ca 5 108 colony forming units cfu per ml serial 10 fold dilutions of each bacterial suspension were taken for fluorescence measurements the actual number of cfus in each sample was determined by plating 10 fold serial dilutions on lb agar plate following overnight incubation at 37 c 2 2 groundwater sampling groundwater was sampled in 6 drinking water wells between july 2017 and june 2018 the list of groundwater wells the frequency of sampling and the number of the samples collected are listed in table s1 supplementary information water samples 250 ml were collected from active wells by standard method into cleaned dark glass bottles and transported within 2 4 h under refrigeration 4 8 c to the agricultural research organization aro laboratory the samples were stored for 12 48 h at 4 c until analyzed altogether 90 groundwater samples were collected groundwater ph measured in the lab using a ph meter si analytics weilheim germany was in the 6 9 8 7 range the sampled water was also characterized for the presence of coliforms fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and hpc in an accredited microbiological laboratory mekorot central laboratory eshkol site hevel hayarden israel according to standard methods of the american public health association eaton et al 2005 2 3 fluorescence measurements fluorescence spectra of water samples were measured at 22 2 c with an rf 5301pc spectrofluorometer shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with 150 w xenon lamp ushio inc tokyo japan as described by borisover et al 2009 the cuvette used was the standard quartz cell hellma m√ºllheim germany having a path length of 10 mm and chamber volume of 3 5 ml excitation emission matrices eems of fluorescence were obtained by collecting emission spectra between 220 and 450 nm at 2 nm increments with excitation wavelengths ranging from 210 to 400 nm at 5 nm increments the excitation and emission optical slits were set to 10 nm and scanning time per eem was about 2 5 min intensity of the raman scattering peak of pure water at excitation wavelength at 275 nm and emission wavelength at 305 nm was determined in every measurement series water samples were scanned in duplicate using two separate water volumes for calibrating tryptophan emission signal 1 g of l tryptophan powder cas number 73 22 3 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa was dissolved into 100 ml of non fluorescent pure water merck darmstadt germany at 80 c using an electric stirrer and a hot plate freed electric haifa israel the tryptophan stock solution was serially diluted to prepare a series of concentrations in the 1 10 ppb range for all fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair 275 and 362 nm were used respectively this ex em wavelengths pair approximately represented maxima in the groundwater samples studied and is also in agreement with similar maxima locations used in the literature for tlf baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b no inner filter effect corrections were introduced during collecting the fluorescence data of samples the consideration was that in multiple real life scenarios performing this correction needs absorbance measurements in a range of wavelengths and may not be practical and easy therefore there was an interest in probing the potential of pls analysis of the data as is 2 4 data pre processing for each sample studied the emission data obtained with the excitation wavelength exceeding the emission wavelength were removed prior to the data analysis the emission intensities were normalized by the raman scattering intensity of water since eems are inherently 3 dimensional and the pls analysis is based on a 2 dimensional model there was a need to transform the eems data into two dimensional matrices this transformation was made by assigning excitation emission wavelengths pair as one coordinate using microsoft excel 2013 microsoft richmond usa further data pre processing involved centering and scaling geladi and kowalski 1986 using jmp software version 13 pro sas institute inc cary us each analyzed group of water samples was partitioned randomly into training and validation subsets in a ratio of 6 to 4 respectively 2 5 partial least squares pls analysis and statistical tests partial least squares pls method was used with its nipals nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm to both quantify and classify bacteria the jmp software was used for pls and other statistical tests classification was done using a pls discriminant analysis pls da option each pls model consists of several latent variables lv the number of lvs represents the complexity of the model the number of lvs of a good model was recommended to be minimal and with a proper dataset between 3 10 geladi and kowalski 1986 there were no general linear relations between measured fluorescence intensities and bacterial concentrations due to broad ranges of the bacterial concentrations examined and the lack of inner filter corrections therefore the pls model was allowed to deal with emission intensity by applying log bacterial concentrations thus reducing statistical weights of high concentrations and large emissions the models were characterized by coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse which measures the model s error in the units of measurements statistical significance of the differences was analyzed with wilcoxon rank sum test also known as the mann whitney test and if variances were equal also by using the tukey kramer test in order to test whether the variance of two groups is equal levene s test was applied soave and sun 2017 throughout the study statistical significance was required to be p 0 01 the cohen s kappa coefficient k measuring non random agreement between different raters prediction methods agresti 2007 was also calculated using jmp the cohen s kappa coefficient varies between zero indicating that the correct prediction if occurred is just by chance and 1 evidencing for non random correct prediction detection threshold was defined as difference between a measurement in a given sample and the analyzed value in a sample with microbial concentration 10 cfu ml this difference was considered significant by applying p 0 01 and using wilcoxon ranked sum test or tukey kramer test when applicable 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of laboratory grown bacteria with fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair the tryptophan like fluorescence at ex em wavelengths of 275 and 362 nm respectively of e coli b subtilis and p aeruginosa is shown in fig 1 as box plot against bacterial concentration according to the levene s test soave and sun 2017 the variances in fluorescence intensity were not equal at different concentrations of bacteria therefore to test the differences in fluorescence intensity between different bacterial concentrations when variances are not equal a wilcoxon non parametric test was applied leech and onwuegbuzie 2002 sorensen et al 2018b the fluorescence differences became statistically significant only at bacterial concentrations of 103 105 cfu ml depending on the bacterial species which corresponded roughly to emission intensity of 0 2 r u fig 1 this fluorescence threshold was converted to the concentration of tryptophan producing the same level of emission for that a linear relation between the raman normalized intensity of tryptophan fluorescence emission upon excitation at 375 nm and emission at 362 nm and tryptophan concentration in ppb was obtained in the following form emission intensity 0 127 0 038 tryptophan concentration r2 0 85 p 0 0001 it appeared that when using fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair microbial species became detectable when the emission intensity was equal to that measured in a solution containing about 2 ppb of tryptophan this estimate seems to be in agreement with earlier studies baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b sorensen et al 2015a b in which the minimal detectable microbial concentration was found equivalent to the 1 5 ppb concentrations of free tryptophan 3 2 quantification of laboratory grown bacteria with pls analyzed emission spectra and eems quantification of e coli by fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair as described above was further compared with the pls supported use of i the emission spectra recorded in the 220 450 nm wavelength interval upon excitation at 275 nm and ii the eems obtained in the excitation and emission wavelength ranges as such as 210 400 and 220 450 nm respectively in the first analysis i the 275 nm excitation wavelength was selected to include tlf vivian and callis 2001 yang et al 2015 baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b consistently with our earlier selection of the ex em wavelengths coordinates for peak picking the range of excitation wavelengths in the eem analysis ii as well as the emission wavelength ranges in both cases i and ii were taken to significantly explore wavelength distributions of recorded signals associated with cultured bacteria in model systems additional support for using broad wavelength ranges may be provided by the work of fox et al 2017 in which non tlf was demonstrated to appear in pure cultures of escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa therefore also in the model systems studied in this work a non tlf if appears should be associated with presence of microorganisms and might contribute to their better quantification this comparison was performed by obtaining a prediction model with a training sample set 60 of the data or 84 samples and applying it to the validation sample set 40 of the data or 53 samples therefore first the emission intensities at the single ex em wavelengths pair were linearly regressed on the training dataset of log e coli concentrations involving 84 samples of bacterial solutions the obtained regression equation was used to predict bacterial concentrations from emission intensities in the validation set the linear regression of the predicted log e coli concentrations against actual log concentrations is shown in fig 2 a second pls algorithm was applied to both the emission spectra obtained upon excitation at 275 nm of the e coli suspension and to their eems of fluorescence the linear regressions of the predicted log bacterial concentrations obtained by means of emission spectra and the eems on the actual log bacterial concentrations are provided in fig 2c and e respectively when the prediction was made using the pls analyzed emission spectra the regression of the predicted log concentrations on the actual log concentrations was characterized by dramatically improved r2 0 587 as compared with the regression based on the values predicted using peak picking at a single ex em wavelengths pair r2 0 089 respectively the regression slope raised from 0 09 the peak picking method to 0 75 the pls analyzed emission spectra even better improvement of the regression of the predicted log concentrations on the actual log concentrations was reached when pls was applied to the entire eems r2 became 0 73 and the slope was 0 93 fig 2e the box plots in the right column of fig 2 examine the threshold values of three approaches for bacterial quantification based on the tukey kramer test presuming equal variances the thresholds cfu ml were as following 105 103 and 10 for using peak picking pls analyzed emission spectra and eems respectively in the same sequence using a wilcoxon non parametric test allowing comparison at non equal variances the thresholds were 105 104 and 10 cfu ml thus the pls guided use of emission spectra and in particular of eems as compared with a single ex em wavelengths pair increased the sensitivity of e coli detection by about one and four orders of magnitude respectively similar analyses were performed separately for b subtilis and p aeruginosa suspended in water table 1 summarizes for each bacterium and fluorescence measurement analysis type the slope rmse and r2 values computed for regressions of predicted log bacterial concentrations on the log actual concentration values in validation sets in addition table 1 provides the detection thresholds based on the wilcoxon and tukey kramer tests it is clear from table 1 that for all bacterial species r2 and the slopes were increased when the pls analysis was applied to emission spectra or eems as compared with the peak picking method in addition generally the pls analysis of eems led to the rise of r2 values and the slopes as compared with the pls analysis of emission spectra except non affected slopes for b subtilis finally in the validation datasets the pls analysis of the eems reduced significantly by orders of magnitude the detection limits of all bacterial species as compared with peak picking table 1 this improvement was highly significant for e coli and p aeruginosa and less yet distinct for b subtilis when emission spectra were pls analyzed the less improvement of the detection limit was reached as compared with peak picking for e coli and p aeruginosa overall decrease of detection limits when using the pls analysis as compared with peak picking might be understood by considering that fluorescence measurements covering ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths contain more quantitative information on fluorophores than those at a single ex em wavelengths pair hence the pls analysis of multiple signals might reduce the interfering effect of noise thus improving detection capability it is also clear from table 1 that the extent of detection limit improvement achieved by using the pls analysis as compared with peak picking varies depending on bacterial species which most probably reflects differences in the contents of proteinaceous matter its specific composition and structure it may be argued that even the best detection limits achieved in the model systems table 1 may not be sufficient to quantify the required presence of specific bacteria in water however the appearance of total coliforms e coli in water is expected to correlate with contamination events of drinking sources e g associated with penetration of sewage treated effluents or faecal bacteria cumberland et al 2012 baker et al 2015 therefore improving the detection limits associated with the development of the whole bacterial background may contribute also to an earlier signaling of possible contamination of water sources by specific bacterial pathogens furthermore hpc are widely used to assess water treatment and monitor changes of bacterial populations in the water system allen et al 2004 particularly where no coliforms are present as it follows from the above examination of the model bacterial systems and table 1 the pls analysis of emission spectra and eems may be helpful in reaching the goal to enhance the detection capabilities presence of other fluorophores e g belonging to humic like substances not related to bacterial matter may obviously interfere with fluorescence based analysis of microbial contamination of real water samples therefore the approach using fluorescence is foremost recommended for pre screening monitoring and risk communication in water samples with low contents of natural organic matter such as groundwater nowicki et al 2019 in addition selecting the appropriate narrowed ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths in the eems and emission spectra may help to reach a compromise between i better focusing on optical signals associated with microbial contamination and ii using still sufficiently large datasets allowing to explore the opportunities of chemometric analyses and the pls specifically for improving detection capabilities 3 3 differentiation between bacterial species using pls analysis of eems in order to examine the ability of pls analysis of eems to differentiate between bacterial species in water the eems of bacterial suspensions with 104 cfu ml of each species were combined in one dataset a pls da model was calculated in an attempt to classify these samples correctly with the same training validation ratio of 6 4 confusion matrix in table 2 demonstrates that the pls da model was capable of distinguishing between the different bacterial species the values shown in a row in table 2 indicate the number of samples of a certain species assigned correctly or erroneously to each of three bacteria studied such that the total number of the samples containing this species is summarized in the last column respectively the last line in table 2 presents the total number of sample assignments to a given bacterium so of eleven b subtilis samples seven were identified correctly whereas four were assigned as p aeruginosa all the e coli and p aeruginosa samples 11 and 18 respectively were correctly identified so altogether 36 samples of different bacteria of 40 were properly identified indicating an overall prediction accuracy of 90 the cohen s kappa coefficient k of 0 84 indicates that a significant non random classification of bacterial samples was possible with the pls analysis of eems 3 4 fluorescence based detection of heterotrophic bacteria in groundwater at a single ex em wavelengths pair of 90 groundwater samples studied table s1 supplementary information only one sample contained 1000 cfu ml of hpc and that sample also harbored 3 cfu 100 ml of fecal coliforms in fig 3 a fluorescence emission intensities determined in groundwater from all sampling locations and events were plotted against the bacterial concentration fig 3b shows the data only for the samples with bacteria concentration 500 cfu ml it is seen in fig 3a that all but four of the groundwater samples contained less than 300 cfu ml of hpc and fluorescence intensities below 0 45 r u a comparable emission intensity of 0 2 r u determined in suspensions of laboratory grown bacteria was related to much higher bacterial concentrations i e 103 106 cfu ml fig 1 this contrast between laboratory grown bacteria and those present in groundwater suggests that natural water contains other microorganisms that are not necessarily detected by the hpc method these may comprise bacteria with specific nutritional requirements that cannot grow on the medium used to determine hpc as well as viable but not culturable vbnc bacteria fungi parasites and viruses ashbolt 2015 in general the presence of various types of microorganisms results in multiple contributions to the overall fluorescence bridgeman et al 2015 fox et al 2017 such that these contributions may also be species dependent this makes the models developed on bacterial monocultures hardly applicable for straightforward predicting bacteria specific concentrations in real water samples from fluorescence measurements in addition the variability of emission intensity for a given level of bacterial concentrations in groundwater up to 0 42 r u fig 3b exceeds the variability observed for lab grown bacteria fig 1 which reflects most probably variable composition of bacterial communities in groundwater samples depending on a specific well and sampling date this variable composition of groundwater samples increases the threshold of detections in groundwater as compared with that of individual lab grown bacteria fig 4 illustrates how fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair distinguish different levels i e 90 90 500 500 cfu ml of bacterial concentration in groundwater samples indeed the ability of fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair to distinguish groundwater samples with bacteria concentrations 500 cfu ml from samples containing 90 cfu ml hpc was reached at a higher emission intensity level 0 5 0 6 r u fig 4 as compared with the threshold observed with lab grown bacteria 0 2 r u fig 1 3 5 detection of heterotrophic bacteria in groundwater using pls analyzed emission spectra obtained upon excitation at 275 nm and full eems in further analysis emission spectra collected upon excitation at 275 nm and the whole eems of groundwater samples were modeled by means of pls since two samples obtained from the shimron 7 well were characterized by relatively high hpc values i e 770 and 2900 cfu ml and have shown significant differences in fluorescence as compared with others these samples were removed from the analysis and the remaining 88 samples were analyzed fig 5 shows how pls analyzed emission spectra and eems distinguish the groups of groundwater samples differing by hpc as compared with fluorescence measurements at the single ex em wavelengths pair in this comparison one group of the samples was characterized by bacterial concentrations less than 90 cfu ml and in the second group the hpc values exceeded 90 cfu ml it was not possible to further divide the water samples of the latter group into additional subgroups as done in fig 4 due to the relatively small number of samples available for the pls analysis neither measurements at the single ex em wavelengths pair nor the pls analysis of emission spectra were able to distinguish the water samples having less or more than 90 cfu ml hpc fig 5 whereas the pls analysis of the whole eems could do that in agreement with the demonstrated ability of the pls eems analysis to decrease the detection limit of lab grown bacteria fig 2 table 1 the data shown in fig 5 propose improvement of bacterial detection in high quality groundwater when fluorescence measurements are combined with the pls based modeling however it is worth mentioning that weighting effects of sample sites associated with different bacterial communities in the examined samples may affect predictability which should be taken into account by testing a larger number of wells samples from various water sources 4 conclusions the use of a pls predictive model based on the emission spectrum upon excitation by a single wavelength as compared with use of a single ex em wavelengths pair improves predictions of bacterial concentrations better and distinct improvements in predictions are reached when the whole eems were used instead of a single ex em wavelengths pair a pls based analysis of the emission spectra and in particular of eems as compared with a single ex em wavelengths pair can significantly reduce the detection thresholds of the tested bacterial species by orders of magnitude both the extents of prediction improvements and the reduction in the detection limits when using pls analyzed fluorescence data are species dependent the pls analysis of eems enables differentiating between e coli b subtilis and p aeruginosa present in pure water at concentrations exceeding 104 cfu ml improvement of bacterial detection is also observed in high quality groundwater when the fluorescence measurements are combined with pls treatment however variable bacterial compositions of groundwater samples may increase the apparent detection limit of bacteria as compared with that of individual laboratory grown bacteria utilizing large sets of excitation emission wavelengths combinations seems to be beneficial in order to enhance bacterial detection sensitivity this could be consequential especially in cases of high water quality and low bacterial concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18327,bacterial contamination of drinking water is a considerable concern for public health tryptophan like fluorescence tlf has been widely suggested to enable fast and inexpensive monitoring and quantification of bacterial contamination of water typically tlf is determined at a certain excitation ex emission em wavelengths pair the aim of this study was to assess fluorescence spectroscopy supported with partial least squares pls algorithms as a tool for a rapid evaluation of the microbial quality of water by comparing the use of a single ex em wavelengths pair of the spectrum of emission obtained at a single excitation wavelength to that of whole excitation emission matrices eems for that laboratory grown escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied as the model systems as well as 90 groundwater samples from 6 different wells in israel the groundwater samples were characterized for fluorescence emission coliforms fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and heterotrophic plate counts the pls analysis of emission spectra and especially of eems was capable of meaningfully reducing the detection limit of microorganisms in model systems as compared with the single ex em wavelengths pair based determination commonly used reaching a detection threshold as low as 10 cfu ml use of pls analyzed eems becomes beneficial also in terms of correlation and similarity between the actual and predicted bacterial concentrations similarly improved detection of bacteria was also achieved in groundwater samples furthermore at a level of 104 cfu ml use of eems coupled with pls enabled discrimination between e coli b subtilis and p aeruginosa graphical abstract image 1 keywords e coli bacterial contamination drinking water eem pls detection limit 1 introduction bacterial contamination of drinking water caused approximately 40 000 hospitalizations yearly in the united states with costs estimated at 1 b collier et al 2012 bacteria can reach the drinking water system from source contamination or via defective pipelines the main challenge in the prevention of waterborne pathogens from reaching consumers is improving pollution detection ashbolt 2015 baker et al 2015 this challenge is intensified as contamination events are sporadic and transient and can occur at any point along the supply chain cabral 2010 frolich et al 2017 obtaining rapid and affordable estimates of the microbial quality of drinking water is a widely discussed problem aw and rose 2012 heibati et al 2017 ram√≠rez castillo et al 2015 microbial indicators such as escherichia coli coliforms and fecal coliforms are used as proxies for the presence of human pathogens while heterotrophic bacterial counts hpc provide estimates for bacterial load in water allen et al 2004 edberg et al 2000 the standard testing methods are labor intensive may produce false positive results have low sensitivity and viable microorganisms may not be culturable ram√≠rez castillo et al 2015 deshmukh et al 2016 since the standard methods used to detect bacterial contamination of drinking water demand long incubation times during that time water flows through the system and hence contaminations can only be detected long after the water had reached consumers and likely contaminated the water distribution system therefore there is a need for a simple on line and accurate tool for detection and quantification of bacteria in drinking water fluorescence spectroscopy has been used for decades to characterize organic matter in various water sources and specifically water fluorescence was linked to water quality indicators such as biochemical and chemical oxygen demands hudson et al 2008 cohen et al 2014 wang et al 2017 goffin et al 2019 microorganisms contain intrinsic fluorescent components such as amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and oxidized flavins lakowicz 2006 hill et al 2009 therefore fluorescence spectroscopy is widely discussed as a tool to characterize the presence of proteinaceous organic matter sewage water microbial contamination and

b sorensen et al 2018a b multiple studies have focused on the presence of e coli in water samples which signifies a major contamination event although the measured tlf signal contributed by e coli in many cases is likely to represent the occurrence of other microorganisms bridgeman et al 2015 risk assessment by tlf measurements showed some disagreements with that based on e coli enumeration however the tlf interpretation challenges were considered minimal in low organic c groundwater samples nowicki et al 2019 typically tlf is related to the bacterial concentration by using fluorescence

such as parallel factor parafac analysis principal component analysis self organizing maps partial least squares pls artificial neural networks and others e g giana et al 2003 stedmon and bro 2008 carstea et al 2010 bieroza et al 2011 faassen and hitzmann 2015 heibati et al 2017 fox et al 2017 demonstrated the production of various non tryptophan like fluorescent organic matter by growing escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in non fluorescent media by examining emission at certain excitation emission wavelengths peak picking within eems although microbially driven production of fluorescent organic matter was related to metabolic activity rather than to bacterial numbers per se fox et al 2017 yet this study prompts that simultaneous use of signals recorded in the broad ranges of excitation emission wavelengths not limited by typical tlf may be useful for detection of microbial contamination such an approach would presume using chemometric techniques to the best of our knowledge no study so far has compared peak picking measurements at selected ex em wavelength pairs with the use of an emission spectrum and the whole eem of water samples for the quantification of bacteria therefore the aim of this study was to assess fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for a rapid evaluation of the microbial quality of water by comparing the use of a single ex em wavelengths pair of the spectrum of emission obtained at a single excitation wavelength and of the eems analyzed with the pls algorithm the study was conducted both in a laboratory model system using pure cultures of bacteria and with natural groundwater samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and sample preparation for fluorescence measurements the

method into cleaned dark glass bottles and transported within 2 4 h under refrigeration 4 8 c to the agricultural research organization aro laboratory the samples were stored for 12 48 h at 4 c until analyzed altogether 90 groundwater samples were collected groundwater ph measured in the lab using a ph meter si analytics weilheim germany was in the 6 9 8 7 range the sampled water was also characterized for the presence of coliforms fecal coliforms fecal streptococci and hpc in an accredited microbiological laboratory mekorot central laboratory eshkol site hevel hayarden israel according to standard methods of the american public health association eaton et al 2005 2 3 fluorescence measurements fluorescence spectra of water samples were measured at 22 2 c with an rf 5301pc spectrofluorometer shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with 150 w xenon lamp ushio inc tokyo japan as described by borisover et al 2009 the cuvette used was the standard quartz cell hellma m√ºllheim germany having a path length of 10 mm and chamber volume of 3 5 ml excitation emission matrices eems of fluorescence were obtained by collecting emission spectra between 220 and 450 nm at 2 nm increments with excitation wavelengths ranging from 210 to 400 nm at 5 nm increments the excitation and emission optical slits were set to 10 nm and scanning time per eem was about 2 5 min intensity of the raman scattering peak of pure water at excitation wavelength at 275 nm and emission wavelength at 305 nm was determined in every measurement series water samples were scanned in duplicate using two separate water volumes for calibrating tryptophan emission signal 1 g of l tryptophan powder cas number 73 22 3 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa was dissolved into 100 ml of non fluorescent pure water merck darmstadt germany at 80 c using an electric stirrer and a hot plate freed electric haifa israel the tryptophan stock solution was serially diluted to prepare a series of concentrations in the 1 10 ppb range for all fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair 275 and 362 nm were used respectively this ex em wavelengths pair approximately represented maxima in the groundwater samples studied and is also in agreement with similar maxima locations used in the literature for tlf baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b no inner filter effect corrections were introduced during collecting the fluorescence data of samples the consideration was that in multiple real life scenarios performing this correction needs absorbance measurements in a range of wavelengths and may not be practical and easy therefore there was an interest in probing the potential of pls analysis of the data as is 2 4 data pre processing for each sample studied the emission data obtained with the excitation wavelength exceeding the emission wavelength were removed prior to the data analysis the emission intensities were normalized by the raman scattering intensity of water since eems are inherently 3 dimensional and the pls analysis is based on a 2 dimensional model there was a need to transform the eems data into two dimensional matrices this transformation was made by assigning excitation emission wavelengths pair as one coordinate using microsoft excel 2013 microsoft richmond usa further data pre processing involved centering and scaling geladi and kowalski 1986 using jmp software version 13 pro sas institute inc cary us each analyzed group of water samples was partitioned randomly into training and validation subsets in a ratio of 6 to 4 respectively 2 5 partial least squares pls analysis and statistical tests partial least squares pls method was used with its nipals nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm to both quantify and classify bacteria the jmp software was used for pls and other statistical tests classification was done using a pls discriminant analysis pls da option each pls model consists of several latent variables lv the number of lvs represents the complexity of the model the number of lvs of a good model was recommended to be minimal and with a proper dataset between 3 10 geladi and kowalski 1986 there were no general linear relations between measured fluorescence intensities and bacterial concentrations due to broad ranges of the bacterial concentrations examined and the lack of inner filter corrections therefore the pls model was allowed to deal with emission intensity by applying log bacterial concentrations thus reducing statistical weights of high concentrations and large emissions the models were characterized by coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse which measures the model s error in the units of measurements statistical significance of the differences was analyzed with wilcoxon rank sum test also known as the mann whitney test and if variances were equal also by using the tukey kramer test in order to test whether the variance of two groups is equal levene s test was applied soave and sun 2017 throughout the study statistical significance was required to be p 0 01 the cohen s kappa coefficient k measuring non random agreement between different raters prediction methods agresti 2007 was also calculated using jmp the cohen s kappa coefficient varies between zero indicating that the correct prediction if occurred is just by chance and 1 evidencing for non random correct prediction detection threshold was defined as difference between a measurement in a given sample and the analyzed value in a sample with microbial concentration 10 cfu ml this difference was considered significant by applying p 0 01 and using wilcoxon ranked sum test or tukey kramer test when applicable 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of laboratory grown bacteria with fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair the tryptophan like fluorescence at ex em wavelengths of 275 and 362 nm respectively of e coli b subtilis and p aeruginosa is shown in fig 1 as box plot against bacterial concentration according to the levene s test soave and sun 2017 the variances in fluorescence intensity were not equal at different concentrations of bacteria therefore to test the differences in fluorescence intensity between different bacterial concentrations when variances are not equal a wilcoxon non parametric test was applied leech and onwuegbuzie 2002 sorensen et al 2018b the fluorescence differences became statistically significant only at bacterial concentrations of 103 105 cfu ml depending on the bacterial species which corresponded roughly to emission intensity of 0 2 r u fig 1 this fluorescence threshold was converted to the concentration of tryptophan producing the same level of emission for that a linear relation between the raman normalized intensity of tryptophan fluorescence emission upon excitation at 375 nm and emission at 362 nm and tryptophan concentration in ppb was obtained in the following form emission intensity 0 127 0 038 tryptophan concentration r2 0 85 p 0 0001 it appeared that when using fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair microbial species became detectable when the emission intensity was equal to that measured in a solution containing about 2 ppb of tryptophan this estimate seems to be in agreement with earlier studies baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b sorensen et al 2015a b in which the minimal detectable microbial concentration was found equivalent to the 1 5 ppb concentrations of free tryptophan 3 2 quantification of laboratory grown bacteria with pls analyzed emission spectra and eems quantification of e coli by fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair as described above was further compared with the pls supported use of i the emission spectra recorded in the 220 450 nm wavelength interval upon excitation at 275 nm and ii the eems obtained in the excitation and emission wavelength ranges as such as 210 400 and 220 450 nm respectively in the first analysis i the 275 nm excitation wavelength was selected to include tlf vivian and callis 2001 yang et al 2015 baker et al 2015 bridgeman et al 2015 khamis et al 2015 cumberland et al 2012 sorensen et al 2018a b consistently with our earlier selection of the ex em wavelengths coordinates for peak picking the range of excitation wavelengths in the eem analysis ii as well as the emission wavelength ranges in both cases i and ii were taken to significantly explore wavelength distributions of recorded signals associated with cultured bacteria in model systems additional support for using broad wavelength ranges may be provided by the work of fox et al 2017 in which non tlf was demonstrated to appear in pure cultures of escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa therefore also in the model systems studied in this work a non tlf if appears should be associated with presence of microorganisms and might contribute to their better quantification this comparison was performed by obtaining a prediction model with a training sample set 60 of the data or 84 samples and applying it to the validation sample set 40 of the data or 53 samples therefore first the emission intensities at the single ex em wavelengths pair were linearly regressed on the training dataset of log e coli concentrations involving 84 samples of bacterial solutions the obtained regression equation was used to predict bacterial concentrations from emission intensities in the validation set the linear regression of the predicted log e coli concentrations against actual log concentrations is shown in fig 2 a second pls algorithm was applied to both the emission spectra obtained upon excitation at 275 nm of the e coli suspension and to their eems of fluorescence the linear regressions of the predicted log bacterial concentrations obtained by means of emission spectra and the eems on the actual log bacterial concentrations are provided in fig 2c and e respectively when the prediction was made using the pls analyzed emission spectra the regression of the predicted log concentrations on the actual log concentrations was characterized by dramatically improved r2 0 587 as compared with the regression based on the values predicted using peak picking at a single ex em wavelengths pair r2 0 089 respectively the regression slope raised from 0 09 the peak picking method to 0 75 the pls analyzed emission spectra even better improvement of the regression of the predicted log concentrations on the actual log concentrations was reached when pls was applied to the entire eems r2 became 0 73 and the slope was 0 93 fig 2e the box plots in the right column of fig 2 examine the threshold values of three approaches for bacterial quantification based on the tukey kramer test presuming equal variances the thresholds cfu ml were as following 105 103 and 10 for using peak picking pls analyzed emission spectra and eems respectively in the same sequence using a wilcoxon non parametric test allowing comparison at non equal variances the thresholds were 105 104 and 10 cfu ml thus the pls guided use of emission spectra and in particular of eems as compared with a single ex em wavelengths pair increased the sensitivity of e coli detection by about one and four orders of magnitude respectively similar analyses were performed separately for b subtilis and p aeruginosa suspended in water table 1 summarizes for each bacterium and fluorescence measurement analysis type the slope rmse and r2 values computed for regressions of predicted log bacterial concentrations on the log actual concentration values in validation sets in addition table 1 provides the detection thresholds based on the wilcoxon and tukey kramer tests it is clear from table 1 that for all bacterial species r2 and the slopes were increased when the pls analysis was applied to emission spectra or eems as compared with the peak picking method in addition generally the pls analysis of eems led to the rise of r2 values and the slopes as compared with the pls analysis of emission spectra except non affected slopes for b subtilis finally in the validation datasets the pls analysis of the eems reduced significantly by orders of magnitude the detection limits of all bacterial species as compared with peak picking table 1 this improvement was highly significant for e coli and p aeruginosa and less yet distinct for b subtilis when emission spectra were pls analyzed the less improvement of the detection limit was reached as compared with peak picking for e coli and p aeruginosa overall decrease of detection limits when using the pls analysis as compared with peak picking might be understood by considering that fluorescence measurements covering ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths contain more quantitative information on fluorophores than those at a single ex em wavelengths pair hence the pls analysis of multiple signals might reduce the interfering effect of noise thus improving detection capability it is also clear from table 1 that the extent of detection limit improvement achieved by using the pls analysis as compared with peak picking varies depending on bacterial species which most probably reflects differences in the contents of proteinaceous matter its specific composition and structure it may be argued that even the best detection limits achieved in the model systems table 1 may not be sufficient to quantify the required presence of specific bacteria in water however the appearance of total coliforms e coli in water is expected to correlate with contamination events of drinking sources e g associated with penetration of sewage treated effluents or faecal bacteria cumberland et al 2012 baker et al 2015 therefore improving the detection limits associated with the development of the whole bacterial background may contribute also to an earlier signaling of possible contamination of water sources by specific bacterial pathogens furthermore hpc are widely used to assess water treatment and monitor changes of bacterial populations in the water system allen et al 2004 particularly where no coliforms are present as it follows from the above examination of the model bacterial systems and table 1 the pls analysis of emission spectra and eems may be helpful in reaching the goal to enhance the detection capabilities presence of other fluorophores e g belonging to humic like substances not related to bacterial matter may obviously interfere with fluorescence based analysis of microbial contamination of real water samples therefore the approach using fluorescence is foremost recommended for pre screening monitoring and risk communication in water samples with low contents of natural organic matter such as groundwater nowicki et al 2019 in addition selecting the appropriate narrowed ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths in the eems and emission spectra may help to reach a compromise between i better focusing on optical signals associated with microbial contamination and ii using still sufficiently large datasets allowing to explore the opportunities of chemometric analyses and the pls specifically for improving detection capabilities 3 3 differentiation between bacterial species using pls analysis of eems in order to examine the ability of pls analysis of eems to differentiate between bacterial species in water the eems of bacterial suspensions with 104 cfu ml of each species were combined in one dataset a pls da model was calculated in an attempt to classify these samples correctly with the same training validation ratio of 6 4 confusion matrix in table 2 demonstrates that the pls da model was capable of distinguishing between the different bacterial species the values shown in a row in table 2 indicate the number of samples of a certain species assigned correctly or erroneously to each of three bacteria studied such that the total number of the samples containing this species is summarized in the last column respectively the last line in table 2 presents the total number of sample assignments to a given bacterium so of eleven b subtilis samples seven were identified correctly whereas four were assigned as p aeruginosa all the e coli and p aeruginosa samples 11 and 18 respectively were correctly identified so altogether 36 samples of different bacteria of 40 were properly identified indicating an overall prediction accuracy of 90 the cohen s kappa coefficient k of 0 84 indicates that a significant non random classification of bacterial samples was possible with the pls analysis of eems 3 4 fluorescence based detection of heterotrophic bacteria in groundwater at a single ex em wavelengths pair of 90 groundwater samples studied table s1 supplementary information only one sample contained 1000 cfu ml of hpc and that sample also harbored 3 cfu 100 ml of fecal coliforms in fig 3 a fluorescence emission intensities determined in groundwater from all sampling locations and events were plotted against the bacterial concentration fig 3b shows the data only for the samples with bacteria concentration 500 cfu ml it is seen in fig 3a that all but four of the groundwater samples contained less than 300 cfu ml of hpc and fluorescence intensities below 0 45 r u a comparable emission intensity of 0 2 r u determined in suspensions of laboratory grown bacteria was related to much higher bacterial concentrations i e 103 106 cfu ml fig 1 this contrast between laboratory grown bacteria and those present in groundwater suggests that natural water contains other microorganisms that are not necessarily detected by the hpc method these may comprise bacteria with specific nutritional requirements that cannot grow on the medium used to determine hpc as well as viable but not culturable vbnc bacteria fungi parasites and viruses ashbolt 2015 in general the presence of various types of microorganisms results in multiple contributions to the overall fluorescence bridgeman et al 2015 fox et al 2017 such that these contributions may also be species dependent this makes the models developed on bacterial monocultures hardly applicable for straightforward predicting bacteria specific concentrations in real water samples from fluorescence measurements in addition the variability of emission intensity for a given level of bacterial concentrations in groundwater up to 0 42 r u fig 3b exceeds the variability observed for lab grown bacteria fig 1 which reflects most probably variable composition of bacterial communities in groundwater samples depending on a specific well and sampling date this variable composition of groundwater samples increases the threshold of detections in groundwater as compared with that of individual lab grown bacteria fig 4 illustrates how fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair distinguish different levels i e 90 90 500 500 cfu ml of bacterial concentration in groundwater samples indeed the ability of fluorescence measurements at a single ex em wavelengths pair to distinguish groundwater samples with bacteria concentrations 500 cfu ml from samples containing 90 cfu ml hpc was reached at a higher emission intensity level 0 5 0 6 r u fig 4 as compared with the threshold observed with lab grown bacteria 0 2 r u fig 1 3 5 detection of heterotrophic bacteria in groundwater using pls analyzed emission spectra obtained upon excitation at 275 nm and full eems in further analysis emission spectra collected upon excitation at 275 nm and the whole eems of groundwater samples were modeled by means of pls since two samples obtained from the shimron 7 well were characterized by relatively high hpc values i e 770 and 2900 cfu ml and have shown significant differences in fluorescence as compared with others these samples were removed from the analysis and the remaining 88 samples were analyzed fig 5 shows how pls analyzed emission spectra and eems distinguish the groups of groundwater samples differing by hpc as compared with fluorescence measurements at the single ex em wavelengths pair in this comparison one group of the samples was characterized by bacterial concentrations less than 90 cfu ml and in the second group the hpc values exceeded 90 cfu ml it was not possible to further divide the water samples of the latter group into additional subgroups as done in fig 4 due to the relatively small number of samples available for the pls analysis neither measurements at the single ex em wavelengths pair nor the pls analysis of emission spectra were able to distinguish the water samples having less or more than 90 cfu ml hpc fig 5 whereas the pls analysis of the whole eems could do that in agreement with the demonstrated ability of the pls eems analysis to decrease the detection limit of lab grown bacteria fig 2 table 1 the data shown in fig 5 propose improvement of bacterial detection in high quality groundwater when fluorescence measurements are combined with the pls based modeling however it is worth mentioning that weighting effects of sample sites associated with different bacterial communities in the examined samples may affect predictability which should be taken into account by testing a larger number of wells samples from various water sources 4 conclusions the use of a pls predictive model based on the emission spectrum upon excitation by a single wavelength as compared with use of a single ex em wavelengths pair improves predictions of bacterial concentrations better and distinct improvements in predictions are reached when the whole eems were used instead of a single ex em wavelengths pair a pls based analysis of the emission spectra and in particular of eems as compared with a single ex em wavelengths pair can significantly reduce the detection thresholds of the tested bacterial species by orders of magnitude both the extents of prediction improvements and the reduction in the detection limits when using pls analyzed fluorescence data are species dependent the pls analysis of eems enables differentiating between e coli b subtilis and p aeruginosa present in pure water at concentrations exceeding 104 cfu ml improvement of bacterial detection is also observed in high quality groundwater when the fluorescence measurements are combined with pls treatment however variable bacterial compositions of groundwater samples may increase the apparent detection limit of bacteria as compared with that of individual laboratory grown bacteria utilizing large sets of excitation emission wavelengths combinations seems to be beneficial in order to enhance bacterial detection sensitivity this could be consequential especially in cases of high water quality and low bacterial concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18328,oil spills are one of the major threats to the marine environment in the german bight north sea in case of an accident application of chemical dispersants would be one response option among others dispersion breaks oil slicks into small droplets which get then mixed into the water column removal of the oil from the water surface may reduce contamination of the coast however the window of opportunity for effective dispersant application is short and there are concerns about potential effects to the marine life we propose a bayesian network bn as an interactive and intuitive tool for responders to justify decisions on using chemical dispersants and possibly the provision of appropriate assets the bn combines detailed sub bns for different criteria that govern the decision process expected drift trajectories are estimated based on comprehensive numerical ensemble simulations of hypothetical oil spills ecological impacts are represented prototypically focusing on vulnerability of seabird concentrations to pollution in coastal areas dispersant effectiveness is estimated considering oil properties and weather conditions decision making is supposed to be based on expected satisfaction the definition of what is considered satisfactory is of central importance for the whole analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil spill chemical dispersants decision making german bight bayesian network 1 introduction oil spills are serious threats to the marine ecosystem accidents involving ships or oil rigs may damage the ocean environment for decades to come amir heidari et al 2019 the german bight is located in the southeast of the north sea bounded by denmark germany and netherlands it is one of the most heavily trafficked sea areas in the world hosting shipping lanes that connect the ports of antwerp rotterdam and hamburg with the atlantic in case of an oil spill emergency responders have to select effective oil combatting technologies to minimize damages the preferred response option mechanical recovery uses booms and skimmers to recover oil from the surface if feasible and effective such mechanical cleaning is preferable to other options but often only a relatively small proportion of the spilled oil can be recovered this way aps et al 2009 the sea state weather conditions and equipment availability control the effectiveness of mechanical response lessard and demarco 2000 application of a chemical dispersant is an alternative response option the exxon valdez spill in 1989 was one of the first large scale oil spills after which dispersants were used kelso and kendziorek 1991 shaw 1992 being the largest marine oil spill in the petroleum industry s history the deepwater horizon spill occurred on 20 april 2010 crone and tolstoy 2010 this disaster killed 11 crew members and discharged over 636 million liters of oil into the gulf of mexico over a time span of about three months incardona et al 2014 in order to avoid spills reaching coastlines nearly two million gallons of oil dispersants were used in clean up efforts alexandera et al 2018 dispersants break up oil slicks into tiny oil droplets that are easily mixed into the water column the benefits of using dispersants include reduction of surface oil and enhanced natural biodegradation due to the oil surface being substantially increased drawbacks include potentially detrimental effects on local marine life therefore decisions regarding the use of dispersants involve trade offs among potential benefits and costs in the presence of high uncertainty the window of opportunity for effective dispersant application is usually within hours to one or two days after an oil spill hence rapid decision making is extremely important every spill is different responders must make timely decisions based on limited information available judging whether application of dispersant will result in net environmental benefits to guide decisions on potential dispersant use several flow charts were proposed national research council 1989 most of them employ remarkably similar concepts to evaluate the appropriateness of dispersant use national research council 2005 since the purpose of using dispersants is to minimize damages caused by an oil spill quantitative measures of success are necessary being hard pressed for time and watched by the public and different stakeholders decision makers are at risk of a misjudgment davies and hope 2015 to help emergency responders to make proper decisions a comprehensive model combining oil transport and fate dispersant effectiveness and ecological consequences on local habitats is necessary king and dethier 2017 until now no such comprehensive assessment of risk associated with the use of chemical dispersants has been developed for the german bight grote et al 2018 vogel et al 2014 see a large under exploited potential of bayesian network bn technology to be applied in the context of environmental problems bns

al 2015 montewka et al 2013 and analyses of potential benefits of using chemical dispersants liu and callies 2019 although some of the bns also deal with chemical dispersion to our best knowledge none of them involves decision making on the use of dispersants this study has the focus on this specific aspect after an outline of the general method a specific oil spill scenario will be presented to illustrate the decision making process we will then discuss the model and its applications and draw some conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the decision making process fig 1 shows an example flow chart national research council 2005 stevens 2006 summarizing key aspects to be considered when deciding on the potential use of chemical dispersants each step of the multistage decision problem needs evaluation of information available at that time once an oil spill is confirmed information on its location the oil type and environmental conditions enables an assessment of possible threats environmentally or economically sensitive values may include sea birds endangered species marine reserves ports fishing areas and so on in a next step combatting technologies must be selected usually mechanical recovery of oil from the water surface will be the first choice but efficiency of mechanical cleaning may be restricted by wind or wave conditions so that it is to be decided whether mechanical recovery will be sufficient if the answer is yes the option of using dispersants will be obsolete if the answer is no application of chemical dispersants may be considered as an option generally however dispersant use is not allowed in nearshore areas water depth 10 m of the german bight grote et al 2018 another key criterion is whether the oil is dispersible chemical properties of the oil spilled such as its viscosity density and boiling point are important factors that influence dispersant effectiveness based on their american petroleum institute api gravities oils are grouped into five categories light distillates light crudes medium crudes heavy crudes and non spreading oils stevens 2006 due to their high evaporation rates it is unnecessary to disperse light distillates chemical dispersants are likely to be effective for light crudes and medium crudes for heavy crude and non spreading oils dispersant use is likely to be ineffective and therefore not advised ipieca iogp 2015 given that the oil is dispersible responders must make sure that sufficient assets are available including the chemical dispersant itself but also equipment and trained personnel for its application if this precondition is satisfied decision makers must assess whether the application of dispersants can be assumed to be effective dispersant effectivity depends on different factors like water temperature wind velocity wave height and the degree of weathering there are some guidelines for the window of the opportunity and effectiveness of dispersants fingas 2004 finally responders should try to evaluate whether using dispersants would reduce the overall harm considering tradeoffs between expected ecological benefits and ecological costs of dispersant use our prototypical study emphasizes the particular aspect that due to modified drift paths application of dispersants can prevent oil from reaching the ecologically sensitive shorelines schwichtenberg et al 2017 only when benefits outweigh the drawbacks using dispersants can be considered a reasonable option 2 2 bayesian network a bn is a graphical model describing probabilistic relationships among a set of variables pearl 1986 1988 as directed acyclic graphs dags bns are composed of nodes and arcs nodes represent random variables directed arcs from parent to child nodes denote probabilistic dependencies each node may have several states e g yes and no prior probabilities must be assigned to all states of all so called root nodes without parents conditional probability tables assigned to child nodes specify the probabilities of their states for all possible combinations of states of their parent nodes bayesian inference means calculating posteriori probabilities for states of all unobserved variables propagating evidence available for the subset of observed variables across the whole bn bayes theorem plays an important role in this inference process suppose x and y are random variables given observations of y the updated probability p x y of x with prior distribution p x reads 1 p x y p y x p x p y let nodes x 1 x n denote interacting random variables assuming that in the bn p a x i is the set of all parent nodes of x i the conditional probability distribution of x i is denoted by p x i p a x i the joint probability distribution p x 1 x n can then be written as 2 p x 1 x n x i x 1 x n p x i p a x i based on eqs 1 and 2 it is possible to perform either forward predictive or backward diagnostic analyses in the latter case information is propagated against the orientation of arcs developing a bn includes structure specification and parameter estimation both steps can be accomplished based on expert knowledge or machine learning from various kinds of data in this paper the bn structure was designed based on knowledge about the causal structure of the problem concerning oil drift behavior bn parameters were estimated based on rich data available from numerical simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 on the other hand for environmental damages conditional probabilities in the prototypical bn were specified in a more conceptual way results serving as kind of placeholder for possibly more detailed descriptions 2 3 hydrodynamic simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 performed comprehensive ensemble simulations including 2190 hypothetical oil spills every 28 h in the years 2008 2015 from each of 636 cells of a regular grid covering the inner german bight se north sea for each simulation 1000 randomly distributed tracer particles were used to represent a hypothetical oil spill in the respective grid cell then drift paths of all these particles were tracked for seven days the drift simulations were conducted using the offline lagrangian transport toolbox pelets 2d callies et al 2011 prevailing winds and marine transports are decisive for the oil slicks drifting on the surface underlying marine surface currents were obtained from the 3d operational circulation model bshcmod dick et al 2001 an extra wind drift was specified as 1 8 of 10 m wind from the regional model cosmo eu schulz and sch√§ttler 2014 which also provides atmospheric forcing for the bshcmod marine simulations to simplify the representation in the bn we coarsened the spatial resolutions of both source and target regions relative to the setup originally used by schwichtenberg et al 2017 we divided the inner german bight into just 14 source regions s1 s14 and defined 8 target regions t1 t8 along the german bight coast see fig 2 an extra target region t9 was introduced for the island of helgoland from the pre calculated drift trajectories for each hypothetical accident in a given source area the numbers of particles reaching different target areas could be specified in addition the times elapsed since the spill took place could be recorded ranging up to a maximum integration time of seven days 3 model construction key decision criteria selected from the flow chart in fig 1 are expanded into bns that model dependences on major influencing factors these specialized subnetworks will then be combined into one master bn that covers all different aspects simultaneously the software we used for developing and evaluating the bn is netica nodes in the bn belong to three categories nature nodes decision nodes and utility nodes a nature node represents a variable it is also called a chance node if its relationship with its parent nodes is probabilistic and a deterministic node if it isn t a decision node combines options for action being under the control of the decision maker a utility node also known as value node represents a value to be maximized while searching for the optimal decision it will be drawn as a flattened hexagon or a diamond based on the flow chart in fig 1 the final decision use dispersant will not be made until all the decision criteria are answered with yes therefore the relationship between decision criteria and the final decision can be modeled by an and gate there are seven decision criteria in the flow chart however some decision criteria are redundant or trivial for example is the oil dispersible can be included in the decision criterion is the dispersant effective besides some trivial criteria like are sufficient assets available can be decided by simply yes or no neglecting these factors three key criteria remain that obviously involve large uncertainties which are are sensitive values threatened is a mechanical response sufficient and is the dispersant effective the next sections describe subnetworks designed to model dependences and uncertainties related to these three decision criteria 3 1 decision criterion are sensitive values threatened spilled oil polluting coastal areas may have severe effects on the ecosystem in particular the impacts on seabirds can be devastating seabirds washed up dead and covered in oil usually also attract most of the public concerns focusing on this latter aspect node ecological impact was introduced fig 3 trying to quantify the threat to coastal seabirds as a function of environmental conditions whether or not drifting oil will reach the coast depends on both wind direction mean wd and wind speed mean ws wind direction was subdivided into 8 sectors of 45 each referring to beaufort classification node mean ws has 7 states at this point some simplification was unavoidable wind conditions will not be constant during an oil slick s journey of up to seven days but rather change on a short term basis nevertheless we assumed for this study that winds averaged over the total drift period will still enable proper representation of the influence of winds on key drift characteristics the wind climatology depends on month corresponding cpts were derived from 10 m winds at location 7 5oe and 54 5 n near the center of german bight we extracted these probabilities from the atmospheric fields source deutscher wetterdienst dwd that were also used to force the marine currents underlying drift simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 ecological impact were also assumed to be depend on month because the presence of birds in different areas changes with season tasker and pienkowski 1987 provide monthly distribution maps for all seabirds and categorized the importance of each area of the north sea to every species as very high high moderate or low in their study vulnerability to oil pollution of seabirds species were categorized based on the amount of time birds spent on the water and the importance of the area to the world population of the species being endangered besides the importance of each area of the north sea to every species was categorized maps of vulnerability were then produced based on a combination of the two categorizations for our study the potential for damage in target regions t1 t9 on a monthly basis was extracted from these maps based on tasker and pienkowski 1987 we defined ecological impact to have four states very high high moderate and none a state low did not occur in coastal regions the main part of the cpt of ecological impact is listed in table 1 skipping state none of target area meaning that no oil reached any target area within a seven day period in the latter case also ecological impacts are assumed to be absent state none of ecological impact in fig 3 root node source area is assumed to have a non informative uniform prior distribution however its specification is central for any scenario definition the cpt of target area describing the probability that different target areas will be affected is derived from a total of about 1 4 10 9 trajectories simulated by schwichtenberg et al 2017 3 2 decision criterion is a mechanical response sufficient for the preferred mechanical response being a reasonable option mechanical response sufficient yes equipment must be available sufficient assets available and environmental conditions conditions for mechanical response must be favorable fig 4 wind speed and wave height are the main factors that influence feasibility of mechanical response too strong wind speeds 20 m s or wave heights 3 m s are considered unfavorable root note month allows probabilities of wind speeds to be specified as functions of season 3 3 decision criterion is the dispersant effective for an assessment of this decision criterion a node dispersion efficacy is introduced depending on oil type ws at application time ws standing for wind speed wave height month and application time fig 5 assuming that maximum possible efficiency in practice would be 35 fingas 2004 fingas et al 1995 the range of achievable values is discretized into 4 intervals note that the assumed maximum could easily be changed on the basis of expert knowledge however in our study the degree of satisfaction will be defined in terms of how close one comes to the best possible result therefore maximum possible efficiency is not a crucial parameter within such a concept after being released into the water oil undergoes weathering that decreases dispersion effectiveness generally the best opportunity for efficient use of dispersants is within hours up to one or two days after an oil spill application time later the effectiveness will generally be very low in application time we distinguished between applications on the first second third day or at some time later a prior distribution subjectively assigned to these four timings assumes a 50 chance that dispersants can be applied already within the first day in real decision making specification of application time will reflect the constraints of infrastructure being available generally oil viscosity depends on the type of oil being spilled oil type as oil viscosity increases for lower temperatures in winter the window of opportunity is shorter see influence of month effective chemical dispersion requires sufficient mixing caused by wind and waves wave heights between approximately 0 5 and 3 m are assumed to be necessary fingas 2004 if waves are very high already natural dispersion may be sufficient hence wave height is subdivided into the three classes 0 5 m 0 5 3 m and 3 m in ws at application time we distinguish between five states 5 m s 5 10 m s 10 15 m s 15 20 m s and 20 m s wind speeds of at least 5 m s are needed to generate waves for good dispersion national research council 2005 on the other hand too strong winds might prevent sprayed dispersant droplets from reaching the oil slick the cpt of dispersion efficacy eff was defined mainly based on estimates from the literature helle et al 2011 fingas 2004 itopf 2005 nordvik 1995 1999 introducing the following formula 3 eff 0 35 c 1 month c 2 application time c 3 ws at application time c 4 wave height c 5 oil type with weighting coefficients c1 c5 for the five parent variables fig 5 listed in table 2 each coefficient may assume values between 0 and 1 for dispersion efficacy eq 3 postulates a maximum possible value of 0 35 fingas 2004 fingas et al 1995 this upper limit however could easily be changed possibly after empirical values got available the bn was implemented in such a way that states of parents of dispersion efficacy represent the numerical values of corresponding coefficients in eq 3 rather than the descriptive states being annotated table 2 provides the corresponding mapping accordingly all mean values and standard deviations shown in separate boxes below the belief bars in fig 5 refer to the importance measures in eq 3 widely following helle et al 2011 coefficients in table 2 were chosen drawing on various studies reported in the literature fingas et al 1991 used the swirling flask test to measure effectiveness of four types of dispersants applied to a range of different oils they identified clear differences among the combinations they studied based on average effectiveness for each oil type hayes et al 1992 helle et al 2011 estimated the coefficients for oil type given in table 2 weathering of an oil slick will reduce dispersant effectiveness so that generally the best opportunity for using dispersants is within hours up to at most 1 or 2 days after an oil spill occurred national research council 2005 helle et al 2011 estimated coefficients for application time based on several studies published national research council 1989 hayes et al 1992 nordvik 1995 1999 mainly by increasing oil viscosity low water temperatures can reduce dispersant effectiveness down to below 10 fingas et al 1991 fingas 2011 moles et al 2002 following helle et al 2011 the effects of seasonal temperature variations within a range of roughly 20 c are parameterized in terms of a coefficient depending on month in order to enable effective mixing of dispersed oil droplets into the water column wind speed should be at least 5 m s national research council 2005 ideally it should be 12 13 m s fingas 2011 too strong winds might blow dispersants away from a targeted oil slick helle et al 2011 estimated coefficients for ws at application time based on several studies published fingas 2004 itopf 2005 according to allen 1988 wave heights between 0 5 and 3 m are needed for successful dispersant application 3 4 assembling the entire bn to assemble the full bn all subnetworks representing criteria of the decision procedure must be combined nodes used repeatedly are deleted in this process in fig 6 all root notes are marked in light green so that they can be identified more easily decision makers must specify their states to define the general setting within which decisions must be reached decision node use dispersant tries to maximize the value of utility node satisfaction it is assumed that satisfaction depends on mechanical response sufficient dispersion efficacy and ecological impact values of satisfaction ranging from 0 to 1 are defined based on four rules rule 1 when the mechanical response option is sufficient and the decision is to not use dispersants satisfaction is equal to 1 rule 2 when the mechanical response option is sufficient and the decision is to nevertheless use dispersants satisfaction is equal to 0 rule 3 when the mechanical response option is insufficient and the decision is to use dispersants values of satisfaction will be higher with higher dispersion efficacy or higher ecological impact of untreated oil corresponding assumed values of satisfaction are listed in table 3 rule 4 when the mechanical response option is insufficient and the decision is to not use dispersants values of satisfaction will be higher with lower dispersion efficacy or with lower ecological impact of untreated oil this attitude reflects the regret of having missed opportunities corresponding assumed values of satisfaction are listed in table 4 in fig 6 the numerical values shown for the two alternatives in use dispersant indicate the expected level of satisfaction values between 0 and 1 when making that choice the value does not mean the probability that this decision will be taken according to fig 6 without a specific scenario being defined a decision to always use dispersants would result in an expected satisfaction of only 0 09 while not using dispersants would result in a high average satisfaction of 0 98 this clearly shows that usefulness of dispersants depends on the presence of specific conditions this will be demonstrated in section 4 bns augmented by the inclusion of explicit decision and utility nodes are called influence diagrams cowell et al 1999 kjaerulff and madsen 2008 influence diagrams may host also a larger set of partial decisions to be taken sequentially based on information becoming available gradually so called informational links may represent the order on decisions and availability of information in our example with just one decision the problem of defining a decision sequence does not exist according to kjaerulff and madsen 2008 their section 7 3 2 in such case also informational links between observations and decisions based on them can be ignored however whether or not informational links are introduced affects the way the bn can be used the setup in fig 6 assumes that in order to take a decision the whole network will be evaluated after all evidence available has been entered additional informational links would single out random variables that are assumed to be known at the time of decision making then solving the bn would make the strategy for decision making explicit which otherwise is hidden in the process of solving the full bn adding informational links would generate decision rules depending on those variables considered to be known these rules could be applied without referring to the whole bn kjaerulff and madsen 2008 although the approach may be prohibitive for complex networks such decision rules can aid understanding of the general framework of the decision process an example will be provided in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 an example oil spill scenario let us assume that an oil spill in source area s4 occurs in july according to the bn in this month westerly winds have the highest probability 21 1 we select this wind direction plus wind speed category 5 5 7 9 m s which according to the bn or the data it is based on is most likely for westerly winds in july probability 25 3 under the assumed very common environmental conditions the bn predicts 81 9 of the spilled oil to reach either t2 or t3 within a 7 day period see fig 7 severe ecological impacts are to be expected probability for state very high is 85 2 this is because for many species the nesting season ends in july adult and juvenile birds staying in coastal waters makes them very vulnerable to oil pollution see table 1 fig 8 shows how ecological impacts arising from the assumed oil spill in source area s4 would vary with wind direction and season concentrating on the extremes the figure sums up probabilities for just the two states very high and high neglecting state moderate probabilities of coastal pollution are particularly high when winds blow from w sw or nw these wind directions happen to also be the most frequent ones according to the bn in july such wind conditions on a weekly basis are found in 56 of all cases in fig 8 sudden drops of strong environmental effects during may or october result from the fact that ecological impacts in target areas t1 t2 or t3 have been classified as only moderate table 1 a category neglected in fig 8 the trade off between possibly too simplistic assumptions on the one hand and the need for simple rules on the other is central for the design of any decision scheme the scenario underlying fig 7 implies a dangerous threat to the coastal bird population nevertheless according to the bn using dispersants would result in a low expected satisfaction of only 0 16 for not using dispersants a satisfaction as high as 0 93 would be expected the reason for this surprising finding is that key preconditions needed for successful dispersant use are still unspecified the aforementioned estimates of satisfaction represent an average over many scenarios that differ with regard to oil type technical aspects e g availability of assets but also environmental conditions at the time of dispersant application fig 9 redisplays the bn in fig 7 after the scenario has been made more explicit most of the additional information supplied is likely to be known at the time when the decision is to be made it is assumed that the oil type is dispersible light crude and that it is technically possible to apply dispersants within the first day in addition it is assumed that winds and waves at the time of dispersant application are favorable having made these choices dispersion efficacy reaches its maximum possible value which would be 35 according to the assumption in eq 3 nevertheless still the bn would not generally recommend using dispersants satisfaction 0 48 for yes and 0 57 for no not shown this is because our definition of satisfaction generally includes a preference for mechanical cleaning therefore the last and most crucial piece of information to be provided is whether there would be sufficient assets for successful mechanical cleaning sufficient assets available fig 9 assumes that this is not the case only now the bn clearly recommends using dispersants the expected satisfaction value of 0 87 contrasts with 0 15 when deciding against the use of dispersants for a preparatory strategic discussion of possible measures to be taken in case of an oil spill it is interesting to know at which locations positive effects of dispersant use are likely to occur schwichtenberg et al 2017 provided a corresponding map of probabilities their fig 2 key features of this map are also reflected in the behavior of the bn presented in this study for different wind directions fig 10 shows how expected satisfactions with decisions in favor of chemical dispersant use depend on the location of the hypothetical oil spill generally winds from w sw nw and n imply the highest benefits due to the geographic setting fig 2 these wind directions imply oil slicks to drift towards the coast in particular when oil is released near the coast in the german bight region the most threatening wind directions are also the most frequent ones successful dispersion and subsequent mixing of dispersed oil into the water column would suppress an extra wind drag and thereby stop or at least slow down the oil slick s drift towards the coast for source areas s11 and s12 located far from the coast fig 2 the bn predicts a low satisfaction with dispersant use no matter from where the winds blow it must be kept in mind however that drift simulations underling this study did not extend beyond a seven day period for oil releases on the open sea this time span might be too short for damages in coastal regions to occur so that there is also no chance to observe benefits from dispersion 4 2 introducing an informational link sometimes it can be instructive to identify and formally separate variables states of which are supposed to be known at the time of decision making establishing these variables as ancestors of the decision node introduces so called informational links see section 3 3 as a result solving the bn will produce decision rules that can be applied offline kjaerulff and madsen 2008 however specification of such rules based on only a subset of variables has to be redone as soon as evidence for variables not being involved in the decision rules becomes either available or updated fig 11 provides an example for such modification of the influence diagram in case of an emergency situation in the german bight operational drift simulations will be available for a three day period which is less than the one week period the bn considers for a generation of detrimental ecological effects by contrast operational weather forecasts may be available for a whole week as marine currents depend on atmospheric forcing knowing future wind conditions will be informative about currents as well fig 11 assumes that at the time of decision making the state of mean wd for the next week is known then solving the modified bn will generate a table that suggests decisions yes or no with regard to the application of dispersants as a function of the state of mean wd given all evidences provided for other parameters of the bn the decision table that arises from the specific configuration shown in fig 11 would be the fourth line of table 5 fig 11 assumes an accident in region s4 and a configuration in which dispersant efficiency will be 35 the maximum possible value according to eq 3 table 5 as a whole combines all decision tables one per line that refer to different choices of the location of the accident source area assuming that for all other parameters oil type application time month evidence was entered as in fig 11 for source region s4 table 5 suggests dispersant use only for mean wd being nw w or sw for all other wind directions using dispersants is predicted to be not beneficial as a result with unspecified wind conditions note that information on mean wd is not yet entered in fig 11 the expected satisfaction 0 46 when using dispersants is lower than when not using them 0 6 for westerly winds w expected satisfaction after dispersant use increases to a value of 0 81 not shown or even 0 87 when in addition mean ws is constrained to be in the range of 5 5 7 9 m s see fig 9 in both cases expected satisfaction when refraining from dispersant use would be much lower 0 21 and 0 15 respectively given the distribution of birds in july evidence for month in fig 11 the bn recommends dispersant use in regions s1 s6 if winds blow from westerly directions nw w or sw application of dispersants would suppress a wind drag that tends to push untreated oil into regions populated by coastal birds for regions s1 and s2 table 5 favors the use of dispersants also for winds from either the south or north which seems reasonable considering the bay like structure of these two nearshore source areas see fig 2 northern winds are also a key decision criterion for those regions s6 s10 s14 that adjoin to the coast at their southern boundary the recommendation to use dispersants in s9 under winds blowing from the west arises from the neighborhood with the island of helgoland t9 the same holds for an oil spill in s10 and winds blowing from southwest note that the two independent parameters source area and mean wd in table 5 also underlie fig 10 so that the above findings agree with peak values in fig 10 5 discussion this study presented a prototypical bn that models the process of decision making with regard to the potential use of chemical dispersants in case of an oil spill in the german bight the design of the bn was rooted in the structure of commonly used flow charts replacing single decision points therein by more complex representations of influencing factors transformed the linear structure of the flow chart into a complex network bns are capable of combining qualitative information observation or expert judgment with quantitative data historical data experiments and simulations representing also uncertainties the bn provides emergency responders with a quantitative assessment of different decisions in terms of expected satisfaction estimated satisfaction is an average over all combinations of possible states of variables being involved accordingly the estimated satisfaction becomes the more specific the more ranges of parameter values are narrowed by entering specific evidence simplistic flow charts assume that each decision criterion can be answered by yes or no however criteria like is the dispersant effective obviously involve large uncertainties generally actual efficiencies of different measures can only be estimated also knowledge about how the oil either untreated or dispersed will behave and impact on various ecosystem processes is fragmentary decision making must take into account such uncertainties as far as possible in case of a real accident there will not be enough time for a general discussion of which counter measures are generally acceptable and how they should be prioritized preparing for possible accidents also the allocation of equipment must be discussed in advance this preparatory discussion must be led for unspecified atmospheric and marine conditions under which a hypothetical accident would actually take place however frequent constellations and developments can be distinguished from those that are unlikely based on long term reconstructions of past conditions e g several decades this simulated surrogate reality can be used as a mathematical laboratory that enables evaluation of huge ensembles of hypothetical oil releases scheduling hypothetical accidents on a regular basis e g once per day implicitly produces realistic statistics of environmental developments aggregation of such ensemble simulations in a bn has been demonstrated by liu and callies 2019 in the present study we combined their approach with the process of decision making trying to make uncertainty of criteria in the flow chart more explicit as a future extension even the probabilities of having ship accidents in different marine areas could possibly be parameterized dependent on weather conditions being useful as a tool mainly for contingency planning the bn in its present form may not yet be suitable for decision making in case of a specific accident in such a situation customized drift simulations would be available based on weather predictions for the next couple of days our bn referring to mean conditions aggregated over one week could not accommodate such more explicit information major adjustments would be needed however possibly developments beyond the limit of explicit predictions e g 3 days at the moment could still be represented probabilistically based on weather predictions credible for about one week for instance introducing informational links see the example in section 4 2 might condense some decision rules see table 5 to give rough orientation in the presence of high uncertainty the perspective is very different with regard to environmental damages a certain accident would entail quantification and relative weighting of environmental damages is extremely difficult in our study we focused prototypically on just birds which is obviously a very simplistic approach for more realistic applications the bn would have to be extended shifting the overall focus of the tool more from physical to ecosystem aspects grote et al 2018 point out the need for a comprehensive net environmental benefit analysis neba that compares expected impact mitigation for habitats or ecological resources when different oil spill response options are pursued the necessity of considering various trade offs makes this an ambitious scheme stakeholders involved may have conflicting ideas about which ecosystem services at risk should be protected in the first place an even broader so called spill impact mitigation assessment sima would also bring in relevant societal cultural and economic aspects ipieca iogp 2017 for fishermen for instance the role of coastal waters as a nursery for young fish would have high priority in the above report it is recommended to differentiate between resource compartments at a relatively broad level distinguishing for instance between seabed water surface water column air shorelines high value resources socio economic and cultural resources resource compartment air would cover human health aspects due to exposures of professionals and possibly volunteers involved in clean up prioritization criteria may be subject to changes and revisions the advantage of bn technology is that such changes can be realized in a very transparent way different options for prioritization could be made explicit bostrom et al 2015 found limited confidence among u s coastal residents regarding scientific knowledge about dispersant toxicity and effectiveness this further complicates communication and a possibly emotive discussion of the response option being chosen the clear presentation of assumed cause effect relationships via an interactive bn could be helpful in that respect a related issue is the definition of states of node satisfaction in the bn the fuzzy criteria for satisfaction are disputable in our study we made some subjective choices of what we thought might be reasonable assumptions however the corresponding cpt in the bn can easily modified also further parent nodes considered relevant for the definition of satisfaction could be added such updates might need intense negotiations of a consensus among different stakeholders the outcome of such negotiations would be well documented and comprehensible from the bn one specific aspect of the scheme we implemented should be emphasized at this point according to eq 3 a maximum dispersant efficacy of 35 has been assumed this limit can of course be questioned results on dispersant efficacy are mainly based on laboratory experiments and might not always properly represent the conditions after real oil spills using various tests many different results for dispersant effectiveness were obtained george ares et al 2001 blondina et al 1999 in case of a real accident dispersants might directly be tested for the oil being spilled parameters used in the bn could be upgraded once new data from experiments become available however our definition of satisfaction was oriented towards the degree to which the maximum possible value could be achieved under given conditions within this concept a change of the maximum possible value itself would not change the overall results reaching the maximum possible degree of dispersion would be satisfactory regardless of how large this value is for the time being there are no clear cut answers to the question if and when chemical dispersant should be used decisions regarding the use of chemical dispersants often focus on toxic effects that dispersed oil may have on marine organisms in either the water column or the sediment lewis and prince 2018 to simplify decision making it is often assumed that in deep water e g water depth 10 m dilution will reduce harmful effects of dispersed oil to an acceptable level this leads to different zoning concepts in national response planning grote et al 2018 however there are also concerns that dispersants may enhance incorporation of oil into marine oil snow which then efficiently transfers the pollutant and its toxic effects to the benthic environment vonk et al 2015 daly et al 2016 passow et al 2017 unfortunately the acute or chronic toxicity of dispersed oil under realistic conditions has not been analyzed in sufficient depth to support robust decisions national research council 2005 researchers continue to debate toxic effects on marine organisms coelho et al 2013 kleindienst et al 2015 therefore this prototypical study did not take into account any effects on pelagic or benthic organisms these could be integrated however based on accepted scientific assessments 6 conclusions we proposed a bn approach influence diagram to describe decision making with regard to the potential use of chemical dispersants in case of an oil spill in the german bight the bn integrates key criteria of decision making including weather dependent drift behavior dispersion effectiveness and ecological impacts as a flexible interactive and intuitive tool it delivers the expected degree of satisfaction for a decision either against or in favor of dispersant use referring to the multivariate distribution of all variables and parameters being involved the estimated degree of satisfaction represents an average over all possible state combinations taking into account their multivariate probability distribution the spread of the underlying ensemble shrinks when specific evidence for some parameters can be entered primarily the bn is supposed to be useful in the context of preparatory contingency planning representation of the main connectivity between different influencing factors and the expected effects and consequences of a certain decision helps justify decisions being made considering the probabilities of decisions either against or in favor of dispersant use helps justify certain strategies including the provision of appropriate resources in the bn decisions are simulated as being based on an expected degree of satisfaction the case dependent definition of satisfaction is at the heart of the bn approach but its specification is likely to be subject to controversial scientific and societal debates to conform to the assessments of specific users a corresponding conditional probability table in the bn can easily be adjusted in case of real accidents specific drift simulations would be available with a detailed description of time behavior that goes beyond the aggregated representation seven day mean used in the bn this does not apply to the quantification of ecosystem effects for which uncertainties are generally much higher a future step to go could therefore be to improve and extend the description of ecosystem effects and then link that revised module to the outcome of case specific drift simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study was based on using rich simulation data which fabian schwichtenberg now federal maritime and hydrographic agency bsh produced in the context of a previous study hydrodynamic currents underlying these drift simulations were provided by bsh ulrike

18328,oil spills are one of the major threats to the marine environment in the german bight north sea in case of an accident application of chemical dispersants would be one response option among others dispersion breaks oil slicks into small droplets which get then mixed into the water column removal of the oil from the water surface may reduce contamination of the coast however the window of opportunity for effective dispersant application is short and there are concerns about potential effects to the marine life we propose a bayesian network bn as an interactive and intuitive tool for responders to justify decisions on using chemical dispersants and possibly the provision of appropriate assets the bn combines detailed sub bns for different criteria that govern the decision process expected drift trajectories are estimated based on comprehensive numerical ensemble simulations of hypothetical oil spills ecological impacts are represented prototypically focusing on vulnerability of seabird concentrations to pollution in coastal areas dispersant effectiveness is estimated considering oil properties and weather conditions decision making is supposed to be based on expected satisfaction the definition of what is considered satisfactory is of central importance for the whole analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil spill chemical dispersants decision making german bight bayesian network 1 introduction oil spills are serious threats to the marine ecosystem accidents involving ships or oil rigs may damage the ocean environment for decades to come amir heidari et al 2019 the german bight is located in the southeast of the north sea bounded by denmark germany and netherlands it is one of the most heavily trafficked sea areas in the world hosting shipping lanes that connect the ports of antwerp rotterdam and hamburg with the atlantic in case of an oil spill emergency responders have to select effective oil combatting technologies to minimize damages the preferred response option mechanical recovery uses booms and skimmers to recover oil from the surface if feasible and effective such mechanical cleaning is preferable to other options but often only a relatively small proportion of the spilled oil can be recovered this way aps et al 2009 the sea state weather conditions and equipment availability control the effectiveness of mechanical response lessard and demarco 2000 application of a chemical dispersant is an alternative response option the exxon valdez spill in 1989 was one of the first large scale oil spills after which dispersants were used kelso and kendziorek 1991 shaw 1992 being the largest marine oil spill in the petroleum industry s history the deepwater horizon spill occurred on 20 april 2010 crone and tolstoy 2010 this disaster killed 11 crew members and discharged over 636 million liters of oil into the gulf of mexico over a time span of about three months incardona et al 2014 in order to avoid spills reaching coastlines nearly two million gallons of oil dispersants were used in clean up efforts alexandera et al 2018 dispersants break up oil slicks into tiny oil droplets that are easily mixed into the water column the benefits of using dispersants include reduction of surface oil and enhanced natural biodegradation due to the oil surface being substantially increased drawbacks include potentially detrimental effects on local marine life therefore decisions regarding the use of dispersants involve trade offs among potential benefits and costs in the presence of high uncertainty the window of opportunity for effective dispersant application is usually within hours to one or two days after an oil spill hence rapid decision making is extremely important every spill is different responders must make timely decisions based on limited information available judging whether application of dispersant will result in net environmental benefits to guide decisions on potential dispersant use several flow charts were proposed national research council 1989 most of them employ remarkably similar concepts to evaluate the appropriateness of dispersant use national research council 2005 since the purpose of using dispersants is to minimize damages caused by an oil spill quantitative measures of success are necessary being hard pressed for time and watched by the public and different stakeholders decision makers are at risk of a misjudgment davies and hope 2015 to help emergency responders to make proper decisions a comprehensive model combining oil transport and fate dispersant effectiveness and ecological consequences on local habitats is necessary king and dethier 2017 until now no such comprehensive assessment of risk associated with the use of chemical dispersants has been developed for the german bight grote et al 2018 vogel et al 2014 see a large under exploited potential of bayesian network bn technology to be applied in the context of environmental problems bns

al 2015 montewka et al 2013 and analyses of potential benefits of using chemical dispersants liu and callies 2019 although some of the bns also deal with chemical dispersion to our best knowledge none of them involves decision making on the use of dispersants this study has the focus on this specific aspect after an outline of the general method a specific oil spill scenario will be presented to illustrate the decision making process we will then discuss the model and its applications and draw some conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the decision making process fig 1 shows an example flow chart national research council 2005 stevens 2006 summarizing key aspects to be considered when deciding on the potential use of chemical dispersants each step of the multistage decision problem needs evaluation of information available at that time once an oil spill is confirmed information on its location the oil type and environmental conditions enables an assessment of possible threats environmentally or economically sensitive values may include sea birds endangered species marine reserves ports fishing areas and so on in a next step combatting technologies must be selected usually mechanical recovery of oil from the water surface will be the first choice but efficiency of mechanical cleaning may be restricted by wind or wave conditions so that it is to be decided whether mechanical recovery will be sufficient if the answer is yes the option of using dispersants will be obsolete if the answer is no application of chemical dispersants may be considered as an option generally however dispersant use is not allowed in nearshore areas water depth 10 m of the german bight grote et al 2018 another key criterion is whether the oil is dispersible chemical properties of the oil spilled such as its viscosity density and boiling point are important factors that influence dispersant effectiveness based on their american petroleum institute api gravities oils are grouped into five categories light distillates light crudes medium crudes heavy crudes and non spreading oils stevens 2006 due to their high evaporation rates it is unnecessary to disperse light distillates chemical dispersants are likely to be effective for light crudes and medium crudes for heavy crude and non spreading oils dispersant use is likely to be ineffective and therefore not advised ipieca iogp 2015 given that the oil is dispersible responders must make sure that sufficient assets are available including the chemical dispersant itself but also equipment and trained personnel for its application if this precondition is satisfied decision makers must assess whether the application of dispersants can be assumed to be effective dispersant effectivity depends on different factors like water temperature wind velocity wave height and the degree of weathering there are some guidelines for the window of the opportunity and effectiveness of dispersants fingas 2004 finally responders should try to evaluate whether using dispersants would reduce the overall harm considering tradeoffs between expected ecological benefits and ecological costs of dispersant use our prototypical study emphasizes the particular aspect that due to modified drift paths application of dispersants can prevent oil from reaching the ecologically sensitive shorelines schwichtenberg et al 2017 only when benefits outweigh the drawbacks using dispersants can be considered a reasonable option 2 2 bayesian network a bn is a graphical model describing probabilistic relationships among a set of variables pearl 1986 1988 as directed acyclic graphs dags bns are composed of nodes and arcs nodes represent random variables directed arcs from parent to child nodes denote probabilistic dependencies each node may have several states e g yes and no prior probabilities must be assigned to all states of all so called root nodes without parents conditional probability tables assigned to child nodes specify the probabilities of their states for all possible combinations of states of their parent nodes bayesian inference means calculating posteriori probabilities for states of all unobserved variables propagating evidence available for the subset of observed variables across the whole bn bayes theorem plays an important role in this inference process suppose x and y are random variables given observations of y the updated probability p x y of x with prior distribution p x reads 1 p x y p y x p x p y let nodes x 1 x n denote interacting random variables assuming that in the bn p a x i is the set of all parent nodes of x i the conditional probability distribution of x i is denoted by p x i p a x i the joint probability distribution p x 1 x n can then be written as 2 p x 1 x n x i x 1 x n p x i p a x i based on eqs 1 and 2 it is possible to perform either forward predictive or backward diagnostic analyses in the latter case information is propagated against the orientation of arcs developing a bn includes structure specification and parameter estimation both steps can be accomplished based on expert knowledge or machine learning from various kinds of data in this paper the bn structure was designed based on knowledge about the causal structure of the problem concerning oil drift behavior bn parameters were estimated based on rich data available from numerical simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 on the other hand for environmental damages conditional probabilities in the prototypical bn were specified in a more conceptual way results serving as kind of placeholder for possibly more detailed descriptions 2 3 hydrodynamic simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 performed comprehensive ensemble simulations including 2190 hypothetical oil spills every 28 h in the years 2008 2015 from each of 636 cells of a regular grid covering the inner german bight se north sea for each simulation 1000 randomly distributed tracer particles were used to represent a hypothetical oil spill in the respective grid cell then drift paths of all these particles were tracked for seven days the drift simulations were conducted using the offline lagrangian transport toolbox pelets 2d callies et al 2011 prevailing winds and marine transports are decisive for the oil slicks drifting on the surface underlying marine surface currents were obtained from the 3d operational circulation model bshcmod dick et al 2001 an extra wind drift was specified as 1 8 of 10 m wind from the regional model cosmo eu schulz and sch√§ttler 2014 which also provides atmospheric forcing for the bshcmod marine simulations to simplify the representation in the bn we coarsened the spatial resolutions of both source and target regions relative to the setup originally used by schwichtenberg et al 2017 we divided the inner german bight into just 14 source regions s1 s14 and defined 8 target regions t1 t8 along the german bight coast see fig 2 an extra target region t9 was introduced for the island of helgoland from the pre calculated drift trajectories for each hypothetical accident in a given source area the numbers of particles reaching different target areas could be specified in addition the times elapsed since the spill took place could be recorded ranging up to a maximum integration time of seven days 3 model construction key decision criteria selected from the flow chart in fig 1 are expanded into bns that model dependences on major influencing factors these specialized subnetworks will then be combined into one master bn that covers all different aspects simultaneously the software we used for developing and evaluating the bn is netica nodes in the bn belong to three categories nature nodes decision nodes and utility nodes a nature node represents a variable it is also called a chance node if its relationship with its parent nodes is probabilistic and a deterministic node if it isn t a decision node combines options for action being under the control of the decision maker a utility node also known as value node represents a value to be maximized while searching for the optimal decision it will be drawn as a flattened hexagon or a diamond based on the flow chart in fig 1 the final decision use dispersant will not be made until all the decision criteria are answered with yes therefore the relationship between decision criteria and the final decision can be modeled by an and gate there are seven decision criteria in the flow chart however some decision criteria are redundant or trivial for example is the oil dispersible can be included in the decision criterion is the dispersant effective besides some trivial criteria like are sufficient assets available can be decided by simply yes or no neglecting these factors three key criteria remain that obviously involve large uncertainties which are are sensitive values threatened is a mechanical response sufficient and is the dispersant effective the next sections describe subnetworks designed to model dependences and uncertainties related to these three decision criteria 3 1 decision criterion are sensitive values threatened spilled oil polluting coastal areas may have severe effects on the ecosystem in particular the impacts on seabirds can be devastating seabirds washed up dead and covered in oil usually also attract most of the public concerns focusing on this latter aspect node ecological impact was introduced fig 3 trying to quantify the threat to coastal seabirds as a function of environmental conditions whether or not drifting oil will reach the coast depends on both wind direction mean wd and wind speed mean ws wind direction was subdivided into 8 sectors of 45 each referring to beaufort classification node mean ws has 7 states at this point some simplification was unavoidable wind conditions will not be constant during an oil slick s journey of up to seven days but rather change on a short term basis nevertheless we assumed for this study that winds averaged over the total drift period will still enable proper representation of the influence of winds on key drift characteristics the wind climatology depends on month corresponding cpts were derived from 10 m winds at location 7 5oe and 54 5 n near the center of german bight we extracted these probabilities from the atmospheric fields source deutscher wetterdienst dwd that were also used to force the marine currents underlying drift simulations schwichtenberg et al 2017 ecological impact were also assumed to be depend on month because the presence of birds in different areas changes with season tasker and pienkowski 1987 provide monthly distribution maps for all seabirds and categorized the importance of each area of the north sea to every species as very high high moderate or low in their study vulnerability to oil pollution of seabirds species were categorized based on the amount of time birds spent on the water and the importance of the area to the world population of the species being endangered besides the importance of each area of the north sea to every species was categorized maps of vulnerability were then produced based on a combination of the two categorizations for our study the potential for damage in target regions t1 t9 on a monthly basis was extracted from these maps based on tasker and pienkowski 1987 we defined ecological impact to have four states very high high moderate and none a state low did not occur in coastal regions the main part of the cpt of ecological impact is listed in table 1 skipping state none of target area meaning that no oil reached any target area within a seven day period in the latter case also ecological impacts are assumed to be absent state none of ecological impact in fig 3 root node source area is assumed to have a non informative uniform prior distribution however its specification is central for any scenario definition the cpt of target area describing the probability that different target areas will be affected is derived from a total of about 1 4 10 9 trajectories simulated by schwichtenberg et al 2017 3 2 decision criterion is a mechanical response sufficient for the preferred mechanical response being a reasonable option mechanical response sufficient yes equipment must be available sufficient assets available and environmental conditions conditions for mechanical response must be favorable fig 4 wind speed and wave height are the main factors that influence feasibility of mechanical response too strong wind speeds 20 m s or wave heights 3 m s are considered unfavorable root note month allows probabilities of wind speeds to be specified as functions of season 3 3 decision criterion is the dispersant effective for an assessment of this decision criterion a node dispersion efficacy is introduced depending on oil type ws at application time ws standing for wind speed wave height month and application time fig 5 assuming that maximum possible efficiency in practice would be 35 fingas 2004 fingas et al 1995 the range of achievable values is discretized into 4 intervals note that the assumed maximum could easily be changed on the basis of expert knowledge however in our study the degree of satisfaction will be defined in terms of how close one comes to the best possible result therefore maximum possible efficiency is not a crucial parameter within such a concept after being released into the water oil undergoes weathering that decreases dispersion effectiveness generally the best opportunity for efficient use of dispersants is within hours up to one or two days after an oil spill application time later the effectiveness will generally be very low in application time we distinguished between applications on the first second third day or at some time later a prior distribution subjectively assigned to these four timings assumes a 50 chance that dispersants can be applied already within the first day in real decision making specification of application time will reflect the constraints of infrastructure being available generally oil viscosity depends on the type of oil being spilled oil type as oil viscosity increases for lower temperatures in winter the window of opportunity is shorter see influence of month effective chemical dispersion requires sufficient mixing caused by wind and waves wave heights between approximately 0 5 and 3 m are assumed to be necessary fingas 2004 if waves are very high already natural dispersion may be sufficient hence wave height is subdivided into the three classes 0 5 m 0 5 3 m and 3 m in ws at application time we distinguish between five states 5 m s 5 10 m s 10 15 m s 15 20 m s and 20 m s wind speeds of at least 5 m s are needed to generate waves for good dispersion national research council 2005 on the other hand too strong winds might prevent sprayed dispersant droplets from reaching the oil slick the cpt of dispersion efficacy eff was defined mainly based on estimates from the literature helle et al 2011 fingas 2004 itopf 2005 nordvik 1995 1999 introducing the following formula 3 eff 0 35 c 1 month c 2 application time c 3 ws at application time c 4 wave height c 5 oil type with weighting coefficients c1 c5 for the five parent variables fig 5 listed in table 2 each coefficient may assume values between 0 and 1 for dispersion efficacy eq 3 postulates a maximum possible value of 0 35 fingas 2004 fingas et al 1995 this upper limit however could easily be changed possibly after empirical values got available the bn was implemented in such a way that states of parents of dispersion efficacy represent the numerical values of corresponding coefficients in eq 3 rather than the descriptive states being annotated table 2 provides the corresponding mapping accordingly all mean values and standard deviations shown in separate boxes below the belief bars in fig 5 refer to the importance measures in eq 3 widely following helle et al 2011 coefficients in table 2 were chosen drawing on various studies reported in the literature fingas et al 1991 used the swirling flask test to measure effectiveness of four types of dispersants applied to a range of different oils they identified clear differences among the combinations they studied based on average effectiveness for each oil type hayes et al 1992 helle et al 2011 estimated the coefficients for oil type given in table 2 weathering of an oil slick will reduce dispersant effectiveness so that generally the best opportunity for using dispersants is within hours up to at most 1 or 2 days after an oil spill occurred national research council 2005 helle et al 2011 estimated coefficients for application time based on several studies published national research council 1989 hayes et al 1992 nordvik 1995 1999 mainly by increasing oil viscosity low water temperatures can reduce dispersant effectiveness down to below 10 fingas et al 1991 fingas 2011 moles et al 2002 following helle et al 2011 the effects of seasonal temperature variations within a range of roughly 20 c are parameterized in terms of a coefficient depending on month in order to enable effective mixing of dispersed oil droplets into the water column wind speed should be at least 5 m s national research council 2005 ideally it should be 12 13 m s fingas 2011 too strong winds might blow dispersants away from a targeted oil slick helle et al 2011 estimated coefficients for ws at application time based on several studies published fingas 2004 itopf 2005 according to allen 1988 wave heights between 0 5 and 3 m are needed for successful dispersant application 3 4 assembling the entire bn to assemble the full bn all subnetworks representing criteria of the decision procedure must be combined nodes used repeatedly are deleted in this process in fig 6 all root notes are marked in light green so that they can be identified more easily decision makers must specify their states to define the general setting within which decisions must be reached decision node use dispersant tries to maximize the value of utility node satisfaction it is assumed that satisfaction depends on mechanical response sufficient dispersion efficacy and ecological impact values of satisfaction ranging from 0 to 1 are defined based on four rules rule 1 when the mechanical response option is sufficient and the decision is to not use dispersants satisfaction is equal to 1 rule 2 when the mechanical response option is sufficient and the decision is to nevertheless use dispersants satisfaction is equal to 0 rule 3 when the mechanical response option is insufficient and the decision is to use dispersants values of satisfaction will be higher with higher dispersion efficacy or higher ecological impact of untreated oil corresponding assumed values of satisfaction are listed in table 3 rule 4 when the mechanical response option is insufficient and the decision is to not use dispersants values of satisfaction will be higher with lower dispersion efficacy or with lower ecological impact of untreated oil this attitude reflects the regret of having missed opportunities corresponding assumed values of satisfaction are listed in table 4 in fig 6 the numerical values shown for the two alternatives in use dispersant indicate the expected level of satisfaction values between 0 and 1 when making that choice the value does not mean the probability that this decision will be taken according to fig 6 without a specific scenario being defined a decision to always use dispersants would result in an expected satisfaction of only 0 09 while not using dispersants would result in a high average satisfaction of 0 98 this clearly shows that usefulness of dispersants depends on the presence of specific conditions this will be demonstrated in section 4 bns augmented by the inclusion of explicit decision and utility nodes are called influence diagrams cowell et al 1999 kjaerulff and madsen 2008 influence diagrams may host also a larger set of partial decisions to be taken sequentially based on information becoming available gradually so called informational links may represent the order on decisions and availability of information in our example with just one decision the problem of defining a decision sequence does not exist according to kjaerulff and madsen 2008 their section 7 3 2 in such case also informational links between observations and decisions based on them can be ignored however whether or not informational links are introduced affects the way the bn can be used the setup in fig 6 assumes that in order to take a decision the whole network will be evaluated after all evidence available has been entered additional informational links would single out random variables that are assumed to be known at the time of decision making then solving the bn would make the strategy for decision making explicit which otherwise is hidden in the process of solving the full bn adding informational links would generate decision rules depending on those variables considered to be known these rules could be applied without referring to the whole bn kjaerulff and madsen 2008 although the approach may be prohibitive for complex networks such decision rules can aid understanding of the general framework of the decision process an example will be provided in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 an example oil spill scenario let us assume that an oil spill in source area s4 occurs in july according to the bn in this month westerly winds have the highest probability 21 1 we select this wind direction plus wind speed category 5 5 7 9 m s which according to the bn or the data it is based on is most likely for westerly winds in july probability 25 3 under the assumed very common environmental conditions the bn predicts 81 9 of the spilled oil to reach either t2 or t3 within a 7 day period see fig 7 severe ecological impacts are to be expected probability for state very high is 85 2 this is because for many species the nesting season ends in july adult and juvenile birds staying in coastal waters makes them very vulnerable to oil pollution see table 1 fig 8 shows how ecological impacts arising from the assumed oil spill in source area s4 would vary with wind direction and season concentrating on the extremes the figure sums up probabilities for just the two states very high and high neglecting state moderate probabilities of coastal pollution are particularly high when winds blow from w sw or nw these wind directions happen to also be the most frequent ones according to the bn in july such wind conditions on a weekly basis are found in 56 of all cases in fig 8 sudden drops of strong environmental effects during may or october result from the fact that ecological impacts in target areas t1 t2 or t3 have been classified as only moderate table 1 a category neglected in fig 8 the trade off between possibly too simplistic assumptions on the one hand and the need for simple rules on the other is central for the design of any decision scheme the scenario underlying fig 7 implies a dangerous threat to the coastal bird population nevertheless according to the bn using dispersants would result in a low expected satisfaction of only 0 16 for not using dispersants a satisfaction as high as 0 93 would be expected the reason for this surprising finding is that key preconditions needed for successful dispersant use are still unspecified the aforementioned estimates of satisfaction represent an average over many scenarios that differ with regard to oil type technical aspects e g availability of assets but also environmental conditions at the time of dispersant application fig 9 redisplays the bn in fig 7 after the scenario has been made more explicit most of the additional information supplied is likely to be known at the time when the decision is to be made it is assumed that the oil type is dispersible light crude and that it is technically possible to apply dispersants within the first day in addition it is assumed that winds and waves at the time of dispersant application are favorable having made these choices dispersion efficacy reaches its maximum possible value which would be 35 according to the assumption in eq 3 nevertheless still the bn would not generally recommend using dispersants satisfaction 0 48 for yes and 0 57 for no not shown this is because our definition of satisfaction generally includes a preference for mechanical cleaning therefore the last and most crucial piece of information to be provided is whether there would be sufficient assets for successful mechanical cleaning sufficient assets available fig 9 assumes that this is not the case only now the bn clearly recommends using dispersants the expected satisfaction value of 0 87 contrasts with 0 15 when deciding against the use of dispersants for a preparatory strategic discussion of possible measures to be taken in case of an oil spill it is interesting to know at which locations positive effects of dispersant use are likely to occur schwichtenberg et al 2017 provided a corresponding map of probabilities their fig 2 key features of this map are also reflected in the behavior of the bn presented in this study for different wind directions fig 10 shows how expected satisfactions with decisions in favor of chemical dispersant use depend on the location of the hypothetical oil spill generally winds from w sw nw and n imply the highest benefits due to the geographic setting fig 2 these wind directions imply oil slicks to drift towards the coast in particular when oil is released near the coast in the german bight region the most threatening wind directions are also the most frequent ones successful dispersion and subsequent mixing of dispersed oil into the water column would suppress an extra wind drag and thereby stop or at least slow down the oil slick s drift towards the coast for source areas s11 and s12 located far from the coast fig 2 the bn predicts a low satisfaction with dispersant use no matter from where the winds blow it must be kept in mind however that drift simulations underling this study did not extend beyond a seven day period for oil releases on the open sea this time span might be too short for damages in coastal regions to occur so that there is also no chance to observe benefits from dispersion 4 2 introducing an informational link sometimes it can be instructive to identify and formally separate variables states of which are supposed to be known at the time of decision making establishing these variables as ancestors of the decision node introduces so called informational links see section 3 3 as a result solving the bn will produce decision rules that can be applied offline kjaerulff and madsen 2008 however specification of such rules based on only a subset of variables has to be redone as soon as evidence for variables not being involved in the decision rules becomes either available or updated fig 11 provides an example for such modification of the influence diagram in case of an emergency situation in the german bight operational drift simulations will be available for a three day period which is less than the one week period the bn considers for a generation of detrimental ecological effects by contrast operational weather forecasts may be available for a whole week as marine currents depend on atmospheric forcing knowing future wind conditions will be informative about currents as well fig 11 assumes that at the time of decision making the state of mean wd for the next week is known then solving the modified bn will generate a table that suggests decisions yes or no with regard to the application of dispersants as a function of the state of mean wd given all evidences provided for other parameters of the bn the decision table that arises from the specific configuration shown in fig 11 would be the fourth line of table 5 fig 11 assumes an accident in region s4 and a configuration in which dispersant efficiency will be 35 the maximum possible value according to eq 3 table 5 as a whole combines all decision tables one per line that refer to different choices of the location of the accident source area assuming that for all other parameters oil type application time month evidence was entered as in fig 11 for source region s4 table 5 suggests dispersant use only for mean wd being nw w or sw for all other wind directions using dispersants is predicted to be not beneficial as a result with unspecified wind conditions note that information on mean wd is not yet entered in fig 11 the expected satisfaction 0 46 when using dispersants is lower than when not using them 0 6 for westerly winds w expected satisfaction after dispersant use increases to a value of 0 81 not shown or even 0 87 when in addition mean ws is constrained to be in the range of 5 5 7 9 m s see fig 9 in both cases expected satisfaction when refraining from dispersant use would be much lower 0 21 and 0 15 respectively given the distribution of birds in july evidence for month in fig 11 the bn recommends dispersant use in regions s1 s6 if winds blow from westerly directions nw w or sw application of dispersants would suppress a wind drag that tends to push untreated oil into regions populated by coastal birds for regions s1 and s2 table 5 favors the use of dispersants also for winds from either the south or north which seems reasonable considering the bay like structure of these two nearshore source areas see fig 2 northern winds are also a key decision criterion for those regions s6 s10 s14 that adjoin to the coast at their southern boundary the recommendation to use dispersants in s9 under winds blowing from the west arises from the neighborhood with the island of helgoland t9 the same holds for an oil spill in s10 and winds blowing from southwest note that the two independent parameters source area and mean wd in table 5 also underlie fig 10 so that the above findings agree with peak values in fig 10 5 discussion this study presented a prototypical bn that models the process of decision making with regard to the potential use of chemical dispersants in case of an oil spill in the german bight the design of the bn was rooted in the structure of commonly used flow charts replacing single decision points therein by more complex representations of influencing factors transformed the linear structure of the flow chart into a complex network bns are capable of combining qualitative information observation or expert judgment with quantitative data historical data experiments and simulations representing also uncertainties the bn provides emergency responders with a quantitative assessment of different decisions in terms of expected satisfaction estimated satisfaction is an average over all combinations of possible states of variables being involved accordingly the estimated satisfaction becomes the more specific the more ranges of parameter values are narrowed by entering specific evidence simplistic flow charts assume that each decision criterion can be answered by yes or no however criteria like is the dispersant effective obviously involve large uncertainties generally actual efficiencies of different measures can only be estimated also knowledge about how the oil either untreated or dispersed will behave and impact on various ecosystem processes is fragmentary decision making must take into account such uncertainties as far as possible in case of a real accident there will not be enough time for a general discussion of which counter measures are generally acceptable and how they should be prioritized preparing for possible accidents also the allocation of equipment must be discussed in advance this preparatory discussion must be led for unspecified atmospheric and marine conditions under which a hypothetical accident would actually take place however frequent constellations and developments can be distinguished from those that are unlikely based on long term reconstructions of past conditions e g several decades this simulated surrogate reality can be used as a mathematical laboratory that enables evaluation of huge ensembles of hypothetical oil releases scheduling hypothetical accidents on a regular basis e g once per day implicitly produces realistic statistics of environmental developments aggregation of such ensemble simulations in a bn has been demonstrated by liu and callies 2019 in the present study we combined their approach with the process of decision making trying to make uncertainty of criteria in the flow chart more explicit as a future extension even the probabilities of having ship accidents in different marine areas could possibly be parameterized dependent on weather conditions being useful as a tool mainly for contingency planning the bn in its present form may not yet be suitable for decision making in case of a specific accident in such a situation customized drift simulations would be available based on weather predictions for the next couple of days our bn referring to mean conditions aggregated over one week could not accommodate such more explicit information major adjustments would be needed however possibly developments beyond the limit of explicit predictions e g 3 days at the moment could still be represented probabilistically based on weather predictions credible for about one week for instance introducing informational links see the example in section 4 2 might condense some decision rules see table 5 to give rough orientation in the presence of high uncertainty the perspective is very different with regard to environmental damages a certain accident would entail quantification and relative weighting of environmental damages is extremely difficult in our study we focused prototypically on just birds which is obviously a very simplistic approach for more realistic applications the bn would have to be extended shifting the overall focus of the tool more from physical to ecosystem aspects grote et al 2018 point out the need for a comprehensive net environmental benefit analysis neba that compares expected impact mitigation for habitats or ecological resources when different oil spill response options are pursued the necessity of considering various trade offs makes this an ambitious scheme stakeholders involved may have conflicting ideas about which ecosystem services at risk should be protected in the first place an even broader so called spill impact mitigation assessment sima would also bring in relevant societal cultural and economic aspects ipieca iogp 2017 for fishermen for instance the role of coastal waters as a nursery for young fish would have high priority in the above report it is recommended to differentiate between resource compartments at a relatively broad level distinguishing for instance between seabed water surface water column air shorelines high value resources socio economic and cultural resources resource compartment air would cover human health aspects due to exposures of professionals and possibly volunteers involved in clean up prioritization criteria may be subject to changes and revisions the advantage of bn technology is that such changes can be realized in a very transparent way different options for prioritization could be made explicit bostrom et al 2015 found limited confidence among u s coastal residents regarding scientific knowledge about dispersant toxicity and effectiveness this further complicates communication and a possibly emotive discussion of the response option being chosen the clear presentation of assumed cause effect relationships via an interactive bn could be helpful in that respect a related issue is the definition of states of node satisfaction in the bn the fuzzy criteria for satisfaction are disputable in our study we made some subjective choices of what we thought might be reasonable assumptions however the corresponding cpt in the bn can easily modified also further parent nodes considered relevant for the definition of satisfaction could be added such updates might need intense negotiations of a consensus among different stakeholders the outcome of such negotiations would be well documented and comprehensible from the bn one specific aspect of the scheme we implemented should be emphasized at this point according to eq 3 a maximum dispersant efficacy of 35 has been assumed this limit can of course be questioned results on dispersant efficacy are mainly based on laboratory experiments and might not always properly represent the conditions after real oil spills using various tests many different results for dispersant effectiveness were obtained george ares et al 2001 blondina et al 1999 in case of a real accident dispersants might directly be tested for the oil being spilled parameters used in the bn could be upgraded once new data from experiments become available however our definition of satisfaction was oriented towards the degree to which the maximum possible value could be achieved under given conditions within this concept a change of the maximum possible value itself would not change the overall results reaching the maximum possible degree of dispersion would be satisfactory regardless of how large this value is for the time being there are no clear cut answers to the question if and when chemical dispersant should be used decisions regarding the use of chemical dispersants often focus on toxic effects that dispersed oil may have on marine organisms in either the water column or the sediment lewis and prince 2018 to simplify decision making it is often assumed that in deep water e g water depth 10 m dilution will reduce harmful effects of dispersed oil to an acceptable level this leads to different zoning concepts in national response planning grote et al 2018 however there are also concerns that dispersants may enhance incorporation of oil into marine oil snow which then efficiently transfers the pollutant and its toxic effects to the benthic environment vonk et al 2015 daly et al 2016 passow et al 2017 unfortunately the acute or chronic toxicity of dispersed oil under realistic conditions has not been analyzed in sufficient depth to support robust decisions national research council 2005 researchers continue to debate toxic effects on marine organisms coelho et al 2013 kleindienst et al 2015 therefore this prototypical study did not take into account any effects on pelagic or benthic organisms these could be integrated however based on accepted scientific assessments 6 conclusions we proposed a bn approach influence diagram to describe decision making with regard to the potential use of chemical dispersants in case of an oil spill in the german bight the bn integrates key criteria of decision making including weather dependent drift behavior dispersion effectiveness and ecological impacts as a flexible interactive and intuitive tool it delivers the expected degree of satisfaction for a decision either against or in favor of dispersant use referring to the multivariate distribution of all variables and parameters being involved the estimated degree of satisfaction represents an average over all possible state combinations taking into account their multivariate probability distribution the spread of the underlying ensemble shrinks when specific evidence for some parameters can be entered primarily the bn is supposed to be useful in the context of preparatory contingency planning representation of the main connectivity between different influencing factors and the expected effects and consequences of a certain decision helps justify decisions being made considering the probabilities of decisions either against or in favor of dispersant use helps justify certain strategies including the provision of appropriate resources in the bn decisions are simulated as being based on an expected degree of satisfaction the case dependent definition of satisfaction is at the heart of the bn approach but its specification is likely to be subject to controversial scientific and societal debates to conform to the assessments of specific users a corresponding conditional probability table in the bn can easily be adjusted in case of real accidents specific drift simulations would be available with a detailed description of time behavior that goes beyond the aggregated representation seven day mean used in the bn this does not apply to the quantification of ecosystem effects for which uncertainties are generally much higher a future step to go could therefore be to improve and extend the description of ecosystem effects and then link that revised module to the outcome of case specific drift simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18329,there is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation moreover proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies herein we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using mhz order surface acoustic waves saws a key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves compared to previous work on its lower frequency khz order bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment is the absence of cavitation which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria thus limiting the intensity and duration and hence the efficiency enhancement associated with the acoustic exposure in particular we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion alternatively the saw exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput given the low cost of the miniature chipscale platform these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large scale industrial wastewater processing through massive parallelization graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment anaerobic sludge ultrasound surface acoustic wave acoustic pressure acoustic streaming 1 introduction water scarcity has been a significant issue that has over the years affected and continues to plague countries across the world due to population growth increased urbanisation mismanagement of water resources and climate change falkenmark 1990 arnell 1999 bouwer 2000 thousands of deaths occur each day in developing countries due to water shortage and inadequate sanitation facilities while in developed countries water wastage and water pollution are major concerns by 2025 it is estimated that up to half of the global population will encounter freshwater supply shortages juan et al 2016 as such there is an urgent need to tackle this crisis which is growing at an alarming rate one solution is the reuse of greywater wastewater generated from the kitchen bathroom and laundry excluding toilet water friedler 2004 which makes up approximately 70 of the total wastewater in a household and contains a lower level of organic compounds and microorganisms compared to domestic wastewater treated greywater can be reused for example for flushing toilets irrigation and other cleaning purposes and not only increases freshwater availability by decreasing its household consumption up to 43 reduction of freshwater usage in a household can be achieved oh et al 2018 but also reduce the volume of wastewater sent to a municipal treatment system many studies have reported various technologies for the treatment of greywater jefferson et al 2000 these can be categorized as physical chemical biological or a combination of these systems ghunmi et al 2011 noutsopoulos et al 2018 ahmadi and ghanbari 2016 physical greywater treatment systems mainly remove suspended solids in the greywater via membrane or sand filters jefferson et al 2000 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 the main disadvantage associated with the physical treatment system is fouling which requires regular cleaning and replacement of the filters chemical treatment systems typically comprise coagulation and flocculation processes to remove colloids in greywater barzegar et al 2019 the former involves the process of combining colloidal particles into larger particulates whereas the latter involves the addition of polymers to form even larger flocs pidou et al 2007 either process enhances the settlement of solids since the bigger their size the greater their settling velocity tchobanoglous et al

capable of removing biodegradable materials and stabilizing the organics in a controlled manner jefferson et al 2000 ghunmi et al 2010 in aerobic processes microbes utilize dissolved oxygen supplied via aeration to degrade the organic compounds mondal et al 2017 this process can achieve a higher removal efficiency of soluble organic compounds and produce well flocculated biomass to generate effluent with a lower pollutant concentration in the absence of aeration and hence oxygen in anaerobic processes the microbes on the other hand digest the organic compounds and convert them into biogas and other end products with high energy content hanum et al 2019 which can then be harnessed for power generation ward et al 2008 as such and given the low energy consumption and production of excess sludge low construction operation and maintenance costs as well as small space area requirements anaerobic processes are essentially cost effective sustainable and environmentally safe appels et al 2011 muhammad nasir et al 2012 nevertheless deficiencies associated with this process exist which if circumvented can increase its attractiveness and efficiency for instance the effluent from the anaerobic process might not be suitable for direct discharge in some cases thus necessitating post treatment additionally a longer process duration is often required in order to achieve higher removal efficiencies hence the development of various techniques to increase microbial activity in anaerobic sludge have been explored xie et al 2009 for example reported a study in which low intensity ultrasound was applied during anaerobic treatment of sludge under 0 2 w cm2 intensity of ultrasound at 35 khz over 10 min they found an increase in biological activity of the sludge resulting in an enhancement of the removal efficiency based on chemical oxygen demand cod from 87 9 in the control experiment in the absence of ultrasound to 91 5 the initial influent cod concentration was approximately 10 837 mg ‚Ñì 336 mg ‚Ñì similarly zhu et al 2015 observed that 10 min application of low energy 0 1 w m ‚Ñì ultrasound at 20 khz on anaerobic sludge with an initial cod concentration of approximately 1000 mg ‚Ñì 32 mg ‚Ñì and subsequently agitating the treated mixture on a shaking table with its temperature controlled at 30 c over 8 h can further enhance anaerobic sludge bioactivity such that the cod removal efficiency increased from 74 4 to 87 3 the difference in the enhancement of removal efficiency between the study conducted by xie et al 2009 and zhu et al 2015 can partly be attributed to the difference in the influent cod concentration parenthetically we note that the cod concentration for influent from countries such as the uk spain germany india and pakistan is usually below 600 mg ‚Ñì oteng peprah et al 2018 nevertheless these studies suggest that ultrasonic stimulation at frequencies f 10 4 hz can increase removal efficiency although the improvement achieved to date appears to be modest higher ultrasonic intensities over shorter exposure durations have been found to stimulate the microbial sludge due to its ability to enhance cell membrane permeability pitt and ross 2003 and microbial enzyme activity chisti 2003 the increase in metabolic activity being attributed to the activation of the cells defence response to the mechanical shear caused by acoustic cavitation induced by the ultrasound lin and wu 2002 however exposing the sludge to longer durations of ultrasonic excitation has been found to result in cell lysis and disintegration of the sludge zhang et al 2007 in this work we investigate the enhancement in greywater treatment using surface acoustic waves saws nanometer amplitude high frequency electromechanical rayleigh waves friend and yeo 2011 with the end goal of enhancing anaerobic greywater treatment besides the distinction of being localized on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate it is generated as opposed to propagating in bulk media in conventional ultrasound the 10 100 mhz order saw is also considerably higher in frequency than the 10 100 khz order frequencies associated with typical ultrasonic excitation to date saws have been employed for cell patterning sorting shi et al 2009 franke et al 2010 meng et al 2011 nam et al 2011 bussonni√®re et al 2014 guo et al 2015 smith et al

microfluidic devices yeo and friend 2014 destgeer and sung 2015 go et al 2017 without detriment to their structural or functional viability given that the saws we note that cell lysis has however been known to be effected under certain conditions taller et al 2015 salehi reyhani et al 2015 in themselves do not generate cavitation qi et al 2008 yeo and friend 2014 which is known to inflict considerable damage to cells interestingly dynamic cell culture under convective conditions driven by acoustic streaming induced by the saw has been demonstrated to increase cell proliferation by 36 compared to static cell cultures greco et al 2018 moreover saw excitation under low intensities has been shown to lead to a temporal but yet reversible structural reorganization of the lipids comprising the cell membrane resulting in an enhancement of their permeability whilst retaining the viability of the cells given the absence of pore formation or long term structural changes to the cell membrane ramesan et al 2018 nevertheless the effect of excitation at these frequencies on microbial systems to our best knowledge has yet to be studied let alone the use of saws for enhancing greywater biological treatment processes 2 experiments 2 1 setup the surface acoustic wave saw devices used consisted of a 128 rotated y cut x propagating single crystal lithium niobate linbo3 piezoelectric substrate roditi ltd london uk on which a focusing elliptical single phase unidirectional transducer fe spudt was photolithographically patterned to generate the saw a sinusoidal electric signal from a function generator afg1062 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and high frequency amplifier zhl 5w 1 mini circuits inc ny usa was applied to the fe spudt at a frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the transducer which in this work was set through the finger spacing and width at f saw 30 5 mhz to increase the efficiency of the system an amplitude modulation scheme similar to that previously reported ang et al 2016b 2017 was employed the total input electric power of the modulated signal to the saw device is then given by p e p c 1 m 2 2 wherein p c v c i c is the rms

tpp 0201 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and current p6022 tektronix inc beaverton or usa probes connected to an oscilloscope tds 2012c tektronix inc beaverton or usa in each experiment four saw devices were placed in a 25 m ‚Ñì beaker with dimensions of approximately 32 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height filled with a greywater sample the devices were positioned orthogonally to each other as shown in fig 1 a and c so as to ensure uniformity of the acoustic field transmitted into the sample the mixed culture bacteria that made up the microbial suspension in the sample were obtained from a wastewater treatment system in a local palm oil processing plant sime darby east oil mill carey island selangor malaysia we note that the microbial suspension consisted of a diversity of organisms and is hence not a monoculture fig 1 d shows a few sample images of the bacteria under field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi gmbh krefeld germany typically the mixed culture bacteria sludge composed of approximately 17 mixed bacteria and approximately 83 greywater before each experiment the bacteria were left to sediment for one day after which they were extracted and mixed with a new batch of controlled greywater produced by the washing of hands with a commercial facial exfoliating scrub face clay mask scrub freeman beauty beverly hills ca usa that consisted of polyethylene terephthalate pet beads see greywater sample a in section 2 2 for the complete composition list of materials in the facewash under running tap water to ensure consistency between each sample the amount of the facial scrub the duration of the washing and the amount of tap water were carefully controlled specifically 6 m ‚Ñì of mixed culture bacteria and 24 m ‚Ñì of greywater were extracted using a syringe and mixed in a 50 m ‚Ñì beaker at a ratio of 1 5 one part mixed culture bacteria in 5 parts greywater the resultant mixture was then extracted and separated into two 25 m ‚Ñì beakers with v gb 13 m ‚Ñì of sample in each beaker one sample was then treated with saw for 2 h whereas the other sample comprised the unexcited control over the same duration the height of the greywater in the beaker was approximately h w 17 6 mm before and after the 2 h treatment the two samples were stirred for approximately 3 s and subsequently left for 20 min to allow the mixed culture bacteria to settle the stratified product therefore consisted of two regions a greywater layer at the top and the mixed culture bacteria layer at the bottom see for example fig 1 b and c 250 Œº ‚Ñì was then extracted from the top layer without mixed culture bacteria of each sample using a micropipette and placed in a 1 5 m ‚Ñì microcentrifuge tube and left for another 2 h for further sedimentation prior to subsequent analysis of its content 2 2 sample analysis for all the collected samples total suspended solids tss measurements were conducted in accordance with the american public health association apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 briefly a blank sample cell was filled with 10 m ‚Ñì of deionized water cleaned externally using a delicate task wipe kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa and placed into the cell holder of a portable spectrophotometer dr2800 hach loveland co usa to calibrate the system at 0 mg ‚Ñì tss the experimental sample was then prepared by diluting the mixture in deionized water by 100 from which 10 m ‚Ñì was extracted into another sample cell and placed into the cell holder of the spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of its suspended solids measurements were conducted both before and after the treatment process tss removal efficiencies were calculated from r e tss i tss f tss i 100 in which tss i and tss f are the measured concentration of suspended solids before and after treatment respectively a higher value of r e based on the tss represents a lower amount of suspended solids in the greywater after treatment a parametric study on three system parameters electric power p e modulation frequency f m and modulation index m was then conducted to investigate the effect of the acoustic excitation on the efficiency of the process in order to further verify the improvement in the treated greywater with and without the saw excitation a similar study was also conducted using another common test chemical oxygen demand cod in which the amount of oxygen consumed by the samples due to decomposition of inorganic chemicals was measured under controlled conditions in accordance with standard methods published by the apha apha 2005 given the extensive nature of the cod analysis compared to the tss measurements we restricted the verification to four different levels of the acoustic wave intensity i e four p e values whilst keeping values for f m and m fixed we note that the cod is expressed in mg ‚Ñì and indicates the mass of oxygen consumed per liter of the greywater cod removal efficiencies were subsequently calculated using the same method as that based on the tss i e r e cod i cod f cod i 100 wherein codi and codf represent the initial and final cod values respectively a higher value of r e based on cod corresponding to a lower amount of organic compound in the greywater after treatment additionally we measured the difference in concentration of the bacteria sludge suspended in the greywater prior to and after treatment via uv vis absorption cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa at 668 nm this wavelength was identified based on the absorbance curve measured for the bacterial sludge in deionized water the mixture was diluted by a factor of 10 for the analysis from the corresponding absorption peaks associated with the mixed culture bacteria it was then possible to calculate the difference in their concentration before and after treatment from Œ¥abs abs i abs f abs i 100 wherein abs i and abs f represent the absorbance values before and after the treatment respectively given that both heating and acoustic streaming i e flow circulation are consequences of the thermoviscous absorption and subsequent dissipation of sound waves as they are transmitted through a liquid when the saw devices are partially submerged within it we simulate the effect of a similar magnitude of temperature increase and convective flow intensity on the greywater sample independently and in combination of both in the absence of the acoustic field in order to isolate its direct influence on the efficiency of the process this was done by measuring the removal efficiency r e when the same sample was subjected to direct heating or convection without the saw excitation by placing the sample on a hot plate and magnetic stirrer c mag hs7 ika cologne germany whose temperature and average velocity was adjusted to match that measured for the saw exposed sample for a given value of p e the velocity in both experiments being measured via particle tracking diatrack v3 03 semasopht australia vallotton et al 2017 from images of the flow acquired using a high speed video camera phantom pcc 2 2 vision research inc wayne nj usa to investigate the potential feasibility of implementing this technique we examine the tss removal efficiency for different greywater volumes and treatment durations varying each parameter at a time whilst holding the others fixed for constant values of p e f m and m finally to ensure a similar improvement can be obtained using the saw excitations for different greywater samples with different composition to that above henceforth referred to as greywater sample a we altered the test samples with two other commercial facial wash products a facewash that does not contain exfoliating beads greywater sample b garnier pureactive anti acne white l oreal jakarta indonesia and a facial scrub containing hydrated silica beads greywater sample c simple unilever london

and constitute the solution for the propagation of the sound wave in the liquid a finite difference time domain numerical scheme schr√∂der and scott 2000 was used to obtain solutions to these equations on a two dimensional rectilinear x 1 x 3 computational domain of dimension l w 32 mm h w 17 6 mm that constitutes the beaker s dimensions see fig 2 the grid spacing was set as Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x 3

to account for the attenuation of the saw along the substrate liquid interface i e along x 3 0 and x 3 l w due to leakage of its energy into the liquid we impose a characteristic attenuation length frommelt et al 2008 shilton et al 2014 which can be approximated as Œ± saw 0 45 Œª saw œÅ saw c saw œÅ 0 c 0 for transmission of the saw from the linbo3 substrate into water given c saw 3890 m s c 0

attenuation length is slightly longer than the distance over which the sound wave propagates across the beaker before it impinges on the opposing wall l ac see fig 2 c i e Œ± 1 l ac nonetheless the acoustic particle velocity magnitude of this sound wave has attenuated significantly to less than 20 of its initial magnitude we note that since the dimension of the liquid domain is significantly larger than the thickness of the viscous boundary layer i e l w h w Œ¥ v 2 Œº œÅ 0 œâ 1 2 for 30 mhz acoustic wave in water Œ¥ v 10 7 m viscous dissipation within the thin boundary layer adjacent to the substrate surfaces along x 3 0 and x 3 l w is insignificant and therefore can be neglected in the model additionally as can be seen in fig 1 d ii d iv for the samples containing the bacterial aggregates the spacing between the bacteria in a cluster is on the same order of magnitude of the boundary layer thickness and thus the sound waves are not expected to propagate as a consequence of viscous dissipation of the sound wave energy within the clusters themselves consequently the induced acoustic streaming flow within the bacteria clusters can be omitted as can be seen in fig 1 b iii and c iii after 2 h of treatment it can be seen that the height of the bacterial sludge in the sample in the absence of the saw irradiation h bs 4 8 mm is lower compared to that in the presence of the saw h bs 6 4 mm by comparing the height of the bacterial sludge to the height of the reflection location h ac 4 mm see fig 2 d we observe that h ac h bs indicating that the acoustic wave albeit one with lower amplitude due to viscous dissipation in the liquid can penetrate into the bacterial sludge layer to induce weak acoustic streaming which can subsequently lead to an increase in the height of bacterial sludge layer itself 4 results and discussion fig 3 a shows the effect of the saw irradiation on the tss removal efficiency r e in the greywater sample after 2 h compared to the unexposed control sample p e 0 wherein r e 3 57 we observe an approximate fivefold gain in r e with exposure to the saw with the modulation frequency and modulation index fixed at f m 1 khz and m 0 586 respectively with increasing p e to a peak value of r e 16 65 at p e 0 477 w without the saw irradiation we note this same level in removal efficiency could only be achieved in the control sample over 8 h fig 3 d therefore showing the effectiveness of the acoustic irradiation in enhancing greywater treatment from a rate and hence throughput perspective by 75 further increases in the acoustic intensity beyond p e 0 477 w however led to a decrease in the removal efficiency to ascertain if the change in the removal efficiency is a direct consequence of the saw excitation or indirectly due to the phenomena accompanying the saw irradiation of the greywater sample namely an increase in the temperature and or convective transport associated with the acoustic streaming in the liquid both of which increase with increasing p e we repeated the same experiments in the absence of the saw but on a hotplate to elevate the temperature to match the temperature increase due to the saw irradiation Œ¥ t ln 4 7 c or with a magnetic stirrer to match the convective velocity associated with the acoustic streaming generated by the saw irradiation u 0 1 mm s or the combination of both effects in the former we observe the removal efficiency of the directly heated sample on the hotplate r e 3 81 Œ¥ t ln 4 7 c and p e 0 to be very close to that of the control sample at room temperature r e 3 57 Œ¥ t ln 0 and p e 0 similarly the agitated sample at room temperature Œ¥ t ln 0 produced a significantly lower removal efficiency r e 1 96 u 0 1 mm s compared to that obtained under saw excitation r e 16 65 u dc 0 03 mm s and is in fact lower than that of the control sample in the presence of both effects the removal efficiency r e 2 08 is lower than that under saw excitation as such it is reasonable to assume that neither thermal or convective effects play a significant role in the enhancement of the removal efficiency and that the efficiency gain can be directly attributed to the saw irradiation of the sample closer examination of the suspension exposed to the saw excitation reveals the presence of bacteria aggregates or clusters that form in the greywater sample as shown in fig 4 a i see also the fe sem images of the clusters in fig 1 d although it should however be noted that the clusters in the fe sem images are smaller in size due to the process of transferring and drying the samples prior to imaging while typically present in the suspension prior to the treatment we note that the clusters which are quite heterogeneous in size with several that are relatively large up to a few cm are broken into smaller clusters that are considerably more uniform in size after 2 h treatment with the saw which can be lead to a more murky appearance of the solution as can be seen in fig 1 b iii and c iii the sizes of these bacteria clusters at varying excitation powers are shown in table 1 in the absence of the saw on the other hand there are an insignificant number of bacteria clusters suspended in the control solution after the 2 h treatment see fig 4 a ii more specifically we observe the average of the mean cluster size to be approximately œÜ bc 48 1 Œº m relatively independent of the value of p e f m and m the reduction in cluster size can be attributed to either dispersive effects arising due to acoustic streaming induced by the saw or due to the acoustic pressure field associated with the sound wave propagation in the liquid chu and apfel 1982 deagglomeration under the large pressures accompanying acoustic cavitation events can be discounted in this case as the saw field given its high mhz order frequencies does not give rise to such events even for large p e qi et al 2008 yeo and friend 2014 if acoustic streaming were to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the cluster size reduction and homogenization the average cluster size would decrease with increasing p e which we do not observe that the average of the mean cluster size is comparable with the sound wavelength in the liquid Œª f 49 Œº m 30 mhz instead suggests that the initial bacterial clusters are broken up by the acoustic radiation pressure associated with the sound wave propagation with an upper limitation of the cluster size imposed by the dimension of the maximum and minimum pressure zones which respectively coincide with the antinodes and nodes of the sound wave as illustrated in fig 4 c moreover this mechanism also explains the reason for the enhancement in the removal efficiency with increasing p e fig 3 a since higher acoustic intensities correspond to larger pressure amplitudes at the antinodes and hence more efficient homogenization and reduction in the cluster size which in turn increases the surface area to volume ratio and consequently facilitates more efficient digestion of the organic compounds by the bacteria beyond p e 0 477 w the subsequent decline in the removal efficiency to r e 8 26 at p e 0 971 w fig 3 a can be attributed to the onset and increasing intensity of acoustic streaming which while insufficient to cause deagglomeration of the clusters themselves under shear at these intensities can result in the recirculation of the existing clusters within the beaker given that the clusters can only be trapped and break up further if they are within the narrow acoustic beam of width w ac 18 Œª f which propagates at the rayleigh angle and decays exponentially away from the surface of the saw substrate fig 2 b the increasing acoustic streaming velocity with further increases in p e fig 4 b leads to more infrequent cluster size homogenization and reduction and consequently a reduction in removal efficiency this is because the clusters are more likely to translate under the recirculation flow in and out of the acoustic beam therefore reducing their time spent within the beam and hence the probability and hence efficiency of their breakup fig 3 b shows an increase in the removal efficiency as the modulation index is increased from m 0 376 to m 0 51 which can be attributed to the higher maximum magnitude of acoustic pressure p 1 max when the modulation is increased as illustrated in the inset of the figure therefore leading to more effective breakup of the bacterial clusters clumps as discussed above nevertheless a further increase leads to a reduction in the removal efficiency given that the acoustic streaming intensity also increases with increasing m ang et al 2016b which in turn reduces the residence time of the clusters within the acoustic beam and hence their probability of breakup a similar trend can be observed for the modulation frequency f m in which a commensurate increase in the removal efficiency is observed but plateaus or decreases slightly beyond approximately f m 1 khz see fig 3 c as illustrated in the figure inset increasing the modulation frequency reduces the time period between the two maxima t m f m 1 associated with the magnitude of the acoustic pressure p 1 max giving rise to more efficient bacteria cluster breakup beyond f m 1 khz however the change in the removal efficiency becomes statistically insignificant again due to the increase of the acoustic streaming velocity to further confirm the trend observed in fig 3 a wherein the removal efficiency was estimated based on the measured total suspended solids tss we estimated the removal efficiency under the same modulation frequency modulation index and treatment duration but based on the measured cod a measure of the capacity of the greywater to consume oxygen during the decomposition of organic matter for four different values of p e the results reported in table 2 reveal a similar qualitative enhancement of the process with the saw excitation whereby the cod removal efficiency is observed to increase to a maximum value of r e 29 03 at p e 0 477 w before decreasing again the uv vis absorbance measurements for the bacterial sludge layer extracted from the greywater sample in table 3 further show a larger increase in the absorbance reading for samples exposed to the saw approximately 3 3 and 9 6 for p e 0 164 w and 0 477 w respectively compared to an increase of approximately 1 5 for the control sample in the absence of the saw suggesting a more rapid increase in the density of the bacteria as a result of their increased consumption of waste in the greywater and hence higher removal efficiencies for samples exposed to the acoustic irradiation with greater greywater sample volumes v gb we observe the tss removal efficiency in fig 5 to decrease concomitantly at least if the beaker dimensions are maintained this is because the increased volume of the mixture in the beaker v gb can lead to a decrease in the proportion of the volume over which the saw energy propagates through the sample i e the ratio between the volume of the acoustic beams to that of the total sample volume is reduced and as such a larger proportion of the bacteria clusters lie outside the acoustic beam regions see for example the schematic in the inset of fig 5 in order for the removal efficiency to be maintained the number of devices needs to be increased such that the transmitted acoustic waves in the greywater can penetrate the bacterial sludge layer at the bottom i e the height of the location at which the sound wave reflects at the boundaries of the beaker should be smaller than the height of the bacterial sludge layer h ac h bs see figs 1 b and 2 d increasing the treatment duration by twofold can also be seen to further enhance the tss removal efficiency table 4 which can be attributed to more rapid growth of the bacterial sludge following exposure to the saw table 3 which leads to faster waste digestion by the bacteria moreover the results also indicate that the bacterial sludge is still functional after 4 h of saw exposure in stark contrast to treatment under khz order ultrasonic waves in which the treatment needs to be limited to a duration of just several minutes to avoid inflicting irreversible damage on the bacteria primarily due to cavitation zhang et al 2007 lin and wu 2002 the results in table 5 show similar improvements in the tss removal efficiency for all of the three greywater samples prepared using different facial wash products see the list in section 2 2 the largest increase in the removal efficiency was observed for the treatment of greywater sample c 14 23 which can be attributed to the presence of hydrated silica microparticles in the product given the large acoustic impedance difference between greywater and silica we expect a stronger secondary acoustic field to arise from the wave reflection and scattering off these particles which in turn produces wider acoustic beams see fig 2 that facilitate longer cluster residence times and hence greater probabilities for their breakup a lower enhancement in the removal efficiency for greywater sample a 13 08 which contains plastic polyethylene terephthalate microparticles that possess a smaller difference in the acoustic impedance with that of greywater whilst the removal efficiency is the lowest for greywater sample b 11 76 given that it does not contain any microparticles we note that the similar trend in the absolute values for the removal efficiencies across the three samples suggests that greywater sample c has the largest amount of organic compounds that can be digested by the bacteria whereas greywater sample b has the lowest the identification of these compounds is however beyond the scope of this work suggesting that the improvement in the removal efficiency due to acoustic exposure may be to some extent independent of the organic content finally we note from table 6 that the initial cod content cod i can have a significant effect on the level of enhancement in the treatment which could also explain the difference in the enhancement levels between the low intensity khz order ultrasound results of xie et al 2009 3 6 enhancement with cod i 10 837 mg ‚Ñì and zhu et al 2015 12 9 enhancement with cod i 1000 mg ‚Ñì discussed in the introduction in light of recent published data showing that typical cod and tss concentrations for influent from countries such as the uk spain germany india and pakistan are both below 600 mg ‚Ñì oteng peprah et al 2018 we note even higher gains in the removal efficiency at these low influent concentrations with the saw device of up to around 30 in the tss removal efficiency and 54 in the cod removal efficiency 5 conclusions we show that exposure of greywater samples to mhz order saws can lead to up to fivefold improvement in the efficiency of solids removal in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes the enhancement can be attributed to the homogenization and size reduction of bacterial clusters in the sample due to the acoustic pressure field within the acoustic beam that forms in the liquid when sound waves emanating from the saw are transmitted and propagate through the liquid thus increasing the surface area to volume ratio which consequentially allows for more efficient bacterial digestion of the organic compounds in the sample increasing the magnitudes of this acoustic pressure field within the acoustic beam or increasing the residence time that the bacterial clusters are exposed to this field in the acoustic beam the former through increasing the intensity input power of the sound wave transmitted into the sample for example and the latter through modulation of the acoustic signal therefore leads to an increase in the removal efficiency although this is observed to reach a maximum efficiency further increases in the power or modulation leads to a decrease in removal efficiency beyond this optimum due to the onset and increased intensity in the acoustic streaming which while providing a further mechanism for cluster deagglomeration drives the translation of the clusters themselves so that they spend less time within the acoustic beam where they are susceptible to breakup given the compact size and low cost and chipscale sizes of the saw device typically us 1 as well as the ability to be employed for longer treatment durations without inflicting damage to the bacteria these first results on the use of saws for wastewater treatment highlight their potential not just as portable treatment devices for use in the developing world but also their prospect for scale out through massive parallelization toward relevant throughputs for industrial scale wastewater treatment declaration of competing

18329,there is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation moreover proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies herein we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using mhz order surface acoustic waves saws a key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves compared to previous work on its lower frequency khz order bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment is the absence of cavitation which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria thus limiting the intensity and duration and hence the efficiency enhancement associated with the acoustic exposure in particular we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion alternatively the saw exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput given the low cost of the miniature chipscale platform these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large scale industrial wastewater

introduction water scarcity has been a significant issue that has over the years affected and continues to plague countries across the world due to population growth increased urbanisation mismanagement of water resources and climate change falkenmark 1990 arnell 1999 bouwer 2000 thousands of deaths occur each day in developing countries due to water shortage and inadequate sanitation facilities while in developed countries water wastage and water pollution are major concerns by 2025 it is estimated that up to half of the global population will encounter freshwater supply shortages juan et al 2016 as such there is an urgent need to tackle this crisis which is growing at an alarming rate one solution is the reuse of greywater wastewater generated from the kitchen bathroom and laundry excluding toilet water friedler 2004 which makes up approximately 70 of the total wastewater in a household and contains a lower level of organic compounds and microorganisms compared to domestic wastewater treated greywater can be reused for example for flushing toilets irrigation and other cleaning purposes and not only increases freshwater availability by decreasing its household consumption up to 43 reduction of freshwater usage in a household can be achieved oh et al 2018 but also reduce the volume of wastewater sent to a municipal treatment system many studies have reported various technologies for the treatment of greywater jefferson et al 2000 these can be categorized as physical chemical biological or a combination of these systems ghunmi et al 2011 noutsopoulos et al 2018 ahmadi and ghanbari 2016 physical greywater treatment systems mainly remove suspended solids in the greywater via membrane or sand filters jefferson et al 2000 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 the main disadvantage associated with the physical treatment system is fouling which requires regular cleaning and replacement of the filters chemical treatment systems typically comprise coagulation and flocculation processes to remove colloids in greywater barzegar et al 2019 the former involves the process of combining colloidal particles into larger particulates whereas the latter involves the addition of polymers to form even larger flocs pidou et al 2007 either process enhances the settlement of solids since the bigger their size the greater their settling velocity tchobanoglous et al 2004 despite physical and chemical treatment systems being widely used for greywater treatment they are often considered costly and have limited efficacy given the difficulty in reduce the concentration of organic compounds in the greywater to the desired level biological treatment systems on the other hand generally consist of aerobic and anaerobic processes gerardi 2006 which are capable of removing biodegradable materials and stabilizing the organics in a controlled manner jefferson et al 2000 ghunmi et al 2010 in aerobic processes microbes utilize dissolved oxygen supplied via aeration to degrade the organic compounds mondal et al 2017 this process can achieve a higher removal efficiency of soluble organic compounds and produce well flocculated biomass to generate effluent with a lower pollutant concentration in the absence of aeration and hence oxygen in anaerobic processes the microbes on the other hand digest the organic compounds and convert them into biogas and other end products with high energy content hanum et al 2019 which can then be harnessed for power generation ward et al 2008 as such and given the low energy consumption and production of excess sludge low construction operation and maintenance costs as well as small space area requirements anaerobic processes are essentially cost effective sustainable and environmentally safe appels et al 2011 muhammad nasir et al 2012 nevertheless deficiencies associated with this process exist which if circumvented can increase its attractiveness and efficiency for instance the effluent from the anaerobic process might not be suitable for direct discharge in some cases thus necessitating post treatment additionally a longer process duration is often required in order to achieve higher removal efficiencies hence the development of various techniques to increase microbial activity in anaerobic sludge have been explored xie et al 2009 for example reported a study in which low intensity ultrasound was applied during anaerobic treatment of sludge under 0 2 w cm2 intensity of ultrasound at 35 khz over 10 min they found an increase in biological activity of the sludge resulting in an enhancement of the removal efficiency based on chemical oxygen demand cod from 87 9 in the control experiment in the absence of ultrasound to 91 5 the initial influent cod concentration was approximately 10 837 mg ‚Ñì 336 mg ‚Ñì similarly zhu et al 2015 observed that 10 min application of low energy 0 1 w m ‚Ñì ultrasound at 20 khz on anaerobic sludge with an initial cod concentration of approximately 1000 mg ‚Ñì 32 mg ‚Ñì and subsequently agitating the treated mixture on a shaking table with its temperature controlled at 30 c over 8 h can further enhance anaerobic sludge bioactivity such that the cod removal efficiency increased from 74 4 to 87 3 the difference in the enhancement of removal efficiency between the study conducted by xie et al 2009 and zhu et al 2015 can partly be attributed to the difference in the influent cod concentration parenthetically we note that the cod concentration for influent from countries such as the uk spain germany india and pakistan is usually below 600 mg ‚Ñì oteng peprah et al 2018 nevertheless these studies suggest that ultrasonic stimulation at frequencies f 10 4 hz can increase removal efficiency although the improvement achieved to date appears to be modest higher ultrasonic intensities over shorter exposure durations have been found to stimulate the microbial sludge due to its ability to enhance cell membrane permeability pitt and ross 2003 and microbial enzyme activity chisti 2003 the increase in metabolic activity being attributed to the activation of the cells defence response to the mechanical shear caused by acoustic cavitation induced by the ultrasound lin and wu 2002 however exposing the sludge to longer durations of ultrasonic excitation has been found to result in cell lysis and disintegration of the sludge zhang et al 2007 in this work we investigate the enhancement in greywater treatment using surface acoustic waves saws nanometer amplitude high frequency electromechanical rayleigh waves friend and yeo 2011 with the end goal of enhancing anaerobic greywater treatment besides the distinction of being localized on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate it is generated as opposed to propagating in bulk media in conventional ultrasound the 10 100 mhz order saw is also considerably higher in frequency than the 10 100 khz order frequencies associated with typical ultrasonic excitation to date saws have been employed for cell patterning sorting shi et al 2009 franke et al 2010 meng et al 2011 nam et al 2011 bussonni√®re et al 2014 guo et al 2015 smith et al

microfluidic devices yeo and friend 2014 destgeer and sung 2015 go et al 2017 without detriment to their structural or functional viability given that the saws we note that cell lysis has however been known to be effected under certain conditions taller et al 2015 salehi reyhani et al 2015 in themselves do not generate cavitation qi et al 2008 yeo and friend 2014 which is known to inflict considerable damage to cells interestingly dynamic cell culture under convective conditions driven by acoustic streaming induced by the saw has been demonstrated to increase cell proliferation by 36 compared to static cell cultures greco et al 2018 moreover saw excitation under low intensities has been shown to lead to a temporal but yet reversible structural reorganization of the lipids comprising the cell membrane resulting in an enhancement of their permeability whilst retaining the viability of the cells given the absence of pore formation or long term structural changes to the cell membrane ramesan et al 2018 nevertheless the effect of excitation at these frequencies on microbial systems to our best knowledge has yet to be studied let alone the use of saws for enhancing greywater biological treatment processes 2 experiments 2 1 setup the surface acoustic wave saw devices used consisted of a 128 rotated y cut x propagating single crystal lithium niobate linbo3 piezoelectric substrate roditi ltd london uk on which a focusing elliptical single phase unidirectional transducer fe spudt was photolithographically patterned to generate the saw a sinusoidal electric signal from a function generator afg1062 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and high frequency amplifier zhl 5w 1 mini circuits inc ny usa was applied to the fe spudt at a frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the transducer which in this work was set through the finger spacing and width at f saw 30 5 mhz to increase the efficiency of the system an amplitude modulation scheme similar to that previously reported ang et al 2016b 2017 was employed the total input electric power of the modulated signal to the saw device is then given by p e p c 1 m 2 2 wherein p c v c i c is the rms

tpp 0201 tektronix inc beaverton or usa and current p6022 tektronix inc beaverton or usa probes connected to an oscilloscope tds 2012c tektronix inc beaverton or usa in each experiment four saw devices were placed in a 25 m ‚Ñì beaker with dimensions of approximately 32 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height filled with a greywater sample the devices were positioned orthogonally to each other as shown in fig 1 a and c so as to ensure uniformity of the acoustic field transmitted into the sample the mixed culture bacteria that made up the microbial suspension in the sample were obtained from a wastewater treatment system in a local palm oil processing plant sime darby east oil mill carey island selangor malaysia we note that the microbial suspension consisted of a diversity of organisms and is hence not a monoculture fig 1 d shows a few sample images of the bacteria under field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi gmbh krefeld germany typically the mixed culture bacteria sludge composed of approximately 17 mixed bacteria and approximately 83 greywater before each experiment the bacteria were left to sediment for one day after which they were extracted and mixed with a new batch of controlled greywater produced by the washing of hands with a commercial facial exfoliating scrub face clay mask scrub freeman beauty beverly hills ca usa that consisted of polyethylene terephthalate pet beads see greywater sample a in section 2 2 for the complete composition list of materials in the facewash under running tap water to ensure consistency between each sample the amount of the facial scrub the duration of the washing and the amount of tap water were carefully controlled specifically 6 m ‚Ñì of mixed culture bacteria and 24 m ‚Ñì of greywater were extracted using a syringe and mixed in a 50 m ‚Ñì beaker at a ratio of 1 5 one part mixed culture bacteria in 5 parts greywater the resultant mixture was then extracted and separated into two 25 m ‚Ñì beakers with v gb 13 m ‚Ñì of sample in each beaker one sample was then treated with saw for 2 h whereas the other sample comprised the unexcited control over the same duration the height of the greywater in the beaker was approximately h w 17 6 mm before and after the 2 h treatment the two samples were stirred for approximately 3 s and subsequently left for 20 min to allow the mixed culture bacteria to settle the stratified product therefore consisted of two regions a greywater layer at the top and the mixed culture bacteria layer at the bottom see for example fig 1 b and c 250 Œº ‚Ñì was then extracted from the top layer without mixed culture bacteria of each sample using a micropipette and placed in a 1 5 m ‚Ñì microcentrifuge tube and left for another 2 h for further sedimentation prior to subsequent analysis of its content 2 2 sample analysis for all the collected samples total suspended solids tss measurements were conducted in accordance with the american public health association apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 briefly a blank sample cell was filled with 10 m ‚Ñì of deionized water cleaned externally using a delicate task wipe kimtech kimberly clark worldwide inc irving tx usa and placed into the cell holder of a portable spectrophotometer dr2800 hach loveland co usa to calibrate the system at 0 mg ‚Ñì tss the experimental sample was then prepared by diluting the mixture in deionized water by 100 from which 10 m ‚Ñì was extracted into another sample cell and placed into the cell holder of the spectrophotometer to measure the concentration of its suspended solids measurements were conducted both before and after the treatment process tss removal efficiencies were calculated from r e tss i tss f tss i 100 in which tss i and tss f are the measured concentration of suspended solids before and after treatment respectively a higher value of r e based on the tss represents a lower amount of suspended solids in the greywater after treatment a parametric study on three system parameters electric power p e modulation frequency f m and modulation index m was then conducted to investigate the effect of the acoustic excitation on the efficiency of the process in order to further verify the improvement in the treated greywater with and without the saw excitation a similar study was also conducted using another common test chemical oxygen demand cod in which the amount of oxygen consumed by the samples due to decomposition of inorganic chemicals was measured under controlled conditions in accordance with standard methods published by the apha apha 2005 given the extensive nature of the cod analysis compared to the tss measurements we restricted the verification to four different levels of the acoustic wave intensity i e four p e values whilst keeping values for f m and m fixed we note that the cod is expressed in mg ‚Ñì and indicates the mass of oxygen consumed per liter of the greywater cod removal efficiencies were subsequently calculated using the same method as that based on the tss i e r e cod i cod f cod i 100 wherein codi and codf represent the initial and final cod values respectively a higher value of r e based on cod corresponding to a lower amount of organic compound in the greywater after treatment additionally we measured the difference in concentration of the bacteria sludge suspended in the greywater prior to and after treatment via uv vis absorption cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa at 668 nm this wavelength was identified based on the absorbance curve measured for the bacterial sludge in deionized water the mixture was diluted by a factor of 10 for the analysis from the corresponding absorption peaks associated with the mixed culture bacteria it was then possible to calculate the difference in their concentration before and after treatment from Œ¥abs abs i abs f abs i 100 wherein abs i and abs f represent the absorbance values before and after the treatment respectively given that both heating and acoustic streaming i e flow circulation are consequences of the thermoviscous absorption and subsequent dissipation of sound waves as they are transmitted through a liquid when the saw devices are partially submerged within it we simulate the effect of a similar magnitude of temperature increase and convective flow intensity on the greywater sample independently and in combination of both in the absence of the acoustic field in order to isolate its direct influence on the efficiency of the process this was done by measuring the removal efficiency r e when the same sample was subjected to direct heating or convection without the saw excitation by placing the sample on a hot plate and magnetic stirrer c mag hs7 ika cologne germany whose temperature and average velocity was adjusted to match that measured for the saw exposed sample for a given value of p e the velocity in both experiments being measured via particle tracking diatrack v3 03 semasopht australia vallotton et al 2017 from images of the flow acquired using a high speed video camera phantom pcc 2 2 vision research inc wayne nj usa to investigate the potential feasibility of implementing this technique we examine the tss removal efficiency for different greywater volumes and treatment durations varying each parameter at a time whilst holding the others fixed for constant values of p e f m and m finally to ensure a similar improvement can be obtained using the saw excitations for different greywater samples with different composition to that above henceforth referred to as greywater sample a we altered the test samples with two other commercial facial wash products a facewash that does not contain exfoliating beads greywater sample b garnier pureactive anti acne white l oreal jakarta indonesia and a facial scrub containing hydrated silica beads greywater sample c simple unilever london

and constitute the solution for the propagation of the sound wave in the liquid a finite difference time domain numerical scheme schr√∂der and scott 2000 was used to obtain solutions to these equations on a two dimensional rectilinear x 1 x 3 computational domain of dimension l w 32 mm h w 17 6 mm that constitutes the beaker s dimensions see fig 2 the grid spacing was set as Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x 3

surfaces of the acoustic radiators i e the saw devices 0 x 1 h w and x 3 0 left wall and x 3 l w right wall a sinusoidal boundary condition for the first order instantaneous acoustic velocity is

where œâ saw 2 œÄ f saw is the angular frequency k saw œâ saw c saw is the wavenumber c saw is the velocity of the saw on the linbo3 substrate and u x 1 u x 3 represents the peak amplitude of the saw to account for the attenuation of the saw along the substrate liquid interface i e along x 3 0 and x 3 l w due to leakage of its energy into the liquid we impose a characteristic attenuation length frommelt et al 2008 shilton et al 2014 which can be approximated as Œ± saw 0 45 Œª saw œÅ saw c saw œÅ 0 c 0 for transmission of the saw from the linbo3 substrate into water given c saw 3890 m s c 0

attenuation length is slightly longer than the distance over which the sound wave propagates across the beaker before it impinges on the opposing wall l ac see fig 2 c i e Œ± 1 l ac nonetheless the acoustic particle velocity magnitude of this sound wave has attenuated significantly to less than 20 of its initial magnitude we note that since the dimension of the liquid domain is significantly larger than the thickness of the viscous boundary layer i e l w h w Œ¥ v 2 Œº œÅ 0 œâ 1 2 for 30 mhz acoustic wave in water Œ¥ v 10 7 m viscous dissipation within the thin boundary layer adjacent to the substrate surfaces along x 3 0 and x 3 l w is insignificant and therefore can be neglected in the model additionally as can be seen in fig 1 d ii d iv for the samples containing the bacterial aggregates the spacing between the bacteria in a cluster is on the same order of magnitude of the boundary layer thickness and thus the sound waves are not expected to propagate as a consequence of viscous dissipation of the sound wave energy within the clusters themselves consequently the induced acoustic streaming flow within the bacteria clusters can be omitted as can be seen in fig 1 b iii and c iii after 2 h of treatment it can be seen that the height of the bacterial sludge in the sample in the absence of the saw irradiation h bs 4 8 mm is lower compared to that in the presence of the saw h bs 6 4 mm by comparing the height of the bacterial sludge to the height of the reflection location h ac 4 mm see fig 2 d we observe that h ac h bs indicating that the acoustic wave albeit one with lower amplitude due to viscous dissipation in the liquid can penetrate into the bacterial sludge layer to induce weak acoustic streaming which can subsequently lead to an increase in the height of bacterial sludge layer itself 4 results and discussion fig 3 a shows the effect of the saw irradiation on the tss removal efficiency r e in the greywater sample after 2 h compared to the unexposed control sample p e 0 wherein r e 3 57 we observe an approximate fivefold gain in r e with exposure to the saw with the modulation frequency and modulation index fixed at f m 1 khz and m 0 586 respectively with increasing p e to a peak value of r e 16 65 at p e 0 477 w without the saw irradiation we note this same level in removal efficiency could only be achieved in the control sample over 8 h fig 3 d therefore showing the effectiveness of the acoustic irradiation in enhancing greywater treatment from a rate and hence throughput perspective by 75 further increases in the acoustic intensity beyond p e 0 477 w however led to a decrease in the removal efficiency to ascertain if the change in the removal efficiency is a direct consequence of the saw excitation or indirectly due to the phenomena accompanying the saw irradiation of the greywater sample namely an increase in the temperature and or convective transport associated with the acoustic streaming in the liquid both of which increase with increasing p e we repeated the same experiments in the absence of the saw but on a hotplate to elevate the temperature to match the temperature increase due to the saw irradiation Œ¥ t ln 4 7 c or with a magnetic stirrer to match the convective velocity associated with the acoustic streaming generated by the saw irradiation u 0 1 mm s or the combination of both effects in the former we observe the removal efficiency of the directly heated sample on the hotplate r e 3 81 Œ¥ t ln 4 7 c and p e 0 to be very close to that of the control sample at room temperature r e 3 57 Œ¥ t ln 0 and p e 0 similarly the agitated sample at room temperature Œ¥ t ln 0 produced a significantly lower removal efficiency r e 1 96 u 0 1 mm s compared to that obtained under saw excitation r e 16 65 u dc 0 03 mm s and is in fact lower than that of the control sample in the presence of both effects the removal efficiency r e 2 08 is lower than that under saw excitation as such it is reasonable to assume that neither thermal or convective effects play a significant role in the enhancement of the removal efficiency and that the efficiency gain can be directly attributed to the saw irradiation of the sample closer examination of the suspension exposed to the saw excitation reveals the presence of bacteria aggregates or clusters that form in the greywater sample as shown in fig 4 a i see also the fe sem images of the clusters in fig 1 d although it should however be noted that the clusters in the fe sem images are smaller in size due to the process of transferring and drying the samples prior to imaging while typically present in the suspension prior to the treatment we note that the clusters which are quite heterogeneous in size with several that are relatively large up to a few cm are broken into smaller clusters that are considerably more uniform in size after 2 h treatment with the saw which can be lead to a more murky appearance of the solution as can be seen in fig 1 b iii and c iii the sizes of these bacteria clusters at varying excitation powers are shown in table 1 in the absence of the saw on the other hand there are an insignificant number of bacteria clusters suspended in the control solution after the 2 h treatment see fig 4 a ii more specifically we observe the average of the mean cluster size to be approximately œÜ bc 48 1 Œº m relatively independent of the value of p e f m and m the reduction in cluster size can be attributed to either dispersive effects arising due to acoustic streaming induced by the saw or due to the acoustic pressure field associated with the sound wave propagation in the liquid chu and apfel 1982 deagglomeration under the large pressures accompanying acoustic cavitation events can be discounted in this case as the saw field given its high mhz order frequencies does not give rise to such events even for large p e qi et al 2008 yeo and friend 2014 if acoustic streaming were to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the cluster size reduction and homogenization the average cluster size would decrease with increasing p e which we do not observe that the average of the mean cluster size is comparable with the sound wavelength in the liquid Œª f 49 Œº m 30 mhz instead suggests that the initial bacterial clusters are broken up by the acoustic radiation pressure associated with the sound wave propagation with an upper limitation of the cluster size imposed by the dimension of the maximum and minimum pressure zones which respectively coincide with the antinodes and nodes of the sound wave as illustrated in fig 4 c moreover this mechanism also explains the reason for the enhancement in the removal efficiency with increasing p e fig 3 a since higher acoustic intensities correspond to larger pressure amplitudes at the antinodes and hence more efficient homogenization and reduction in the cluster size which in turn increases the surface area to volume ratio and consequently facilitates more efficient digestion of the organic compounds by the bacteria beyond p e 0 477 w the subsequent decline in the removal efficiency to r e 8 26 at p e 0 971 w fig 3 a can be attributed to the onset and increasing intensity of acoustic streaming which while insufficient to cause deagglomeration of the clusters themselves under shear at these intensities can result in the recirculation of the existing clusters within the beaker given that the clusters can only be trapped and break up further if they are within the narrow acoustic beam of width w ac 18 Œª f which propagates at the rayleigh angle and decays exponentially away from the surface of the saw substrate fig 2 b the increasing acoustic streaming velocity with further increases in p e fig 4 b leads to more infrequent cluster size homogenization and reduction and consequently a reduction in removal efficiency this is because the clusters are more likely to translate under the recirculation flow in and out of the acoustic beam therefore reducing their time spent within the beam and hence the probability and hence efficiency of their breakup fig 3 b shows an increase in the removal efficiency as the modulation index is increased from m 0 376 to m 0 51 which can be attributed to the higher maximum magnitude of acoustic pressure p 1 max when the modulation is increased as illustrated in the inset of the figure therefore leading to more effective breakup of the bacterial clusters clumps as discussed above nevertheless a further increase leads to a reduction in the removal efficiency given that the acoustic streaming intensity also increases with increasing m ang et al 2016b which in turn reduces the residence time of the clusters within the acoustic beam and hence their probability of breakup a similar trend can be observed for the modulation frequency f m in which a commensurate increase in the removal efficiency is observed but plateaus or decreases slightly beyond approximately f m 1 khz see fig 3 c as illustrated in the figure inset increasing the modulation frequency reduces the time period between the two maxima t m f m 1 associated with the magnitude of the acoustic pressure p 1 max giving rise to more efficient bacteria cluster breakup beyond f m 1 khz however the change in the removal efficiency becomes statistically insignificant again due to the increase of the acoustic streaming velocity to further confirm the trend observed in fig 3 a wherein the removal efficiency was estimated based on the measured total suspended solids tss we estimated the removal efficiency under the same modulation frequency modulation index and treatment duration but based on the measured cod a measure of the capacity of the greywater to consume oxygen during the decomposition of organic matter for four different values of p e the results reported in table 2 reveal a similar qualitative enhancement of the process with the saw excitation whereby the cod removal efficiency is observed to increase to a maximum value of r e 29 03 at p e 0 477 w before decreasing again the uv vis absorbance measurements for the bacterial sludge layer extracted from the greywater sample in table 3 further show a larger increase in the absorbance reading for samples exposed to the saw approximately 3 3 and 9 6 for p e 0 164 w and 0 477 w respectively compared to an increase of approximately 1 5 for the control sample in the absence of the saw suggesting a more rapid increase in the density of the bacteria as a result of their increased consumption of waste in the greywater and hence higher removal efficiencies for samples exposed to the acoustic irradiation with greater greywater sample volumes v gb we observe the tss removal efficiency in fig 5 to decrease concomitantly at least if the beaker dimensions are maintained this is because the increased volume of the mixture in the beaker v gb can lead to a decrease in the proportion of the volume over which the saw energy propagates through the sample i e the ratio between the volume of the acoustic beams to that of the total sample volume is reduced and as such a larger proportion of the bacteria clusters lie outside the acoustic beam regions see for example the schematic in the inset of fig 5 in order for the removal efficiency to be maintained the number of devices needs to be increased such that the transmitted acoustic waves in the greywater can penetrate the bacterial sludge layer at the bottom i e the height of the location at which the sound wave reflects at the boundaries of the beaker should be smaller than the height of the bacterial sludge layer h ac h bs see figs 1 b and 2 d increasing the treatment duration by twofold can also be seen to further enhance the tss removal efficiency table 4 which can be attributed to more rapid growth of the bacterial sludge following exposure to the saw table 3 which leads to faster waste digestion by the bacteria moreover the results also indicate that the bacterial sludge is still functional after 4 h of saw exposure in stark contrast to treatment under khz order ultrasonic waves in which the treatment needs to be limited to a duration of just several minutes to avoid inflicting irreversible damage on the bacteria primarily due to cavitation zhang et al 2007 lin and wu 2002 the results in table 5 show similar improvements in the tss removal efficiency for all of the three greywater samples prepared using different facial wash products see the list in section 2 2 the largest increase in the removal efficiency was observed for the treatment of greywater sample c 14 23 which can be attributed to the presence of hydrated silica microparticles in the product given the large acoustic impedance difference between greywater and silica we expect a stronger secondary acoustic field to arise from the wave reflection and scattering off these particles which in turn produces wider acoustic beams see fig 2 that facilitate longer cluster residence times and hence greater probabilities for their breakup a lower enhancement in the removal efficiency for greywater sample a 13 08 which contains plastic polyethylene terephthalate microparticles that possess a smaller difference in the acoustic impedance with that of greywater whilst the removal efficiency is the lowest for greywater sample b 11 76 given that it does not contain any microparticles we note that the similar trend in the absolute values for the removal efficiencies across the three samples suggests that greywater sample c has the largest amount of organic compounds that can be digested by the bacteria whereas greywater sample b has the lowest the identification of these compounds is however beyond the scope of this work suggesting that the improvement in the removal efficiency due to acoustic exposure may be to some extent independent of the organic content finally we note from table 6 that the initial cod content cod i can have a significant effect on the level of enhancement in the treatment which could also explain the difference in the enhancement levels between the low intensity khz order ultrasound results of xie et al 2009 3 6 enhancement with cod i 10 837 mg ‚Ñì and zhu et al 2015 12 9 enhancement with cod i 1000 mg ‚Ñì discussed in the introduction in light of recent published data showing that typical cod and tss concentrations for influent from countries such as the uk spain germany india and pakistan are both below 600 mg ‚Ñì oteng peprah et al 2018 we note even higher gains in the removal efficiency at these low influent concentrations with the saw device of up to around 30 in the tss removal efficiency and 54 in the cod removal efficiency 5 conclusions we show that exposure of greywater samples to mhz order saws can lead to up to fivefold improvement in the efficiency of solids removal in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes the enhancement can be attributed to the homogenization and size reduction of bacterial clusters in the sample due to the acoustic pressure field within the acoustic beam that forms in the liquid when sound waves emanating from the saw are transmitted and propagate through the liquid thus increasing the surface area to volume ratio which consequentially allows for more efficient bacterial digestion of the organic compounds in the sample increasing the magnitudes of this acoustic pressure field within the acoustic beam or increasing the residence time that the bacterial clusters are exposed to this field in the acoustic beam the former through increasing the intensity input power of the sound wave transmitted into the sample for example and the latter through modulation of the acoustic signal therefore leads to an increase in the removal efficiency although this is observed to reach a maximum efficiency further increases in the power or modulation leads to a decrease in removal efficiency beyond this optimum due to the onset and increased intensity in the acoustic streaming which while providing a further mechanism for cluster deagglomeration drives the translation of the clusters themselves so that they spend less time within the acoustic beam where they are susceptible to breakup given the compact size and low cost and chipscale sizes of the saw device typically us 1 as well as the ability to be employed for longer treatment durations without inflicting damage to the bacteria these first results on the use of saws for wastewater treatment highlight their potential not just as portable treatment devices for use in the developing world but also their prospect for scale out through massive parallelization toward relevant throughputs for industrial scale wastewater treatment declaration of competing
