3115,investigating precipitation concentration pc is significant for a deeper understanding of the formation of floods and droughts taking a chinese region huaihe river basin hrb as the study area this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of annual seasonal pcs and their teleconnections with el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo specifically the daily and monthly precipitation data are employed to build two annual indices cid year and cim year and four seasonal pc indices the modified mann kendall test is used to identify the significant trends of pc indices besides the correlation test and cross wavelet transform are used to examine the relationship between cid year and cim year the spatiotemporal characteristics of pc indices and the teleconnections of pc indices with enso and pdo the results show that 1 cid year has a significantly positive correlation with cim year and shows a dominate downward trend across the hrb 2 the precipitation temporal distribution in winter and autumn is more variable and more irregular than that in spring and summer at the hrb 3 the annual and seasonal precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb become more variable and more irregular with increasing latitude and the downward trends of cid year and cim year tend to be more significant with increasing latitude and longitude 4 enso and pdo have potentially negative effects on the annual and seasonal pcs of hrb and their negative impacts on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north in the hrb and 5 compared with pdo enso has more pronounced negative impacts on seasonal pcs of the hrb and its negative impacts on summer pc and winter pc decrease and increase from west to east of hrb respectively these findings could provide a new perspective for understanding regional precipitation temporal distribution keywords precipitation concentration el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation cross wavelet transform mann kendall test data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation extremes have received widespread attention since they are closely related to droughts and floods and have profound effects on hydrology agriculture ecosystems and many aspects of human life such as mortality and morbidity and health trenberth 2011 wang et al 2013 ngo and horton 2015 papalexiou and montanari 2019 as global warming increases ipcc 2013 liu et al 2017 the water vapor carrying capacity of the atmosphere is enhanced leading to more frequent and intense extreme precipitation kumar 2013 wang et al 2019 observations and model simulations indicate a clear increasing trend of extreme precipitation events at global and regional scales over the past decades allan and soden 2008 min et al 2011 westra et al 2013 donat et al 2017 such trend is expected to continue with the continuous warming o gorman and schneider 2009 kopparla et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 in this context the changing patterns of precipitation structure have attracted particular attention e g huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 sahany et al 2018 serrano notivoli et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 which would provide a further insight into the hydrological response to climate change scientific disaster prevention and mitigation and efficient water resources management precipitation concentration pc defined as the temporal distribution of precipitation is the most important connotation describing precipitation structure rahman and islam 2019 it is a valid indicator to quantify and reflect the contribution of precipitation days with corresponding precipitation to the total precipitation yang et al 2020a in general a higher pc is more likely to cause droughts and floods huang et al 2016 guo et al 2020 furthermore it could be expressed not only by the heterogeneity of daily precipitation but also by the irregularity of monthly precipitation distribution currently the daily precipitation based pc index proposed by martin vide 2004 and the monthly precipitation based pc index presented by oliver 1980 have been widely used to capture regional pc and their spatiotemporal variation behaviors around the world suhaila and jemain 2012 benhamrouche et al 2015 huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 zheng et al 2017 serrano notivoli et al 2018 vyshkvarkova et al 2018 zamani et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b previous studies provide key insights for understanding the variation characteristics of pc at different temporal and regional scales however few studies have examined the relationship between the daily precipitation based and monthly precipitation based pc indices when they were co used to investigate the annual pc another issue related to pc is the relationships between pc and the potential influencing factors some studies royé and martin vide 2017 huang et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 amiri and gocić 2021 found significant variation characteristics of pc with geographical factors such as latitude b longitude l and altitude h many studies e g yin et al 2016 huang et al 2019 sarricolea et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020a mei et al 2022 have shown that pc is affected by large scale atmospheric circulation lsac factors such as the el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the north atlantic oscillation nao however most studies focused more on the potential effects of geographical factors on pc at the annual scale than at a smaller time scale such as the seasonal scale in particular the potential effects of geographic factors and lsac factors on pc have been investigated separately in the past but the variation characteristics of the potential effects of lsac factors on pc with geographic factors have rarely been studied therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the relationship between the daily precipitation based and monthly precipitation based pc indices in describing the annual pc 2 to reveal the potential effects of geographical factors on pc at annual and seasonal scales and 3 to capture the variation characteristics of the potential effects of lsac factors on pc with geographic factors 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the huaihe river basin hrb with a total area of 2 7 105 km2 was selected as the study area which is located between 111 55 121 20 e and 30 55 36 20 n the hrb is high in the west and low in the east but it is generally flat with low elevation the main stream of huaihe river originates from the north side of tongbai mountain and flows from west to east through henan anhui and jiangsu provinces to reach the yellow sea with a total length of 1000 km the hrb is located in the transition zone between semi arid and semi humid climates which is a typical climate change sensitive and ecologically fragile area in the eastern of china the annual precipitation 800 mm on average of the hrb is highly variable with wet years exceeding 1200 mm and dry years below 550 mm moreover the precipitation during a flood season june to september accounts for 50 60 of annual precipitation which easily results in a high frequency of droughts and floods in the hrb in china the hrb is one of the most important food production energy mineral and manufacturing bases playing an important role in the economic and social development however the hrb is prone to both floods and droughts he et al 2015 besides severe water pollution has prevented it from meeting the water needs for sustainable socioeconomic development zhai et al 2014 given the importance of water security further investigation is needed to understand the spatiotemporal variations of pc in the hrb and the potential influencing factors which is important for local water management and agricultural practices 2 2 data daily precipitation data 1960 2020 were collected from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration ncc cma for 29 meteorological stations in or around the hrb the geographical factors of the 29 meteorological stations are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 1 these stations are relatively evenly distributed in and around the hrb which could be used to detect the spatial characteristics of pc in the hrb moreover the daily precipitation data of the 29 stations have no missing values and had already been quality controlled by the ncc cma in order to investigate the teleconnections of pc of the hrb with the lsac factors enso and pdo we downloaded the monthly el nino 3 4 data climate indices monthly atmospheric and ocean time series physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov data climateindices list and the monthly pdo index data linear correlations in atmospheric seasonal monthly averages physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov data correlation based on the monthly el nino 3 4 and pdo index data the annual and seasonal enso pdo indices could be calculated specifically enso year enso spr enso sum enso aut and enso win separately denote the annual spring summer autumn and winter average enso indices and pdo year pdo spr pdo sum pdo aut and pdo win are the annual spring summer autumn and winter average pdo indices respectively 3 methodology 3 1 calculation of pc indices 3 1 1 daily precipitation based pc index the daily precipitation based pc index martin vide 2004 cid year is employed to evaluate the contribution of different precipitation classes to the total precipitation in a year the procedure of calculating cid year for a year is given as follows step 1 select all the wet days with daily precipitation of not less than 0 1 mm from the year step 2 find the minimum daily precipitation p min and the maximum daily precipitation p max in the wet days step 3 predetermine the precipitation class interval δp δp 1 mm and divide the wet days into m classes i e p min p min δp p min δp p min 2 δp p min m 2 δp p min m 1 δp p min m 1 δp where m is the maximum integer that is not larger than p max p min δp step 4 calculate the accumulative percentage of precipitation days to annual precipitation days ap days and the accumulative percentage of daily precipitation to annual precipitation ap amout from the minimum precipitation class to the maximum precipitation class step 5 fit ap days ap amount dots of all precipitation classes by the exponential lorenz curve martin vide 2004 expressed by 1 a p amount a a p days exp b a p days where a and b represent the parameters of the lorenz curve determined by the least squares method sarricolea et al 2019 step 6 as shown in fig 2 cid year is calculated by 2 ci d year 5000 s a 5000 where s a denotes the size of the area enclosed by the lorenz curve the horizontal axis and the line ap days 100 the value of cid year is between 0 and 1 and a high cid year value indicates that more precipitation concentrates in few wet days during the year huang et al 2016 3 1 2 monthly precipitation based pc indices the monthly precipitation based pc indices oliver 1980 are often utilized to describe the concentration degrees of total precipitation in a period a year or a season specially the monthly precipitation based pc indices for describing the seasonal pc include cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win which represent the spring summer autumn and winter pc indices respectively the seasonal pc indices are calculated by 3 ci m season 25 i 1 3 p i 2 i 1 3 p i 2 where cim season represents the cim spr cim sum cim aut or cim win pi i 1 3 denotes the precipitation of the ith month in a season the monthly precipitation based pc index cim year for describing the annual pc is given as 4 ci m year 100 i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 where pi i 1 12 denotes the precipitation of the ith month in a year the values of cim season and cim year are always higher than 8 3 and a high cim season cim year value indicates that the total precipitation is concentrated in a smaller period specially cim season 16 7 cim year 16 7 and cim season 25 cim year 25 separately denote that the total precipitation is concentrated in 1 2 and 1 3 of a period guo et al 2020 3 2 trend test mann kendall test is the most commonly used trend test method which has the advantage of being nonparametric and distribution free nevertheless significant autocorrelations in time series may seriously mislead trend test results based on the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 to reduce the impacts of autocorrelations the modified mann kendall mmk test developed by hamed and rao 1998 is employed to identify the significant trend of a time series the mmk test statistic hamed and rao 1998 khanmohammadi et al 2021 is built as 5 u mmk s k v s 6 v s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 7 k 1 12 n n 1 n 2 π j 1 n 1 n j n j 1 n j 2 arcsin ρ j 2 where u mmk is the mmk test statistic that follows the standard normal distribution s denotes the mann kendall test statistic khanmohammadi et al 2021 v s is the variance of s considering ties in a time series n represents the length of the time series m denotes the number of tied values ti is the number of ties for the i th value k is the correction factor of variance that takes significant autocorrelations into account and ρj is the j th order autocorrelation coefficient that is significant under the significance level α the trend is significant if u mmk u 1 α 2 where u 1 α 2 is the 1 α 2 quantile of the standard normal distribution otherwise the trend is not significant the j th order autocorrelation coefficient ρj in eq 7 should be significant otherwise let ρj 0 if it is not significant the autocorrelation test statistic khanmohammadi et al 2021 is expressed as 8 z 1 n j ρ j n j 1 where z is the test statistic that obeys the standard normal distribution under the significance level α ρj is significant if z u 1 α 2 otherwise ρj is not significant 3 3 correlation test and cross wavelet transform for the time series x and y with the same sample size of n it is supposed that their pearson correlation coefficient is r the significance test statistic of correlation between x and y is expressed as follows xie et al 2018 10 t n 2 r 1 r 2 where t is the test statistic that obeys the t distribution with the freedom degree of n 2 under the significance level α the correlation between x and y is significant if t t 1 α 2 n 2 where t 1 α 2 n 2 is the 1 α 2 quantile of the t distribution with the freedom degree of n 2 otherwise the correlation is not significant the correlation test is a convenient tool to detect the relationship of two different time series but cannot deeply reveal the relationship in both time and frequency domains this deficiency could be compensated by the cross wavelet transform which has been widely used to investigate physical connections between different meteorological and hydrological factors grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 xie et al 2018 in the study the cross wavelet transform is used to examine the relationship between different annual pc indices and the relationships between lsac factors and pc indices more details about the cross wavelet transform could be referred to grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 annual and seasonal pc indices of the hrb as can be seen from fig 3 a at each station in or around the hrb the fitting degree r 2 of the exponential lorenz curve to ap days ap amount dots is between 0 81 and 1 00 and the median value of fitting degree is about 0 98 therefore the exponential lorenz curve can well describe the relationship between the ap days and the ap amount in the hrb and it is reasonable to calculate the annual cid year for each station according to the exponential lorenz curve the differentiation of cim year is more obvious than that of cid year at measuring the pc of the hrb as shown in fig 3 b and c at each station in or around the hrb the median value of cid year ranges from 0 66 to 0 71 and the inter quartile range of cid year is between 0 04 and 0 08 while the median value of cim year locates between 12 2 and 21 6 and the inter quartile range of cim year variates from 2 5 to 8 0 the correlation coefficients between cid year and cim year at different stations are shown in fig 4 a the correlation coefficient at each station is significant under the 5 significance level and the correlation coefficient varies by station among the 29 stations the correlation coefficients at heifei station no 2 from low to high latitudes and chuxian station no 5 are the minimum value 0 25 and the maximum value 0 62 respectively thus the correlation between cid year and cim year is significant but not very strong when they are co used to describe the annual pc of the hrb taking hefei and chuxian stations as examples the cross wavelet transforms of cid year and cim year series are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively fig 4 b shows that cid year and cim year at hefei station have a significant resonance period rp of 6 7 years between 1978 and 1985 and cid year leads cim year by 1 2 years moreover cid year and cim year have a significant rp of 3 6 years between 1991 and 2003 and cid year changes from leading cim year by about 1 year to synchronizing with cim year at chuxian station as shown in fig 4 c cid year and cim year have an obvious 4 5 years rp during 1982 1987 and a distinct rp of no more than 5 years during 2006 2012 besides cid year and cim year change almost synchronously during 1982 1987 and 2006 2012 at chuxian station therefore the consistency of cid year and cim year changes is stronger for chuxian station than for hefei station nevertheless cid year and cim year do not change synchronously throughout the whole time domain 1960 2020 at chuxian station the statistical results of seasonal pc indices of the hrb are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that at the 29 meteorological stations the median values of cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win are located at 9 2 11 8 9 3 11 2 10 5 13 1 and 9 8 14 3 respectively besides the inter quartile ranges of cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win are 1 3 4 5 1 4 3 8 2 6 6 6 and 1 9 9 2 respectively overall the median values inner quartile ranges are cim sum cim spr cim aut and cim win in ascending order indicating that the winter and autumn pcs are higher and more variable than the spring and summer pcs in the hrb 4 2 spatiotemporal variations of the pc of the hrb the correlations between the means ex variances dx of six pc indices cid year cim year cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win and geographical factors of the hrb are shown in table 2 from table 2 it could be seen that there exist significant correlations between the means variances of six pc indices and geographical factors under the 5 significance level specifically the means of the six pc indices have positive correlations with latitude of the hrb the mean of cim win is negatively correlated with longitude the means of cim year cim spr and cim win have positive correlations with altitude the variances of four indices cim year cim spr cim aut and cim win is positively correlated with latitude the variance of cim win is negatively correlated with longitude moreover the variances of cim spr and cim win are positively and negatively correlated with altitude respectively the mmk test statistic u mmk values of annual pc indices cid year and cim year at different meteorological stations in or around the hrb are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 a c it can be seen that u mmk values of cid year are negative at 28 stations except for huoshan station no 1 and more than half of the 29 stations have u mmk values which are significant under the 5 significance level moreover u mmk value of cid year has a significant downward trend with the growth of longitude but has no significant trend with increasing altitude as shown in fig 6 d f at the 5 significance level u mmk values of cid year are not significant at the 29 stations and u mmk of cid year decreases significantly with increasing geographical factors except for altitude as a result there is a clear downward trend in cid year for most stations and this downward trend is increasingly evident from west to east in the hrb meanwhile the trend of cim year is not significant across stations but the decreasing trend of cim year becomes clearer from southwest to northeast in the hrb fig 7 displays u mmk values of seasonal pc indices cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win at the 29 stations in or around the hrb as can be seen from fig 7 a c u mmk value of cim spr is not significant and has no significant trends with increasing geographical factors in fig 7 d f u mmk values of cim sum at only three of 29 stations are significant and u mmk value of cim sum has no significant trend with growing geographical factors as shown in fig 7 g i u mmk value of cim aut is similar to that of cim spr in significance and spatial distribution across the hrb it can be seen from fig 7 j l that only one u mmk value of cim win is significant and there is no significant change in u mmk value of cim win with increasing geographical factors in general there are no clear trends in the seasonal pc indices and the trends in seasonal pc indices are not significantly related to geographical factors in the hrb 4 3 teleconnections of pc of the hrb with the lsac factors the correlation coefficients r between the annual lsac indices and the annual pc indices of the 29 stations in the hrb are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a c the r values between enso year and cid year are smaller than zero at 22 stations and the r values between pdo year and cid year are less than zero at 27 stations the r values between enso year and cid year are significant at four stations and the r values between pdo year and cid year are significant at 11 stations under the 5 significance level in addition there is no significant trend in the r values between cid year and enso year pdo year with increasing geographical factors under the 5 significance level from fig 8 d f it can be observed that the r values between enso year and cim year are smaller than zero at 17 stations and the r values between pdo year and cim year are less than zero at the 29 stations the r values between enso year and cim year are significant at two stations and the r values between pdo year and cim year are significant at five stations besides the r values between cim year and enso year pdo year are significantly and negatively correlated with latitude by and large there is a negative correlation between the annual pc of the hrb and enso pdo and the negative correlation tends to be significant from the south to the north of the hrb the cross wavelet transforms of the annual lsac index series and the annual pc index series of the hrb are displayed in fig 9 fig 9 a shows that enso year and cid year have a significant 3 5 years rp and a significant 1 3 years rp during 1995 2004 and 2010 2019 respectively cid year varies in anti phase with enso year from 1995 to 2004 and in phase with enso year between 2010 and 2019 fig 9 b illustrates that enso year and cim year have four significant rps i e 1 4 years rp during 1963 1970 2 3 years rp during 1989 1998 4 6 years rp during 1995 2008 and 13 14 years rp during 2001 2015 during 1963 1970 cim year is in phase with enso year while in the other three stages it varies almost inversely with enso year in fig 9 c pdo year and cid year have a significant 4 5 years rp during 1995 2003 and cid year is in anti phase with pdo year as shown in fig 9 d pdo year and cim year have three significant rps i e 3 6 years rp during 1993 2005 11 12 years rp during 2005 2019 and 5 6 years rp during 2011 2017 at the three stages cim year basically changes inversely with pdo year as seen in fig 9 the annual pc indices of the hrb have clear relationships with the annual lsac indices in some periods and the annual pc indices change in anti phase with the annual lsac indices in most cases in addition the relationships between the lsac indices and cim year are more pronounced than the relationships between the lsac indices and cid year the correlation coefficients between the seasonal lsac indices and the seasonal pc indices of the 29 stations in the hrb are shown in fig 10 from fig 10 a c it can be seen that the r values between enso spr pdo spr and cim spr are smaller than zero at 27 25 stations and the r values between enso spr pdo spr and cim spr are significant at five three stations under the 5 significance level as shown in fig 10 d f the r values between enso sum pdo sum and cim sum are less than zero at 21 19 stations and the r values between enso sum pdo sum and cim sum are significant at two four stations besides the r values between cim sum and enso sum pdo sum are significantly and positively correlated with longitude of the hrb fig 10 g i show that the r values between enso aut pdo aut and cim aut are smaller than zero at 29 17 stations and the r values between enso aut pdo aut and cim aut are significant at four zero stations it can also be seen that the r values between cim aut and enso aut pdo aut are not significantly correlated with the geographical factors of the hrb as shown in fig 10 j l the r values between enso win pdo win and cim win are less than zero at 29 24 stations and the r values between enso win pdo win and cim win are significant at five zero stations in addition the r values between cim win and enso win are significantly and negatively correlated with longitude of the hrb on the whole the seasonal pcs of the hrb are negatively correlated with enso pdo and the negative correlations between the seasonal pcs and enso pdo are influenced to some extent by geographical factors except for altitude fig 11 exhibits the cross wavelet transforms of the seasonal lsac index series and the seasonal pc index series of the hrb as shown in fig 11 a d cim spr and enso spr have three rps i e the 13 14 years rp during 1980 2007 the 3 6 years rp during 1983 1989 and the 2 7 years rp during 1997 2011 cim sum and enso sum have two rps i e the 1 5 years rp during 1964 1993 and the 12 13 years rp during 1990 2013 cim aut and enso aut have three rps i e the 4 6 years rp during 1973 1986 the 2 4 years rp during 1992 2000 and the 2 3 years rp during 2009 2014 cim win and enso win have two rps i e the 12 14 years rp during 1994 2016 and the 2 4 years rp during 2010 2017 from fig 11 e h it can be seen that cim spr and pdo spr have three significant rps i e the 2 3 years rp during 1983 1988 the 8 9 years rp during 1996 2011 and the 6 7 years rp during 2003 2010 cim sum and pdo sum have two significant rps i e the 2 4 years rp during 1984 1993 and the 11 12 years rp during 1996 2014 cim aut and pdo aut have no significant rp over the whole time domain cim win and pdo win have two significant rps i e 1 2 years rp during 1968 1971 and the 12 18 years rp during 1999 2020 overall the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal lsac indices have many significant rps and the seasonal pc indices basically change in anti phase with the lsac indices in addition the relationships between the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal enso indices are more remarkable than those between the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal pdo indices in the hrb 5 discussion 5 1 relationship of two annual pc indices and the trend of annual pc the two annual pc indices cid year and cim year are calculated from daily and monthly precipitation data respectively oliver 1980 martin vide 2004 many studies e g huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2020b utilized cid year and cim year to capture the intra annual precipitation distribution characteristics of many regions but did not clearly explain the relationship between the two annual pc indices and the necessity of co using the two indices to describe the annual pc of a region according to the calculation approaches of cid year and cim year it could be known that cid year and cim year reflect the concentration extents of annual precipitation in a small number of days and a few months respectively fig 4 a shows that the correlation between cid year and cim year is significant at the 5 significance level for the 29 stations in or around the hrb moreover fig 4 b c indicate that the changes of cid year and cim year are basically in phase therefore the concentration of annual precipitation on a small number of days tends to cause the concentration of annual precipitation over a few months nevertheless the difference between cid year and cim year should not be neglected fig 4 a also shows that the correlation between cid year and cim year is not as strong as expected in describing the pc of the hrb since the correlation coefficient of each station is less than 0 65 in addition as shown in fig 6 cid year has a significant downward trend at more than half of the stations in or around the hrb while there are no significant trends in cim year at all stations therefore it is essential to employ both cid year and cim year to investigate the intra annual precipitation distribution characteristics of the same regions since the cid year and cim year describe the annual pc in daily and monthly scales respectively this study suggests that there is a dominant decreasing trend of cid year across the hrb which is consistent with the results of huang et al 2019 as a result daily precipitation in the hrb is more evenly distributed throughout the year besides it indicates that the frequency of high intensity precipitation tends to decrease across the hrb which was also supported by wang et al 2017 who found that the number of days with heavy precipitation had a slow downward trend in the hrb in the context of global warming the significant warming trend was also observed in the hrb sun et al 2018 but the extreme precipitation events did not show a significant trend in the basin wang et al 2017 thus the decreasing trend of cid year in hrb implies that warming climate does not necessarily trigger extreme precipitation events 5 2 potential impacts of geographical factors on pc as shown in table 2 the means of annual and seasonal pc indices have significant and positive correlations with the latitude showing that the annual and seasonal precipitation become more concentrated with increasing latitude in the hrb yin et al 2021 investigated the annual pc through gini coefficient that is similar to the cid year their study showed that the mean of the gini coefficient increases from low to high latitudes which indicated that the annual precipitation became more concentrated with increasing latitude this phenomenon could be also found in many other watersheds and regions in southern china huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 however royé and martin vide 2017 argued that in the contiguous united states the higher latitude the lower annual pc sarricolea et al 2019 held that the annual pc in central southern chile had significant and negative correlations with southern latitude and western longitude in addition amiri and gocić 2021 suggested that in serbia the annual and seasonal pcs had significantly negative correlation with altitude and the pc of serbia was significantly and positively correlated with latitude in spring and autumn and with longitude in summer and autumn their findings had both similarities and differences with the results of this study therefore geographical factors significantly affect the annual and seasonal pcs but their impacts differ from region to region using spatial analysis yin et al 2021 concluded that the standard deviation of the gini coefficient decreased from the southwest to the northeast in the hrb implying that the dispersion degree of annual pc diminished with increasing latitude and longitude however gu et al 2010 suggested that the interannual variability of pc in the northern part of the hrb was greater than that in the southern part by investigating the unevenness coefficient and concentration degree of intraannual precipitation this study adds something else to the results of gu et al 2010 and yin et al 2021 in particular by means of the correlation tests it found that the variation of cid year had no significant correlations with geographical factors nevertheless the variations of cim year cim spr cim aut and cim win significantly increase with increasing latitude in the hrb implying that floods and droughts were more likely to occur in the northern part of the hrb the potential effect of latitude on pc of the hrb may be related to the spatial distribution of solar radiant energy as seen in fig 1 the hrb is located north of the tropic of cancer thus the hrb receives less solar radiation energy from south to north correspondingly as shown in table 2 the mean variance values of annual and seasonal pc indices increase with increasing latitude furthermore the solar radiation energy reaching the hrb decreases when the position of direct solar radiation shifts from the northern to the southern hemisphere under this circumstance as shown in fig 5 the median values inner quartile ranges of cim aut and cim win are larger than those of cim spr and cim sum hence the precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb tends to be more variable and more irregular with the decline of solar radiation energy nevertheless the mechanism of the effect of solar radiation energy on pc still needs further studies in fig 6 the downward trend of annual pc in the hrb tends to be clearer with increasing longitude combining with fig 1 it could be known that from west to east of the hrb the geographic locations of meteorological stations are getting closer to the pacific ocean whose strong water vapor supply and temperature regulation capability sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 may have a significant weakening effect on the annual pc of the hrb in addition the hrb is located in the east asian monsoon region huang et al 2019 and the variation of its pc with longitude is closely related to the influence of the east asian monsoon as seen in table 2 the mean and variation values of the winter pc index have significant and negative correlations with longitude implying that under the dry and cold east asian winter monsoon the winter pc is more severe and more variable from east to west of the hrb 5 3 links of pc with lsac factors many studies found that at the annual scale pc is closely related to lsac factors such as enso and pdo but their relationship varies from place to place even at different locations within the same region basin for example sarricolea et al 2019 concluded that the increase in cid year of the central southern chile was linked to the warm phase of pdo wang et al 2019 thought that pdo was negatively correlated with the cid year in most regions of northeast china in contrast to enso yang et al 2020a demonstrated that pdo and enso had significant and negative correlations with the annual pc in the major river basins of central asia mei et al 2021 found that in the yangtze river delta enso had significant and positive correlation with the cid year and the relationship between pdo and cid year was not significant in addition to these studies this survey not only investigated the potential effects of enso and pdo on pc at the annual and seasonal scales but also explored the spatial characteristics of the potential effects of the two lsac factors on pc as can be seen from fig 8 11 the annual and seasonal pcs of the hrb show mainly negative correlations with enso and pdo indicating that the annual and seasonal precipitation of hrb tends to show a more uniform uneven temporal distribution during the warm cold phase of enso and pdo guo et al 2020 held that the variation of drought was significantly and positively correlated with cid year and cim year cim season yao et al 2021 found that an important drought cycle of hrb was concentrated in the 1990s when the negative correlations between annual pc and the two lsac factors were significant and the changes of the two lsac factors were in a warm phase yao et al 2021 also concluded that enso had a stronger effect on the drought of the hrb than pdo which is consistent with a finding of this study that the seasonal pc of hrb is more significantly related to enso than its relationship with pdo in addition wang et al 2022 analyzed the summer water vapor change characteristics of china during the development of enso and found that during the warm phase of enso the hrb belongs to the water vapor dissipation zone it can be seen that enso and pdo have potential negative impacts on the regional pc while the negative impact of enso is relatively more prominent and subsequently affects the formation of drought as can be seen in figs 8 and 10 the potential negative effects of enso and pdo on the annual and seasonal pcs in the hrb have notable spatial distribution patterns specifically in the hrb the negative impacts of the two lsac factors on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north and the negative effects on the summer pc obviously weaken from west to east showing that the annual precipitation in the north and summer precipitation in the west tend to be more uniform concentrated during the warm cold phase of the two lsac factors unlike summer the negative impact of enso on winter pc markedly increases from west to east indicating that winter precipitation in the east of the hrb tend to be more uniform concentrated during the warm cold phase of enso in addition it is also worth mentioning that the effects of enso and pdo on the pc of the hrb are hardly disturbed by the altitude mainly because the relatively flat and low topography does not significantly affect the horizontal water vapor transport in the hrb 6 conclusions the pc affects the formation of regional floods and droughts and even ecological environments which has attracted more and more attention from the hydrological community in order to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns and the potential influencing factors of pc cid year and cim year were co used to study the annual pc and cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win were used to represent the spring summer autumn and winter pcs respectively the mmk test is used to identify significant trends of pc indices besides the correlation test and cross wavelet transform are utilized to examine the relationship between cid year and cim year the relationships between annual seasonal pcs and geographical factors and the teleconnections of annual seasonal pcs with two lsac factors enso and pdo taking the hrb as the study area the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the two annual pc indices of the hrb cid year and cim year have a significant and positive correlation showing that the concentration of annual precipitation on a small number of days tends to cause the concentration of annual precipitation over few months in the hrb 2 there is a dominant downward trend of cid year across the hrb indicating that the frequency of high intensity precipitation tends to decrease across the hrb however the monthly precipitation based indices cim year cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win have no significant trends in addition the precipitation temporal distribution in winter and autumn is more variable and more irregular than that in spring and summer at the hrb 3 the annual and seasonal precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb become more variable and more irregular with increasing latitude indicating that the annual and seasonal precipitation is increasingly concentrated in few days months and tends to be more uncertain moreover the downward trends of cid year and cim year tend to be more significant with increasing latitude and longitude and the non significant trends of seasonal pc indices are also not significantly associated with geographical factors in the hrb 4 the annual and seasonal pcs of the hrb are potentially negatively affected by enso and pdo with distinct spatial distribution patterns specifically the negative impacts of the two lsac factors on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north in the hrb moreover enso has more pronounced potential negative impacts on seasonal pcs in the hrb and its negative impacts on summer pc and winter pc decrease and increase from west to east of hrb respectively credit authorship contribution statement yangyang xie methodology formal

3115,investigating precipitation concentration pc is significant for a deeper understanding of the formation of floods and droughts taking a chinese region huaihe river basin hrb as the study area this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of annual seasonal pcs and their teleconnections with el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo specifically the daily and monthly precipitation data are employed to build two annual indices cid year and cim year and four seasonal pc indices the modified mann kendall test is used to identify the significant trends of pc indices besides the correlation test and cross wavelet transform are used to examine the relationship between cid year and cim year the spatiotemporal characteristics of pc indices and the teleconnections of pc indices with enso and pdo the results show that 1 cid year has a significantly positive correlation with cim year and shows a dominate downward trend across the hrb 2 the precipitation temporal distribution in winter and autumn is more variable and more irregular than that in spring and summer at the hrb 3 the annual and seasonal precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb become more variable and more irregular with increasing latitude and the downward trends of cid year and cim year tend to be more significant with increasing latitude and longitude 4 enso and pdo have potentially negative effects on the annual and seasonal pcs of hrb and their negative impacts on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north in the hrb and 5 compared with pdo enso has more pronounced negative impacts on seasonal pcs of the hrb and its negative impacts on summer pc and winter pc decrease and increase from west to east of hrb respectively these findings could provide a new perspective for understanding regional precipitation temporal distribution keywords precipitation concentration el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation cross

droughts and floods and have profound effects on hydrology agriculture ecosystems and many aspects of human life such as mortality and morbidity and health trenberth 2011 wang et al 2013 ngo and horton 2015 papalexiou and montanari 2019 as global warming increases ipcc 2013 liu et al 2017 the water vapor carrying capacity of the atmosphere is enhanced leading to more frequent and intense

et al 2013 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 in this context the changing patterns of precipitation structure have attracted particular attention e g huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 sahany et al 2018 serrano notivoli et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 which would provide a further insight into the hydrological response to climate change scientific disaster prevention and mitigation and efficient water resources management precipitation concentration pc defined as the temporal distribution of precipitation is the most important connotation describing precipitation structure rahman and islam 2019 it is a valid indicator to quantify and reflect the contribution of precipitation days with corresponding precipitation to the total precipitation yang et al 2020a in general a higher pc is more likely to cause droughts and floods huang et al 2016 guo et al 2020 furthermore it could be expressed not only by the heterogeneity of daily precipitation but also by the irregularity of monthly precipitation distribution currently the daily precipitation based pc index proposed by martin vide 2004 and the monthly precipitation based pc index presented by oliver 1980 have been widely used to capture regional pc and their spatiotemporal variation behaviors around the world suhaila and jemain 2012 benhamrouche et al 2015 huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 zheng et al 2017 serrano notivoli et al 2018 vyshkvarkova et al 2018 zamani et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b previous studies provide key insights for understanding the variation characteristics of pc at different temporal and regional scales however few studies have examined the relationship between the daily precipitation based and monthly precipitation based pc indices when they were co used to investigate the annual pc another issue related to pc is the relationships between pc and the potential influencing factors some studies royé and martin vide 2017 huang et al 2018 sarricolea et al 2019 amiri and gocić 2021 found significant variation characteristics of pc with geographical factors such as latitude b longitude l and altitude h many studies e g yin et al 2016 huang et al 2019 sarricolea et al 2019 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020a mei et al 2022 have shown that pc is affected by large scale atmospheric circulation lsac factors such as the el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the north atlantic oscillation nao however most studies focused more on the potential effects of geographical factors on pc at the annual scale than at a smaller time scale such as the seasonal scale in particular the potential effects of geographic factors and lsac factors on pc have been investigated separately in the past but the variation characteristics of the potential effects of lsac factors on pc with geographic factors have rarely been studied therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the relationship between the daily precipitation based and monthly precipitation based pc indices in describing the annual pc 2 to reveal the potential effects of geographical factors on pc at annual and seasonal scales and 3 to capture the variation characteristics of the potential effects of lsac factors on pc with geographic factors 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the huaihe river basin hrb with a total area of 2 7 105 km2 was selected as the study area which is located between 111 55 121 20 e and 30 55 36 20 n the hrb is high in the west and low in the east but it is generally flat with low elevation the main stream of huaihe river originates from the north side of tongbai mountain and flows from west to east through henan anhui and jiangsu provinces to reach the yellow sea with a total length of 1000 km the hrb is located in the transition zone between semi arid and semi humid climates which is a typical climate change sensitive and ecologically fragile area in the eastern of china the annual precipitation 800 mm on average of the hrb is highly variable with wet years exceeding 1200 mm and dry years below 550 mm moreover the precipitation during a flood season june to september accounts for 50 60 of annual precipitation which easily results in a high frequency of droughts and floods in the hrb in china the hrb is one of the most important food production energy mineral and manufacturing bases playing an important role in the economic and social development however the hrb is prone to both floods and droughts he et al 2015 besides severe water pollution has prevented it from meeting the water needs for sustainable socioeconomic development zhai et al 2014 given the importance of water security further investigation is needed to understand the spatiotemporal variations of pc in the hrb and the potential influencing factors which is important for local water management and agricultural practices 2 2 data daily precipitation data 1960 2020 were collected from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration ncc cma for 29 meteorological stations in or around the hrb the geographical factors of the 29 meteorological stations are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 1 these stations are relatively evenly distributed in and around the hrb which could be used to detect the spatial characteristics of pc in the hrb moreover the daily precipitation data of the 29 stations have no missing values and had already been quality controlled by the ncc cma in order to investigate the teleconnections of pc of the hrb with the lsac factors enso and pdo we downloaded the monthly el nino 3 4 data climate indices monthly atmospheric and ocean time series physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov data climateindices list and the monthly pdo index data linear correlations in atmospheric seasonal monthly averages physical sciences laboratory https psl noaa gov data correlation based on the monthly el nino 3 4 and pdo index data the annual and seasonal enso pdo indices could be calculated specifically enso year enso spr enso sum enso aut and enso win separately denote the annual spring summer autumn and winter average enso indices and pdo year pdo spr pdo sum pdo aut and pdo win are the annual spring summer autumn and winter average pdo indices respectively 3 methodology 3 1 calculation of pc indices 3 1 1 daily precipitation based pc index the daily precipitation based pc index martin vide 2004 cid year is employed to evaluate the contribution of different precipitation classes to the total precipitation in a year the procedure of calculating cid year for a year is given as follows step 1 select all the wet days with daily precipitation of not less than 0 1 mm from the year step 2 find the minimum daily precipitation p min and the maximum daily precipitation p max in the wet days step 3 predetermine the precipitation class interval δp δp 1 mm and divide the wet days into m classes i e p min p min δp p min δp p min 2 δp p min m 2 δp p min m 1 δp p min m 1 δp where m is the maximum integer that is not larger than p max p min δp step 4 calculate the accumulative percentage of precipitation days to annual precipitation days ap days and the accumulative percentage of daily precipitation to annual precipitation ap amout from the minimum precipitation class to the maximum precipitation class step 5 fit ap days ap amount dots of all precipitation classes by the exponential lorenz curve martin vide 2004 expressed by 1 a p amount a a p days exp b a p days where a and b represent the parameters of the lorenz curve determined by the least squares method sarricolea et al 2019 step 6 as shown in fig 2 cid year is calculated by 2 ci d year 5000 s a 5000 where s a denotes the size of the area enclosed by the lorenz curve the horizontal axis and the line ap days 100 the value of cid year is between 0 and 1 and a high cid year value indicates that more precipitation concentrates in few wet days during the year huang et al 2016 3 1 2 monthly precipitation based pc indices the monthly precipitation based pc indices oliver 1980 are often utilized to describe the concentration degrees of total precipitation in a period a year or a season specially the monthly precipitation based pc indices for describing the seasonal pc include cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win which represent the spring summer autumn and winter pc indices respectively the seasonal pc indices are calculated by 3 ci m season 25 i 1 3 p i 2 i 1 3 p i 2 where cim season represents the cim spr cim sum cim aut or cim win pi i 1 3 denotes the precipitation of the ith month in a season the monthly precipitation based pc index cim year for describing the annual pc is given as 4 ci m year 100 i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 where pi i 1 12 denotes the precipitation of the ith month in a year the values of cim season and cim year are always higher than 8 3 and a high cim season cim year value indicates that the total precipitation is concentrated in a smaller period specially cim season 16 7 cim year 16 7 and cim season 25 cim year 25 separately denote that the total precipitation is concentrated in 1 2 and 1 3 of a period guo et al 2020 3 2 trend test mann kendall test is the most commonly used trend test method which has the advantage of being nonparametric and distribution free nevertheless significant autocorrelations in time series may seriously mislead trend test results based on the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 to reduce the impacts of autocorrelations the modified mann kendall mmk test developed by hamed and rao 1998 is employed to identify the significant trend of a time series the mmk test statistic hamed and rao 1998 khanmohammadi et al 2021 is built as 5 u mmk s k v s 6 v s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 7 k 1 12 n n 1 n 2 π j 1 n 1 n j n j 1 n j 2 arcsin ρ j 2 where u mmk is the mmk test statistic that follows the standard normal distribution s denotes the mann kendall test statistic khanmohammadi et al 2021 v s is the variance of s considering ties in a time series n represents the length of the time series m denotes the number of tied values ti is the number of ties for the i th value k is the correction factor of variance that takes significant autocorrelations into account and ρj is the j th order autocorrelation coefficient that is significant under the significance level α the trend is significant if u mmk u 1 α 2 where u 1 α 2 is the 1 α 2 quantile of the standard normal distribution otherwise the trend is not significant the j th order autocorrelation coefficient ρj in eq 7 should be significant otherwise let ρj 0 if it is not significant the autocorrelation test statistic khanmohammadi et al 2021 is expressed as 8 z 1 n j ρ j n j 1 where z is the test statistic that obeys the standard normal distribution under the significance level α ρj is significant if z u 1 α 2 otherwise ρj is not significant 3 3 correlation test and cross wavelet transform for the time series x and y with the same sample size of n it is supposed that their pearson correlation coefficient is r the significance test statistic of correlation between x and y is expressed as follows xie et al 2018 10 t n 2 r 1 r 2 where t is the test statistic that obeys the t distribution with the freedom degree of n 2 under the significance level α the correlation between x and y is significant if t t 1 α 2 n 2 where t 1 α 2 n 2 is the 1 α 2 quantile of the t distribution with the freedom degree of n 2 otherwise the correlation is not significant the correlation test is a convenient tool to detect the relationship of two different time series but cannot deeply reveal the relationship in both time and frequency domains this deficiency could be compensated by the cross wavelet transform which has been widely used to investigate physical connections between different meteorological and hydrological factors grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 xie et al 2018 in the study the cross wavelet transform is used to examine the relationship between different annual pc indices and the relationships between lsac factors and pc indices more details about the cross wavelet transform could be referred to grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 annual and seasonal pc indices of the hrb as can be seen from fig 3 a at each station in or around the hrb the fitting degree r 2 of the exponential lorenz curve to ap days ap amount dots is between 0 81 and 1 00 and the median value of fitting degree is about 0 98 therefore the exponential lorenz curve can well describe the relationship between the ap days and the ap amount in the hrb and it is reasonable to calculate the annual cid year for each station according to the exponential lorenz curve the differentiation of cim year is more obvious than that of cid year at measuring the pc of the hrb as shown in fig 3 b and c at each station in or around the hrb the median value of cid year ranges from 0 66 to 0 71 and the inter quartile range of cid year is between 0 04 and 0 08 while the median value of cim year locates between 12 2 and 21 6 and the inter quartile range of cim year variates from 2 5 to 8 0 the correlation coefficients between cid year and cim year at different stations are shown in fig 4 a the correlation coefficient at each station is significant under the 5 significance level and the correlation coefficient varies by station among the 29 stations the correlation coefficients at heifei station no 2 from low to high latitudes and chuxian station no 5 are the minimum value 0 25 and the maximum value 0 62 respectively thus the correlation between cid year and cim year is significant but not very strong when they are co used to describe the annual pc of the hrb taking hefei and chuxian stations as examples the cross wavelet transforms of cid year and cim year series are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively fig 4 b shows that cid year and cim year at hefei station have a significant resonance period rp of 6 7 years between 1978 and 1985 and cid year leads cim year by 1 2 years moreover cid year and cim year have a significant rp of 3 6 years between 1991 and 2003 and cid year changes from leading cim year by about 1 year to synchronizing with cim year at chuxian station as shown in fig 4 c cid year and cim year have an obvious 4 5 years rp during 1982 1987 and a distinct rp of no more than 5 years during 2006 2012 besides cid year and cim year change almost synchronously during 1982 1987 and 2006 2012 at chuxian station therefore the consistency of cid year and cim year changes is stronger for chuxian station than for hefei station nevertheless cid year and cim year do not change synchronously throughout the whole time domain 1960 2020 at chuxian station the statistical results of seasonal pc indices of the hrb are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that at the 29 meteorological stations the median values of cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win are located at 9 2 11 8 9 3 11 2 10 5 13 1 and 9 8 14 3 respectively besides the inter quartile ranges of cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win are 1 3 4 5 1 4 3 8 2 6 6 6 and 1 9 9 2 respectively overall the median values inner quartile ranges are cim sum cim spr cim aut and cim win in ascending order indicating that the winter and autumn pcs are higher and more variable than the spring and summer pcs in the hrb 4 2 spatiotemporal variations of the pc of the hrb the correlations between the means ex variances dx of six pc indices cid year cim year cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win and geographical factors of the hrb are shown in table 2 from table 2 it could be seen that there exist significant correlations between the means variances of six pc indices and geographical factors under the 5 significance level specifically the means of the six pc indices have positive correlations with latitude of the hrb the mean of cim win is negatively correlated with longitude the means of cim year cim spr and cim win have positive correlations with altitude the variances of four indices cim year cim spr cim aut and cim win is positively correlated with latitude the variance of cim win is negatively correlated with longitude moreover the variances of cim spr and cim win are positively and negatively correlated with altitude respectively the mmk test statistic u mmk values of annual pc indices cid year and cim year at different meteorological stations in or around the hrb are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 a c it can be seen that u mmk values of cid year are negative at 28 stations except for huoshan station no 1 and more than half of the 29 stations have u mmk values which are significant under the 5 significance level moreover u mmk value of cid year has a significant downward trend with the growth of longitude but has no significant trend with increasing altitude as shown in fig 6 d f at the 5 significance level u mmk values of cid year are not significant at the 29 stations and u mmk of cid year decreases significantly with increasing geographical factors except for altitude as a result there is a clear downward trend in cid year for most stations and this downward trend is increasingly evident from west to east in the hrb meanwhile the trend of cim year is not significant across stations but the decreasing trend of cim year becomes clearer from southwest to northeast in the hrb fig 7 displays u mmk values of seasonal pc indices cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win at the 29 stations in or around the hrb as can be seen from fig 7 a c u mmk value of cim spr is not significant and has no significant trends with increasing geographical factors in fig 7 d f u mmk values of cim sum at only three of 29 stations are significant and u mmk value of cim sum has no significant trend with growing geographical factors as shown in fig 7 g i u mmk value of cim aut is similar to that of cim spr in significance and spatial distribution across the hrb it can be seen from fig 7 j l that only one u mmk value of cim win is significant and there is no significant change in u mmk value of cim win with increasing geographical factors in general there are no clear trends in the seasonal pc indices and the trends in seasonal pc indices are not significantly related to geographical factors in the hrb 4 3 teleconnections of pc of the hrb with the lsac factors the correlation coefficients r between the annual lsac indices and the annual pc indices of the 29 stations in the hrb are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a c the r values between enso year and cid year are smaller than zero at 22 stations and the r values between pdo year and cid year are less than zero at 27 stations the r values between enso year and cid year are significant at four stations and the r values between pdo year and cid year are significant at 11 stations under the 5 significance level in addition there is no significant trend in the r values between cid year and enso year pdo year with increasing geographical factors under the 5 significance level from fig 8 d f it can be observed that the r values between enso year and cim year are smaller than zero at 17 stations and the r values between pdo year and cim year are less than zero at the 29 stations the r values between enso year and cim year are significant at two stations and the r values between pdo year and cim year are significant at five stations besides the r values between cim year and enso year pdo year are significantly and negatively correlated with latitude by and large there is a negative correlation between the annual pc of the hrb and enso pdo and the negative correlation tends to be significant from the south to the north of the hrb the cross wavelet transforms of the annual lsac index series and the annual pc index series of the hrb are displayed in fig 9 fig 9 a shows that enso year and cid year have a significant 3 5 years rp and a significant 1 3 years rp during 1995 2004 and 2010 2019 respectively cid year varies in anti phase with enso year from 1995 to 2004 and in phase with enso year between 2010 and 2019 fig 9 b illustrates that enso year and cim year have four significant rps i e 1 4 years rp during 1963 1970 2 3 years rp during 1989 1998 4 6 years rp during 1995 2008 and 13 14 years rp during 2001 2015 during 1963 1970 cim year is in phase with enso year while in the other three stages it varies almost inversely with enso year in fig 9 c pdo year and cid year have a significant 4 5 years rp during 1995 2003 and cid year is in anti phase with pdo year as shown in fig 9 d pdo year and cim year have three significant rps i e 3 6 years rp during 1993 2005 11 12 years rp during 2005 2019 and 5 6 years rp during 2011 2017 at the three stages cim year basically changes inversely with pdo year as seen in fig 9 the annual pc indices of the hrb have clear relationships with the annual lsac indices in some periods and the annual pc indices change in anti phase with the annual lsac indices in most cases in addition the relationships between the lsac indices and cim year are more pronounced than the relationships between the lsac indices and cid year the correlation coefficients between the seasonal lsac indices and the seasonal pc indices of the 29 stations in the hrb are shown in fig 10 from fig 10 a c it can be seen that the r values between enso spr pdo spr and cim spr are smaller than zero at 27 25 stations and the r values between enso spr pdo spr and cim spr are significant at five three stations under the 5 significance level as shown in fig 10 d f the r values between enso sum pdo sum and cim sum are less than zero at 21 19 stations and the r values between enso sum pdo sum and cim sum are significant at two four stations besides the r values between cim sum and enso sum pdo sum are significantly and positively correlated with longitude of the hrb fig 10 g i show that the r values between enso aut pdo aut and cim aut are smaller than zero at 29 17 stations and the r values between enso aut pdo aut and cim aut are significant at four zero stations it can also be seen that the r values between cim aut and enso aut pdo aut are not significantly correlated with the geographical factors of the hrb as shown in fig 10 j l the r values between enso win pdo win and cim win are less than zero at 29 24 stations and the r values between enso win pdo win and cim win are significant at five zero stations in addition the r values between cim win and enso win are significantly and negatively correlated with longitude of the hrb on the whole the seasonal pcs of the hrb are negatively correlated with enso pdo and the negative correlations between the seasonal pcs and enso pdo are influenced to some extent by geographical factors except for altitude fig 11 exhibits the cross wavelet transforms of the seasonal lsac index series and the seasonal pc index series of the hrb as shown in fig 11 a d cim spr and enso spr have three rps i e the 13 14 years rp during 1980 2007 the 3 6 years rp during 1983 1989 and the 2 7 years rp during 1997 2011 cim sum and enso sum have two rps i e the 1 5 years rp during 1964 1993 and the 12 13 years rp during 1990 2013 cim aut and enso aut have three rps i e the 4 6 years rp during 1973 1986 the 2 4 years rp during 1992 2000 and the 2 3 years rp during 2009 2014 cim win and enso win have two rps i e the 12 14 years rp during 1994 2016 and the 2 4 years rp during 2010 2017 from fig 11 e h it can be seen that cim spr and pdo spr have three significant rps i e the 2 3 years rp during 1983 1988 the 8 9 years rp during 1996 2011 and the 6 7 years rp during 2003 2010 cim sum and pdo sum have two significant rps i e the 2 4 years rp during 1984 1993 and the 11 12 years rp during 1996 2014 cim aut and pdo aut have no significant rp over the whole time domain cim win and pdo win have two significant rps i e 1 2 years rp during 1968 1971 and the 12 18 years rp during 1999 2020 overall the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal lsac indices have many significant rps and the seasonal pc indices basically change in anti phase with the lsac indices in addition the relationships between the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal enso indices are more remarkable than those between the seasonal pc indices and the seasonal pdo indices in the hrb 5 discussion 5 1 relationship of two annual pc indices and the trend of annual pc the two annual pc indices cid year and cim year are calculated from daily and monthly precipitation data respectively oliver 1980 martin vide 2004 many studies e g huang et al 2016 royé and martin vide 2017 sarricolea et al 2019 guo et al 2020 yang et al 2020b utilized cid year and cim year to capture the intra annual precipitation distribution characteristics of many regions but did not clearly explain the relationship between the two annual pc indices and the necessity of co using the two indices to describe the annual pc of a region according to the calculation approaches of cid year and cim year it could be known that cid year and cim year reflect the concentration extents of annual precipitation in a small number of days and a few months respectively fig 4 a shows that the correlation between cid year and cim year is significant at the 5 significance level for the 29 stations in or around the hrb moreover fig 4 b c indicate that the changes of cid year and cim year are basically in phase therefore the concentration of annual precipitation on a small number of days tends to cause the concentration of annual precipitation over a few months nevertheless the difference between cid year and cim year should not be neglected fig 4 a also shows that the correlation between cid year and cim year is not as strong as expected in describing the pc of the hrb since the correlation coefficient of each station is less than 0 65 in addition as shown in fig 6 cid year has a significant downward trend at more than half of the stations in or around the hrb while there are no significant trends in cim year at all stations therefore it is essential to employ both cid year and cim year to investigate the intra annual precipitation distribution characteristics of the same regions since the cid year and cim year describe the annual pc in daily and monthly scales respectively this study suggests that there is a dominant decreasing trend of cid year across the hrb which is consistent with the results of huang et al 2019 as a result daily precipitation in the hrb is more evenly distributed throughout the year besides it indicates that the frequency of high intensity precipitation tends to decrease across the hrb which was also supported by wang et al 2017 who found that the number of days with heavy precipitation had a slow downward trend in the hrb in the context of global warming the significant warming trend was also observed in the hrb sun et al 2018 but the extreme precipitation events did not show a significant trend in the basin wang et al 2017 thus the decreasing trend of cid year in hrb implies that warming climate does not necessarily trigger extreme precipitation events 5 2 potential impacts of geographical factors on pc as shown in table 2 the means of annual and seasonal pc indices have significant and positive correlations with the latitude showing that the annual and seasonal precipitation become more concentrated with increasing latitude in the hrb yin et al 2021 investigated the annual pc through gini coefficient that is similar to the cid year their study showed that the mean of the gini coefficient increases from low to high latitudes which indicated that the annual precipitation became more concentrated with increasing latitude this phenomenon could be also found in many other watersheds and regions in southern china huang et al 2018 huang et al 2019 however royé and martin vide 2017 argued that in the contiguous united states the higher latitude the lower annual pc sarricolea et al 2019 held that the annual pc in central southern chile had significant and negative correlations with southern latitude and western longitude in addition amiri and gocić 2021 suggested that in serbia the annual and seasonal pcs had significantly negative correlation with altitude and the pc of serbia was significantly and positively correlated with latitude in spring and autumn and with longitude in summer and autumn their findings had both similarities and differences with the results of this study therefore geographical factors significantly affect the annual and seasonal pcs but their impacts differ from region to region using spatial analysis yin et al 2021 concluded that the standard deviation of the gini coefficient decreased from the southwest to the northeast in the hrb implying that the dispersion degree of annual pc diminished with increasing latitude and longitude however gu et al 2010 suggested that the interannual variability of pc in the northern part of the hrb was greater than that in the southern part by investigating the unevenness coefficient and concentration degree of intraannual precipitation this study adds something else to the results of gu et al 2010 and yin et al 2021 in particular by means of the correlation tests it found that the variation of cid year had no significant correlations with geographical factors nevertheless the variations of cim year cim spr cim aut and cim win significantly increase with increasing latitude in the hrb implying that floods and droughts were more likely to occur in the northern part of the hrb the potential effect of latitude on pc of the hrb may be related to the spatial distribution of solar radiant energy as seen in fig 1 the hrb is located north of the tropic of cancer thus the hrb receives less solar radiation energy from south to north correspondingly as shown in table 2 the mean variance values of annual and seasonal pc indices increase with increasing latitude furthermore the solar radiation energy reaching the hrb decreases when the position of direct solar radiation shifts from the northern to the southern hemisphere under this circumstance as shown in fig 5 the median values inner quartile ranges of cim aut and cim win are larger than those of cim spr and cim sum hence the precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb tends to be more variable and more irregular with the decline of solar radiation energy nevertheless the mechanism of the effect of solar radiation energy on pc still needs further studies in fig 6 the downward trend of annual pc in the hrb tends to be clearer with increasing longitude combining with fig 1 it could be known that from west to east of the hrb the geographic locations of meteorological stations are getting closer to the pacific ocean whose strong water vapor supply and temperature regulation capability sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 may have a significant weakening effect on the annual pc of the hrb in addition the hrb is located in the east asian monsoon region huang et al 2019 and the variation of its pc with longitude is closely related to the influence of the east asian monsoon as seen in table 2 the mean and variation values of the winter pc index have significant and negative correlations with longitude implying that under the dry and cold east asian winter monsoon the winter pc is more severe and more variable from east to west of the hrb 5 3 links of pc with lsac factors many studies found that at the annual scale pc is closely related to lsac factors such as enso and pdo but their relationship varies from place to place even at different locations within the same region basin for example sarricolea et al 2019 concluded that the increase in cid year of the central southern chile was linked to the warm phase of pdo wang et al 2019 thought that pdo was negatively correlated with the cid year in most regions of northeast china in contrast to enso yang et al 2020a demonstrated that pdo and enso had significant and negative correlations with the annual pc in the major river basins of central asia mei et al 2021 found that in the yangtze river delta enso had significant and positive correlation with the cid year and the relationship between pdo and cid year was not significant in addition to these studies this survey not only investigated the potential effects of enso and pdo on pc at the annual and seasonal scales but also explored the spatial characteristics of the potential effects of the two lsac factors on pc as can be seen from fig 8 11 the annual and seasonal pcs of the hrb show mainly negative correlations with enso and pdo indicating that the annual and seasonal precipitation of hrb tends to show a more uniform uneven temporal distribution during the warm cold phase of enso and pdo guo et al 2020 held that the variation of drought was significantly and positively correlated with cid year and cim year cim season yao et al 2021 found that an important drought cycle of hrb was concentrated in the 1990s when the negative correlations between annual pc and the two lsac factors were significant and the changes of the two lsac factors were in a warm phase yao et al 2021 also concluded that enso had a stronger effect on the drought of the hrb than pdo which is consistent with a finding of this study that the seasonal pc of hrb is more significantly related to enso than its relationship with pdo in addition wang et al 2022 analyzed the summer water vapor change characteristics of china during the development of enso and found that during the warm phase of enso the hrb belongs to the water vapor dissipation zone it can be seen that enso and pdo have potential negative impacts on the regional pc while the negative impact of enso is relatively more prominent and subsequently affects the formation of drought as can be seen in figs 8 and 10 the potential negative effects of enso and pdo on the annual and seasonal pcs in the hrb have notable spatial distribution patterns specifically in the hrb the negative impacts of the two lsac factors on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north and the negative effects on the summer pc obviously weaken from west to east showing that the annual precipitation in the north and summer precipitation in the west tend to be more uniform concentrated during the warm cold phase of the two lsac factors unlike summer the negative impact of enso on winter pc markedly increases from west to east indicating that winter precipitation in the east of the hrb tend to be more uniform concentrated during the warm cold phase of enso in addition it is also worth mentioning that the effects of enso and pdo on the pc of the hrb are hardly disturbed by the altitude mainly because the relatively flat and low topography does not significantly affect the horizontal water vapor transport in the hrb 6 conclusions the pc affects the formation of regional floods and droughts and even ecological environments which has attracted more and more attention from the hydrological community in order to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns and the potential influencing factors of pc cid year and cim year were co used to study the annual pc and cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win were used to represent the spring summer autumn and winter pcs respectively the mmk test is used to identify significant trends of pc indices besides the correlation test and cross wavelet transform are utilized to examine the relationship between cid year and cim year the relationships between annual seasonal pcs and geographical factors and the teleconnections of annual seasonal pcs with two lsac factors enso and pdo taking the hrb as the study area the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the two annual pc indices of the hrb cid year and cim year have a significant and positive correlation showing that the concentration of annual precipitation on a small number of days tends to cause the concentration of annual precipitation over few months in the hrb 2 there is a dominant downward trend of cid year across the hrb indicating that the frequency of high intensity precipitation tends to decrease across the hrb however the monthly precipitation based indices cim year cim spr cim sum cim aut and cim win have no significant trends in addition the precipitation temporal distribution in winter and autumn is more variable and more irregular than that in spring and summer at the hrb 3 the annual and seasonal precipitation temporal distribution of the hrb become more variable and more irregular with increasing latitude indicating that the annual and seasonal precipitation is increasingly concentrated in few days months and tends to be more uncertain moreover the downward trends of cid year and cim year tend to be more significant with increasing latitude and longitude and the non significant trends of seasonal pc indices are also not significantly associated with geographical factors in the hrb 4 the annual and seasonal pcs of the hrb are potentially negatively affected by enso and pdo with distinct spatial distribution patterns specifically the negative impacts of the two lsac factors on the annual pc significantly strengthen from south to north in the hrb moreover enso has more pronounced potential negative impacts on seasonal pcs in the hrb and its negative impacts on summer pc and winter pc decrease and increase from west to east of hrb respectively credit authorship contribution statement yangyang xie methodology formal

3116,the spatial temporal variation of dissolved organic matter dom influences contaminant biodegradation in natural water systems this study explored seasonal patterns of dom concentration and composition and the consequent effect on estrone e1 biodegradation in water columns at the northern bays of lake taihu during bloom seasons the increased concentration of autochthonous dom autodom with higher fresh humic ratios lower aromatics molecular weights and humification degrees exhibited a more substantial promotion on e1 biodegradation than the processed autodom after algal bloom meanwhile the inflow rivers imported high molecular weight humic like substances with strong aromaticity in flood seasons impairing the e1 biodegradation of affected regions end member mixing experiments further confirmed that the mixing of algal derived dom facilitated the mediation of river water derived dom in e1 biodegradation but microbial ageing reduced the promotive effect of autodom and resulted in a weak relationship between dom source indicators and e1 biodegradation a significant and positive correlation was further found between e1 biodegradation and dom bioreactivity p 0 001 both of which were well predicted by dom optical properties as predictor variables in partial least squares regression pls r modelling r 2 values of 0 78 and 0 90 respectively the ratio of fluorescence peak t and c was identified as the most effective predictor and suva254 and slope ratio s r were moderately influential factors controlling carbon normalized e1 biodegradation potential these results suggested that while algal blooms would likely cause enhanced biotransformation of estrogens in freshwater lakes the import of allochthonous dom or the microbially aged autodom with high molecular weight may lead to higher estrogen concentrations in post bloom seasons keywords algal bloom bioreactivity dissolved organic matter eem parafac emerging contaminant hydrological seasons 1 introduction as an essential component of the organic carbon pool in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems dissolved organic matter dom significantly affects the biogeochemical cycling of contaminants ma and yates 2018 sun et al 2021 the soluble organic compounds have a complex structure and chemodiversity due to aromatic groups with different degrees and types of substitution ma et al 2021 while dissolved humic and fulvic substances are considered to dominate aquatic dom nebbioso and piccolo 2013 the high sensitivity to local hydrogeochemical variations and regional biogeochemical variables resulted in the dynamic composition of dom huang et al 2022 in lake ecosystems the dom presented at 0 1 to 10 mg c l 1 consists of a mixture of allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous microbial sources asmala et al 2018 rainfalls of the upstream watershed lead to the increasing inflow runoff and the associated organic loadings into downstream linked lakes during flood seasons huang et al 2022 however the notably production and accumulation of autochthonous dom autodom are stimulated by the expanding eutrophication and algal blooms paul 2008 concurrently the variety of allochthonous and autochthonous sources is linked with dom bioreactivity that primes bacterial productivity in water columns asmala et al 2018 allochthonous dom allodom derived from the dissolution of soil organic matter and terrestrial plant remnants was relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation due to the abundant aromatic structures and high humic degrees inamdar et al 2011 in contrast the proteinaceous substances and carbohydrates derived from algal blooms exhibited a great bioreactivity of 79 bai et al 2017 the distinct resource partitioning of autodom and allodom impacts microbial growth metabolism and functions and therefore would induce changes in the biotransformation of contaminants song et al 2022 a recent study demonstrated that algal derived compounds improved the lake internal microbial activity and hence the biotransformation of hg in eutrophic shallow lakes lei et al 2021 steroid estrogens a representative group of endocrine disrupting chemicals are exclusively produced and released into the lake ecosystems through the sewage water discharge and landfill of municipal biosolids zhou et al 2016 due to their adverse effects on hormonal functions and community structures of aquatic organisms at extremely low concentrations van den belt et al 2004 understanding the environmental behaviour of estrogens is gaining extensive attention biodegradation is a major pathway influencing the presence of estrogens in water environments especially in low transparency water columns zhang et al 2016 because heterotrophic contaminant degrading microbes are also critical decomposers of organic substances zhang et al 2016 the dom can regulate biodegradation by constituting the supplementary carbon source horemans et al 2013 while dissolved organic carbon doc concentration is an essential factor driving estrogen biodegradation ma and yates 2018 the correlation between estrogen biodegradation potential ebp and doc concentration varies with dom compositions when studies cover diverse waters for example the lake water containing lower doc concentrations tended to show stronger estrogen biotransformation than wastewater effluent lee et al 2012 highlighting the complexity of dom mediation in diverse water systems our published works based on autodom end members revealed the inconstant responses of estrogen biodegradation to the algal and macrophytes derived dom with distinct biodegradability bai et al 2022 bai et al 2020 however there is little to no focus on the seasonal variations of dom and estrogen biodegradation in eutrophic lakes that can be strongly influenced by seasonal hydrogeochemical processes which leads to abundant terrigenous and autochthonous dom during the wet and algal bloom seasons but relatively strong in situ degradation in the dry and post bloom seasons cui et al 2021 in combination with optical parameters and indices the optically active fractions such as chromophoric dom cdom and fluorescent dom have been widely used as dom surrogates to characterize the origin and transformation of dom he et al 2021 ni and li 2020 moreover changes in optical spectra associated with dom variations are indicative of the concurrent effects on emerging contaminants in various environmental matrixes korshin et al 2018 so deciphering the relationships between dom optical parameters and estrogen biodegradation would improve the understanding of the causality behind dom and estrogen occurrence and evaluate the dom spectroscopic indices for predicting estrogen fate in aquatic systems lake taihu the important drinking water source in the yangtze river delta for a population of at least 10 million people living within its watershed qin et al 2010 has been influenced by seasonal cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms over the last decade shi et al 2019 the genuine algal and successive food web metabolites affect dom composition and concentration in the northern areas of lake taihu including zhushan bay zsb meiliang bay mlb and gonghu bay ghb zhang et al 2014 also these regions are influenced by terrestrial inputs from adjacent rivers such as the yincungang river wangyu river and chengdonggang river to a certain degree in wet seasons yao et al 2011 the dual sources of dom in these regions offer an excellent opportunity to follow real ecosystem dom dynamics and the associated variation of estrogen biodegradation according to the structure reactivity concept we 1 investigated the seasonal patterns of dom optical properties with absorbance and fluorescence spectra at the northern bays 2 quantified the ebp in seasonal dom samples and 3 explored the relationships between dom optical properties and ebp and the predictive factors besides the field investigations we performed end member mixing experiments to demonstrate the responses of ebp to autodom and allodom the natural estrone e1 a dominant metabolite of other estrogens was selected as the surrogate for ebp assessment due to its high concentration in surface waters zhang et al 2016 in a global context of projected higher frequency of algal blooms and increased terrigenous inputs the results of this study are essential for future predictions and controls of steroid estrogens in the affected regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection four sampling campaigns were conducted at the same sites n 9 in the northern regions of lake taihu from july 2018 to january 2019 fig 1 the surface water samples 0 30 cm were collected in glass bottles transferred on ice and filtered through 1 2 and 0 22 μm glass fibre filter pre combusted upon arrival at the laboratory the filtered water samples were stored at 20 c before dom characterization and ebp bioassay the top 5 cm of sediment was also sampled at each site during the last sampling campaign in january 2019 to prepare the bacterial inoculum for bioassay bai et al 2022 briefly the sediments were mixed equally resuspended in milliq water and incubated overnight after the filtration and centrifugation of the slurry the bacterial pellet was collected washed repeatedly with 10 mm phosphate buffered saline and diluted to 9 1010 cells l expanded information is provided in supporting information si 2 2 bioassay of estrogen biodegradation potential in water samples after the last sampling campaign in january 2019 the ebp in all the collected water samples n 36 was determined simultaneously certain amounts of e1 redissolved in milli q water were spiked into a series of brown glass bottles containing the filtered water samples the selected e1 concentration of 50 μg l 1 was higher than its environmental concentration but crucial to revealing the relationships between dom characteristics and estrogen biodegradation gu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the bacterial inoculum was added to water samples to make a final concentration 1 0 109 cells l 1 the background nutrients were compensated by nitrogen and phosphate solutions to avoid the nutrient limitation ammonium nh4 n 35 μm nitrate no3 n 100 μm and phosphate po4 3 p 2 μm one set of bottles containing milliq water e1 and bacterial inoculum served as the control group another set of bottles containing only milliq water and e1 was performed to estimate the abiotic e1 degradation afterwards the glass bottles were incubated in the dark at room temperature 20 2 c and shaken daily to supply adequate oxygen preliminary experiments showed that five days were adequate to unveil the heterogeneous effects of dom on e1 biodegradation finally the mixtures were collected to concentrate e1 through solid phase extraction spe the biosorption of e1 onto biomass was calculated based on the previously established correlations between bacterial concentrations and e1 biosorption accordingly the difference between the total removal and the biosorption of e1 was calculated as ebp5 in the water samples meanwhile the change of doc concentration over the incubation was determined as biodegradable doc bdoc5 all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 end member experiments the river water derived dom sample rdom was collected from the yincun river to represent the end member of allodom fig 1 the algae derived dom was leached to represent the end member of fresh autodom faom moreover a part of the faom solutions was biologically aged to represent the end member of aged autodom aaom detailed information on the end member preparation can be found in si the three end members were diluted to a doc concentration of 5 mg c l 1 with milli q water then the faom and aaom were mixed with rdom in the volume ratio of 1 1 r faom and r aaom respectively the end members and their mixture solutions were applied for dom characterization and ebp bioassay 2 4 dom characterization and chemical analytical methods the chlorophyll a chla in water samples was collected on whatman gf f filters extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c and then quantified by absorbance at 750 and 665 nm before and after being acidified with hcl 1 mol l 1 the doc concentration was determined as non purgeable organic carbon using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu the absorption and fluorescence spectra of dom were collected using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi respectively the cdom concentration was represented by the absorption coefficient at 350 nm a350 the spectral indices including cdom doc suva254 spectral slope ratio s r specific peak ratios humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi were calculated according to published methods hansen et al 2016 the excitation emission matrixes parallel factor eem parafac modelling was performed in matlab r2012a with the dreem toolbox ver 0 2 0 and validated through the extended s4c6t3 validation fig s1 the maximal fluorescence intensity f max of each component was assumed to be positively correlated with their real concentrations the organic c normalized f max of each component was also calculated to remove the concentration dependence the concentration of e1 was quantified through gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms which excluded the interference of dom complexation on estrogen quantification the recovery rate 83 89 was within the us epa recommended range of 70 120 an expanded description of the above analytical methods is given in si 2 5 statistical analyses each result was reported as mean values of at minimum duplicates and statistical analyses were done in statistical package for social science spss software version 22 0 ibm usa the normality independence and homogeneity of the data variance were firstly validated in spss significance differences in the dom optical properties absorption and fluorescence spectral parameters and specific parafac component and the relative ratio bdoc5 and ebp5 between the water samples were tested using a nonparametric mann whitney u test as for the end member mixing experiments the parametric one way analysis of variance coupled with a post hoc comparison was used to test for significant differences a p value 0 05 was considered significant the actual p values are given in the text with three decimals the partial least squares regression pls r a statistical technique combining principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the predictive strength of dom optical properties for the ebp5 and bdoc5 the pls r was achieved by extracting orthogonal factors i e latent variables with the constraint that these variables explain the covariance between x optical parameters and y ebp5 or bdoc5 to as high a degree as possible all variables were normalized by one standard deviation for consistency and mean centred for the actual models hernes et al 2009 the variable importance in projection vip method was used to determine which predictors should be included in the multiple linear regression model cross validation was applied to describe the stability of the model with the r2y r2x and q2 values the r2y and r2x indicate the explained proportion of the variance in variables y and x the q2 representing the predictability of the model refers to the proportion of data variance predicted by the model 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal dynamics of dom at the eutrophic lake bays the indicator of algal bloom intensity chla concentration displayed a gradual decrease from july 2018 to january 2019 in the northern part of lake taihu fig s2 the high concentrations 40 μg l 1 to 97 μg l 1 in july dropped to 20 μg l 1 in november and much lower values were detected in january accordingly we grouped the four field campaigns into two distinct clusters the bloom season july and september 2018 and the post bloom season november 2018 and january 2019 meanwhile the inflow runoff around the northern bays was more massive in the bloom season due to the higher rainfall than in the post bloom season table s1 3 1 1 doc and cdom the doc concentration varied drastically during the four field campaigns from 3 24 to 6 91 mg l 1 fig 2 a comparable to the typical doc concentration of 2 21 mg l 1 in eutrophic freshwater lakes ye et al 2011 while no spatial variation was observed in the bloom or the post bloom seasons the doc concentrations at mlb and ghb significantly decreased after the algal bloom p 0 001 in contrast the bulk doc at zsb showed relatively lower sensitivity to seasonal variation likewise the concentration and composition of cdom varied with the seasons during the bloom season the cdom concentrations cdom doc and suva254 of zsb samples were higher than those in other regions fig 2a and s3 nevertheless the cdom concentration at mlb and ghb significantly increased in the post bloom season and the cdom doc and suva254 were comparable to those of zsb samples the significant and positive correlation between cdom and suva254 p 0 003 indicated that aromatics were the prominent light absorbing fractions of dom in the water column fig 2b the s r presented apparent seasonal variation that lower values were determined in the post bloom than in the bloom season even though the s r values of zsb samples were relatively lower than those at the other two bays fig 2c 3 1 2 fluorescent dom the representative eem spectra of dom in the bloom and the post bloom seasons were displayed in fig 3 a all the eems showed strong peak t and b fluorescence whereas peak c is weak or absent from visual inspection the intensity of peak a and m varied across sampling sites and seasons with stronger fluorescence in the post bloom season the fluorescence peaks located in the lower uv region may also be related to non protein compounds such as undegraded polyphenols so we described the protein like fraction as reflective of the fresh like fraction thereafter accordingly the fresh like compounds were the dominant fluorescent components whereas the distribution of humic like substances increased with the decline of algal bloom resulting in a significantly decreased r t c in the post bloom season p 0 015 fig s4a moreover the much lower r t c of zsb samples indicated a higher proportion of degraded material in the northwestern region of lake taihu although the r a c at zsb did not show apparent seasonal variations the r a c of mlb and ghb samples were significantly lower in the post bloom than in the bloom season p 0 018 respectively fig s4b additionally the values of r a c and r t c were significantly and positively correlated with each other across the sampling period p 0 011 fig 3b the fluorescent indices including bix hix and fi presented different spatial temporal variations there was no significant spatial difference in bix values between the three bays still the average value of bix which was approximately 1 2 in the bloom season significantly decreased to 1 1 in the post bloom season fig s5a the hix values at the three bays significantly increased in the post bloom season p 0 040 and the zsb samples exhibited a higher humification degree than other samples fig s5b the hix values were significantly and negatively correlated with bix values p 0 002 fig 3c moreover the seasonal variation of fi was only observed at zsb where the values were significantly higher than those of mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season fig s5c 3 1 3 eem parafac components a total of five fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 fig s1 component 1 c1 and component 3 c3 were considered as the tryptophan and tyrosine like substances respectively component 2 component 4 c4 and component 5 c5 were considered as the microbial humic humic and terrestrial humic like substances the f max of fresh like c1 and c3 exhibited significant and similar seasonal variations at all sites p 0 013 figs s6a and s6c regarding the humic like c2 c4 and c5 much higher f max was found at zsb than at other bays in the bloom and post bloom seasons figs s6b s6d and s6e nevertheless the seasonal variations of humic like components were dependent on their locations the fluorescence intensities of c4 and c5 of mlb samples increased after the algal bloom whereas the c2 was enriched in zsb samples in the bloom season after removing concentration dependence the doc normalized f max of c1 was significantly and positively correlated with c3 fig 4 a indicating their common source and similar environmental behaviour a positive relationship was also found between the doc normalized f max of microbial c2 and terrestrial c5 fig 4b the doc normalized f max of c1 and c3 showed no significant or weak correlations with each humic like component fig s7 stating their distinct responses to hydrologic and environmental processes the relative proportions further indicated that the fresh like components accounted for 70 of fluorescent components of mlb and ghb samples and the average proportion of humic like components in zsb samples was 30 and 41 in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively fig 4c consequently the ratios of humic like and fresh like substances of zsb samples were relatively higher than those of mlb and ghb samples and further significantly increased in the post bloom season fig 4d 3 2 seasonal variations of estrogen biodegradation potential in water samples the evaluated ebp5 in the water samples were 12 22 ng l 1 and 6 17 ng l 1 in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively fig 5 a spatially the e1 biodegradation of mlb and ghb samples was stronger than those of zsb samples across the sampling periods meanwhile the ebp5 at each bay showed high sensitivity to seasonal changes with significantly lower values observed in the post bloom p 0 001 generally the average ebp5 followed the order of mlb 36 ghb 34 zsb 28 during the algal bloom whereas the order changed to ghb 27 mlb 25 zsb 21 in the post bloom season considering that the bioassay excluded other factors such as nutrients and particle organic matters the ebp5 variation could be mainly attributed to the varying mediation of dom in biodegradation while there was a positive relationship between the ebp5 and doc concentrations r 2 0 48 fig 5b the ebp5 did not show any significant correlation with cdom concentrations p 0 459 fig s8 furthermore the synchronous c biodegradation within the bioassay showed that the spatial temporal patterns of bdoc5 were similar to that of ebp5 fig s9 hence the ebp5 was found more closely related to bdoc5 with r 2 0 75 fig 5c after removing the doc dependence the c normalized ebp5 c ebp5 of zsb and mlb samples were significantly higher in the bloom than in the post bloom seasons indicating the linkage between e1 biodegradation and seasonal variations of dom composition meanwhile the variation of bdoc5 which was calculated by bdoc doc indicated that the dom samples at each bay exhibited a relatively higher susceptibility to biodegradation in the bloom than in the post bloom season p 0 001 fig 5d overall the seasonal variation of dom controlled the c mineralization and therefore e1 biodegradation these two parameters were improved during the algal bloom and declined in the post bloom season 3 3 end member mixing experiments as listed in table 1 the chromophoric and fluorescent features of rdom faom aaom and their mixtures were remarkably different in keeping with its terrestrial origin rdom presented strong uv absorption with the highest suva350 and suva254 values but the lowest sr value while the s r values of faom were the highest among all samples the microbial transformation increased the aromatic and condensed polyaromatic structures and average molecular weight leading to the increased absorption and the decreased s275 295 of aaom the relatively higher values of r a c and r a t of rdom indicated the heterogeneous distribution of humic and fresh like compounds in allodom also the ratios of humic and fresh like components of aaom were higher than those of faom the values of fluorescence indices further suggested the low freshness and high humic degree of rdom even though the fi was inconsistent with other source indicators notably while the fluorescent composition of faom was different from that of rdom the microbial ageing resulted in a similar distribution of parafac components in aaom and rdom the multiple optical features of the end member mixtures exhibited different mixing behaviour the indicators related to humic like substances including suva254 hix r a c c2 c4 and c5 mostly showed ideal mixing behaviour nevertheless the s r bix r a t r t c c1 and c3 showed significant deviations from the expected values according to ideal mixing moreover the mediation of the dom end members at 5 mg c l 1 in e1 biodegradation followed the order of faom rdom aaom adding faom into the rdom increased the c ebp5 to 7 9 0 3 ng mg 1c close to the ideal mixing based values in contrast the mixing of aaom with rdom did not significantly improve the c ebp5 of rdom within the bioassay the bdoc5 of faom was much higher than the c mineralization of rdom and aaom also the mixture of faom and rdom presented a stronger bioreactivity than the r aaom 3 4 linkages between dom optical properties and estrogen biodegradation potential the pls r analysis was applied to determine the influence of dom composition on e1 biodegradation in both field investigations and end member mixing experiments the c ebp5 and bdoc5 were utilized as the response variable and the dom optical parameters were imported as predictor variables three predictive components were extracted using 21 predictor variables explaining 85 of the variability in dom composition x variables and 91 of the variability in c ebp5 and bdoc5 y variables table s2 the average explained fraction of the variation in response variables after cross validation was 80 9 to best illustrate the differences among dom composition only the first and the second predictive components pc1 and pc2 were displayed the pc1 explained 64 of the variability in dom compositions and 66 of the variability in the y variables representing a gradient from fresh to humic like substances fig 6 a the pc2 explained 15 of the variability in dom compositions and 13 of the variability in the y variables representing a gradient from strong aromaticity to low molecular weight indices the spatial temporal variations of dom composition and c ebp5 were further illustrated through the pls analysis fig 6b the distinguished dom optical parameters at each site in the bloom and the post bloom seasons spread from smallest to largest along the first axis the zsb samples mostly shifted from the right side of pc2 associated with microbial humic like c2 to the left side associated with peak a with the decline of algal bloom in contrast ghb samples mainly shifted from the left side of pc2 associated with molecular weights to the right side hix figs s10a and s10c the mlb samples shifted from the left side of pc1 associated with fresh like compounds to the right side associated with humic like compounds fig s10b as for the end members and their mixtures faom were located on the left side of pc1 and close to the mlb and ghb samples in the bloom season r faom were located near the zsb samples in the bloom season and the mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season aaom r adom and rdom were located at the right side of pc1 near the zsb samples in the post bloom season based on vip scores the r t c suva254 and s r were identified as highly influential predictors of bdoc5 and c ebp5 the humic fresh was identified as moderately influential and all other variables were less influential fig 6c on the loading scatter plot the proximity of variables to the predictors could generally describe the positive contribution of the predictors specifically the sr was positively related to y variables indicated by its positioning near bdoc5 on the pls plot the humic fresh was negatively related as indicated by its opposite positioning the c ebp5 was located near the positive indicator of r t c but opposite the negatively influential predictors of suva254 however the fi and bix were located near the centre and far from the c ebp5 indicating that dom source indicators were not predictive factors of e1 biodegradation these results suggested that the dom bioreactivity would be higher in the presence of small fresh like molecules whereas the e1 biodegradation was more strongly coupled to the distribution of peak t and aromatic structures linear regression analysis further showed that the dom optical parameters were significant predictors of bdoc5 and c ebp5 and the predictability of the model was higher for bdoc5 r 2 0 90 than for c ebp5 r 2 0 78 fig 6d and 6e overall the pls r modelling indicated that the selected predictive variables better described the variability in bioreactivity of dom which in turn altered e1 biodegradation in lake taihu 4 discussion 4 1 quantity and quality of dom influenced by autochthonous and allochthonous sources the spatial variation of dom quantity and quality was related to the various hydrological processes at the northern bays of lake taihu the chla concentration indicated that all the three bays endured dense cyanobacterial blooms in the bloom season meanwhile the sampling sites at zsb are located near the western yixing shoreline where a great density of terrigenous dom from the massif region in the western taihu basin feeds into taihu in comparison the dom samples at mlb and ghb were less influenced by the riverine input especially in the post bloom and dry season thus the increased doc concentration at mlb and ghb was mainly attributed to the algal excretion and microbial production in the bloom season fig 2a which was further indicated by the similar composition of faom and mlb and ghb samples fig 6b phytoplankton on average released 20 of their daily productivity as autodom during the growth phase wear et al 2015 the phytoplankton lysis can also excrete more than half of net primary production in the aquatic systems agusti et al 2001 nevertheless the doc concentration is not directly linked to the typical indicators of bloom intensity fig s11 since the in situ biogeochemical processes such as photochemical and microbial degradation also strongly regulate the variation of dom quantity while the abiotic photochemical processing was nearly absent in the post bloom season when taihu is covered with dense fog for extended times the ubiquitous microbial communities utilized large amounts of doc and significantly decreased the doc concentration of mlb and ghb samples the vital role of biodegradation in regulating dom was also confirmed by the close location of aaom and dom samples in the post bloom season in the pls model nevertheless the subtle mixing of algal bacterial extracellular release and discharge from inflows kept the stable doc concentration of zsb samples across the bloom development moreover the strong winds in the post bloom season may also stir up and leach sediments to enhance mixing throughout the water column releasing additional doc from the sediment particles in shallow lakes komada and reimers 2001 the doc is considered more in the framework of an assemblage of chromophoric and non chromophoric compositions associated with macromolecules however cdom only represents the light absorbing fractions and its concentration did not always fluctuate synchronously with doc concentration the composition and source of cdom were different at the inflowing rivers influenced sites compared to the open water offshore sites due to the increased aromatic compounds with strong optical reactivity in the terrestrial input by runoff and leaching pathways the doc and cdom optical properties of zsb samples behaved more conservatively in the bloom and flood season previous studies have reported a significant positive correlation between the inflows and cdom absorption and the decreased contribution of allochthonous cdom with the intrusion of lake water zhou et al 2018 while the algal exudation at the exponential growth is another possible cdom source the algal derived dom usually contains more significant amounts of non chromophores compounds such as polysaccharides qu et al 2012 resulting in the relatively lower cdom doc of mlb and ghb samples in the bloom season meanwhile the microbes in water columns could consume the polysaccharides and transform small organic molecules into high molecular weight compounds with elevated aromaticity bai et al 2017 increasing the cdom doc and suva254 of mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season the suva254 typically ranges from 1 0 to 6 0 l mg 1c m 1 in surface waters and low values are observed in algae leachates containing low molecular weight aliphatic compounds that do not absorb at 254 nm table 1 hansen et al 2016 in contrast poly aromatic pyrolytic compounds coming from allochthonous sources may have increased the suva254 and decreased the s r of zsb samples bravo et al 2017 the decreased s r also implied the production of high molecular weight compounds or the consumption of small molecules in the post bloom season the significant and positive correlation between cdom and aromaticity was consistent with previous findings that the cdom is relevant to reflecting the changes in dom aromaticity fig 2b jiang et al 2020 alterations in fluorescent components are widely used as a surrogate for changes in the source and composition of the wider dom pool the tryptophan like c1 and tyrosine like c3 are produced and consumed by microbes during the decomposition of algal scums in eutrophic waters zhang et al 2013 thus their concentrations were positively correlated fig 4a cyclic algal blooms coupled with short water retention time have been believed to be one reason why the contribution of fresh like substances to dom was over higher in lake taihu zhou et al 2015 nonetheless the inflows through the upstream region influenced by organic manure usage and nitrogen nutrients may also bring an unknown amount of amino like substances into the northern bays yao et al 2011 which may explain the highest abundance of c1 in zsb samples in the meantime a larger quantity of terrigenous humic like c4 and c5 were also imported into the northwestern region resulting in the relatively higher humic fresh of zsb samples with the dilution by lake water the contribution of allochthonous sources decreased in the offshore areas and fresh like components dominated the mlb and ghb samples so the spatial shifts of fluorescent dom were controlled by the trade off between terrestrial input and autochthonous production while the microbial humic like c2 was regarded as the byproducts of fresh like c1 and c3 biodegradation the synchronous variation of c2 and c5 and the high f max of c2 in rdom suggested that the allochthonous source brought considerable amounts of c2 into the humic like dom pools the diverse sensitivity of fresh and humic like components to seasonal changes led to the variations of fluorescent indices the low hix and high bix in the bloom season indicated that the dom was strongly affected by biological or autochthonous contributions freshly released in origin and likely caused by the algal bloom moreover the solar irradiation may have also increased the bix of aromatics in allodom susceptible to photodegradation hansen et al 2016 in the post bloom season the decreased bix and the increased hix were ascribed to the consumption of fresh substances and the increase of humic like substances concurring with the variations of suva254 and s r fig 3c compared to the recalcitrant peak c peak t and peak a were more easily utilized by microbes associated with the increased humic fresh after the algal bloom the fi with a small range of values 1 6 1 9 did not show significant seasonal variability and was inconsistent with previous findings that fi values of 1 9 consistently appear in dom from rivers that have terrestrially derived dom sources mcknight et al 2001 the end member mixing experiments also indicated that the microbial transformation masked the dom source signal gleaned from the fi by decreasing the fi of faom to a value similar to that of r faom table 1 the fi was initially developed for predicting the precursor source and chemical properties of fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 so it may not be representative of the source of non humic components of dom therefore the higher aromaticity absorbance molecular weight and humification degree of zsb samples were mainly related to the stronger terrestrial input as compared to the other two bays the higher abundance of fresh like dom at mlb and ghb where was far from the western river mouths was primarily controlled by algal excretion and in situ degradation in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively moreover the dom sources and in situ degradation both contributed to the temporal variations of dom quality whilst their relative importance showed seasonality the pls analysis stated that the variations of dom sources and compositions affected its availability to microbes the negative correlations between bdoc5 with suva254 could be attributed to the low ability of microbes to utilize the condensed aromatics in contrast the linkage between tyrosine like substances and low molecular weight organic acids acetate and butyrate that microbial consortia can rapidly consume led to the close positions of c3 s r and bdoc5 in the pls model drake et al 2015 the tyrosine like c3 was easy to biodegradation due to its less complicated molecular composition than the tryptophan like c1 and correlated with the rapidly cycled fractions in algal derived dom bai et al 2017 however some organics produced from phytoplankton under nutrient stress were less biodegradable and persisted in the dissolved phase leading to the accumulation of recalcitrant dom after the algal bloom asmala et al 2018 furthermore biotransformation and photo transformation can regulate dom bioreactivity without changing the bix and fi values hansen et al 2016 thus the bdoc5 was unrelated to dom source indicators although the dom optical properties presented distinct seasonal patterns at the three bays the temporal synchronicity in bdoc5 suggested that the simultaneous increase of freshly released autodom elevated the c mineralization in the water columns in the bloom season the end member mixing experiments also indicated that the bioreactivity of mixtures was mainly dependent on the priming effect of faom on recalcitrant dom therefore the freshly released autodom played a crucial role in determining the bioreactivity of dom pools even though the strong terrestrial input brought recalcitrant humic substances into the lake water however with the decreased terrestrial input in the post bloom season the autodom with a higher humification degree was difficult to biodegradation resulting in a lower bdoc5 furthermore the aaom and its mixture with rdom both showed extremely low availability to microbes highlighting that the source was not the decisive factor indicating the variations of dom bioreactivity 4 2 structure reactivity between dom and estrone biodegradation potential contaminants at trace levels were too low for maximal induction of or recognition by bacterial enzymes so the transformation of contaminants would be associated with particular metabolic stages of the major organic substrate biodegradation stumpe and marschner 2009 enhanced contaminant biodegradation with the increased doc concentration was reported in various aquatic systems tan et al 2013 tang et al 2017 however the concentration dependent effect of dom varied with its structure and reactivity with the turnover of high concentrations of complex dom the stimulated microbial respiration and growth were favourable to contaminant biodegradation nevertheless the increased recalcitrant dom could not be readily used by microbes and showed no or little enhancement of bacterial activity and estrogen biodegradation hence the e1 biodegradation was primarily associated with the microbial cycling of biodegradable dom resulting in a closer connection between ebp5 with bdoc5 than with bulk doc fig 5b and 5c a previous study observed the parallel decrease of contaminants and doc availability due to the coupling of the processes via microbial co metabolism mueller et al 2021 the correlations between dom compound classes and e1 biodegradation differed with the bioavailability of dom compounds the behaviour of emerging contaminants with high removals was previously correlated with that of the fluorescence indices associated with aromatic proteins and tyrosine like components sgroi et al 2017 nevertheless the positive correlations between c ebp5 and r t c indicated the similar or linked turnover processes of e1 and bioavailable dom as dom structural compositions not as individual parafac fluorescent components the coexistence of individual dom compounds showed interactive effects on the microbial community members affecting their ability to handle available resources our previous studies revealed that the interaction between protein and lipid like dom showed determination on bacterial community assemblages with enhanced interspecies cooperation for degrading refractory organics bai et al 2020 in contrast the change from more fresh to humic like compounds decreased the bacterial biomass community diversity and metabolic activity bai et al 2022 indeed humic fresh was identified as the moderately and negatively influential factor of c ebp5 however pls analysis demonstrated the weak linkage between dom source indicators and e1 biodegradation the end member mixing experiments further provided substantial evidence that the promotion of autodom on e1 biodegradation was dependent on its freshness with significantly decreased c ebp5 in the presence of aaom and its mixture with rdom these results suggested that the structure rather than the source of dom played a crucial role in determining e1 biodegradation microbes often exhibited similar temporal turnover rates habitat niche breadths and co occurrence patterns when exposed to different kinds of dom with similar structural compositions zhou et al 2021 also the in situ transformation which may alter the structure of autodom similar to that of allodom made the mediation in e1 biodegradation unrelated to dom sources besides the weak priming effect of humic acids on microbial metabolism the negative correlation between ebp5 and humic related indicators was associated with the strong complexation of humic substances and estrogens while humic acids can increase the apparent solubility and enhance the diffusion and mass transfer of contaminants the presence of various reactive groups such as carboxylic phenolic and quinones can bind and modulate the existing form of contaminants lee et al 2011 compared to the low molecular weight organic compounds such as amino acids carbohydrates and carboxylic acids the high molecular weight components exhibited a stronger affinity to estrogens and decreased their availability to microbes the relationship between e1 biodegradation and dom molecular mass distribution was further evidenced by the positive correlation between s r and c ebp5 in the pls model in addition the difference between the predictive strengths of bdoc5 and c ebp5 using dom optical parameters implied that the model based on these predictor variables was more likely to explain the co metabolism of dom rather than the complexation 4 3 conclusions and environmental implications in combination with field investigations and laboratory experiments we show for the first time that the biodegradation of e1 was closely related to the distribution and optical properties of dom and therefore was primarily controlled by the hydrologic processes besides the doc concentration the dom optical indices of humic fresh and molecular weights were influential factors controlling the c ebp5 in the water column of lake taihu whereas the e1 biodegradation was not highly correlated with dom source indicators while the aromatic structures negatively correlated with c ebp5 the low molecular weight compounds strongly and positively correlated with e1 biodegradation we provide new insights into the temporal variation of e1 biodegradation in eutrophic freshwater lakes 1 in the bloom season the freshly produced low molecular mass compounds from algal derived exudates increased c mineralization and c ebp5 even though the input of high molecular weight aromatic structures in allodom weakened the promotive effects 2 with the decline of algal bloom the in situ processes e g microbial ageing shifted the dom structure to recalcitrant components with the increased molecular weight leading to the relatively lower biodegradation potential our results partially explained whether organic rich environments are sinks or sources for the estrogens particularly in the algal bloom affected regions future studies are needed to develop this framework by including other environmental factors such as ph redox and sulfur geochemistry known to modulate the activity of microorganisms and estrogen biodegradation by considering the bioaccumulation biomagnification processes and by extending it to other aquatic ecosystems such as ponds rivers estuaries and sea water quality monitoring assessment and management based on fluorescent dom is a promising strategy due to the high sensitivity low cost and possibility of developing real time sensors based on the results of the pls r modelling the strong and positive relationship between the optical indices related to r t c indicated that a higher peak t and lower peak c fluorescence intensity may be a valuable indicator for water pollution assessment and lake management previous results support this assumption that the removal of emerging contaminants was correlated with that of the fluorescence indices associated with tryptophan like fluorescence in wastewater treatment plants and constructed wetlands sgroi et al 2018 sgroi et al 2017 the very high explanatory and predictive power of pls r modelling demonstrated that ebp could be quantitatively predicted from the optical parameters of dom even in the bloom and in the post bloom seasons overall this study provides additional insights into the variable influences of dom on estrogen biodegradation and a robust prediction of seasonal estrogen biodegradation in eutrophic waters which may have important implications for regional contaminant attenuation on a temporal scale

3116,the spatial temporal variation of dissolved organic matter dom influences contaminant biodegradation in natural water systems this study explored seasonal patterns of dom concentration and composition and the consequent effect on estrone e1 biodegradation in water columns at the northern bays of lake taihu during bloom seasons the increased concentration of autochthonous dom autodom with higher fresh humic ratios lower aromatics molecular weights and humification degrees exhibited a more substantial promotion on e1 biodegradation than the processed autodom after algal bloom meanwhile the inflow rivers imported high molecular weight humic like substances with strong aromaticity in flood seasons impairing the e1 biodegradation of affected regions end member mixing experiments further confirmed that the mixing of algal derived dom facilitated the mediation of river water derived dom in e1 biodegradation but microbial ageing reduced the promotive effect of autodom and resulted in a weak relationship between dom source indicators and e1 biodegradation a significant and positive correlation was further found between e1 biodegradation and dom bioreactivity p 0 001 both of which were well predicted by dom optical properties as predictor variables in partial least squares regression pls r modelling r 2 values of 0 78 and 0 90 respectively the ratio of fluorescence peak t and c was identified as the most effective predictor and suva254 and slope ratio s r were moderately influential factors controlling carbon normalized e1 biodegradation potential these results suggested that while algal blooms would likely cause enhanced biotransformation of estrogens in freshwater lakes the import of allochthonous dom or the microbially aged autodom with high molecular weight may lead to higher estrogen concentrations in post bloom seasons keywords algal bloom bioreactivity dissolved organic matter eem parafac emerging contaminant hydrological seasons 1 introduction as an essential component of the organic carbon pool in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems dissolved organic matter dom significantly affects the biogeochemical cycling of contaminants ma and yates 2018 sun et al 2021 the soluble organic compounds have a complex structure and chemodiversity due to aromatic groups with different degrees and types of substitution ma et al 2021 while dissolved humic and fulvic substances are considered to dominate aquatic dom nebbioso and piccolo 2013 the high sensitivity to local hydrogeochemical variations and regional biogeochemical variables resulted in the dynamic composition of dom huang et al 2022 in lake ecosystems the dom presented at 0 1 to 10 mg c l 1 consists of a mixture of allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous microbial sources asmala et al 2018 rainfalls of the upstream watershed lead to the increasing inflow runoff and the associated organic loadings into downstream linked lakes during flood seasons huang et al 2022 however the notably production and accumulation of autochthonous dom autodom are stimulated by the expanding eutrophication and algal blooms paul 2008 concurrently the variety of allochthonous and autochthonous sources is linked with dom bioreactivity that primes bacterial productivity in water columns asmala et al 2018 allochthonous dom allodom derived from the dissolution of soil organic matter and terrestrial plant remnants was relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation due to the abundant aromatic structures and high humic degrees inamdar et al 2011 in contrast the proteinaceous substances and carbohydrates derived from algal blooms exhibited a great bioreactivity of 79 bai et al 2017 the distinct resource partitioning of autodom and allodom impacts microbial growth metabolism and functions and therefore would induce changes in the biotransformation of contaminants song et al 2022 a recent study demonstrated that algal derived compounds improved the lake internal microbial activity and hence the biotransformation of hg in eutrophic shallow lakes lei et al 2021 steroid estrogens a representative group of endocrine disrupting chemicals are exclusively produced and released into the lake ecosystems through the sewage water discharge and landfill of municipal biosolids zhou et al 2016 due to their adverse effects on hormonal functions and community structures of aquatic organisms at extremely low concentrations van den belt et al 2004 understanding the environmental behaviour of estrogens is gaining extensive attention biodegradation is a major pathway influencing the presence of estrogens in water environments especially in low transparency water columns zhang et al 2016 because heterotrophic contaminant degrading microbes are also critical decomposers of organic substances zhang et al 2016 the dom can regulate biodegradation by constituting the supplementary carbon source horemans et al 2013 while dissolved organic carbon doc concentration is an essential factor driving estrogen biodegradation ma and yates 2018 the correlation between estrogen biodegradation potential ebp and doc concentration varies with dom compositions when studies cover diverse waters for example the lake water containing lower doc concentrations tended to show stronger estrogen biotransformation than wastewater effluent lee et al 2012 highlighting the complexity of dom mediation in diverse water systems our published works based on autodom end members revealed the inconstant responses of estrogen biodegradation to the algal and macrophytes derived dom with distinct biodegradability bai et al 2022 bai et al 2020 however there is little to no focus on the seasonal variations of dom and estrogen biodegradation in eutrophic lakes that can be strongly influenced by seasonal hydrogeochemical processes which leads to abundant terrigenous and autochthonous dom during the wet and algal bloom seasons but relatively strong in situ degradation in the dry and post bloom seasons cui et al 2021 in combination with optical parameters and indices the optically active fractions such as chromophoric dom cdom and fluorescent dom have been widely used as dom surrogates to characterize the origin and transformation of dom he et al 2021 ni and li 2020 moreover changes in optical spectra associated with dom variations are indicative of the concurrent effects on emerging contaminants in various environmental matrixes korshin et al 2018 so deciphering the relationships between dom optical parameters and estrogen biodegradation would improve the understanding of the causality behind dom and estrogen occurrence and evaluate the dom spectroscopic indices for predicting estrogen fate in aquatic systems lake taihu the important drinking water source in the yangtze river delta for a population of at least 10 million people living within its watershed qin et al 2010 has been influenced by seasonal cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms over the last decade shi et al 2019 the genuine algal and successive food web metabolites affect dom composition and concentration in the northern areas of lake taihu including zhushan bay zsb meiliang bay mlb and gonghu bay ghb zhang et al 2014 also these regions are influenced by terrestrial inputs from adjacent rivers such as the yincungang river wangyu river and chengdonggang river to a certain degree in wet seasons yao et al 2011 the dual sources of dom in these regions offer an excellent opportunity to follow real ecosystem dom dynamics and the associated variation of estrogen biodegradation according to the structure reactivity concept we 1 investigated the seasonal patterns of dom optical properties with absorbance and fluorescence spectra at the northern bays 2 quantified the ebp in seasonal dom samples and 3 explored the relationships between dom optical properties and ebp and the predictive factors besides the field investigations we performed end member mixing experiments to demonstrate the responses of ebp to autodom and allodom the natural estrone e1 a dominant metabolite of other estrogens was selected as the surrogate for ebp assessment due to its high concentration in surface waters zhang et al 2016 in a global context of projected higher frequency of algal blooms and increased terrigenous inputs the results of this study are essential for future predictions and controls of steroid estrogens in the affected regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection four sampling campaigns were conducted at the same sites n 9 in the northern regions of lake taihu from july 2018 to january 2019 fig 1 the surface water samples 0 30 cm were collected in glass bottles transferred on ice and filtered through 1 2 and 0 22 μm glass fibre filter pre combusted upon arrival at the laboratory the filtered water samples were stored at 20 c before dom characterization and ebp bioassay the top 5 cm of sediment was also sampled at each site during the last sampling campaign in january 2019 to prepare the bacterial inoculum for bioassay bai et al 2022 briefly the sediments were mixed equally resuspended in milliq water and incubated overnight after the filtration and centrifugation of the slurry the bacterial pellet was collected washed repeatedly with 10 mm phosphate buffered saline and diluted to 9 1010 cells l

collected water samples n 36 was determined simultaneously certain amounts of e1 redissolved in milli q water were spiked into a series of brown glass bottles containing the filtered water samples the selected e1 concentration of 50 μg l 1 was higher than its environmental concentration but crucial to revealing the relationships between dom characteristics and estrogen biodegradation gu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the bacterial inoculum was added to water samples to make a final concentration 1 0 109 cells l 1 the background nutrients were compensated by nitrogen and phosphate solutions to avoid the nutrient limitation ammonium nh4 n 35 μm nitrate no3 n 100 μm and phosphate po4 3 p 2 μm one set of bottles containing milliq water e1 and bacterial inoculum served as the control group another set of bottles containing only milliq water and e1 was performed to estimate the abiotic e1 degradation afterwards the glass bottles were incubated in the dark at room temperature 20 2 c and shaken daily to supply adequate oxygen preliminary experiments showed that five days were adequate to unveil the heterogeneous effects of dom on e1 biodegradation finally the mixtures were collected to concentrate e1 through solid phase extraction spe the biosorption of e1 onto biomass was calculated based on the previously established correlations between bacterial concentrations and e1 biosorption accordingly the difference between the total removal and the biosorption of e1 was calculated as ebp5 in the water samples meanwhile the change of doc concentration over the incubation was determined as biodegradable doc bdoc5 all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 end member experiments the river water derived dom sample rdom was collected from the yincun river to represent the end member of allodom fig 1 the algae derived dom was leached to represent the end member of fresh autodom faom moreover a part of the faom solutions was biologically aged to represent the end member of aged autodom aaom detailed information on the end member preparation can be found in si the three end members were diluted to a doc concentration of 5 mg c l 1 with milli q water then the faom and aaom were mixed with rdom in the volume ratio of 1 1 r faom and r aaom respectively the end members and their mixture solutions were applied for dom characterization and ebp bioassay 2 4 dom characterization and chemical analytical methods the chlorophyll a chla in water samples was collected on whatman gf f filters extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c and then quantified by absorbance at 750 and 665 nm before and after being acidified with hcl 1 mol l 1 the doc concentration was determined as non purgeable organic carbon using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu the absorption and fluorescence spectra of dom were collected using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi respectively the cdom concentration was represented by the absorption coefficient at 350 nm a350 the spectral indices including cdom doc suva254 spectral slope ratio s r specific peak ratios humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi were calculated according to published methods hansen et al 2016 the excitation emission matrixes parallel factor eem parafac modelling was performed in matlab r2012a with the dreem toolbox ver 0 2 0 and validated through the extended s4c6t3 validation fig s1 the maximal fluorescence intensity f max of each component was assumed to be positively correlated with their real concentrations the organic c normalized f max of each component was also calculated to remove the concentration dependence the concentration of e1 was quantified through gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms which excluded the interference of dom complexation on estrogen quantification the recovery rate 83 89 was within the us epa recommended range of 70 120 an expanded description of the above analytical methods is given in si 2 5 statistical analyses each result was reported as mean values of at minimum duplicates and statistical analyses were done in statistical package for social science spss software version 22 0 ibm usa the normality independence and homogeneity of the data variance were firstly validated in spss significance differences in the dom optical properties absorption and fluorescence spectral parameters and specific parafac component and the relative ratio bdoc5 and ebp5 between the water samples were tested using a nonparametric mann whitney u test as for the end member mixing experiments the parametric one way analysis of variance coupled with a post hoc comparison was used to test for significant differences a p value 0 05 was considered significant the actual p values are given in the text with three decimals the partial least squares regression pls r a statistical technique combining principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the predictive strength of dom optical properties for the ebp5 and bdoc5 the pls r was achieved by extracting orthogonal factors i e latent variables with the constraint that these variables explain the covariance between x optical parameters and y ebp5 or bdoc5 to as high a degree as possible all variables were normalized by one standard deviation for consistency and mean centred for the actual models hernes et al 2009 the variable importance in projection vip method was used to determine which predictors should be included in the multiple linear regression model cross validation was applied to describe the stability of the model with the r2y r2x and q2 values the r2y and r2x indicate the explained proportion of the variance in variables y and x the q2 representing the predictability of the model refers to the proportion of data variance predicted by the model 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal dynamics of dom at the eutrophic lake bays the indicator of algal bloom intensity chla concentration displayed a gradual decrease from july 2018 to january 2019 in the northern part of lake taihu fig s2 the high concentrations 40 μg l 1 to 97 μg l 1 in july dropped to 20 μg l 1 in november and much lower values were detected in january accordingly we grouped the four field campaigns into two distinct clusters the bloom season july and september 2018 and the post bloom season november 2018 and january 2019 meanwhile the inflow runoff around the northern bays was more massive in the bloom season due to the higher rainfall than in the post bloom season table s1 3 1 1 doc and cdom the doc concentration varied drastically during the four field campaigns from 3 24 to 6 91 mg l 1 fig 2 a comparable to the typical doc concentration of 2 21 mg l 1 in eutrophic freshwater lakes ye et al 2011 while no spatial variation was observed in the bloom or the post bloom seasons the doc concentrations at mlb and ghb significantly decreased after the algal bloom p 0 001 in contrast the bulk doc at zsb showed relatively lower sensitivity to seasonal variation likewise the concentration and composition of cdom varied with the seasons during the bloom season the cdom concentrations cdom doc and suva254 of zsb samples were higher than those in other regions fig 2a and s3 nevertheless the cdom concentration at mlb and ghb significantly increased in the post bloom season and the cdom doc and suva254 were comparable to those of zsb samples the significant and positive correlation between cdom and suva254 p 0 003 indicated that aromatics were the prominent light absorbing fractions of dom in the water column fig 2b the s r presented apparent seasonal variation that lower values were determined in the post bloom than in the bloom season even though the s r values of zsb samples were relatively lower than those at the other two bays fig 2c 3 1 2 fluorescent dom the representative eem spectra of dom in the bloom and the post bloom seasons were displayed in fig 3 a all the eems showed strong peak t and b fluorescence whereas peak c is weak or absent from visual inspection the intensity of peak a and m varied across sampling sites and seasons with stronger fluorescence in the post bloom season the fluorescence peaks located in the lower uv region may also be related to non protein compounds such as undegraded polyphenols so we described the protein like fraction as reflective of the fresh like fraction thereafter accordingly the fresh like compounds were the dominant fluorescent components whereas the distribution of humic like substances increased with the decline of algal bloom resulting in a significantly decreased r t c in the post bloom season p 0 015 fig s4a moreover the much lower r t c of zsb samples indicated a higher proportion of degraded material in the northwestern region of lake taihu although the r a c at zsb did not show apparent seasonal variations the r a c of mlb and ghb samples were significantly lower in the post bloom than in the bloom season p 0 018 respectively fig s4b additionally the values of r a c and r t c were significantly and positively correlated with each other across the sampling period p 0 011 fig 3b the fluorescent indices including bix hix and fi presented different spatial temporal variations there was no significant spatial difference in bix values between the three bays still the average value of bix which was approximately 1 2 in the bloom season significantly decreased to 1 1 in the post bloom season fig s5a the hix values at the three bays significantly increased in the post bloom season p 0 040 and the zsb samples exhibited a higher humification degree than other samples fig s5b the hix values were significantly and negatively correlated with bix values p 0 002 fig 3c moreover the seasonal variation of fi was only observed at zsb where the values were significantly higher than those of mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season fig s5c 3 1 3 eem parafac components a total of five fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 fig s1 component 1 c1 and component 3 c3 were considered as the tryptophan and tyrosine like substances respectively component 2 component 4 c4 and component 5 c5 were considered as the microbial humic humic and terrestrial humic like substances the f max of fresh like c1 and c3 exhibited significant and similar seasonal variations at all sites p 0 013 figs s6a and s6c regarding the humic like c2 c4 and c5 much higher f max was found at zsb than at other bays in the bloom and post bloom seasons figs s6b s6d and s6e nevertheless the seasonal variations of humic like components were dependent on their locations the fluorescence intensities of c4 and c5 of mlb samples increased after the algal bloom whereas the c2 was enriched in zsb samples in the bloom season after removing concentration dependence the doc normalized f max of c1 was significantly and positively correlated with c3 fig 4 a indicating their common source and similar environmental behaviour a positive relationship was also found between the doc normalized f max of microbial c2 and terrestrial c5 fig 4b the doc normalized f max of c1 and c3 showed no significant or weak correlations with each humic like component fig s7 stating their distinct responses to hydrologic and environmental processes the relative proportions further indicated that the fresh like components accounted for 70 of fluorescent components of mlb and ghb samples and the average proportion of humic like components in zsb samples was 30 and 41 in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively fig 4c consequently the ratios of humic like and fresh like substances of zsb samples were relatively higher than those of mlb and ghb samples and further significantly increased in the post bloom season fig 4d 3 2 seasonal variations of estrogen biodegradation potential in water samples the evaluated ebp5 in the water samples were 12 22 ng l 1 and 6 17 ng l 1 in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively fig 5 a spatially the e1 biodegradation of mlb and ghb samples was stronger than those of zsb samples across the sampling periods meanwhile the ebp5 at each bay showed high sensitivity to seasonal changes with significantly lower values observed in the post bloom p 0 001 generally the average ebp5 followed the order of mlb 36 ghb 34 zsb 28 during the algal bloom whereas the order changed to ghb 27 mlb 25 zsb 21 in the post bloom season considering that the bioassay excluded other factors such as nutrients and particle organic matters the ebp5 variation could be mainly attributed to the varying mediation of dom in biodegradation while there was a positive relationship between the ebp5 and doc concentrations r 2 0 48 fig 5b the ebp5 did not show any significant correlation with cdom concentrations p 0 459 fig s8 furthermore the synchronous c biodegradation within the bioassay showed that the spatial temporal patterns of bdoc5 were similar to that of ebp5 fig s9 hence the ebp5 was found more closely related to bdoc5 with r 2 0 75 fig 5c after removing the doc dependence the c normalized ebp5 c ebp5 of zsb and mlb samples were significantly higher in the bloom than in the post bloom seasons indicating the linkage between e1 biodegradation and seasonal variations of dom composition meanwhile the variation of bdoc5 which was calculated by bdoc doc indicated that the dom samples at each bay exhibited a relatively higher susceptibility to biodegradation in the bloom than in the post bloom season p 0 001 fig 5d overall the seasonal variation of dom controlled the c mineralization and therefore e1 biodegradation these two parameters were improved during the algal bloom and declined in the post bloom season 3 3 end member mixing experiments as listed in table 1 the chromophoric and fluorescent features of rdom faom aaom and their mixtures were remarkably different in keeping with its terrestrial origin rdom presented strong uv absorption with the highest suva350 and suva254 values but the lowest sr value while the s r values of faom were the highest among all samples the microbial transformation increased the aromatic and condensed polyaromatic structures and average molecular weight leading to the increased absorption and the decreased s275 295 of aaom the relatively higher values of r a c and r a t of rdom indicated the heterogeneous distribution of humic and fresh like compounds in allodom also the ratios of humic and fresh like components of aaom were higher than those of faom the values of fluorescence indices further suggested the low freshness and high humic degree of rdom even though the fi was inconsistent with other source indicators notably while the fluorescent composition of faom was different from that of rdom the microbial ageing resulted in a similar distribution of parafac components in aaom and rdom the multiple optical features of the end member mixtures exhibited different mixing behaviour the indicators related to humic like substances including suva254 hix r a c c2 c4 and c5 mostly showed ideal mixing behaviour nevertheless the s r bix r a t r t c c1 and c3 showed significant deviations from the expected values according to ideal mixing moreover the mediation of the dom end members at 5 mg c l 1 in e1 biodegradation followed the order of faom rdom aaom adding faom into the rdom increased the c ebp5 to 7 9 0 3 ng mg 1c close to the ideal mixing based values in contrast the mixing of aaom with rdom did not significantly improve the c ebp5 of rdom within the bioassay the bdoc5 of faom was much higher than the c mineralization of rdom and aaom also the mixture of faom and rdom presented a stronger bioreactivity than the r aaom 3 4 linkages between dom optical properties and estrogen biodegradation potential the pls r analysis was applied to determine the influence of dom composition on e1 biodegradation in both field investigations and end member mixing experiments the c ebp5 and bdoc5 were utilized as the response variable and the dom optical parameters were imported as predictor variables three predictive components were extracted using 21 predictor variables explaining 85 of the variability in dom composition x variables and 91 of the variability in c ebp5 and bdoc5 y variables table s2 the average explained fraction of the variation in response variables after cross validation was 80 9 to best illustrate the differences among dom composition only the first and the second predictive components pc1 and pc2 were displayed the pc1 explained 64 of the variability in dom compositions and 66 of the variability in the y variables representing a gradient from fresh to humic like substances fig 6 a the pc2 explained 15 of the variability in dom compositions and 13 of the variability in the y variables representing a gradient from strong aromaticity to low molecular weight indices the spatial temporal variations of dom composition and c ebp5 were further illustrated through the pls analysis fig 6b the distinguished dom optical parameters at each site in the bloom and the post bloom seasons spread from smallest to largest along the first axis the zsb samples mostly shifted from the right side of pc2 associated with microbial humic like c2 to the left side associated with peak a with the decline of algal bloom in contrast ghb samples mainly shifted from the left side of pc2 associated with molecular weights to the right side hix figs s10a and s10c the mlb samples shifted from the left side of pc1 associated with fresh like compounds to the right side associated with humic like compounds fig s10b as for the end members and their mixtures faom were located on the left side of pc1 and close to the mlb and ghb samples in the bloom season r faom were located near the zsb samples in the bloom season and the mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season aaom r adom and rdom were located at the right side of pc1 near the zsb samples in the post bloom season based on vip scores the r t c suva254 and s r were identified as highly influential predictors of bdoc5 and c ebp5 the humic fresh was identified as moderately influential and all other variables were less influential fig 6c on the loading scatter plot the proximity of variables to the predictors could generally describe the positive contribution of the predictors specifically the sr was positively related to y variables indicated by its positioning near bdoc5 on the pls plot the humic fresh was negatively related as indicated by its opposite positioning the c ebp5 was located near the positive indicator of r t c but opposite the negatively influential predictors of suva254 however the fi and bix were located near the centre and far from the c ebp5 indicating that dom source indicators were not predictive factors of e1 biodegradation these results suggested that the dom bioreactivity would be higher in the presence of small fresh like molecules whereas the e1 biodegradation was more strongly coupled to the distribution of peak t and aromatic structures linear regression analysis further showed that the dom optical parameters were significant predictors of bdoc5 and c ebp5 and the predictability of the model was higher for bdoc5 r 2 0 90 than for c ebp5 r 2 0 78 fig 6d and 6e overall the pls r modelling indicated that the selected predictive variables better described the variability in bioreactivity of dom which in turn altered e1 biodegradation in lake taihu 4 discussion 4 1 quantity and quality of dom influenced by autochthonous and allochthonous sources the spatial variation of dom quantity and quality was related to the various hydrological processes at the northern bays of lake taihu the chla concentration indicated that all the three bays endured dense cyanobacterial blooms in the bloom season meanwhile the sampling sites at zsb are located near the western yixing shoreline where a great density of terrigenous dom from the massif region in the western taihu basin feeds into taihu in comparison the dom samples at mlb and ghb were less influenced by the riverine input especially in the post bloom and dry season thus the increased doc concentration at mlb and ghb was mainly attributed to the algal excretion and microbial production in the bloom season fig 2a which was further indicated by the similar composition of faom and mlb and ghb samples fig 6b phytoplankton on average released 20 of their daily productivity as autodom during the growth phase wear et al 2015 the phytoplankton lysis can also excrete more than half of net primary production in the aquatic systems agusti et al 2001 nevertheless the doc concentration is not directly linked to the typical indicators of bloom intensity fig s11 since the in situ biogeochemical processes such as photochemical and microbial degradation also strongly regulate the variation of dom quantity while the abiotic photochemical processing was nearly absent in the post bloom season when taihu is covered with dense fog for extended times the ubiquitous microbial communities utilized large amounts of doc and significantly decreased the doc concentration of mlb and ghb samples the vital role of biodegradation in regulating dom was also confirmed by the close location of aaom and dom samples in the post bloom season in the pls model nevertheless the subtle mixing of algal bacterial extracellular release and discharge from inflows kept the stable doc concentration of zsb samples across the bloom development moreover the strong winds in the post bloom season may also stir up and leach sediments to enhance mixing throughout the water column releasing additional doc from the sediment particles in shallow lakes komada and reimers 2001 the doc is considered more in the framework of an assemblage of chromophoric and non chromophoric compositions associated with macromolecules however cdom only represents the light absorbing fractions and its concentration did not always fluctuate synchronously with doc concentration the composition and source of cdom were different at the inflowing rivers influenced sites compared to the open water offshore sites due to the increased aromatic compounds with strong optical reactivity in the terrestrial input by runoff and leaching pathways the doc and cdom optical properties of zsb samples behaved more conservatively in the bloom and flood season previous studies have reported a significant positive correlation between the inflows and cdom absorption and the decreased contribution of allochthonous cdom with the intrusion of lake water zhou et al 2018 while the algal exudation at the exponential growth is another possible cdom source the algal derived dom usually contains more significant amounts of non chromophores compounds such as polysaccharides qu et al 2012 resulting in the relatively lower cdom doc of mlb and ghb samples in the bloom season meanwhile the microbes in water columns could consume the polysaccharides and transform small organic molecules into high molecular weight compounds with elevated aromaticity bai et al 2017 increasing the cdom doc and suva254 of mlb and ghb samples in the post bloom season the suva254 typically ranges from 1 0 to 6 0 l mg 1c m 1 in surface waters and low values are observed in algae leachates containing low molecular weight aliphatic compounds that do not absorb at 254 nm table 1 hansen et al 2016 in contrast poly aromatic pyrolytic compounds coming from allochthonous sources may have increased the suva254 and decreased the s r of zsb samples bravo et al 2017 the decreased s r also implied the production of high molecular weight compounds or the consumption of small molecules in the post bloom season the significant and positive correlation between cdom and aromaticity was consistent with previous findings that the cdom is relevant to reflecting the changes in dom aromaticity fig 2b jiang et al 2020 alterations in fluorescent components are widely used as a surrogate for changes in the source and composition of the wider dom pool the tryptophan like c1 and tyrosine like c3 are produced and consumed by microbes during the decomposition of algal scums in eutrophic waters zhang et al 2013 thus their concentrations were positively correlated fig 4a cyclic algal blooms coupled with short water retention time have been believed to be one reason why the contribution of fresh like substances to dom was over higher in lake taihu zhou et al 2015 nonetheless the inflows through the upstream region influenced by organic manure usage and nitrogen nutrients may also bring an unknown amount of amino like substances into the northern bays yao et al 2011 which may explain the highest abundance of c1 in zsb samples in the meantime a larger quantity of terrigenous humic like c4 and c5 were also imported into the northwestern region resulting in the relatively higher humic fresh of zsb samples with the dilution by lake water the contribution of allochthonous sources decreased in the offshore areas and fresh like components dominated the mlb and ghb samples so the spatial shifts of fluorescent dom were controlled by the trade off between terrestrial input and autochthonous production while the microbial humic like c2 was regarded as the byproducts of fresh like c1 and c3 biodegradation the synchronous variation of c2 and c5 and the high f max of c2 in rdom suggested that the allochthonous source brought considerable amounts of c2 into the humic like dom pools the diverse sensitivity of fresh and humic like components to seasonal changes led to the variations of fluorescent indices the low hix and high bix in the bloom season indicated that the dom was strongly affected by biological or autochthonous contributions freshly released in origin and likely caused by the algal bloom moreover the solar irradiation may have also increased the bix of aromatics in allodom susceptible to photodegradation hansen et al 2016 in the post bloom season the decreased bix and the increased hix were ascribed to the consumption of fresh substances and the increase of humic like substances concurring with the variations of suva254 and s r fig 3c compared to the recalcitrant peak c peak t and peak a were more easily utilized by microbes associated with the increased humic fresh after the algal bloom the fi with a small range of values 1 6 1 9 did not show significant seasonal variability and was inconsistent with previous findings that fi values of 1 9 consistently appear in dom from rivers that have terrestrially derived dom sources mcknight et al 2001 the end member mixing experiments also indicated that the microbial transformation masked the dom source signal gleaned from the fi by decreasing the fi of faom to a value similar to that of r faom table 1 the fi was initially developed for predicting the precursor source and chemical properties of fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 so it may not be representative of the source of non humic components of dom therefore the higher aromaticity absorbance molecular weight and humification degree of zsb samples were mainly related to the stronger terrestrial input as compared to the other two bays the higher abundance of fresh like dom at mlb and ghb where was far from the western river mouths was primarily controlled by algal excretion and in situ degradation in the bloom and the post bloom season respectively moreover the dom sources and in situ degradation both contributed to the temporal variations of dom quality whilst their relative importance showed seasonality the pls analysis stated that the variations of dom sources and compositions affected its availability to microbes the negative correlations between bdoc5 with suva254 could be attributed to the low ability of microbes to utilize the condensed aromatics in contrast the linkage between tyrosine like substances and low molecular weight organic acids acetate and butyrate that microbial consortia can rapidly consume led to the close positions of c3 s r and bdoc5 in the pls model drake et al 2015 the tyrosine like c3 was easy to biodegradation due to its less complicated molecular composition than the tryptophan like c1 and correlated with the rapidly cycled fractions in algal derived dom bai et al 2017 however some organics produced from phytoplankton under nutrient stress were less biodegradable and persisted in the dissolved phase leading to the accumulation of recalcitrant dom after the algal bloom asmala et al 2018 furthermore biotransformation and photo transformation can regulate dom bioreactivity without changing the bix and fi values hansen et al 2016 thus the bdoc5 was unrelated to dom source indicators although the dom optical properties presented distinct seasonal patterns at the three bays the temporal synchronicity in bdoc5 suggested that the simultaneous increase of freshly released autodom elevated the c mineralization in the water columns in the bloom season the end member mixing experiments also indicated that the bioreactivity of mixtures was mainly dependent on the priming effect of faom on recalcitrant dom therefore the freshly released autodom played a crucial role in determining the bioreactivity of dom pools even though the strong terrestrial input brought recalcitrant humic substances into the lake water however with the decreased terrestrial input in the post bloom season the autodom with a higher humification degree was difficult to biodegradation resulting in a lower bdoc5 furthermore the aaom and its mixture with rdom both showed extremely low availability to microbes highlighting that the source was not the decisive factor indicating the variations of dom bioreactivity 4 2 structure reactivity between dom and estrone biodegradation potential contaminants at trace levels were too low for maximal induction of or recognition by bacterial enzymes so the transformation of contaminants would be associated with particular metabolic stages of the major organic substrate biodegradation stumpe and marschner 2009 enhanced contaminant biodegradation with the increased doc concentration was reported in various aquatic systems tan et al 2013 tang et al 2017 however the concentration dependent effect of dom varied with its structure and reactivity with the turnover of high concentrations of complex dom the stimulated microbial respiration and growth were favourable to contaminant biodegradation nevertheless the increased recalcitrant dom could not be readily used by microbes and showed no or little enhancement of bacterial activity and estrogen biodegradation hence the e1 biodegradation was primarily associated with the microbial cycling of biodegradable dom resulting in a closer connection between ebp5 with bdoc5 than with bulk doc fig 5b and 5c a previous study observed the parallel decrease of contaminants and doc availability due to the coupling of the processes via microbial co metabolism mueller et al 2021 the correlations between dom compound classes and e1 biodegradation differed with the bioavailability of dom compounds the behaviour of emerging contaminants with high removals was previously correlated with that of the fluorescence indices associated with aromatic proteins and tyrosine like components sgroi et al 2017 nevertheless the positive correlations between c ebp5 and r t c indicated the similar or linked turnover processes of e1 and bioavailable dom as dom structural compositions not as individual parafac fluorescent components the coexistence of individual dom compounds showed interactive effects on the microbial community members affecting their ability to handle available resources our previous studies revealed that the interaction between protein and lipid like dom showed determination on bacterial community assemblages with enhanced interspecies cooperation for degrading refractory organics bai et al 2020 in contrast the change from more fresh to humic like compounds decreased the bacterial biomass community diversity and metabolic activity bai et al 2022 indeed humic fresh was identified as the moderately and negatively influential factor of c ebp5 however pls analysis demonstrated the weak linkage between dom source indicators and e1 biodegradation the end member mixing experiments further provided substantial evidence that the promotion of autodom on e1 biodegradation was dependent on its freshness with significantly decreased c ebp5 in the presence of aaom and its mixture with rdom these results suggested that the structure rather than the source of dom played a crucial role in determining e1 biodegradation microbes often exhibited similar temporal turnover rates habitat niche breadths and co occurrence patterns when exposed to different kinds of dom with similar structural compositions zhou et al 2021 also the in situ transformation which may alter the structure of autodom similar to that of allodom made the mediation in e1 biodegradation unrelated to dom sources besides the weak priming effect of humic acids on microbial metabolism the negative correlation between ebp5 and humic related indicators was associated with the strong complexation of humic substances and estrogens while humic acids can increase the apparent solubility and enhance the diffusion and mass transfer of contaminants the presence of various reactive groups such as carboxylic phenolic and quinones can bind and modulate the existing form of contaminants lee et al 2011 compared to the low molecular weight organic compounds such as amino acids carbohydrates and carboxylic acids the high molecular weight components exhibited a stronger affinity to estrogens and decreased their availability to microbes the relationship between e1 biodegradation and dom molecular mass distribution was further evidenced by the positive correlation between s r and c ebp5 in the pls model in addition the difference between the predictive strengths of bdoc5 and c ebp5 using dom optical parameters implied that the model based on these predictor variables was more likely to explain the co metabolism of dom rather than the complexation 4 3 conclusions and environmental implications in combination with field investigations and laboratory experiments we show for the first time that the biodegradation of e1 was closely related to the distribution and optical properties of dom and therefore was primarily controlled by the hydrologic processes besides the doc concentration the dom optical indices of humic fresh and molecular weights were influential factors controlling the c ebp5 in the water column of lake taihu whereas the e1 biodegradation was not highly correlated with dom source indicators while the aromatic structures negatively correlated with c ebp5 the low molecular weight compounds strongly and positively correlated with e1 biodegradation we provide new insights into the temporal variation of e1 biodegradation in eutrophic freshwater lakes 1 in the bloom season the freshly produced low molecular mass compounds from algal derived exudates increased c mineralization and c ebp5 even though the input of high molecular weight aromatic structures in allodom weakened the promotive effects 2 with the decline of algal bloom the in situ processes e g microbial ageing shifted the dom structure to recalcitrant components with the increased molecular weight leading to the relatively lower biodegradation potential our results partially explained whether organic rich environments are sinks or sources for the estrogens particularly in the algal bloom affected regions future studies are needed to develop this framework by including other environmental factors such as ph redox and sulfur geochemistry known to modulate the activity of microorganisms and estrogen biodegradation by considering the bioaccumulation biomagnification processes and by extending it to other aquatic ecosystems such as ponds rivers estuaries and sea water quality monitoring assessment and management based on fluorescent dom is a promising strategy due to the high sensitivity low cost and possibility of developing real time sensors based on the results of the pls r modelling the strong and positive relationship between the optical indices related to r t c indicated that a higher peak t and lower peak c fluorescence intensity may be a valuable indicator for water pollution assessment and lake management previous results support this assumption that the removal of emerging contaminants was correlated with that of the fluorescence indices associated with tryptophan like fluorescence in wastewater treatment plants and constructed wetlands sgroi et al 2018 sgroi et al 2017 the very high explanatory and predictive power of pls r modelling demonstrated that ebp could be quantitatively predicted from the optical parameters of dom even in the bloom and in the post bloom seasons overall this study provides additional insights into the variable influences of dom on estrogen biodegradation and a robust prediction of seasonal estrogen biodegradation in eutrophic waters which may have important implications for regional contaminant attenuation on a temporal scale

3117,vegetation changes can strongly influence the hydrological cycle including streamflow but the effects of plant diseases have seldom been described in the mid 20th century the invasion of an exotic disease white pine blister rust precipitated widespread mortality of western white pine wwp pinus monticola dougl in the northern rocky mountains usa these events converted a forest dominated by white pine into one dominated by more shade tolerant tree species the long term hydrological implications of this historical shift in forest composition have not been adequately explored in part because collocated long term vegetation meteorology and hydrology data are rare we assembled long term streamflow climate and vegetation records for a small 4 0 km2 forested watershed in the u s northern rocky mountains we used a minimally calibrated physically based model to simulate historical changes in the water budget based on observed vegetation changes along with the historical climate the observed hydrological anomalies were attributed to a combination of white pine blister rust induced tree mortality harvest and eventual species replacement small increases in streamflow began in the basin in the 1940s when the basal area of wwp began to decrease more dramatic increases in streamflow started after harvesting began in 1966 based on both observations and modeling streamflow increased by 131 179 mm between the 1940s and the 2000s 30 40 of the 2000s streamflow in contrast to documented regional streamflow declines approximately 1 3 of the flow changes were attributed to blister rust and 2 3 to harvest as shade tolerant species instead of wwp regenerated in response to both this study highlights the importance of long term ecohydrological data which made it possible to detect the influence of the invasion of an exotic pathogen against a backdrop of periodic timber harvest it also showed that the species replacement after these disturbances caused long term

informative example of dramatic vegetation change and its impact on water cycling tinkham et al 2015 wwp was prevalent throughout the northern rocky mountains on all aspects and slopes and was resistant to endemic disturbances jain and graham 2005 between 1900 and 1992 the wwp dominated area in northern idaho declined from about 8000 km2 to merely 47 km2 fig s1 fins et al 2002 harvey et al 2008 neuenschwander et al 1999 the mortality had multiple causes including widespread logging beginning in the late 19th century neuenschwander et al 1999 strong and webb 1970 and an extensive high severity fire in northern idaho the big burn in 1910 fig s1 diaz and swetnam 2013 egan 2009 plummer 1912 wwp mortality on an even larger scale occurred after 1910 due to an exotic disease lethal to wwp the disease white pine blister rust is caused by the fungus cronartium ribicola native to asia and accidentally introduced by timber importers from europe to british columbia it subsequently spread to northern idaho in the 1920s harvey et al 2008 neuenschwander et al 1999 white pine blister rust not only killed most adult trees but also dramatically reduced the survival of wwp seedlings and hence inhibited regeneration tomback and achuff 2010 despite efforts to control the spread of blister rust and breeding of rust resistant seedlings wwp mortality accelerated in the 1950s in northern idaho and the species has yet to recover to the point of stand dominance neuenschwander et al 1999 unless planted and carefully managed schnepf and schwandt 2006 a new ecological and hydrological regime may have started in this forest ecosystem with the gradual replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species namely western redcedar thuja plicata donn ex d don western hemlock tsuga heterophylla raf sarg and grand fir abies grandis dougl ex d don lindl these shade tolerant species transpire approximately half the water relative to wwp per unit leaf area reflected in highly different stomatal limits on transpiration pangle et al 2015 due to such a large difference in transpiration the high initial cover of wwp and the magnitude of wwp mortality wwp mortality is expected to decrease transpiration with concomitant increases in streamflow this may cause a slower hydrological response than from relatively sudden disturbances such as forest harvest wildfire and insect outbreaks that have been more widely investigated despite the widespread replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species in the interior u s northwest and possible impacts on water cycling such historical impacts on water budgets have not been quantitatively assessed with either observations or modeling in this case modeling facilitates disentangling the hydrologic processes due to climate and vegetation changes that result in net changes in streamflow a rare opportunity was found in a data rich small watershed in an experimental forest in northern idaho where wwp vegetation was gradually replaced by shade tolerant tree species the watershed was excluded from widespread commercial wwp logging and fire impacts in the early 20th century some small scale harvests did happen after the early 20th century but detailed harvest records were uncovered and compiled streamflow and climatic data were systematically monitored prior to shifts in species composition within the watershed link et al 2015 tinkham et al 2015 because of the valuable historical records this study serves as a novel example to assess and parse the hydrological impacts of shifts in forest cover type due to introduced blister rust and limited timber harvest we hypothesized that a significant increase in streamflow should have occurred due to wwp mortality and small scale timber harvest due to the large difference in water consumption between historical wwp dominant and current shade tolerant forests the specific objective of this research is to quantify long term differences in observed streamflows that are specifically attributed to species changes from gradual pathogen induced mortality versus vegetation changes from discrete harvests although a paired catchment experiment would be the most effective approach to reveal such impacts this option was not available since no watersheds with wwp vegetation unimpacted by blister rust remained therefore this study employed a multi decadal data record and physically based hydrological model to test the hypothesis by quantitatively estimating changes in transpiration streamflow and soil moisture due to hydroclimatic and vegetation changes in the basin over 70 years the model was previously parameterized for this watershed wei et al 2016 a wealth of long term onsite observational data facilitated the analysis and modeling including climate snow depth streamflow forest cover and inventory and management history 2 methods 2 1 study area the priest river experimental forest pref 25 8 km2 established in 1911 wellner 1976 is located in the panhandle of northern idaho 48 45 n 116 49 w which is in the continental maritime hydroclimatic region of the united states the annual mean temperature is 6 7 c and the annual mean precipitation is 808 mm at pref headquarters 726 m above sea level national climatic data center ncdc station no usc00107386 from 1930 to 2011 fig 1 approximately 65 of the annual precipitation occurred from november to april fig 2 within pref annual mean precipitation varies with orographic enhancement between 812 mm yr 1 at low elevations 675 m to 1270 mm yr 1 at higher elevations 1825 m pangle et al 2015 soils at pref are loamy inceptisols with a 10 20 cm deep volcanic ash cap at the top of the mineral soil berryman et al 2014 and the bedrock is metamorphic rocks comprised of gneiss and schists the u s general soil map statsgo2 c f srivastava et al 2020 pref has long term records for forest composition hydrometeorology and streamflow a gauging station benton dam has recorded streamflow since 1939 for the upper benton basin ubb a small 4 0 km2 400 ha watershed which ranges from 805 to 1700 m in elevation fig 1 these observational data were mainly used for driving the process based model to assess water balance changes resulting from vegetation dynamics see 2 5 and 2 6 forest disturbances in ubb were recorded since the establishment of pref there were two reports of fires in ubb since the inception of pref in 1911 in 1967 there was a prescribed fire that burned 16 20 ha in august 2008 a small fire burned 2 8 ha before it was quickly extinguished on the southern boundary of pref and mostly outside the ridgeline that delineates the ubb drainage the earliest records of harvest activity were neither accurately mapped within ubb nor labeled as to the type of cut but based on available records and given logging practices at that time were most likely selective cuts of 8 1 ha in 1924 1926 and 36 4 ha in 1939 in 1941 a 91 m 1336 m strip 32 4 ha running n s was clearcut across the entire ubb in an early forestry study these harvest events were considered as part of the background condition for purposes of this study beginning in 1941 because we used the 1940s as a calibration period see 2 6 for detail there were 13 records of small experimental timber harvests in ubb in 13 years from 1966 to 2010 table s2 most of the harvested areas were clearcuts followed by natural regeneration tree replanting in ubb was limited to 16 ha in 1990 ponderosa pine and western white pine and 2 ha in 2007 ponderosa pine western white pine western larch the fraction of land area harvested in each entry ranged from 0 9 ha 0 2 to 36 ha 9 0 mean 2 3 such a small percentage of area harvested per entry is expected to have a minor short term effect on streamflow stednick 1996 but cumulatively may produce larger effects we therefore estimated the impact of harvests with the physically based model see 2 6 to deconvolve the interacting effects of forest harvest regeneration and wwp mortality on streamflow forests at pref and ubb contained therein were historically dominated by wwp fig 1 before the 1950s tinkham et al 2015 and are currently dominated by shade tolerant conifer species fig 3 five major shade tolerant tree species western hemlock western redcedar subalpine fir engelmann spruce and grand fir comprise 60 0 of the current basal area while intermediate shade tolerant douglas fir and wwp comprised 20 3 and 2 9 respectively of current basal area duursma et al 2003 fig 3 in addition to lower transpiration and productivity relative to wwp pangle et al 2015 shade tolerant species are susceptible to native root diseases e g laminated root disease armillaria root disease brown cubical rot and butt rot while pine species are normally tolerant to them neuenschwander et al 1999 therefore the new forest types are more susceptible to native root diseases which may further reduce forest productivity and evapotranspiration cruickshank et al 2011 lockman et al 2016 and further contribute to increased streamflow 2 2 vegetation change we estimated the vegetation changes based on a network of permanent plots in pref which have been maintained since as early as 1914 there were 25 permanent plots in total we used plots with 60 years of records n 21 fig s2 and fig 4 plots were measured every 5 10 years to document forest growth and yield during each measurement campaign tree species were recorded and dbh was measured we used these data to quantify changes in basal area and tree species composition as the measurements were conducted in different years across plots fig s2 we averaged the data by decade to facilitate comparison through time water balance simulations with the simultaneous heat and water shaw model see 2 5 and 2 6 for more detail required stand properties i e leaf area index lai aboveground biomass and vegetation height as inputs but the historical observations were lacking therefore we used the observed basal area information of permanent plots to inform lai aboveground biomass and vegetation height for the model parameterization specifically we used modeled forest growth for a very similar shade tolerant forest in northern idaho wei et al 2014 wei et al 2018 as a reference and cross referenced lai biomass and vegetation height information with observed basal area in pref fig s3 the widely used forest growth model physiological processes predicting growth 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 was used to derive key canopy parameters for different age classes the modeled forest growth was well calibrated and validated with observed stand properties transpiration and stable carbon isotope data wei et al 2014 moreover the simulation started from a new regenerating forest post harvest and hence represented a similar growth condition to the regeneration of forests at pref after harvest 2 3 streamflow and snow observations streamflow has been recorded at benton dam with two trapezoidal cipolletti weirs since 1939 stage 1957 water flows through only the smaller weir with a 1 foot 0 3048 m crest at low flow and through both the smaller and the larger weir with a 10 foot crest when the head exceeds 0 75 feet the water level is recorded in a stilling well connected to a pond above the dam stage 1957 different equipment and media were used to record the data throughout the historical period ranging from mechanical strip charts to electronic water level sensors connected to electronic data loggers data were presented in a variety of formats ranging from undigitized strip charts digitized printed records and various electronic formats link et al 2015 stage 1957 wei et al 2016 data from different equipment and media were error checked and cross compared for quality control all quality controlled streamflow data and metadata were compiled into a common electronic format for a digital archive which is publicly available link et al 2015 snow depth and snow water equivalent swe were recorded in pref daily snow depth data were measured at the headquarters since 1911 725 m a s l ncdc usc00107386 monthly snow depth and swe data were measured at benton meadow station 725 m a s l since 1936 natural resources conservation service the headquarters and benton meadow sites are in close proximity downstream and west of ubb fig 1 2 4 historical hydrometeorological data to drive the model we used observed and estimated hydrometeorological data from 1930 to 2010 which included daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin precipitation shortwave radiation relative humidity and wind speed details about historical hydrometeorological data can be found in the online supplementary materials 2 5 water budget simulations we used a physically based hydrological model with multi layer vegetation the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger et al 1990 flerchinger et al 1998 flerchinger et al 1996 link et al 2004 to simulate the water budget in the ubb shaw is a one dimensional model based on fundamental physical hydrological processes it simulates the transfer of heat liquid water and water vapor through a plant snow residue soil system on a user selected time step ranging from hourly to daily daily in this study it includes major hydrological processes precipitation snowpack development and ablation evaporation transpiration infiltration and soil moisture redistribution deep percolation and runoff detailed descriptions of the model can be found in previous publications chauvin et al 2011 flerchinger et al 1998 flerchinger et al 1996 link et al 2004 we simulated the water budget of the ubb in each hru to estimate potential differences between current shade tolerant and historical wwp dominated vegetation and to compare the results to observed streamflows the water budget of a watershed can be written as 1 p e t r q δ s where p precipitation e evaporation sublimation tr transpiration q streamflow and δs changes in soil water storage all in mm year 1 all these components are directly simulated in the shaw model except streamflow which we assume is equal to the sum of simulated deep percolation and surface runoff for annual water balance estimates assuming negligible amounts of deep seepage this is a reasonable assumption for the ubb because it is a steep watershed with shallow soil overlaying highly impermeable bedrock cline et al 1977 therefore deep percolation is expected to rapidly convert to streamflow this approach was shown to be effective for quantifying the annual water balance at ubb wei et al 2016 by calibrating the transpiration but not streamflow the model reasonably simulated streamflow without systematic errors the successful simulation of streamflow without calibration also corroborated the expectation that deep percolation was minimal vegetation dynamics used as inputs to shaw have direct impacts on the simulated water budget lai describes the amount of transpiring surface in the model an increase in lai typically increases transpiration and precipitation interception but also decreases soil evaporation due to increased radiation interception vegetation height has offsetting impacts on evapotranspiration increased vegetation height increases surface roughness and therefore turbulent transfer from the top of the canopy it also impedes water vapor transport from leaves and the soil surface to the top of the canopy such changes are implicitly included in the turbulent transfer and radiation routines in the model therefore evapotranspiration dynamics controlled by different canopy characteristics were well represented in our modeling approach see 2 6 for more detail we used a semi distributed simulation approach by implementing the shaw model for 21 hrus for ubb which were defined based on aspect elevation slope and harvest history eight hrus were first delineated wei et al 2016 based on similar vegetation in 2002 as well as prevailing aspect s south w west n north and elevation l low m mid h high fig 1 table s1 distinct climate drivers were used for each of these eight original hrus to account for spatial variations in microclimate based on a network of 18 meteorological stations see online supplementary material and wei et al 2016 for more details we then further partitioned 13 additional hrus from these eight hrus to delimited discrete harvest events i e each new hru represented the area associated with one harvest event table s2 fig 1d e g 1966 indicates the hru that was logged in 1966 which makes it possible to simulate vegetation dynamics in the harvested areas these new hrus used identical climatic drivers to the original hru from which most of their area was partitioned the shaw model was calibrated and validated with observed data for ubb in wei et al 2016 for the water years 2004 2009 the model was minimally parameterized kirchner 2006 to retain the chance that the model will fail to reasonably represent observations if it does not accurately represent key physical processes or was unreasonably parameterized to avoid issues of parameter uncertainty and equifinality that could substantially alter our conclusions we used a multi objective parameterization approach that calibrated individual parameters against relevant model outputs wei et al 2016 following efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 we note that multi objective calibrations against not only multiple sites or responses such as high and low flows but also against multiple hydrologic variables such as snow water equivalent and transpiration can reduce equifinality and attendant uncertainty as have been noted in other modeling investigations kuppel et al 2018 széles et al 2020 specifically snow depth and water equivalent were used to calibrate the rain snow temperature threshold sap flow based transpiration estimates were used to estimate minimum stomatal resistance and the responsiveness of stomatal resistance to environmental conditions soil moisture observations were used to refine estimates of soil hydraulic parameters following these calibration efforts the model reasonably simulated interannual streamflows we estimated the model efficiency in this study in terms of nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative performance measure rrelative seibert et al 2018 nse is calculated as follows 2 nse 1 i 1 n x obs x sim 2 i 1 n x obs x ave 2 where xsim xobs and xave are simulated values observed values and mean of observed values respectively n is number of pairs of compared values nse values indicated model efficiency which ranged from to 1 where nse 0 indicates that the model predicts as accurately as the observed mean nse 1 indicates a perfect match between simulations and observations and nse 0 indicates a worse model performance than the mean we also applied the relative performance measure rrelative to estimate the efficiency of a simulation relative to a suite of simulations with possible parameter sets and selected the best model parameter seibert et al 2018 as 3 r relative r x r lower r upper r lower where the upper benchmark rupper is suggested to be the best possible simulation that a model can achieve and the lower benchmark rlower to be the minimum expectation of a model with fundamental hydrological processes see more details in seibert et al 2018 we applied the rrelative measure to this study to select the vegetation parameter and scenario that best represented the vegetation dynamics and changes in the water budget rupper and rlower were determined based on uncertainty analyses of minimum stomatal resistance for each vegetation type described in detail in the next section 2 6 model implementation we estimated the impact of vegetation changes on streamflow to quantitatively represent how vegetation in the hrus changed over time although the shaw model reasonably simulated the water budget in ubb in wei et al 2016 these simulations only covered the water year 2004 2009 and the long term vegetation changes were not considered we obtained most parameters from wei et al 2016 but three key components differed from this previous study to represent the moderate but important functional long term changes in vegetation which were the changes in species composition small timber harvest experiments and forest growth we applied five scenarios to represent these vegetation changes including 1 noveg in the absence of vegetation and thus without transpiration 2 shadetol using the shade tolerant vegetation throughout the modeled time series with streamflow simulations that were calibrated based on observations from 2000 to 2009 3 wwp using the historical white pine dominated vegetation as model inputs with streamflow simulations that were calibrated based on observations from 1940 to 1949 prior to blister rust logging and climate change throughout the simulated time series 1940 1949 4 log which estimated the temporal dynamics of logging recovery and species replacement in the absence of blister rust over the simulated time series and 5 log rust which estimated the temporal dynamics of mortality caused by blister rust invasion logging recovery and species replacement over the simulated time series that is the most realistic representation of the actual vegetation dynamics within the study watershed the first scenario snoveg used identical parameters to the others except that vegetation biomass height and lai were all set to 0 throughout the simulation period thus transpiration was eliminated and any evapotranspiration simulated by the model was driven by abiotic processes comparing simulations of other vegetation scenarios with snoveg reveals the vegetation effects especially on evapotranspiration the swwp and sshadetol scenarios set sideboards on the analysis by assuming constant vegetation as found in either 1940s western white pine dominated or 2000s shade tolerant species dominated this approach is similar to those used to assess the hydrological effects of discrete land cover changes following fire seibert et al 2010 thus scenarios swwp and sshadetol gave an indication of the species replacement effects in the absence of disturbances and regrowth specifically we applied identical vegetation height 17 6 m lai 7 3 m 2 m 2 and biomass 31 7 kg m 2 across all 21 hrus based on lidar estimated unharveted forest wei et al 2016 and vegetation remained unchanged in all years the minimum stomatal resistance rs0 was the only parameter that differed between the two scenarios the rs0 value was determined by simulating streamflow with a pool of rs0 values from 72 to 422 s m 1 with a 10 s m 1 increment fig s4 this range of rs0 should cover the wide range of variations in rs0 from wwp low rs0 to shade tolerance tree species high rs0 in this area pangle et al 2015 the rs0 value with the largest rrelative in simulating annual streamflow in 1940s was selected for swwp and that for 2000s was selected for sshadetol rupper and rlower were set as the maximum and minimum nse values among all simulations respectively while other vegetation parameters may create some uncertainty in historical simulations rs0 and lai are the vegetation parameters with the greatest impact on hydrologic fluxes in shaw marshall et al 2021 lai was relatively well constrained based on basal area records from the permanent plots and 3 pg model simulations figs s2 and s3 besides the three constant vegetation scenarios we implemented two scenarios to represent the hydrological effects of vegetation dynamics resulting from harvest blister rust and regrowth fig 5 the first of these slog was set to estimate the effect of sporadic harvests on the water budget and the second slog rust estimated the combined effects of harvest and blister rust mortality slog rust also accounted for the gradual replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species and was intended to represent the actual historical vegetation changes in ubb slog began with the same static wwp vegetation as in swwp and remained unchanged in unlogged hrus but all wwp vegetation was removed in each logged hru in its respective harvest year fig 1d the shade tolerant vegetation then emerged in these logged hrus and the vegetation height lai and biomass were updated every year after logging as noted above the growth data after logging were obtained from well calibrated and validated model simulations of similar shade tolerant forest in an experimental watershed 130 km south of pref which simulated forest regrowth after logging in the 1930s du et al 2016 wei et al 2014 wei et al 2018 fig s3 see 2 2 for detail the primary difference between this and the slog simulation was that the static wwp vegetation was gradually replaced due to blister rust induced mortality fig 5 that most closely matched the forest history in the watershed the basal areas in fig 4 were translated into matching biomass lai and vegetation height fig s3 based on simulated forest growth in wei et al 2014 see 2 2 for detail the implementation of these scenarios made it possible to estimate the effects of transpiration from the observed vegetation changes slog rust snoveg species replacement alone swwp sshadetol harvest alone slog swwp and blister rust alone slog slog rust we compared the model efficiency across five scenarios with rrelative the rupper and rlower were set as the maximum and minimum nse values among all simulations in five scenarios combined with the simulations with rs0 values from 72 to 422 s m 1 respectively due to the importance of winter precipitation in the water cycle at the study watershed we compared the snow simulations with observations to test if snow regimes may have contributed to the changes in the water budget we ran the model based on the headquarters site to test the quality of the simulation of snow depth and swe we chose this site as it has snow depth data since 1911 and swe data since 1936 we applied all but the vegetation parameters from wei et al 2016 to the simulation of the headquarters site as it was located in a small clearing where there was no canopy effect on snow dynamics simulations were driven by on site precipitation and temperature data at headquarters wind speed shortwave radiation and absolute humidity data were identical to the data for the eight primary hrus 3 results 3 1 forest composition changes the 21 permanent monitoring plots with 60 year records revealed the forest composition change at pref fig 4 and fig s2 the mean basal area of wwp began a continuous decline in the 1960s 23 5 m2 ha 1 that continued until the last observation in the 2000s 6 0 m2 ha 1 fig 4 we defined the starting point of decreased basal area as the measurement time after which basal area declined in two consecutive measurements among 20 plots with decreased wwp basal area the starting point varied from the 1940s to the 1970s across plots five plots for the 1940s four plots for the 1950s eight plots for the 1960s and three plots for the 1970s fig s2 therefore the 1940s 1970s were noted as the period when blister rust induced wwp mortality was initiated within different stands in the watershed in comparison the mean basal area of shade tolerant conifers steadily increased from the 1930s 6 8 m2 ha 1 to the 2000 s 26 9 m2 ha 1 at all 21 plots fig s2 and fig 4 consequently the changes in the mean total basal area wwp and shade tolerant conifers of 21 plots were less dramatic relative to wwp or shade tolerant conifers from the 1930s to the 2000s and the total basal area was again approaching the 1960s maximum by the 2000s 3 2 annual and seasonal changes in hydrometeorology annual streamflow increased significantly from 1939 to 2010 at ubb while annual precipitation tmin tmax and snow depth did not significantly change based on mann kendall analysis table 1 observed streamflow at ubb increased significantly based on sen s slope for the eight months from late summer through winter august march from 1939 to 2010 table 1 fig s5 no significant increase occurred in the spring and early summer months april july typically characterized by snowmelt runoff meanwhile precipitation and snow depth did not change significantly in any months and temperature changes were significant in only three months tmin increased in march and decreased in october while tmax decreased in december at the headquarters site 3 3 hydrologic model performance and calibration results the shaw model reasonably simulated snow depth at the headquarters site fig 6 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency was 0 85 for the days with either observed or simulated snow depth 0 throughout the simulation period based on the rrelative values rs0 82 s m 1 best simulated the streamflow in the 1940s and rs0 412 s m 1 in the 2000s fig 7 a therefore we used rs0 82 s m 1 for the wwp vegetation and rs0 412 s m 1 for the shade tolerant vegetation 3 4 vegetation change scenarios the static vegetation scenarios sshadetol and swwp demonstrated the water budget components in ubb if vegetation stayed unchanged as either of the functional forest types simulated annual streamflow averaged 533 and 343 mm 190 mm difference and likewise et δs averaged 481 and 671 mm 190 mm difference for sshadetol and swwp respectively from water year 1940 to 2009 fig 8 b and d therefore the 190 mm difference demonstrated lower annual transpiration and higher streamflow contributions for the shade tolerant vegetation relative to the wwp vegetation from the 1940s to 2000s the simulated vegetation dynamics reasonably explained historical changes in the annual streamflow the most realistic vegetation scenario slog rust best simulated the annual streamflow when compared with observations fig 8 this is represented by the best model performance values in terms of nse 0 30 0 33 0 54 0 63 for sshadetol swwp slog and slog rust respectively and r2 between simulations and observations 0 53 0 52 0 62 and 0 66 respectively fig s6 slog rust also best simulated streamflow throughout all years as is shown in the highest rrelative of all years among five scenarios the historical changes in residuals between simulated and observed streamflow fig 8c and the distributions of data in the scatter plots between simulated and observed streamflow fig s6 moreover slog rust best represented the annual variations for et δs fig 8d equivalent to p q and et δs p fig 8e comparing across scenarios revealed the effects of vegetation changes on the water budget first differences in simulations between slog and swwp demonstrated the changes in water budgets caused by harvests the difference in annual streamflow and et between slog and swwp departed from zero after the first harvest event in 1966 fig 8f and g the difference in streamflow ranged from 52 to 116 mm and increased with time from water year 1967 to 2009 at a rate of 0 51 mm year 1 linear regression p 0 01 r2 0 16 second the difference in et ranged from 46 to 125 mm and decreased at a rate of 0 55 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 19 fig 8d third the difference between slog rust and slog demonstrated the impact of wwp mortality due to blister rust fig 8f and g differences in annual streamflow ranged from 1 to 81 mm 0 80 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 70 and differences in annual et ranged from 2 to 81 mm 0 77 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 66 fourth differences between slog rust and swwp demonstrated the combined vegetation changes wwp mortality logging and regeneration of shade tolerant species differences in streamflow ranged from 1 to 180 mm 2 50 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 81 fig 8f and differences in et from 2 to 221 mm 2 42 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 80 fig 8g from water year 1940 to 2009 the simulations with snoveg indicate the expected change in streamflow in an unvegetated scenario fig 9 despite similar year to year variations in streamflow fig 9a simulated annual streamflow in snoveg was higher than slog rust snoveg slog rust and observations snoveg obs fig 9b as would be expected for only abiotically driven evaporative processes such differences in streamflow decreased with time linear regression r2 0 32 and 0 41 and slope 2 91 and 2 19 mm year 1 for snoveg obs and snoveg slog rust respectively both p 0 01 which reflects decreases in transpiration through the simulation years in slog rust fig 9b these differences illustrate the magnitude of historical decreases in transpiration this also indicates the potential immediate increases of streamflow if mortality occurred over the entire watershed which ranged from roughly 500 mm to 300 mm depending on the vegetation type we summarized the evidence for causes of historical changes in streamflow in fig 10 which indicated a 128 179 mm increase between the 1940s and the 2000s we used snoveg and swwp as sideboards these two scenarios assumed zero snoveg or limited swwp only responded to climate changes changes in transpiration due to vegetation changes sshadetol swwp indicates how the shade tolerant and wwp vegetation may respond differently to the climate in each decade assuming static vegetation their difference should also reflect the impact of vegetation changes on streamflow in the 2000s therefore the relative changes between simulated streamflow of snoveg swwp and slog rust indicate changes in streamflow due to changes in vegetation differences were normalized with 1940s difference 0 mm the changes in streamflow increased with time r2 0 92 and 0 91 and slope 3 2 and 2 5 mm year 1 for slog rust snoveg and swwp snoveg respectively both p 0 01 the mean annual difference was 179 mm for slog rust snoveg and 128 mm for slog rust swwp in the 2000s moreover we compared simulated streamflow between two static vegetation scenarios sshadetol swwp which assumed that vegetation did not change through time the difference was 153 mm in the 2000s similar to slog rust snoveg and swwp snoveg 4 discussion this study revealed historical changes in the water budget in a small watershed in the u s interior pacific northwest that were mainly caused by the mortality of wwp and small scale forest harvests we simulated the water budget at ubb based on minimally tuned parameters to represent the change in forest composition changes in water budget and increases in streamflow can be explained by the simulated vegetation changes including the impacts of wwp mortality timber harvesting and regrowth by representing the observed vegetation dynamics fig 8 simulation of the most realistic vegetation scenario slog rust closely represented historical changes in observed streamflows from the 1940s to the 2000s fig 8 fig 9 this scenario should also provide insights into the water budget when observed streamflow was incomplete especially in the 1960 1980s 4 1 causes for streamflow changes a key question is how much has streamflow increased and why combining multiple lines of evidence provided a new quantitative understanding of this question figs 8 10 first the trends in temperature precipitation and snow depth cannot explain increases in annual and monthly streamflow from august to march warming annual temperatures fig 2 should result in reduced streamflows rather than increases due to increasing evaporative demand and differences in snow vs rain driven hydrology berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2022 long term temperature increases were only significant for the annual minimums and were very subtle in contrast to more pronounced regional trends dalton et al 2013 possibly because cold air drainage contributed to inversions at the site duursma pers comm that led to local atmospheric decoupling as has been observed at other mountainous sites in the region daly et al 2010 wei et al 2018 observed annual precipitation in pref did not change significantly at the pref headquarters 726 m a s l table 1 and fig 2 though there was no high elevation precipitation observation at the highest elevation in pref 1700 m which is generally lower than other mountain ranges in the broader region over which widespread declines have been noted luce et al 2013 seasonally an increase in tmin in march may explain an increase in streamflow in this month potentially due to increases in snowmelt cooler temperatures in october and december should reduce evapotranspiration and may hence increase streamflow but temperature and precipitation do not explain streamflow changes in other months therefore it is likely that the increases in monthly streamflow were caused by vegetation changes that reduced evapotranspiration and hence increased streamflow in these months hydrological simulations provided more evidence about how vegetation changes have likely increased streamflows as the second line of evidence the lack of a trend in simulated streamflow in the fixed vegetation scenarios sshadetol swwp and snoveg fig 8b fig 9a indicates that changes in climate were not responsible for the observed streamflow increases the difference between simulations with shade tolerant sshadetol and wwp vegetation swwp demonstrated how streamflow would change if vegetation stayed unchanged sshadetol produced 153 mm higher streamflow than swwp in the 2000s fig 10 third simulated streamflow increased gradually with the more realistic vegetation dynamics slog rust swwp from the 1940s to the 2000s and the difference was 131 mm in the 2000s fig 10 fourth when we use the simulation without vegetation snoveg as a reference fig 9b the normalized difference increased with time and reached 179 mm by the 2000s therefore we estimated that there was approximately 131 179 mm of increase in streamflow from the 1940s to the 2000s based on the three lines of evidence 2nd 4th above this indicated that 30 40 of the observed streamflow 443 mm in the 2000s fig 8f by the 2000s could be attributed to blister rust related wwp mortality with subsequent replacement by shade tolerant species we hypothesized that wwp mortality and timber harvest should increase streamflow and such change could be pronounced since wwp transpires approximately twice as much water relative to regenerated shade tolerant species based on a study in pref that utilized sap flow measurements pangle et al 2015 one may expect that wwp mortality should have played a larger role in the increased streamflow than timber harvests as cumulatively only 30 of the area was harvested in 13 separate years from 1966 to 2008 mean of 2 3 per entry and that the impacts of small harvests on streamflow would be minor stednick 1996 however the impact of wwp mortality on streamflow increased slowly since the 1940s and reached 44 mm per year 1 3 of the total change by the 2000s based on the hydrological simulations in contrast the impact of limited harvest regeneration and growth of shade tolerant species started after the first logging event in 1966 during the simulation period and reached 87 mm 2 3 of the total change by the 2000s fig 8f therefore harvest actually produced about twice as much change in streamflow relative to wwp mortality by the 2000s such continuous impact of harvest may be related to a combination of much larger flow changes following harvest and the slow hydrological recovery after harvest in this region which could take approximately 50 years based on a similar modeling study in the region du et al 2016 this study provides distinctive information about the combined effect of species composition changes and forest harvest making it difficult to compare quantitatively with other studies however if we only compare the effect of timber harvest a 27 km2 watershed in northern idaho mica creek experimental watershed mcew 130 km away from ubb may serve as the closest comparison with a similar elevation mcew 945 1650 m ubb 805 1700 m and vegetation mcew is currently covered with shade tolerant species which regenerated from the clearcut around the 1930s wei et al 2018 a paired and nested watershed study with seven sub watersheds was conducted in 1997 for road construction 2 3 watershed area and in 2001 for timber harvest at mcew du et al 2014 du et al 2016 srivastava et al 2020 in addition to small hydrological impacts from road construction increases in annual streamflow were observed as a function of the clearcut area 284 mm 34 increase from 50 clearcut vegetation removal and 161 mm 23 increase from 25 partial cut vegetation removal based on 16 years of data from 1992 to 2007 srivastava et al 2020 in comparison ubb experienced a 87 mm 20 increase in streamflow between the 1940s and 2000s due to a cumulative 30 4 harvested area such an increase in streamflow per harvested area was lower than mcew as well as the mean water yield increment across 29 watersheds with partial cut thinning or strip cut across the globe 145 mm increase picchio et al 2021 the smaller changes per harvested area at ubb likely resulted from the prolonged harvest period at ubb 13 events from 1966 to 2008 which would reduce cumulative impacts on streamflow due to ample time for forest recovery another vegetation factor that may have played a role in water budget alterations is native root diseases although their impact is not clear at this stage native root diseases occurred on the shade tolerant conifers and reduced tree vigor and transpiration cruickshank et al 2011 neuenschwander et al 1999 it was difficult to separate such an impact on transpiration at the watershed scale as the mortality of wwp and harvest also contributed to transpiration changes moreover the basal area of shade tolerant conifers increased continuously in pref since the 1930s fig 4 such active growth would increase evapotranspiration both canopy interception and transpiration and hence potentially conceal the lesser impact of root diseases on the water budget we lacked a detailed record on the root diseases and a quantitative estimate of their ecophysiological impact in this area therefore further studies are necessary to reveal the additional nuance of root diseases on historical changes in the water budget 4 2 assumptions and limitations this study highlighted the importance of long term forest ecohydrological observations despite the large scale of wwp mortality and the shift to more shade tolerant species it is difficult to quantify the hydrological impact of such an event that occurred gradually over decades and concomitantly with changes in other vegetation parameters that affect hydrological partitioning the long term data made it possible to retrospectively compare differences in the water budget from hydrometeorology since 1910s streamflow since 1930s and vegetation records since 1910s at pref these data made it possible to reveal the mechanisms responsible for apparently anomalous changes in the water budget since the 1930s due to vegetation changes most notably the shift in species composition and harvest events this study should be informative to estimate hydrological changes in surrounding areas with historical wwp mortality in northern idaho intensive logging occurred in the late 19th century neuenschwander et al 1999 strong and webb 1970 and an extensive high severity fire occurred in the big burn in 1910 fig s1 diaz and swetnam 2013 egan 2009 plummer 1912 the impact of vegetation changes on the water budget should be more dramatic in these affected areas than in ubb however two major factors limit thorough analyses of hydrological dynamics in most locations first streamflow data are not available because most hydrological stations were established after the disappearance of wwp for example extensive forest clearing was reported in the priest river shoshone and the clearwater river regions in the early 20th century strong and webb 1970 and the big burn of 1910 consumed much of the forested area in northern idaho fig s1 therefore very limited areas were left where hydrometeorological data were available for tracking the period of wwp mortality and subsequent regeneration fig s1 second although the reduced transpiration should increase water available for streamflow such increasing streamflow trends are counter to the regional trend of declining streamflows likely caused by climate change wei et al 2016 a prevailing regional trend of decreasing observed streamflows from 1950 to 2006 in basins across the broader region luce and holden 2009 appears to be due to the reduced strength of westerlies in the pacific northwest leading to decreasing orographic precipitation at high elevations and to a lesser degree rising temperature and evapotranspiration luce et al 2013 therefore the possible increase of streamflow due to wwp mortality in the montane regions may have been constrained by a background of decreasing precipitation warming temperatures and landcover diversity produced by complex patterns of timber harvest and regeneration in larger watersheds throughout the 20th century without these counteracting widespread changes the impact of wwp mortality could be even larger therefore further studies are required to disentangle the impacts of even more factors than this study on historical changes in the water budget in northern idaho in this study we simulated historical water budget conditions using an intensively monitored site nonetheless hydrologic simulations of this long period necessarily constitute some uncertainties most notably there is some uncertainty in the historical model parameterization for instance a possible risk is that observational uncertainties related to deep percolation or estimation of vegetation characteristics lai height and biomass were compensated for by errors in the rs 0 calibration future work could include a full sensitivity and uncertainty analysis e g pappenberger and beven 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 in order to address this limitation 4 3 management implications management implications of this work should be carefully considered due to the higher transpiration rates of wwp than currently dominant shade tolerant species a naïve interpretation may suggest that wwp restoration should be discouraged to promote higher streamflows in the future with a warmer climate and higher anthropogenic water demand our study indicated a limited impact of wwp mortality on streamflow from the 1940s to the 2000s which increased streamflow by 44 mm by the 2000s besides water yield forest management should also account for multiple values and ecosystem functions across watersheds with diverse landcover wwp the tree named king of many waters strong and webb 1970 provided valuable ecological aesthetic and economic values for the region fins et al 2002 harvey et al 2008 therefore we caution that the restoration of wwp ecosystems should consider all the benefits of diverse ecosystem functions that may outweigh potential hydrological detriments of regenerating wwp forests 5 summary and conclusions this study estimated the changes in forest composition and water budget in a small watershed where previously dominant wwp was gradually replaced by shade tolerant conifers the 4 0 km2 ubb provided a data rich setting to assess the long term effect of wwp mortality on the water budget with which we could explore interacting ecohydrological influences on the water budget we used hydrological simulations to estimate the water budget components under wwp versus shade tolerant species shade tolerant vegetation in the 2000s transpired less than wwp vegetation in the 1940s which caused a 131 179 mm streamflow increase from the 1940s to the 2000s wwp mortality appeared to result in gradually increasing streamflows since the 1950s while 13 small scale harvest events beginning in 1966 further increased streamflow as a result wwp mortality increased streamflow by 44 mm 1 3 of the change and logging increased streamflow by 87 mm 2 3 from the 1940s to the 2000s we assert that similar processes have likely occurred across the region of historic wwp decline but have been largely unrecognized at larger scales due to other interacting processes including changes resulting from climate trends and variations land use and land cover dynamics that have obscured the more subtle species changes this study highlighted the importance of combining long term hydrological and vegetational observations and hydrological modeling to reveal changes in the water budget

3117,vegetation changes can strongly influence the hydrological cycle including streamflow but the effects of plant diseases have seldom been described in the mid 20th century the invasion of an exotic disease white pine blister rust precipitated widespread mortality of western white pine wwp pinus monticola dougl in the northern rocky mountains usa these events converted a forest dominated by white pine into one dominated by more shade tolerant tree species the long term hydrological implications of this historical shift in forest composition have not been adequately explored in part because collocated long term vegetation meteorology and hydrology data are rare we assembled long term streamflow climate and vegetation records for a small 4 0 km2 forested watershed in the u s northern rocky mountains we used a minimally calibrated physically based model to simulate historical changes in the water budget based on observed vegetation changes along with the historical climate the observed hydrological anomalies were attributed to a combination of white pine blister rust induced tree mortality harvest and eventual species replacement small increases in streamflow began in the basin in the 1940s when the basal area of wwp began to decrease more dramatic increases in streamflow started after harvesting began in 1966 based on both observations and modeling streamflow increased by 131 179 mm between the 1940s and the 2000s 30 40 of the 2000s streamflow in contrast to documented regional streamflow declines approximately 1 3 of the flow changes were attributed to blister rust and 2 3 to harvest as shade tolerant species instead of wwp regenerated in response to both this study highlights the importance of long term ecohydrological data which made it possible to detect the influence of the invasion of an exotic pathogen against a backdrop of periodic timber harvest it also showed that the species replacement after these disturbances caused long term changes in the flow regime providing a clear and relevant example of how land cover changes can affect interannual hydrological dynamics keywords vegetation change western white pine mortality long

informative example of dramatic vegetation change and its impact on water cycling tinkham et al 2015 wwp was prevalent throughout the northern rocky mountains on all aspects and slopes and was resistant to endemic disturbances jain and graham 2005 between 1900 and 1992 the wwp dominated area in northern idaho declined from about 8000 km2 to merely 47 km2 fig s1 fins et al 2002 harvey et al 2008 neuenschwander et al 1999 the mortality had multiple causes including widespread logging beginning in the late 19th century neuenschwander et al 1999 strong and webb 1970 and an extensive high severity fire in northern idaho the big burn in 1910 fig s1 diaz and swetnam 2013 egan 2009 plummer 1912 wwp mortality on an even larger scale occurred after 1910 due to an exotic disease lethal to wwp the disease white pine blister rust is caused by the fungus cronartium ribicola native to asia and accidentally introduced by timber importers from europe to british columbia it subsequently spread to northern idaho in the 1920s harvey et al 2008 neuenschwander et al 1999 white pine blister rust not only killed most adult trees but also dramatically reduced the survival of wwp seedlings and hence inhibited regeneration tomback and achuff 2010 despite efforts to control the spread of blister rust and breeding of rust resistant seedlings wwp mortality accelerated in the 1950s in northern idaho and the species has yet to recover to the point of stand dominance neuenschwander et al 1999 unless planted and carefully managed schnepf and schwandt 2006 a new ecological and hydrological regime may have started in this forest ecosystem with the gradual replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species namely western redcedar thuja plicata donn ex d don western hemlock tsuga heterophylla raf sarg and grand fir abies grandis dougl ex d don lindl these shade tolerant species transpire approximately half the water relative to wwp per unit leaf area reflected in highly different stomatal limits on transpiration pangle et al 2015 due to such a large difference in transpiration the high initial cover of wwp and the magnitude of wwp mortality wwp mortality is expected to decrease transpiration with concomitant increases in streamflow this may cause a slower hydrological response than from relatively sudden disturbances such as forest harvest wildfire and insect outbreaks that have been more widely investigated despite the widespread replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species in the interior u s northwest and possible impacts on water cycling such historical impacts on water budgets have not been quantitatively assessed with either observations or modeling in this case modeling facilitates disentangling the hydrologic processes due to climate and vegetation changes that result in net changes in streamflow a rare opportunity was found in a data rich small watershed in an experimental forest in northern idaho where wwp vegetation was gradually replaced by shade tolerant tree species the watershed was excluded from widespread commercial wwp logging and fire impacts in the early 20th century some small scale harvests did happen after the early 20th century but detailed harvest records were uncovered and compiled streamflow and climatic data were systematically monitored prior to shifts in species composition within the watershed link et al 2015 tinkham et al 2015 because of the valuable historical records this study serves as a novel example to assess and parse the hydrological impacts of shifts in forest cover type due to introduced blister rust and limited timber harvest we hypothesized that a significant increase in streamflow should have occurred due to wwp mortality and small scale timber harvest due to the large difference in water consumption between historical wwp dominant and current shade tolerant forests the specific objective of this research is to quantify long term differences in observed streamflows that are specifically attributed to species changes from gradual pathogen induced mortality versus vegetation changes from discrete harvests although a paired catchment experiment would be the most effective approach to reveal such impacts this option was not available since no watersheds with wwp vegetation unimpacted by blister rust remained therefore this study employed a multi decadal data record and physically based hydrological model to test the hypothesis by quantitatively estimating changes in transpiration streamflow and soil moisture due to hydroclimatic and vegetation changes in the basin over 70 years the model was previously parameterized for this watershed wei et al 2016 a wealth of long term onsite observational data facilitated the analysis and modeling including climate snow depth streamflow forest cover and inventory and management history 2 methods 2 1 study area the priest river experimental forest pref 25 8 km2 established in 1911 wellner 1976 is located in the panhandle of northern idaho 48 45 n 116 49 w which is in the continental maritime hydroclimatic region of the united states the annual mean temperature is 6 7 c and the annual mean precipitation is 808 mm at pref headquarters 726 m above sea level national climatic data center ncdc station no usc00107386 from 1930 to 2011 fig 1 approximately 65 of the annual precipitation occurred from november to april fig 2 within pref annual mean precipitation varies with orographic enhancement between 812 mm yr 1 at low elevations 675 m to 1270 mm yr 1 at higher elevations 1825 m pangle et al 2015 soils at pref are loamy inceptisols with a 10 20 cm deep volcanic ash cap at the top of the mineral soil berryman et al 2014 and the bedrock is metamorphic rocks comprised of gneiss and schists the u s general soil map statsgo2 c f srivastava et al 2020 pref has long term records for forest composition hydrometeorology and streamflow a gauging station benton dam has recorded streamflow since 1939 for the upper benton basin ubb a small 4 0 km2 400 ha watershed which ranges from 805 to 1700 m in elevation fig 1 these observational data were mainly used for driving the process based model to assess water balance changes resulting from vegetation dynamics see 2 5 and 2 6 forest disturbances in ubb were recorded since the establishment of pref there were two reports of fires in ubb since the inception of pref in 1911 in 1967 there was a prescribed fire that burned 16 20 ha in august 2008 a small fire burned 2 8 ha before it was quickly extinguished on the southern boundary of pref and mostly outside the ridgeline that delineates the ubb drainage the earliest records of harvest activity were neither accurately mapped within ubb nor labeled as to the type of cut but based on available records and given logging practices at that time were most likely selective cuts of 8 1 ha in 1924 1926 and 36 4 ha in 1939 in 1941 a 91 m 1336 m strip 32 4 ha running n s was clearcut across the entire ubb in an early forestry study these harvest events were considered as part of the background condition for purposes of this study beginning in 1941 because we used the 1940s as a calibration period see 2 6 for detail there were 13 records of small experimental timber harvests in ubb in 13 years from 1966 to 2010 table s2 most of the harvested areas were clearcuts followed by natural regeneration tree replanting in ubb was limited to 16 ha in 1990 ponderosa pine and western white pine and 2 ha in 2007 ponderosa pine western white pine western larch the fraction of land area harvested in each entry ranged from 0 9 ha 0 2 to 36 ha 9 0 mean 2 3 such a small percentage of area harvested per entry is expected to have a minor short term effect on streamflow stednick 1996 but cumulatively may produce larger effects we therefore estimated the impact of harvests with the physically based model see 2 6 to deconvolve the interacting effects of forest harvest regeneration and wwp mortality on streamflow forests at pref and ubb contained therein were historically dominated by wwp fig 1 before the 1950s tinkham et al 2015 and are currently dominated by shade tolerant conifer species fig 3 five major shade tolerant tree species western hemlock western redcedar subalpine fir engelmann spruce and grand fir comprise 60 0 of the current basal area while intermediate shade tolerant douglas fir and wwp comprised 20 3 and 2 9 respectively of current basal area duursma et al 2003 fig 3 in addition to lower transpiration and productivity relative to wwp pangle et al 2015 shade tolerant species are susceptible to native root diseases e g laminated root disease armillaria root disease brown cubical rot and butt rot while pine species are normally tolerant to them neuenschwander et al 1999 therefore the new forest types are more susceptible to native root diseases which may further reduce forest productivity and evapotranspiration cruickshank et al 2011 lockman et al 2016 and further contribute to increased streamflow 2 2 vegetation change we estimated the vegetation changes based on a network of permanent plots in pref which have been maintained since as early as 1914 there were 25 permanent plots in total we used plots with 60 years of records n 21 fig s2 and fig 4 plots were measured every 5 10 years to document forest growth and yield during each measurement campaign tree species were recorded and dbh was measured we used these data to quantify changes in basal area and tree species composition as the measurements were conducted in different years across plots fig s2 we averaged the data by decade to facilitate comparison through time water balance simulations with the simultaneous heat and water shaw model see 2 5 and 2 6 for more detail required stand properties i e leaf area index lai aboveground biomass and vegetation height as inputs but the historical observations were lacking therefore we used the observed basal area information of permanent plots to inform lai aboveground biomass and vegetation height for the model parameterization specifically we used modeled forest growth for a very similar shade tolerant forest in northern idaho wei et al 2014 wei et al 2018 as a reference and cross referenced lai biomass and vegetation height information with observed basal area in pref fig s3 the widely used forest growth model physiological processes predicting growth 3 pg landsberg and waring 1997 was used to derive key canopy parameters for different age classes the modeled forest growth was well calibrated and validated with observed stand properties transpiration and stable carbon isotope data wei et al 2014 moreover the simulation started from a new regenerating forest post harvest and hence represented a similar growth condition to the regeneration of forests at pref after harvest 2 3 streamflow and snow observations streamflow has been recorded at benton dam with two trapezoidal cipolletti weirs since 1939 stage 1957 water flows through only the smaller weir with a 1 foot 0 3048 m crest at low flow and through both the smaller and the larger weir with a 10 foot crest when the head exceeds 0 75 feet the water level is recorded in a stilling well connected to a pond above the dam stage 1957 different equipment and media were used to record the data throughout the historical period ranging from mechanical strip charts to electronic water level sensors connected to electronic data loggers data were presented in a variety of formats ranging from undigitized strip charts digitized printed records and various electronic formats link et al 2015 stage 1957 wei et al 2016 data from different equipment and media were error checked and cross compared for quality control all quality controlled streamflow data and metadata were compiled into a common electronic format for a digital archive which is publicly available link et al 2015 snow depth and snow water equivalent swe were recorded in pref daily snow depth data were measured at the headquarters since 1911 725 m a s l ncdc usc00107386 monthly snow depth and swe data were measured at benton meadow station 725 m a s l since 1936 natural resources conservation service the headquarters and benton meadow sites are in close proximity downstream and west of ubb fig 1 2 4 historical hydrometeorological data to drive the model we used observed and estimated hydrometeorological data from 1930 to 2010 which included daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax tmin precipitation shortwave radiation relative humidity and wind speed details about historical hydrometeorological data can be found in the online supplementary materials 2 5 water budget simulations we used a physically based hydrological model with multi layer vegetation the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger et al 1990 flerchinger et al 1998 flerchinger et al 1996 link et al 2004 to simulate the water budget in the ubb shaw is a one dimensional model based on fundamental physical hydrological processes it simulates the transfer of heat liquid water and water vapor through a plant snow residue soil system on a user selected time step ranging from hourly to daily daily in this study it includes major hydrological processes precipitation snowpack development and ablation evaporation transpiration infiltration and soil moisture redistribution deep percolation and runoff detailed descriptions of the model can be found in previous publications chauvin et al 2011 flerchinger et al 1998 flerchinger et al 1996 link et al 2004 we simulated the water budget of the ubb in each hru to estimate potential differences between current shade tolerant and historical wwp dominated vegetation and to compare the results to observed streamflows the water budget of a watershed can be written as 1 p e t r q δ s where p precipitation e evaporation sublimation tr transpiration q streamflow and δs changes in soil water storage all in mm year 1 all these components are directly simulated in the shaw model except streamflow which we assume is equal to the sum of simulated deep percolation and surface runoff for annual water balance estimates assuming negligible amounts of deep seepage this is a reasonable assumption for the ubb because it is a steep watershed with shallow soil overlaying highly impermeable bedrock cline et al 1977 therefore deep percolation is expected to rapidly convert to streamflow this approach was shown to be effective for quantifying the annual water balance at ubb wei et al 2016 by calibrating the transpiration but not streamflow the model reasonably simulated streamflow without systematic errors the successful simulation of streamflow without calibration also corroborated the expectation that deep percolation was minimal vegetation dynamics used as inputs to shaw have direct impacts on the simulated water budget lai describes the amount of transpiring surface in the model an increase in lai typically increases transpiration and precipitation interception but also decreases soil evaporation due to increased radiation interception vegetation height has offsetting impacts on evapotranspiration increased vegetation height increases surface roughness and therefore turbulent transfer from the top of the canopy it also impedes water vapor transport from leaves and the soil surface to the top of the canopy such changes are implicitly included in the turbulent transfer and radiation routines in the model therefore evapotranspiration dynamics controlled by different canopy characteristics were well represented in our modeling approach see 2 6 for more detail we used a semi distributed simulation approach by implementing the shaw model for 21 hrus for ubb which were defined based on aspect elevation slope and harvest history eight hrus were first delineated wei et al 2016 based on similar vegetation in 2002 as well as prevailing aspect s south w west n north and elevation l low m mid h high fig 1 table s1 distinct climate drivers were used for each of these eight original hrus to account for spatial variations in microclimate based on a network of 18 meteorological stations see online supplementary material and wei et al 2016 for more details we then further partitioned 13 additional hrus from these eight hrus to delimited discrete harvest events i e each new hru represented the area associated with one harvest event table s2 fig 1d e g 1966 indicates the hru that was logged in 1966 which makes it possible to simulate vegetation dynamics in the harvested areas these new hrus used identical climatic drivers to the original hru from which most of their area was partitioned the shaw model was calibrated and validated with observed data for ubb in wei et al 2016 for the water years 2004 2009 the model was minimally parameterized kirchner 2006 to retain the chance that the model will fail to reasonably represent observations if it does not accurately represent key physical processes or was unreasonably parameterized to avoid issues of parameter uncertainty and equifinality that could substantially alter our conclusions we used a multi objective parameterization approach that calibrated individual parameters against relevant model outputs wei et al 2016 following efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 we note that multi objective calibrations against not only multiple sites or responses such as high and low flows but also against multiple hydrologic variables such as snow water equivalent and transpiration can reduce equifinality and attendant uncertainty as have been noted in other modeling investigations kuppel et al 2018 széles et al 2020 specifically snow depth and water equivalent were used to calibrate the rain snow temperature threshold sap flow based transpiration estimates were used to estimate minimum stomatal resistance and the responsiveness of stomatal resistance to environmental conditions soil moisture observations were used to refine estimates of soil hydraulic parameters following these calibration efforts the model reasonably simulated interannual streamflows we estimated the model efficiency in this study in terms of nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the relative performance measure rrelative seibert et al 2018 nse is calculated as follows 2 nse 1 i 1 n x obs x sim 2 i 1 n x obs x ave 2 where xsim xobs and xave are simulated values observed values and mean of observed values respectively n is number of pairs of compared values nse values indicated model efficiency which ranged from to 1 where nse 0 indicates that the model predicts as accurately as the observed mean nse 1 indicates a perfect match between simulations and observations and nse 0 indicates a worse model performance than the mean we also applied the relative performance measure rrelative to estimate the efficiency of a simulation relative to a suite of simulations with possible parameter sets and selected the best model parameter seibert et al 2018 as 3 r relative r x r lower r upper r lower where the upper benchmark rupper is suggested to be the best possible simulation that a model can achieve and the lower benchmark rlower to be the minimum expectation of a model with fundamental hydrological processes see more details in seibert et al 2018 we applied the rrelative measure to this study to select the vegetation parameter and scenario that best represented the vegetation dynamics and changes in the water budget rupper and rlower were determined based on uncertainty analyses of minimum stomatal resistance for each vegetation type described in detail in the next section 2 6 model implementation we estimated the impact of vegetation changes on streamflow to quantitatively represent how vegetation in the hrus changed over time although the shaw model reasonably simulated the water budget in ubb in wei et al 2016 these simulations only covered the water year 2004 2009 and the long term vegetation changes were not considered we obtained most parameters from wei et al 2016 but three key components differed from this previous study to represent the moderate but important functional long term changes in vegetation which were the changes in species composition small timber harvest experiments and forest growth we applied five scenarios to represent these vegetation changes including 1 noveg in the absence of vegetation and thus without transpiration 2 shadetol using the shade tolerant vegetation throughout the modeled time series with streamflow simulations that were calibrated based on observations from 2000 to 2009 3 wwp using the historical white pine dominated vegetation as model inputs with streamflow simulations that were calibrated based on observations from 1940 to 1949 prior to blister rust logging and climate change throughout the simulated time series 1940 1949 4 log which estimated the temporal dynamics of logging recovery and species replacement in the absence of blister rust over the simulated time series and 5 log rust which estimated the temporal dynamics of mortality caused by blister rust invasion logging recovery and species replacement over the simulated time series that is the most realistic representation of the actual vegetation dynamics within the study watershed the first scenario snoveg used identical parameters to the others except that vegetation biomass height and lai were all set to 0 throughout the simulation period thus transpiration was eliminated and any evapotranspiration simulated by the model was driven by abiotic processes comparing simulations of other vegetation scenarios with snoveg reveals the vegetation effects especially on evapotranspiration the swwp and sshadetol scenarios set sideboards on the analysis by assuming constant vegetation as found in either 1940s western white pine dominated or 2000s shade tolerant species dominated this approach is similar to those used to assess the hydrological effects of discrete land cover changes following fire seibert et al 2010 thus scenarios swwp and sshadetol gave an indication of the species replacement effects in the absence of disturbances and regrowth specifically we applied identical vegetation height 17 6 m lai 7 3 m 2 m 2 and biomass 31 7 kg m 2 across all 21 hrus based on lidar estimated unharveted forest wei et al 2016 and vegetation remained unchanged in all years the minimum stomatal resistance rs0 was the only parameter that differed between the two scenarios the rs0 value was determined by simulating streamflow with a pool of rs0 values from 72 to 422 s m 1 with a 10 s m 1 increment fig s4 this range of rs0 should cover the wide range of variations in rs0 from wwp low rs0 to shade tolerance tree species high rs0 in this area pangle et al 2015 the rs0 value with the largest rrelative in simulating annual streamflow in 1940s was selected for swwp and that for 2000s was selected for sshadetol rupper and rlower were set as the maximum and minimum nse values among all simulations respectively while other vegetation parameters may create some uncertainty in historical simulations rs0 and lai are the vegetation parameters with the greatest impact on hydrologic fluxes in shaw marshall et al 2021 lai was relatively well constrained based on basal area records from the permanent plots and 3 pg model simulations figs s2 and s3 besides the three constant vegetation scenarios we implemented two scenarios to represent the hydrological effects of vegetation dynamics resulting from harvest blister rust and regrowth fig 5 the first of these slog was set to estimate the effect of sporadic harvests on the water budget and the second slog rust estimated the combined effects of harvest and blister rust mortality slog rust also accounted for the gradual replacement of wwp by shade tolerant species and was intended to represent the actual historical vegetation changes in ubb slog began with the same static wwp vegetation as in swwp and remained unchanged in unlogged hrus but all wwp vegetation was removed in each logged hru in its respective harvest year fig 1d the shade tolerant vegetation then emerged in these logged hrus and the vegetation height lai and biomass were updated every year after logging as noted above the growth data after logging were obtained from well calibrated and validated model simulations of similar shade tolerant forest in an experimental watershed 130 km south of pref which simulated forest regrowth after logging in the 1930s du et al 2016 wei et al 2014 wei et al 2018 fig s3 see 2 2 for detail the primary difference between this and the slog simulation was that the static wwp vegetation was gradually replaced due to blister rust induced mortality fig 5 that most closely matched the forest history in the watershed the basal areas in fig 4 were translated into matching biomass lai and vegetation height fig s3 based on simulated forest growth in wei et al 2014 see 2 2 for detail the implementation of these scenarios made it possible to estimate the effects of transpiration from the observed vegetation changes slog rust snoveg species replacement alone swwp sshadetol harvest alone slog swwp and blister rust alone slog slog rust we compared the model efficiency across five scenarios with rrelative the rupper and rlower were set as the maximum and minimum nse values among all simulations in five scenarios combined with the simulations with rs0 values from 72 to 422 s m 1 respectively due to the importance of winter precipitation in the water cycle at the study watershed we compared the snow simulations with observations to test if snow regimes may have contributed to the changes in the water budget we ran the model based on the headquarters site to test the quality of the simulation of snow depth and swe we chose this site as it has snow depth data since 1911 and swe data since 1936 we applied all but the vegetation parameters from wei et al 2016 to the simulation of the headquarters site as it was located in a small clearing where there was no canopy effect on snow dynamics simulations were driven by on site precipitation and temperature data at headquarters wind speed shortwave radiation and absolute humidity data were identical to the data for the eight primary hrus 3 results 3 1 forest composition changes the 21 permanent monitoring plots with 60 year records revealed the forest composition change at pref fig 4 and fig s2 the mean basal area of wwp began a continuous decline in the 1960s 23 5 m2 ha 1 that continued until the last observation in the 2000s 6 0 m2 ha 1 fig 4 we defined the starting point of decreased basal area as the measurement time after which basal area declined in two consecutive measurements among 20 plots with decreased wwp basal area the starting point varied from the 1940s to the 1970s across plots five plots for the 1940s four plots for the 1950s eight plots for the 1960s and three plots for the 1970s fig s2 therefore the 1940s 1970s were noted as the period when blister rust induced wwp mortality was initiated within different stands in the watershed in comparison the mean basal area of shade tolerant conifers steadily increased from the 1930s 6 8 m2 ha 1 to the 2000 s 26 9 m2 ha 1 at all 21 plots fig s2 and fig 4 consequently the changes in the mean total basal area wwp and shade tolerant conifers of 21 plots were less dramatic relative to wwp or shade tolerant conifers from the 1930s to the 2000s and the total basal area was again approaching the 1960s maximum by the 2000s 3 2 annual and seasonal changes in hydrometeorology annual streamflow increased significantly from 1939 to 2010 at ubb while annual precipitation tmin tmax and snow depth did not significantly change based on mann kendall analysis table 1 observed streamflow at ubb increased significantly based on sen s slope for the eight months from late summer through winter august march from 1939 to 2010 table 1 fig s5 no significant increase occurred in the spring and early summer months april july typically characterized by snowmelt runoff meanwhile precipitation and snow depth did not change significantly in any months and temperature changes were significant in only three months tmin increased in march and decreased in october while tmax decreased in december at the headquarters site 3 3 hydrologic model performance and calibration results the shaw model reasonably simulated snow depth at the headquarters site fig 6 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency was 0 85 for the days with either observed or simulated snow depth 0 throughout the simulation period based on the rrelative values rs0 82 s m 1 best simulated the streamflow in the 1940s and rs0 412 s m 1 in the 2000s fig 7 a therefore we used rs0 82 s m 1 for the wwp vegetation and rs0 412 s m 1 for the shade tolerant vegetation 3 4 vegetation change scenarios the static vegetation scenarios sshadetol and swwp demonstrated the water budget components in ubb if vegetation stayed unchanged as either of the functional forest types simulated annual streamflow averaged 533 and 343 mm 190 mm difference and likewise et δs averaged 481 and 671 mm 190 mm difference for sshadetol and swwp respectively from water year 1940 to 2009 fig 8 b and d therefore the 190 mm difference demonstrated lower annual transpiration and higher streamflow contributions for the shade tolerant vegetation relative to the wwp vegetation from the 1940s to 2000s the simulated vegetation dynamics reasonably explained historical changes in the annual streamflow the most realistic vegetation scenario slog rust best simulated the annual streamflow when compared with observations fig 8 this is represented by the best model performance values in terms of nse 0 30 0 33 0 54 0 63 for sshadetol swwp slog and slog rust respectively and r2 between simulations and observations 0 53 0 52 0 62 and 0 66 respectively fig s6 slog rust also best simulated streamflow throughout all years as is shown in the highest rrelative of all years among five scenarios the historical changes in residuals between simulated and observed streamflow fig 8c and the distributions of data in the scatter plots between simulated and observed streamflow fig s6 moreover slog rust best represented the annual variations for et δs fig 8d equivalent to p q and et δs p fig 8e comparing across scenarios revealed the effects of vegetation changes on the water budget first differences in simulations between slog and swwp demonstrated the changes in water budgets caused by harvests the difference in annual streamflow and et between slog and swwp departed from zero after the first harvest event in 1966 fig 8f and g the difference in streamflow ranged from 52 to 116 mm and increased with time from water year 1967 to 2009 at a rate of 0 51 mm year 1 linear regression p 0 01 r2 0 16 second the difference in et ranged from 46 to 125 mm and decreased at a rate of 0 55 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 19 fig 8d third the difference between slog rust and slog demonstrated the impact of wwp mortality due to blister rust fig 8f and g differences in annual streamflow ranged from 1 to 81 mm 0 80 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 70 and differences in annual et ranged from 2 to 81 mm 0 77 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 66 fourth differences between slog rust and swwp demonstrated the combined vegetation changes wwp mortality logging and regeneration of shade tolerant species differences in streamflow ranged from 1 to 180 mm 2 50 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 81 fig 8f and differences in et from 2 to 221 mm 2 42 mm year 1 p 0 01 r2 0 80 fig 8g from water year 1940 to 2009 the simulations with snoveg indicate the expected change in streamflow in an unvegetated scenario fig 9 despite similar year to year variations in streamflow fig 9a simulated annual streamflow in snoveg was higher than slog rust snoveg slog rust and observations snoveg obs fig 9b as would be expected for only abiotically driven evaporative processes such differences in streamflow decreased with time linear regression r2 0 32 and 0 41 and slope 2 91 and 2 19 mm year 1 for snoveg obs and snoveg slog rust respectively both p 0 01 which reflects decreases in transpiration through the simulation years in slog rust fig 9b these differences illustrate the magnitude of historical decreases in transpiration this also indicates the potential immediate increases of streamflow if mortality occurred over the entire watershed which ranged from roughly 500 mm to 300 mm depending on the vegetation type we summarized the evidence for causes of historical changes in streamflow in fig 10 which indicated a 128 179 mm increase between the 1940s and the 2000s we used snoveg and swwp as sideboards these two scenarios assumed zero snoveg or limited swwp only responded to climate changes changes in transpiration due to vegetation changes sshadetol swwp indicates how the shade tolerant and wwp vegetation may respond differently to the climate in each decade assuming static vegetation their difference should also reflect the impact of vegetation changes on streamflow in the 2000s therefore the relative changes between simulated streamflow of snoveg swwp and slog rust indicate changes in streamflow due to changes in vegetation differences were normalized with 1940s difference 0 mm the changes in streamflow increased with time r2 0 92 and 0 91 and slope 3 2 and 2 5 mm year 1 for slog rust snoveg and swwp snoveg respectively both p 0 01 the mean annual difference was 179 mm for slog rust snoveg and 128 mm for slog rust swwp in the 2000s moreover we compared simulated streamflow between two static vegetation scenarios sshadetol swwp which assumed that vegetation did not change through time the difference was 153 mm in the 2000s similar to slog rust snoveg and swwp snoveg 4 discussion this study revealed historical changes in the water budget in a small watershed in the u s interior pacific northwest that were mainly caused by the mortality of wwp and small scale forest harvests we simulated the water budget at ubb based on minimally tuned parameters to represent the change in forest composition changes in water budget and increases in streamflow can be explained by the simulated vegetation changes including the impacts of wwp mortality timber harvesting and regrowth by representing the observed vegetation dynamics fig 8 simulation of the most realistic vegetation scenario slog rust closely represented historical changes in observed streamflows from the 1940s to the 2000s fig 8 fig 9 this scenario should also provide insights into the water budget when observed streamflow was incomplete especially in the 1960 1980s 4 1 causes for streamflow changes a key question is how much has streamflow increased and why combining multiple lines of evidence provided a new quantitative understanding of this question figs 8 10 first the trends in temperature precipitation and snow depth cannot explain increases in annual and monthly streamflow from august to march warming annual temperatures fig 2 should result in reduced streamflows rather than increases due to increasing evaporative demand and differences in snow vs rain driven hydrology berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2022 long term temperature increases were only significant for the annual minimums and were very subtle in contrast to more pronounced regional trends dalton et al 2013 possibly because cold air drainage contributed to inversions at the site duursma pers comm that led to local atmospheric decoupling as has been observed at other mountainous sites in the region daly et al 2010 wei et al 2018 observed annual precipitation in pref did not change significantly at the pref headquarters 726 m a s l table 1 and fig 2 though there was no high elevation precipitation observation at the highest elevation in pref 1700 m which is generally lower than other mountain ranges in the broader region over which widespread declines have been noted luce et al 2013 seasonally an increase in tmin in march may explain an increase in streamflow in this month potentially due to increases in snowmelt cooler temperatures in october and december should reduce evapotranspiration and may hence increase streamflow but temperature and precipitation do not explain streamflow changes in other months therefore it is likely that the increases in monthly streamflow were caused by vegetation changes that reduced evapotranspiration and hence increased streamflow in these months hydrological simulations provided more evidence about how vegetation changes have likely increased streamflows as the second line of evidence the lack of a trend in simulated streamflow in the fixed vegetation scenarios sshadetol swwp and snoveg fig 8b fig 9a indicates that changes in climate were not responsible for the observed streamflow increases the difference between simulations with shade tolerant sshadetol and wwp vegetation swwp demonstrated how streamflow would change if vegetation stayed unchanged sshadetol produced 153 mm higher streamflow than swwp in the 2000s fig 10 third simulated streamflow increased gradually with the more realistic vegetation dynamics slog rust swwp from the 1940s to the 2000s and the difference was 131 mm in the 2000s fig 10 fourth when we use the simulation without vegetation snoveg as a reference fig 9b the normalized difference increased with time and reached 179 mm by the 2000s therefore we estimated that there was approximately 131 179 mm of increase in streamflow from the 1940s to the 2000s based on the three lines of evidence 2nd 4th above this indicated that 30 40 of the observed streamflow 443 mm in the 2000s fig 8f by the 2000s could be attributed to blister rust related wwp mortality with subsequent replacement by shade tolerant species we hypothesized that wwp mortality and timber harvest should increase streamflow and such change could be pronounced since wwp transpires approximately twice as much water relative to regenerated shade tolerant species based on a study in pref that utilized sap flow measurements pangle et al 2015 one may expect that wwp mortality should have played a larger role in the increased streamflow than timber harvests as cumulatively only 30 of the area was harvested in 13 separate years from 1966 to 2008 mean of 2 3 per entry and that the impacts of small harvests on streamflow would be minor stednick 1996 however the impact of wwp mortality on streamflow increased slowly since the 1940s and reached 44 mm per year 1 3 of the total change by the 2000s based on the hydrological simulations in contrast the impact of limited harvest regeneration and growth of shade tolerant species started after the first logging event in 1966 during the simulation period and reached 87 mm 2 3 of the total change by the 2000s fig 8f therefore harvest actually produced about twice as much change in streamflow relative to wwp mortality by the 2000s such continuous impact of harvest may be related to a combination of much larger flow changes following harvest and the slow hydrological recovery after harvest in this region which could take approximately 50 years based on a similar modeling study in the region du et al 2016 this study provides distinctive information about the combined effect of species composition changes and forest harvest making it difficult to compare quantitatively with other studies however if we only compare the effect of timber harvest a 27 km2 watershed in northern idaho mica creek experimental watershed mcew 130 km away from ubb may serve as the closest comparison with a similar elevation mcew 945 1650 m ubb 805 1700 m and vegetation mcew is currently covered with shade tolerant species which regenerated from the clearcut around the 1930s wei et al 2018 a paired and nested watershed study with seven sub watersheds was conducted in 1997 for road construction 2 3 watershed area and in 2001 for timber harvest at mcew du et al 2014 du et al 2016 srivastava et al 2020 in addition to small hydrological impacts from road construction increases in annual streamflow were observed as a function of the clearcut area 284 mm 34 increase from 50 clearcut vegetation removal and 161 mm 23 increase from 25 partial cut vegetation removal based on 16 years of data from 1992 to 2007 srivastava et al 2020 in comparison ubb experienced a 87 mm 20 increase in streamflow between the 1940s and 2000s due to a cumulative 30 4 harvested area such an increase in streamflow per harvested area was lower than mcew as well as the mean water yield increment across 29 watersheds with partial cut thinning or strip cut across the globe 145 mm increase picchio et al 2021 the smaller changes per harvested area at ubb likely resulted from the prolonged harvest period at ubb 13 events from 1966 to 2008 which would reduce cumulative impacts on streamflow due to ample time for forest recovery another vegetation factor that may have played a role in water budget alterations is native root diseases although their impact is not clear at this stage native root diseases occurred on the shade tolerant conifers and reduced tree vigor and transpiration cruickshank et al 2011 neuenschwander et al 1999 it was difficult to separate such an impact on transpiration at the watershed scale as the mortality of wwp and harvest also contributed to transpiration changes moreover the basal area of shade tolerant conifers increased continuously in pref since the 1930s fig 4 such active growth would increase evapotranspiration both canopy interception and transpiration and hence potentially conceal the lesser impact of root diseases on the water budget we lacked a detailed record on the root diseases and a quantitative estimate of their ecophysiological impact in this area therefore further studies are necessary to reveal the additional nuance of root diseases on historical changes in the water budget 4 2 assumptions and limitations this study highlighted the importance of long term forest ecohydrological observations despite the large scale of wwp mortality and the shift to more shade tolerant species it is difficult to quantify the hydrological impact of such an event that occurred gradually over decades and concomitantly with changes in other vegetation parameters that affect hydrological partitioning the long term data made it possible to retrospectively compare differences in the water budget from hydrometeorology since 1910s streamflow since 1930s and vegetation records since 1910s at pref these data made it possible to reveal the mechanisms responsible for apparently anomalous changes in the water budget since the 1930s due to vegetation changes most notably the shift in species composition and harvest events this study should be informative to estimate hydrological changes in surrounding areas with historical wwp mortality in northern idaho intensive logging occurred in the late 19th century neuenschwander et al 1999 strong and webb 1970 and an extensive high severity fire occurred in the big burn in 1910 fig s1 diaz and swetnam 2013 egan 2009 plummer 1912 the impact of vegetation changes on the water budget should be more dramatic in these affected areas than in ubb however two major factors limit thorough analyses of hydrological dynamics in most locations first streamflow data are not available because most hydrological stations were established after the disappearance of wwp for example extensive forest clearing was reported in the priest river shoshone and the clearwater river regions in the early 20th century strong and webb 1970 and the big burn of 1910 consumed much of the forested area in northern idaho fig s1 therefore very limited areas were left where hydrometeorological data were available for tracking the period of wwp mortality and subsequent regeneration fig s1 second although the reduced transpiration should increase water available for streamflow such increasing streamflow trends are counter to the regional trend of declining streamflows likely caused by climate change wei et al 2016 a prevailing regional trend of decreasing observed streamflows from 1950 to 2006 in basins across the broader region luce and holden 2009 appears to be due to the reduced strength of westerlies in the pacific northwest leading to decreasing orographic precipitation at high elevations and to a lesser degree rising temperature and evapotranspiration luce et al 2013 therefore the possible increase of streamflow due to wwp mortality in the montane regions may have been constrained by a background of decreasing precipitation warming temperatures and landcover diversity produced by complex patterns of timber harvest and regeneration in larger watersheds throughout the 20th century without these counteracting widespread changes the impact of wwp mortality could be even larger therefore further studies are required to disentangle the impacts of even more factors than this study on historical changes in the water budget in northern idaho in this study we simulated historical water budget conditions using an intensively monitored site nonetheless hydrologic simulations of this long period necessarily constitute some uncertainties most notably there is some uncertainty in the historical model parameterization for instance a possible risk is that observational uncertainties related to deep percolation or estimation of vegetation characteristics lai height and biomass were compensated for by errors in the rs 0 calibration future work could include a full sensitivity and uncertainty analysis e g pappenberger and beven 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 in order to address this limitation 4 3 management implications management implications of this work should be carefully considered due to the higher transpiration rates of wwp than currently dominant shade tolerant species a naïve interpretation may suggest that wwp restoration should be discouraged to promote higher streamflows in the future with a warmer climate and higher anthropogenic water demand our study indicated a limited impact of wwp mortality on streamflow from the 1940s to the 2000s which increased streamflow by 44 mm by the 2000s besides water yield forest management should also account for multiple values and ecosystem functions across watersheds with diverse landcover wwp the tree named king of many waters strong and webb 1970 provided valuable ecological aesthetic and economic values for the region fins et al 2002 harvey et al 2008 therefore we caution that the restoration of wwp ecosystems should consider all the benefits of diverse ecosystem functions that may outweigh potential hydrological detriments of regenerating wwp forests 5 summary and conclusions this study estimated the changes in forest composition and water budget in a small watershed where previously dominant wwp was gradually replaced by shade tolerant conifers the 4 0 km2 ubb provided a data rich setting to assess the long term effect of wwp mortality on the water budget with which we could explore interacting ecohydrological influences on the water budget we used hydrological simulations to estimate the water budget components under wwp versus shade tolerant species shade tolerant vegetation in the 2000s transpired less than wwp vegetation in the 1940s which caused a 131 179 mm streamflow increase from the 1940s to the 2000s wwp mortality appeared to result in gradually increasing streamflows since the 1950s while 13 small scale harvest events beginning in 1966 further increased streamflow as a result wwp mortality increased streamflow by 44 mm 1 3 of the change and logging increased streamflow by 87 mm 2 3 from the 1940s to the 2000s we assert that similar processes have likely occurred across the region of historic wwp decline but have been largely unrecognized at larger scales due to other interacting processes including changes resulting from climate trends and variations land use and land cover dynamics that have obscured the more subtle species changes this study highlighted the importance of combining long term hydrological and vegetational observations and hydrological modeling to reveal changes in the water budget

3118,accurate hydrologic forecasting is of vital importance for water resource management and reservoir operation under the changing environments however it is difficult for a standalone method to track the complex hydrological time series with highly nonlinear and nonstationary features to improve the forecasting accuracy this study proposes a hybrid model using compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan and twin support vector machine tsvm optimized by metaheuristic algorithm firstly the ceemdan tool is chosen to divide the original runoff data into several relatively stable subcomponents with various resolutions and frequencies then the tsvm forecasting model is established to extract the deep features of each subseries while the emerging cooperation search algorithm is used to search for satisfying parameter combination the final forecasting value for the original hydrological time series is formulated by aggregating the outputs of all tsvm models long term streamflow data from several hydrological stations in china s yangtze river is used for simulation experimental results reveal that the hybrid model significantly outperforms several conventional forecasting models in prediction accuracy for instance the proposed method improves the root mean squared error and mean absolute error value with about 36 5 and 41 6 reductions compared with the traditional support vector machine at station b thus a novel and effective evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for hydrological forecasting keywords hydrological prediction signal decomposition artificial intelligence evolutionary algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reliable hydrologic forecasting is seen as one of the most significant precondition information for water resource management and reservoir operation ma et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015a zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 runoff often possesses highly nonlinear nonstationary and uncertain features due to the comprehensive influence of multiple factors with complex incidence relations like soil humidity atmospheric temperature and land vegetation li et al 2014 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 besides to tackle the serious water crisis many hydropower reservoirs are put into operation in succession which has made great changes on the rainfall runoff features of natural hydrologic process bai et al 2015 chang et al 2018 meng et al 2019 due to the intense human activities and growing climate changes accurate forecasting models for hydrological time series is becoming more and more difficult in recent years abdullah et al 2015 taormina and chau 2015 yaseen et al 2016 traditionally the physical based approaches based on a couple of carefully designed equations are developed to simulate the complex rainfall runoff process feng and ye 2021 wang et al 2015a wu et al 2010 for these methods a large number of precise data are often required to determine the computational parameters in practice it may be restricted by some unexpected problems to obtain the necessary data on time which inevitably bring about poor forecasting results and high uncertainty liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b to overcome this problem some famous statistical methods based on the linear relationship assumption are introduced for hydrological prediction like auto regression multiple linear regression and stepwise regression wang et al 2015b yang et al 2017 even though great success has been achieved statistical methods cannot well track the nonlinear information in natural runoff and fails to provide satisfying results in many cases adnan et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 tan et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 as computer technologies develop rapidly over the past few years artificial intelligence approaches with strong learning ability are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of engineering fields including hydrology and water resources feng et al 2022 meng et al 2019 taormina et al 2015 wang et al 2009 as an excellent artificial intelligence representative support vector machine svm is based on the structural risk minimization and vapnik chervonenk dimension theory huang et al 2014 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2018 svm can guarantee the determination of the theoretical optimal solution for nonlinear regression problems and has been widely applied in hydrology and water resources although svm obtain superior generalization ability compared with the conventional artificial intelligence methods the computation complexity grows rapidly with the increasing size of the considered training dataset recently twin support vector machine tsvm in fig 1 is successfully developed to alleviate the svm problem ma et al 2020 ma and yu 2022 peng 2010 tsvm constructs two nonparallel functions while each function respectively represents the possible upper bound and lower bound of the undetermined regressor huang et al 2022 khemchandani et al 2016 liang and zhang 2022 then tsvm solves two smaller quadratic programming problems rather than a single large one in the conventional svm method for all samples the standard svm model involves two groups of constraints while only one group of constraints is considered in tsvm which can make obvious reductions on the problem size to the best of our knowledge the applications of tsvm in hydrological forecasting has not been reported by far to fill this gap the feasibility of tsvm in runoff prediction is verified by real world streamflow data the results indicate that tsvm may easily fall into local optima due to the strong nonlinearity of the runoff data and the unsatisfying combination of computation parameters to enhance the tsvm performance two kinds of strategies are adopted here including signal decomposition and parameter optimization generally the model using one resolution component cannot well reflect the internal transformation rules hidden in natural runoff thus the compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan wang et al 2022 wen et al 2019 is chosen as the data preprocessing tool with the aid of the ceemdan tool the original signal can be divided into a set of relatively stable subseries with different frequencies and resolutions on the other hand an effective metaheuristic cooperation search algorithm csa is used to find suitable parameters in tsvm inspired by the cooperation behavior in the teamwork csa takes advantages of several effective evolutionary operators to find promising solutions for the global optimization problems as compared to several traditional methods csa has superior performances in both solution quality and convergence rate making it become increasingly popular in numerous engineering problems based on the above analysis this study develops a hybrid model for hydrological time series forecasting extensive experiments in real world hydrological datasets proves the superiority and robustness of the hybrid model the primary contributions of this paper are outlined as below 1 to reduce modeling difficulty ceemdan is chosen for signal decomposing to provide a set of relatively stable and stationary subseries 2 for the first time tsvm is used to identify nonlinear mapping relationship of each subseries while csa is in charge of determining feasible parameter combinations 3 in different cases the compound method linking ceemdan and csa into tsvm can achieve satisfying forecasting accuracies and significant improvements compared to the control models hence an efficient hydrological forecasting model is provided to support the scientific operation planning and management of water resources system the organization of this research is given as below section 2 describes the technical details of the involved methods section 3 provides the experimental results and data analysis finally the conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodologies 2 1 compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan as a commonly used signal preprocessing method empirical mode decomposition emd can iteratively divide nonlinear sequence into a set of high frequency component named as intrinsic mode function imf as well as a low frequency component called residual r however the emd s decomposing process often suffers from the mode aliasing defect a noise assisted signal analysis tool ensemble emd eemd is developed to alleviate the emd problem however in eemd the gaussian white noise are repeatedly averaged before elimination which will lead to additional computation time the deduced signal contains residual noises have certain influences on the decomposed results making it become difficult to avoid the reconstruction error recently an advanced signal analysis method ceemdan is developed to alleviate the above problems at the reconstruction phase ceemdan uses a limited number of gaussian white noises possessing identical amplitude and opposite phase to calculate a unique residual signal in this way ceemdan can effectively reduce the minimal reconstruction error and avoid the mode aliasing problem gao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the execution process of the ceemdan method is briefly given as below step 1 gaussian white noise with a standard deviation ε is added to the original signal s t which can be expressed as below 1 s m t s t ε 0 v m t m 1 2 m where m is the realization times v m t and s m t are the white noise and the treated signal step 2 after each realization the first component im f 1 m t is obtained by averaging all the components im f 1 m t via the emd method which can be expressed as below 2 imf 1 t 1 m m 1 m im f 1 m t step 3 the first residual signal is obtained by r 1 t s t imf 1 t then emd is chosen to calculate the second component for the signal r 1 t ε 1 e m d 1 v m t while the related residual can be expressed as below 3 imf 2 t 1 m m 1 m em d 1 r 1 t ε 1 e m d 1 v m t r 2 t r 1 t imf 2 t where em d i represents the ith imf mode obtained by emd step 4 the kth residual and the k 1th component is obtained by the following equation 4 r k t r k

effective machine tool svm outperforms several traditional methods in the real world regression and classification problems like pattern recognition speech identification and time series forecasting lin et al 2009 however most training methods for svm usually need two set of constraints to guarantee that the training samples fall into small insensitive zones as far as possible then additional variables and constraints in the optimization model of svm may lead to expensive learning cost and high computation complexity in the complex regression problems recently an effective nonparallel plane regressor called tsvm is developed to alleviate the svm defects the tsvm formulation is different from the conventional svm model tsvm yields two nonparallel functions to deduce the small lower and upper bounds of the unknown regressors and then resolves a pair of small sized quadratic programming problems rather than a single large one in the standard svm model besides tsvm uses a group of constraints rather than two groups of constraints in svm for all samples in each subproblems making obvious improvements in the problem size peng and chen 2018 prasad and balasundaram 2021 zhang et al 2021 considerable comparisons reveal that tsvm can provide better performances than svm in both generalization ability and training time promoting its increasing popularity in practical applications

effectively promotes the social progress and technological development based on this famous social behavior an effective evolutionary algorithm csa is proposed to resolve the complicated global optimization problems feng et al 2022a feng et al 2022b in the csa framework it is believed that the dynamic determination of the optimal solution is equivalent to the enterprise s development process each solution for the target problem is equal to one staff that takes charge of some tasks a certain number of staffs form a teamwork where the staff s status is closely related to the task performance the personal best known position of each staff forms the board of supervisors that is responsible for information management several global best known positions form the board of directors in charge of making great decisions the rotating chairman is selected from the board of directors in a random manner to provide multiple valuable strategic directions after randomly placing the positions of the initial swarm csa utilizes three operators to imitate the cooperation behavior in modern companies including the team communication operator for sharing knowledge and experience the reflection learning operator for correcting passing deficiencies and mistakes and the internal competition operator for guaranteeing the rapid convergence via the well designed message passing and information sharing mechanism all the members in the teamwork have chances to become leaders while some staffs making no obvious improvements for a considerable time are gradually eliminated by the greedy selection strategy in this way the comprehensive strength of the entire team can be gradually improved for a j variable minimization optimization problem the search processes of the csa method

compound hydrological forecasting method as mentioned above it is difficult to accurately forecast the nonlinear hydrological data and then this study develops a hybrid method under the decomposition ensemble framework in the proposed method the nonlinear hydrological time series is divided into a sequence of relatively stationary subseries which conserves the features of the original signal at different levels each subseries is separately predicted by a standalone artificial intelligence model the analogue outputs of all the constructed models are aggregated as the final forecasting value fig 2 shows the sketch map of the proposed model it can be seen that the developed model is composed of three phases namely signal decomposition individual prediction and multimodal ensemble in the first phase the ceemdan tool is used to divide the raw runoff data into multiple subseries with simple complexities and stationary features which can make improvements the modeling accuracy of the fluctuated components in the second phase an individual tsvm model is driven to model each component while the csa method is chosen as the optimizer for determining the necessary parameters which can help find suitable models with compact structure in the third phase the simulation results of all tsvm models are simply superimposed as the final forecasting result which can help reduce the forecasting biases and increase the robustness from the above description it can be found that the thought of the developed method is similar to the well known divide and conquer strategy in practice in other words a large and challenging problem is broken into multiple simple subcomponents that can be modeled individually by mature forecasting models given the simple changing rules of the obtained components the computation complexity of the artificial intelligence model can be improved while the model compactness can be enhanced by a powerful evolutionary algorithm besides the ensemble based strategy is conductive to achieve profitable balances among the possible defects of various models hence the forecasting accuracy of the proposed method have larger improvement rooms than the raw complex signal 3 case studies 3 1 data description the long term runoff series in fig 3 is collected from three hydrological stations in china s yangtze river table 1 shows the basic information of various datasets at the training and testing phases the first 70 data is used for training while other data is used for validation fig 3 and table 1 reveal that the runoff at three stations possesses highly unsteady states and thereby it becomes increasingly difficult to finish accurate runoff prediction tasks owing to the disorder features and high nonlinearity the original runoff data yields large fluctuations and the forecasting model may fail to capture the small magnitude changes in the observed runoff data thus the considered data for each model is normalized before switching on the learning process while the outputs of each model are also renormalized to yield the related forecasting data after finishing the simulation process 3 2 data decomposition with the aid of the ccemdan technique the initial runoff data series is divided into several subcomponents fig 4 shows the decomposed results of the runoff data series at station b it can be seen that obvious differences exist in the frequencies and variation amplitudes of the deduced subseries the foregoing subseries possessing random fluctuation reflects the high frequency parts in the original runoff the final subseries reflects the long term tendency of the original runoff the other subseries can reflect the features of the original runoff from different perspectives like daily scale weekly scale and monthly scale hence the viability of the ceemdan tool in identifying the intrinsic features of the original runoff is fully proved here 3 3 model development in this section several artificial intelligence methods are developed to testify the feasibility of the proposed model including artificial neural network ann extreme learning machine elm support vector machine svm for each method the number of input variables is determined by the expert knowledge and partial autocorrelation function for the ann and elm methods the sigmoid function is used to calculate nonlinear outputs of the neurons the number of the hidden neurons is tuned by the classical cut and try strategy in elm the moore penrose generalized inverse method is used to determine the hidden output weights based on the randomly assigned weights and biases the back propagation method is used to train the ann network in svm the radial basis function is used for feature mapping while the grid search approach is used to search for satisfying computational parameters for the proposed method the number of individual staffs and maximum iteration in the csa optimizer are set as 100 and 200 while the noise amplitude realization times and shifting iterations in ceemdan are set as 0 2 20 and 500 respectively 3 4 evaluation indicators without loss of generality it is assumed that y i and y i are the actual and forecasted value at the ith period y avg and y avg are the average of n actual and forecasted data root mean squared error rmse can assess the dispersion degree of the predicted errors mean absolute error mae can measure the performances of the forecasting model in tracking peak flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse can reflect whether the observed value is effectively replicated by the forecasted value correlation coefficient cc can demonstrate the linear dependence relationship between the observed and forecasted data then the mathematical definitions for the considered evaluation indexes can be expressed as below 35 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 36 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 37 cc i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 38 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 3 5 results and discussions table 2 gives the assessment indexes of the prediction results obtained by several methods at station a where tsvm c1 denotes that the tsvm model is optimized by the csa optimizer while tsvm c2 means that the tsvm model is coupled with the ceemdan method it reveals that the standard ann model provides the worst forecasting results among all the models proving the importance of the employed model structure and parameter tuning strategy the svm method obtains better performances with about 3 7 and 3 6 improvements in the rmse and mae indexes compared with the ann tool during the testing phases the tsvm model outperforms the ann and elm models with about 4 3 and 1 2 improvements in the rmse index at the testing phase the ceemdan and csa based models can help produce satisfying results than the original models for instance the tsvm c1 model betters the tsvm model with 6 3 and 2 7 improvements in the rmse and mae indexes at the testing phase the developed obtains the best results with respect to all the statistical indexes by reducing the rmse mae cc and nse values by 23 9 28 9 1 2 and 3 7 compared to the ann model at the testing phase thus it can be concluded that the model can effectively address hydrological forecasting problem fig 5 shows the forecasting results obtained by various methods at the testing phase for station a the line charts demonstrate that the time varying hydrological series can be well simulated in different cases proving the effectiveness of the considered forecasting models the scatter plots shows that the proposed model can provide the largest r2 value and the best simulation results in forecasting runoff series because its linear trend line is closest to the ideal straight line hence the forecasting ability of the proposed method is successfully verified by the runoff data at station a table 3 shows the statistical indicators of the forecasting results obtained by various methods for station b the data reveals that the results of the tsvm method are superior to three other conventional methods like ann elm and svm the proposed method achieves the best results with respect to all the statistical indexes during the testing phase the proposed method is able to improve the rmse and mae values with about 36 5 and 41 6 reductions in comparison with the standard svm method reaffirming its superiority and feasibility in hydrological forecasting fig 6 draws the forecasting results of the proposed method and several control methods at the testing phase for station b on the whole all the methods are able to simulate the changing runoff process while the hybrid method has better performance than the control methods by producing a trendline close to the ideal one the standalone tsvm method fails to effectively capture the peak values at high flow periods whereas the modified models have stronger abilities to achieve this goal compared to the traditional models the proposed approach can effectively provide superior performance in the complex hydrological forecasting task fig 7 shows the forecasting errors of several methods at the testing phase for runoff stations a and b it can be seen that for stations a and b there are also obvious differences in the forecasting errors of each model demonstrating the direct influences of data features besides the forecasting errors of the proposed model are obviously smaller than the control models in different scenarios proving the effectiveness of multiple strategy integration thus the developed model can provide satisfying performances in hydrological time series prediction table 4 lists the statistical indicators of the forecasting results obtained by various methods for station c fig 8 draws the forecasting results of various methods for station c at the testing phase it can be seen that that the results of the control methods are inferior to the developed method in terms of all the indexes proving the feasibility of the developed method at the testing phase the proposed method makes about 23 5 and 30 0 improvements in the rmse and mae values of the ann method fig 8 shows that all the methods can provide satisfying results for runoff at station c while the hybrid method yields superior performances and higher correlation coefficients as compared with the control methods therefore the developed method is capable of providing better results than several traditional methods in hydrological forecasting the search swarm generated by various initial random seeds are used to check the robustness of the developed method table 5 lists the performances of the developed method with different random seeds at station c it can be clearly observed that at both training and testing phases the developed method can achieve satisfying results regardless of the random seeds this case proves the strong and stable global search ability of the developed model using swarm intelligence signal decomposition and evolutionary algorithm in practice many factors have great influences on the river flow and then the hydrological data series possess highly nonlinear and nonstationary features then it is rather difficult for a single forecasting model to effectively track the internal input output relationship of the original runoff and scholars have been devoting to develop effective forecasting models and parameter optimizer three classical artificial intelligence models ann elm and svm are used for comparison however the poor performance of the conventional ann model is caused by the inherent flaws in the gradient based approaches like time consuming and local convergence the generalization capability of the traditional elm model is mainly limited by the randomly assigned parameters including input hidden weights and hidden biases based on the structural risk minimization principle the svm and tsvm models has strong theorical basis to produce superior results however the performances of the standard svm and tsvm methods are still influenced by the selected parameter combinations in other words once the computational parameters are not suitable the learning ability of the forecasting models will be obviously limited in simulating nonlinear time series to address this problem the emerging metaheuristic csa is used to find satisfying parameter combination to enhance model compactness at the same time meanwhile as mentioned above the original nonlinear runoff series inevitably contains multi resolution components because it is influenced by a large number of interconnected factors from both human societies and natural environments thus the ceemdan tool is used to eliminate the noisy signal and identify the hidden sub signals at different frequency scales by combing the merits of three effective techniques the proposed model can reduce the negative influences of unsystematic parts in comparison with several traditional models then the hybrid model can find better forecasting results in tracking the overall tendency of changing runoff series 4 conclusion due to the nonlinear and nonstationary features of hydrological time series it is rather difficult for a standalone model to provide accurate runoff forecasting to satisfy this practical necessity this research develops a combined hydrological forecasting model using signal decomposition and twin support vector machine with the aid of ccemand hydrological data is decomposed into a couple of subseries at different scales tsvm with strong nonlinear learning ability is chosen as the predictor for the decomposed components while the csa approached is applied to determine the computation parameters for each tsvm model the individual outputs of all the constructed model are aggregated to yield the final forecasting result for the original runoff the proposed model is compared with several conventional forecasting methods on the runoff data of several real world hydrological stations in china based on four famous quantitative evaluation indexes the results indicate that ceemdan exhibits strong ability to reduce the influences of nonlinear modules on runoff data while the proposed model is able to obtain betters results than the control models in both overall forecasting accuracy and peak flow traceability at station c the proposed method betters the ann method with about 23 5 and 30 0 improvements in the rmse and mae values at the testing phase therefore the developed model becomes an effective alternative to forecast hydrological data and other nonlinear time series to be mentioned some defects also exist in the developed model owing to the limited time for instance only antecedent runoff information is considered for simplifying calculation while the optimizer may suffer from local convergence and high computation time in large dataset and complex model thus the future researches can be further considered from the following aspects like the tsvm application in other hydrological issues like rainfall runoff modeling and reservoir operation advanced optimizer for parameter identification and signal decomposing tool for feature selection and high performance computing for improving efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

3118,accurate hydrologic forecasting is of vital importance for water resource management and reservoir operation under the changing environments however it is difficult for a standalone method to track the complex hydrological time series with highly nonlinear and nonstationary features to improve the forecasting accuracy this study proposes a hybrid model using compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan and twin support vector machine tsvm optimized by metaheuristic algorithm firstly the ceemdan tool is chosen to divide the original runoff data into several relatively stable subcomponents with various resolutions and frequencies then the tsvm forecasting model is established to extract the deep features of each subseries while the emerging cooperation search algorithm is used to search for satisfying parameter combination the final forecasting value for the original hydrological time series is formulated by aggregating the outputs of all tsvm models long term streamflow data from several hydrological stations in china s yangtze river is used for simulation experimental results reveal that the hybrid model significantly outperforms several conventional forecasting models in prediction accuracy for instance the proposed method improves the root mean squared error and mean absolute error value with about 36 5 and 41 6 reductions compared with the traditional support vector machine at station b thus a novel and effective evolutionary artificial intelligence model is developed for hydrological forecasting keywords hydrological prediction signal decomposition artificial intelligence evolutionary algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction reliable hydrologic forecasting is seen as one of the most significant precondition information for water resource management and reservoir operation ma et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015a zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 runoff often possesses highly nonlinear nonstationary and uncertain features due to the comprehensive influence of multiple factors with complex incidence relations like soil humidity atmospheric temperature and land vegetation li et al 2014 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 besides to tackle the serious water crisis many hydropower reservoirs are put into operation in succession which has made great changes on the rainfall runoff features of natural hydrologic process bai et al 2015 chang et al 2018 meng et al 2019 due to the intense human activities and growing climate changes accurate forecasting models for hydrological time series is becoming more and more difficult in recent years abdullah et al 2015 taormina and chau 2015 yaseen et al 2016 traditionally the physical based approaches based on a couple of carefully designed equations are developed to simulate the complex rainfall runoff process feng and ye 2021 wang et al 2015a wu et al 2010 for these methods a large number of precise data are often required to determine the computational parameters in practice it may be restricted by some unexpected problems to obtain the necessary data on time which inevitably bring about poor forecasting results and high uncertainty liu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b to overcome this problem some famous statistical methods based on the linear relationship assumption are introduced for hydrological prediction like auto regression multiple linear regression and stepwise regression wang et al 2015b yang et al 2017 even though great success has been achieved statistical methods cannot well track the nonlinear information in natural runoff and fails to provide satisfying results in many cases adnan et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 tan et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 as computer technologies develop rapidly over the past few years artificial intelligence approaches with strong learning ability are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of engineering fields including hydrology and water resources feng et al 2022 meng et al 2019 taormina et al 2015 wang et al 2009 as an excellent artificial intelligence representative support vector machine svm is based on the structural risk minimization and vapnik chervonenk dimension theory huang et al 2014 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2018 svm can guarantee the determination of the theoretical optimal solution for nonlinear regression problems and has been widely applied in hydrology and water resources although svm obtain superior generalization ability compared with the conventional artificial intelligence methods the computation complexity grows rapidly with the increasing size of the considered training dataset recently twin support vector machine tsvm in fig 1 is successfully developed to alleviate the svm problem ma et al 2020 ma and yu 2022 peng 2010 tsvm constructs two nonparallel functions while each function respectively represents the possible upper bound and lower bound of the undetermined regressor huang et al 2022 khemchandani et al 2016 liang and zhang 2022 then tsvm solves two smaller quadratic programming problems rather than a single large one in the conventional svm method for all samples the standard svm model involves two groups of constraints while only one group of constraints is considered in tsvm which can make obvious reductions on the problem size to the best of our knowledge the applications of tsvm in hydrological forecasting has not been reported by far to fill this gap the feasibility of tsvm in runoff prediction is verified by real world streamflow data the results indicate that tsvm may easily fall into local optima due to the strong nonlinearity of the runoff data and the unsatisfying combination of computation parameters to enhance the tsvm performance two kinds of strategies are adopted here including signal decomposition and parameter optimization generally the model using one resolution component cannot well reflect the internal transformation rules hidden in natural runoff thus the compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan wang et al 2022 wen et al 2019 is chosen as the data preprocessing tool with the aid of the ceemdan tool the original signal can be divided into a set of relatively stable subseries with different frequencies and resolutions on the other hand an effective metaheuristic cooperation search algorithm csa is used to find suitable parameters in tsvm inspired by the cooperation behavior in the teamwork csa takes advantages of several effective evolutionary operators to find promising solutions for the global optimization problems as compared to several traditional methods csa has superior performances in both solution quality and convergence rate making it become increasingly popular in numerous engineering problems based on the above analysis this study develops a hybrid model for hydrological time series forecasting extensive experiments in real world hydrological datasets proves the superiority and robustness of the hybrid model the primary contributions of this paper are outlined as below 1 to reduce modeling difficulty ceemdan is chosen for signal decomposing to provide a set of relatively stable and stationary subseries 2 for the first time tsvm is used to identify nonlinear mapping relationship of each subseries while csa is in charge of determining feasible parameter combinations 3 in different cases the compound method linking ceemdan and csa into tsvm can achieve satisfying forecasting accuracies and significant improvements compared to the control models hence an efficient hydrological forecasting model is provided to support the scientific operation planning and management of water resources system the organization of this research is given as below section 2 describes the technical details of the involved methods section 3 provides the experimental results and data analysis finally the conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodologies 2 1 compete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan as a commonly used signal preprocessing method empirical mode decomposition emd can iteratively divide nonlinear sequence into a set of high frequency component named as intrinsic mode function imf as well as a low frequency component called residual r however the emd s decomposing process often suffers from the mode aliasing defect a noise assisted signal analysis tool ensemble emd eemd is developed to alleviate the emd problem however in eemd the gaussian white noise are repeatedly averaged before elimination which will lead to additional computation time the deduced signal contains residual noises have certain influences on the decomposed results making it become difficult to avoid the reconstruction error recently an advanced signal analysis method ceemdan is developed to alleviate the above problems at the reconstruction phase ceemdan uses a limited number of gaussian white noises possessing identical amplitude and opposite phase to calculate a unique residual signal in this way ceemdan can effectively reduce the minimal reconstruction error and avoid the mode aliasing problem gao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the execution process of the ceemdan method is briefly given as below step 1 gaussian white noise with a standard deviation ε is added to the original signal s t which can be expressed as below 1 s m t s t ε 0 v m t m 1 2 m where m is the realization times v m t and s m t are the white noise and the treated signal step 2 after each realization the first component im f 1 m t is obtained by averaging all the components im f 1 m t via the emd method which can be expressed as below 2 imf 1 t 1 m m 1 m im f 1 m t step 3 the first residual signal is obtained by r 1 t s t imf 1 t then emd is chosen to calculate the second component for the signal r 1 t ε 1 e m d 1 v m t while the related residual can be expressed as below 3 imf 2 t 1 m m 1 m em d 1 r 1 t ε 1 e m d 1 v m t r 2 t r 1 t imf 2 t where em d i represents the ith imf mode obtained by emd step 4 the kth residual and the k 1th component is obtained by the following equation 4 r k t r k 1 t imf k t imf k 1 t 1 m m 1 m em d 1 r k t ε k e m d k v m t where imf k t represents the kth imf mode obtained by the ceemdan method then eq 4 is repeated until the following stopping condition is met 5 t 1 t r k t r k 1 t r k 1 t 2 δ k where t is the length of the original signal s t δ k is the empirical value r k t is the residual signal after the kth decomposition finally the decomposing results of ceemdan can be expressed as below 6 s t k 1 k imf k t r t where r t is the residual obtained by ceemdan k denotes the number of subseries 2 2 twin support vector machine tsvm as an effective machine tool svm outperforms several traditional methods in the real world regression and classification problems like pattern recognition speech identification and time series forecasting lin et al 2009 however most training methods for svm usually need two set of constraints to guarantee that the training samples fall into small insensitive zones as far as possible then additional variables and constraints in the optimization model of svm may lead to expensive learning cost and high computation complexity in the complex regression problems recently an effective nonparallel plane regressor called tsvm is developed to alleviate the svm defects the tsvm formulation is different from the conventional svm model tsvm yields two nonparallel functions to deduce the small lower and upper bounds of the unknown regressors and then resolves a pair of small sized quadratic programming problems rather than a single large one in the standard svm model besides tsvm uses a group of constraints rather than two groups of constraints in svm for all samples in each subproblems making obvious improvements in the problem size peng and chen 2018 prasad and balasundaram 2021 zhang et al 2021 considerable comparisons reveal that tsvm can provide better performances than svm in both generalization ability and training time promoting its increasing popularity in practical applications che et al 2021 ganaie and tanveer 2021 gupta and gupta 2021 for a training dataset x i y i i 1 m where x i r n and y r denote the input vector and output of the ith sample n is the number of input variables m is the number of samples from the viewpoint of matrix the inputs and outputs for all training samples can be expressed as a r m n and y y 1 y 2 y m t supposing that in tsvm the kernel function is used to map the inputs x t into the high dimensional space for feature identification and then two nonparallel regressors around the data points can be derived as the following equations 7

effectively promotes the social progress and technological development based on this famous social behavior an effective evolutionary algorithm csa is proposed to resolve the complicated global optimization problems feng et al 2022a feng et al 2022b in the csa framework it is believed that the dynamic determination of the optimal solution is equivalent to the enterprise s development process each solution for the target problem is equal to one staff that takes charge of some tasks a certain number of staffs form a teamwork where the staff s status is closely related to the task performance the personal best known position of each staff forms the board of supervisors that is responsible for information management several global best known positions form the board of directors in charge of making great decisions the rotating chairman is selected from the board of directors in a random manner to provide multiple valuable strategic directions after randomly placing the positions of the initial swarm csa utilizes three operators to imitate the cooperation behavior in modern companies including the team communication operator for sharing knowledge and experience the reflection learning operator for correcting passing deficiencies and mistakes and the internal competition operator for guaranteeing the rapid convergence via the well designed message passing and information sharing mechanism all the members in the teamwork have chances to become leaders while some staffs making no obvious improvements for a considerable time are gradually eliminated by the greedy selection strategy in this way the comprehensive strength of the entire team can be gradually improved for a j variable minimization optimization problem the search processes of the csa method

compound hydrological forecasting method as mentioned above it is difficult to accurately forecast the nonlinear hydrological data and then this study develops a hybrid method under the decomposition ensemble framework in the proposed method the nonlinear hydrological time series is divided into a sequence of relatively stationary subseries which conserves the features of the original signal at different levels each subseries is separately predicted by a standalone artificial intelligence model the analogue outputs of all the constructed models are aggregated as the final forecasting value fig 2 shows the sketch map of the proposed model it can be seen that the developed model is composed of three phases namely signal decomposition individual prediction and multimodal ensemble in the first phase the ceemdan tool is used to divide the raw runoff data into multiple subseries with simple complexities and stationary features which can make improvements the modeling accuracy of the fluctuated components in the second phase an individual tsvm model is driven to model each component while the csa method is chosen as the optimizer for determining the necessary parameters which can help find suitable models with compact structure in the third phase the simulation results of all tsvm models are simply superimposed as the final forecasting result which can help reduce the forecasting biases and increase the robustness from the above description it can be found that the thought of the developed method is similar to the well known divide and conquer strategy in practice in other words a large and challenging problem is broken into multiple simple subcomponents that can be modeled individually by mature forecasting models given the simple changing rules of the obtained components the computation complexity of the artificial intelligence model can be improved while the model compactness can be enhanced by a powerful evolutionary algorithm besides the ensemble based strategy is conductive to achieve profitable balances among the possible defects of various models hence the forecasting accuracy of the proposed method have larger improvement rooms than the raw complex signal 3 case studies 3 1 data description the long term runoff series in fig 3 is collected from three hydrological stations in china s yangtze river table 1 shows the basic information of various datasets at the training and testing phases the first 70 data is used for training while other data is used for validation fig 3 and table 1 reveal that the runoff at three stations possesses highly unsteady states and thereby it becomes increasingly difficult to finish accurate runoff prediction tasks owing to the disorder features and high nonlinearity the original runoff data yields large fluctuations and the forecasting model may fail to capture the small magnitude changes in the observed runoff data thus the considered data for each model is normalized before switching on the learning process while the outputs of each model are also renormalized to yield the related forecasting data after finishing the simulation process 3 2 data decomposition with the aid of the ccemdan technique the initial runoff data series is divided into several subcomponents fig 4 shows the decomposed results of the runoff data series at station b it can be seen that obvious differences exist in the frequencies and variation amplitudes of the deduced subseries the foregoing subseries possessing random fluctuation reflects the high frequency parts in the original runoff the final subseries reflects the long term tendency of the original runoff the other subseries can reflect the features of the original runoff from different perspectives like daily scale weekly scale and monthly scale hence the viability of the ceemdan tool in identifying the intrinsic features of the original runoff is fully proved here 3 3 model development in this section several artificial intelligence methods are developed to testify the feasibility of the proposed model including artificial neural network ann extreme learning machine elm support vector machine svm for each method the number of input variables is determined by the expert knowledge and partial autocorrelation function for the ann and elm methods the sigmoid function is used to calculate nonlinear outputs of the neurons the number of the hidden neurons is tuned by the classical cut and try strategy in elm the moore penrose generalized inverse method is used to determine the hidden output weights based on the randomly assigned weights and biases the back propagation method is used to train the ann network in svm the radial basis function is used for feature mapping while the grid search approach is used to search for satisfying computational parameters for the proposed method the number of individual staffs and maximum iteration in the csa optimizer are set as 100 and 200 while the noise amplitude realization times and shifting iterations in ceemdan are set as 0 2 20 and 500 respectively 3 4 evaluation indicators without loss of generality it is assumed that y i and y i are the actual and forecasted value at the ith period y avg and y avg are the average of n actual and forecasted data root mean squared error rmse can assess the dispersion degree of the predicted errors mean absolute error mae can measure the performances of the forecasting model in tracking peak flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nse can reflect whether the observed value is effectively replicated by the forecasted value correlation coefficient cc can demonstrate the linear dependence relationship between the observed and forecasted data then the mathematical definitions for the considered evaluation indexes can be expressed as below 35 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 36 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 37 cc i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 38 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 3 5 results and discussions table 2 gives the assessment indexes of the prediction results obtained by several methods at station a where tsvm c1 denotes that the tsvm model is optimized by the csa optimizer while tsvm c2 means that the tsvm model is coupled with the ceemdan method it reveals that the standard ann model provides the worst forecasting results among all the models proving the importance of the employed model structure and parameter tuning strategy the svm method obtains better performances with about 3 7 and 3 6 improvements in the rmse and mae indexes compared with the ann tool during the testing phases the tsvm model outperforms the ann and elm models with about 4 3 and 1 2 improvements in the rmse index at the testing phase the ceemdan and csa based models can help produce satisfying results than the original models for instance the tsvm c1 model betters the tsvm model with 6 3 and 2 7 improvements in the rmse and mae indexes at the testing phase the developed obtains the best results with respect to all the statistical indexes by reducing the rmse mae cc and nse values by 23 9 28 9 1 2 and 3 7 compared to the ann model at the testing phase thus it can be concluded that the model can effectively address hydrological forecasting problem fig 5 shows the forecasting results obtained by various methods at the testing phase for station a the line charts demonstrate that the time varying hydrological series can be well simulated in different cases proving the effectiveness of the considered forecasting models the scatter plots shows that the proposed model can provide the largest r2 value and the best simulation results in forecasting runoff series because its linear trend line is closest to the ideal straight line hence the forecasting ability of the proposed method is successfully verified by the runoff data at station a table 3 shows the statistical indicators of the forecasting results obtained by various methods for station b the data reveals that the results of the tsvm method are superior to three other conventional methods like ann elm and svm the proposed method achieves the best results with respect to all the statistical indexes during the testing phase the proposed method is able to improve the rmse and mae values with about 36 5 and 41 6 reductions in comparison with the standard svm method reaffirming its superiority and feasibility in hydrological forecasting fig 6 draws the forecasting results of the proposed method and several control methods at the testing phase for station b on the whole all the methods are able to simulate the changing runoff process while the hybrid method has better performance than the control methods by producing a trendline close to the ideal one the standalone tsvm method fails to effectively capture the peak values at high flow periods whereas the modified models have stronger abilities to achieve this goal compared to the traditional models the proposed approach can effectively provide superior performance in the complex hydrological forecasting task fig 7 shows the forecasting errors of several methods at the testing phase for runoff stations a and b it can be seen that for stations a and b there are also obvious differences in the forecasting errors of each model demonstrating the direct influences of data features besides the forecasting errors of the proposed model are obviously smaller than the control models in different scenarios proving the effectiveness of multiple strategy integration thus the developed model can provide satisfying performances in hydrological time series prediction table 4 lists the statistical indicators of the forecasting results obtained by various methods for station c fig 8 draws the forecasting results of various methods for station c at the testing phase it can be seen that that the results of the control methods are inferior to the developed method in terms of all the indexes proving the feasibility of the developed method at the testing phase the proposed method makes about 23 5 and 30 0 improvements in the rmse and mae values of the ann method fig 8 shows that all the methods can provide satisfying results for runoff at station c while the hybrid method yields superior performances and higher correlation coefficients as compared with the control methods therefore the developed method is capable of providing better results than several traditional methods in hydrological forecasting the search swarm generated by various initial random seeds are used to check the robustness of the developed method table 5 lists the performances of the developed method with different random seeds at station c it can be clearly observed that at both training and testing phases the developed method can achieve satisfying results regardless of the random seeds this case proves the strong and stable global search ability of the developed model using swarm intelligence signal decomposition and evolutionary algorithm in practice many factors have great influences on the river flow and then the hydrological data series possess highly nonlinear and nonstationary features then it is rather difficult for a single forecasting model to effectively track the internal input output relationship of the original runoff and scholars have been devoting to develop effective forecasting models and parameter optimizer three classical artificial intelligence models ann elm and svm are used for comparison however the poor performance of the conventional ann model is caused by the inherent flaws in the gradient based approaches like time consuming and local convergence the generalization capability of the traditional elm model is mainly limited by the randomly assigned parameters including input hidden weights and hidden biases based on the structural risk minimization principle the svm and tsvm models has strong theorical basis to produce superior results however the performances of the standard svm and tsvm methods are still influenced by the selected parameter combinations in other words once the computational parameters are not suitable the learning ability of the forecasting models will be obviously limited in simulating nonlinear time series to address this problem the emerging metaheuristic csa is used to find satisfying parameter combination to enhance model compactness at the same time meanwhile as mentioned above the original nonlinear runoff series inevitably contains multi resolution components because it is influenced by a large number of interconnected factors from both human societies and natural environments thus the ceemdan tool is used to eliminate the noisy signal and identify the hidden sub signals at different frequency scales by combing the merits of three effective techniques the proposed model can reduce the negative influences of unsystematic parts in comparison with several traditional models then the hybrid model can find better forecasting results in tracking the overall tendency of changing runoff series 4 conclusion due to the nonlinear and nonstationary features of hydrological time series it is rather difficult for a standalone model to provide accurate runoff forecasting to satisfy this practical necessity this research develops a combined hydrological forecasting model using signal decomposition and twin support vector machine with the aid of ccemand hydrological data is decomposed into a couple of subseries at different scales tsvm with strong nonlinear learning ability is chosen as the predictor for the decomposed components while the csa approached is applied to determine the computation parameters for each tsvm model the individual outputs of all the constructed model are aggregated to yield the final forecasting result for the original runoff the proposed model is compared with several conventional forecasting methods on the runoff data of several real world hydrological stations in china based on four famous quantitative evaluation indexes the results indicate that ceemdan exhibits strong ability to reduce the influences of nonlinear modules on runoff data while the proposed model is able to obtain betters results than the control models in both overall forecasting accuracy and peak flow traceability at station c the proposed method betters the ann method with about 23 5 and 30 0 improvements in the rmse and mae values at the testing phase therefore the developed model becomes an effective alternative to forecast hydrological data and other nonlinear time series to be mentioned some defects also exist in the developed model owing to the limited time for instance only antecedent runoff information is considered for simplifying calculation while the optimizer may suffer from local convergence and high computation time in large dataset and complex model thus the future researches can be further considered from the following aspects like the tsvm application in other hydrological issues like rainfall runoff modeling and reservoir operation advanced optimizer for parameter identification and signal decomposing tool for feature selection and high performance computing for improving efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

3119,the complementary operation of hydro photovoltaic pv hybrid power systems has become a popular and promising management way in modern power systems since hydropower and pv power depend strongly on precipitation and solar energy previous studies have recognized that climate change can affect the stability of standalone hydro or pv power and can threaten energy security however the vast majority of research studies stop at the impact assessment per se and are unexpanded to hybrid power systems the objective of this study was to explore how the complementary operation of this integrated system could be affected by climate change and identify its resilience to climate change a climate hydrology operation bottom up framework was developed to determine the acceptable range of climate change in climatic exposure space where the system can succeed to operate china s longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system was selected as the study site our analysis revealed that 1 the complementary operation of hydro and pv power reinforces the resilience of renewable energy sources to climate change since the range in climatic exposure space leading to system success is increased 2 the management scheme of complementary operation shows superiority compared to separate operation according to stress tests in gcms prediction information and 3 the complementarity of the two sources remains stable regardless of climate change that is if precipitation decreases then sunshine duration increases and evaporation increases while radiation increases thereby allowing for a more consistent level of power generation than independent hydropower and pv plant we propose therefore that managing hydropower and pv resources in a complementary manner can improve the resilience of hydro pv hybrid power systems to climate change and can lead to more effective power benefits keywords hydro photovoltaic hybrid power systems climate change resilience complementary operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate the risks of climate change and achieve their carbon neutrality goals countries around the world are proactively developing renewable energy resources chu and majumdar 2012 cronin et al 2018 fuso nerini et al 2017 hellin and fisher 2019 macdonald et al 2016 trnka et al 2014 hydropower and photovoltaic pv power are important sources of renewable energy that can mitigate climate change and promote carbon neutrality feng et al 2019 by the end of 2021 hydropower had become the largest global renewable energy source and the rapid development of photovoltaic pv power has become one of the most popular renewable energy sources in recent years duan et al 2022 flecker et al 2022 however hydropower and pv power are all climate driven energy which strongly depend on precipitation and solar energy respectively kozarcanin et al 2019 climate change obviously affects hydro and pv power by influencing the precipitation patterns and solar resources lei et al 2014 schaeffer et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 despite also being key to social and economic development hydropower and pv projects often do not incorporate the effects of future climate change into their planning and operations schaeffer et al 2012 the threat to hydropower and pv power posed by climate change is marked with these two renewable energy sources contributing significantly to the electrical grid in many countries which creates challenges when managing them effectively plenty of studies and reports have shown the negative impacts of climate change on standalone hydropower or pv power plants and these works are mainly evaluated based on historical observations or future forecast information barnett et al 2008 cronin et al 2018 howells et al 2013 hsiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 qin et al 2020 schaeffer et al 2012 schlott et al 2018 sridharan et al 2019 tarroja et al 2016 teotónio et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016a regarding the perspective of the historical observation is to count the power losses caused by actual climate change that has occurred in history e g conway et al 2017 diffenbaugh et al 2015 another is a numerical simulation method based on future climate change prediction information burnett et al 2014 cronin et al 2018 li et al 2020 pan et al 2004 teotónio et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016b consequently many power systems have become increasingly vulnerable and functionally degraded as the climate approaches or breaks through the limit that was originally incorporated in design safety factors however the vast majority of research studies stop at the impact assessment per se to mitigate the threats of climate change on hydropower or pv power some engineering and non engineering measures are usually applied however the economic and environmental costs of retrofitting infrastructure are often enormous beh et al 2015 therefore exploring and designing non engineering measures adapting to climate change may be a priority strategy favored by policy makers the complementary operation of hydro pv hybrid power systems has become a popular and promising way in modern power systems li et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the manage pattern is an effective approach to simultaneously managing hydropower and photovoltaic pv power which can address uncertainties in reservoir inflow and pv power by leveraging the complementarity of hydro and solar power output on temporal spatial scales the complementary operation of hydro pv hybrid power systems has gained more and more attention mainly focusing on the long term operation method or short term stochastic hydro unit commitment model li et al 2021 ming et al 2018a ming et al 2018b yang et al 2018 cheng et al 2022 in these researches the main purpose of the long term operation is to derive operating rules to allocate input energy from a long term perspective li et al 2019 yang et al 2018 while short term scheduling deals with how the system effectively responds to real time load demands with maximum resource utilization guo et al 2022 ming et al 2018a ming et al 2018b with the construction of new large scale hydro pv hybrid power systems the resilience to climate change needs to be identified to enable sustainable use and inform decision makers however few studies address the climate change impact on the hybrid power systems and identify the capacity of the hybrid system adapting to climate change considering the drawbacks above this study used a bottom up framework to identify the capacity of a hydro pv hybrid power system to adapt to climate change and to compare the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary the main objectives of this study are summarized as below 1 to establish a climate hydrology operation coupled model for identifying the range in climatic exposure space leading to system success and failure 2 to conduct a stress test for comparing the resilience of hydro pv power with and without implementing the complementary based on gcms prediction information and 3 to analyze the complementary relationship of climate variables that drive the hydropower and pv power in different time scales this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the climatic exposure space generation the hydro pv hybrid power system operation module and the stress test design section 3 discusses the application of this method in a case study based on the longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system results and discussion are presented in section 4 then we conclude with a summary of the main outcomes in section 5 2 methodology the proposed methodology for analyzing the resilience of hydro pv hybrid power system to climate change consists of the following three separately modules 1 weather generator module to generate climate alteration scenarios two parameter monthly water balance model twbm as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflow from those climate alteration scenarios 2 multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation module to generate system performance indicators under climate change scenarios 3 identification of system acceptable thresholds by stress test under different operation modes and climate change the structure of the proposed methodology is described in fig 1 the details of each module are given as follows 2 1 weather generator and hydrological simulation module 2 1 1 weather generator model the climate change scenarios are simulated with the lars wg weather simulation model a stochastic weather generator developed by rothamsted research semenov 2008 semenov et al 1998 lars wg is a stochastic weather generator based on the series approach which produces synthetic daily time series of maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation semenov 2008 semenov et al 1998 semenov and stratonovitch 2010 the weather generator may be used to generate synthetic weather data that have the same statistical characteristics as the observed data or to generate synthetic weather data corresponding to a scenario of climate change trnka et al 2014 a series of precipitation and radiation mean alteration scenarios can be generated by the lars wg weather generator these realizations will all have the same statistical characteristics but they will differ on a day to day basis the various precipitation mean alteration conditions are used as input of hydrologic model for obtaining runoff consequences of climate change then the various runoff consequences and radiation mean alteration conditions are used as input of multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation model further details of the weather generator can be found in appendix 2 1 2 hydrological simulation model for the long term forecasting of the consequences of runoff distribution under different scenarios the monthly water balance model has been widely employed for converting precipitation into runoff to assess climate change impacts xiong and guo 1999 xiong et al 2019 in this study the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm was used for obtaining runoff levels from weather data generated by the lars wg the twbm is a month long hydrological model proposed by xiong and guo xiong and guo 1999 it has been widely used for monthly runoff simulation and forecast xiong and guo 1999 the inputs of the model include monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the actual monthly evaporation is calculated as follows 1 e m t c 1 e p m t tanh p m t ep m t e p m t c 2 1 λ δ δ γ r m t c 3 where e m t denotes the actual monthly evaporation under climate scenario m ep m t denotes the monthly pan evaporation

multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation module 2 2 1 two management modes for hydro and pv power we hypothesize that the complementary operation of the two power systems could provide an opportunity to build a more sustainable and resilient power supply system under different climate change scenarios to compare the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary we modeled three indicators over a series of climate change related scenarios subject to two management schemes 1 the complementary management of the hydro pv plant and 2 the separate management of hydro and pv power mode 1 an integrated system operation using complementary operating rules eq 3 the first mode is complementary management which means operating the hydro pv plant by complementary operating rules the complementary operating rules are derived from historical optimal operating trajectory by implicit stochastic optimization which consists of three modules deterministic optimization selection of independent and decision variables and derivation of operating rules liu et al 2014 yang et al 2018 in the derivation model when the overall output is lower than the required minimum output the hydropower generation is used to compensate for deficits from the pv station so as to adjust the overall output of the system needed to meet the output requirement meanwhile the pv curtailment is considered by a pv power curtailment function which represents the relationship between the hydropower output and the pv curtailment rate further details can be found in ming et al 2019 therefore in these complementary operating rules the complementarity of both hydropower and pv power is taken into account 3 d m t α k a e m t β k α k i e m t s e m t β

station liu et al 2011 liu et al 2006 yang et al 2018 in this study three management evaluation indicators were used annual power generation economy the generation assurance rate power supply reliability and the water shortage index wsi water supply reliability power generation is a critical operational economic indicator while the power generation assurance rate must be high enough to ensure reliability in the electricity supply liu et al 2014 yang et al 2021 additionally the wsi is a proper quantitative indicator that can comprehensively describe the matching degree of water supply and demand and it is ideal to supply water as close to downstream comprehensive water requirements as possible ming et al 2019 si et al 2019 therefore the operation module has three different performance indicators of the system as a whole 1 indicator 1 the total generation output of the system 13 n m t 1 t t 1 t n hpv m t δ t t 2 indicator 2 the reliability of the system s output 14 f m t

s 2 3 2 identification of the mutually acceptable thresholds the stress test can effectively evaluate how the three performance indicators of the hydro pv hybrid power system respond to climate change in detail the isopleth map can describe intuitively the performance indicator change with climate statistics change and identify the conditions under which the system satisfies the performance indicator poff et al 2016 then the acceptable thresholds of the system with different operation schemes under climate change can be identified at the same time the sensitivity of the system to climate variables can be observed to identify which factor is sensitive to the hydro pv hybrid power system specifically the climate change scenarios data were then fed into the climate hydrology operation framework model to evaluate the outcomes of the three performance indicators under the two management schemes and the various climate change scenarios the results in the form of contour plots with the value of the indicator representing the z dimension under different climate scenarios can visually show how the management evaluation indicators respond to climate change when the indicator value exceeded or below a certain level of the historical simulated mean value deemed unacceptable for the system the value can be represented in the contour plots as a contour boundary line the boundary line of the three indicator values can then form a mutually acceptable threshold which can intuitively represent an acceptable level of climate change for the system in the hydro pv hybrid power systems resilience is defined as the range in climatic exposure space leading to energy system success in detail the climatic exposure space is generated by making a series of incremental changes to attributes of precipitation and radiation the range is the zone of mutually acceptable performance in climatic exposure space leading to system success which satisfies the minimum performance criteria for acceptable power generation assurance rate and wsi indicators simultaneously for the gcms prediction information they are used to stress test by feeding them into the above climate change exposure space firstly calculating how much the mean value of climate variables has changed relative to history then feeding them into the above climate change exposure space to observe where the gcms scattered points are distributed in the space 3 case study 3 1 overview the longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system which is an integrated 850 mw grid connected pv power plant is the largest of its kind in the world it is located in the source basin of the yellow river sbyr on the qinghai tibet plateau china fig 2 as a separate climate zone the qinghai tibet plateau is not only the starting zone for weather changes in china but is also clearly experiencing the effects of climate change as it has warmed approximately three times as fast as the global average rate of warming over the past fifty years chen et al 2014 piao et al 2011 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2012 yi et al 2019 qiu 2008 as the first cascade hydropower station on the upper reaches of the yellow river longyangxia hydropower station was originally built to generate power control flooding provide irrigation and supply water the hydropower station contains a total of four turbines each with a capacity of 320 mw resulting in a total installed capacity of 1280 mw the pv power plant is located in the western part of the gonghe county 130 km from xining the first phase of the project saw 320 mw was installed in 2013 the second phase of the project installed 530 mw which was completed in 2015 creating a large scale grid connected pv power plant at 850 mw total capacity the system generates electricity that is transmitted to the grid through the longyangxia hydropower station transmission lines 3 2 input data and simulation setup the primary input data used in this study included three parts weather generator model data sets hydrologic simulation model data sets and gcms forecast information in this study the lars wg was calibrated using a meteorological observation dataset i e daily temperature rainfall and sunshine duration covering a 31 year period 1980 2010 the dataset was observed by 13 weather stations throughout the sbyr to verify the performance of the lars wg we generated several different realizations of weather time series by selecting a different random seed value at every weather station and comparing it with the observed data the climate change exposure space is generated by making a series of incremental changes to attributes of precipitation and radiation which is conducted by a weather generator the change in mean annual precipitation varies from 70 to 130 relative to history in discrete steps of 2 the shift in radiation settings is similar to the precipitation therefore the climate change exposure space includes a total of 961 31 31 scenarios we calibrated and validated the twbm using the streamflow observations 1980 2010 from the tangnaihe hydrometric station at the mouth of the sbyr as well as monthly precipitation and pan evaporation datasets taken from the 13 weather stations within the sbyr the calibration of the model was performed using the shuffled complex evolution approach developed by the university of arizona duan et al 1993 four evaluation criteria namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency the water balance indicator the correlation coefficient and root mean square error are used to evaluate the runoff simulation results prediction information about climate change was from several gcm simulation results under four emission scenarios and further downscaled using the bias correction approach the statistical downscaling procedure was developed by liu and zuo 2012 the emission scenarios comprised the representative concentration pathway 2 6 rcp2 6 scenario rcp4 5 scenario rcp6 0 scenario and rcp8 5 scenario samset et al 2020 to connect the time of hydrologic simulation module datasets the data period of forecast information is selected from 2011 to 2035 a detailed general information description of the 109 chosen gcms are given in appendix which includes a total of 109 future projection scenarios for precipitation and radiation changes 4 results and discussion 4 1 three performance indicators of two management modes under different climate scenarios 4 1 1 indicator 1 power generation economy fig 3 a shows the annual average power generation of the two management modes under various climate related scenarios the figure shows that both hydropower and pv power are strongly sensitive to climate change with the different performance indicators having different degrees of sensitivity the annual average power generation increases with increased precipitation and decreases with increased solar radiation mean which indicates that changes in precipitation and solar radiation will affect the annual average power generation the boxplots describe the distribution of the performance indicator values for the two management schemes and are presented in the second row of fig 3 b the solid line indicates the median value and the red dot represents the mean value the boxplots show that the mean value for annual power generation across 961 different climate scenarios is 6 80 billion kwh the box length of the separate operation is long as it has a large variance value of 3 86 billion kwh this shows that there are large fluctuations in annual average power generation under different climate related scenarios for the complementary operation scheme the mean power generation value across the 961 climate scenarios is 7 21 billion kwh which is higher than the mean power generation value for the separate operation by 0 41 billion kwh which demonstrates the superiority of the complementary management approach the box length of the complementary operation system is shorter than the separate operation system with a minimum variance value of 2 83 billion kwh this result reveals that the annual average power generation is more stable under the various climate change scenarios after the implementation of the complementary management system in the complementary management mode the increase of pv power generation can compensate for the hydropower with the electricity for example although an increase in solar radiation will lead to increased pv power generation it can lead to increased evaporation and a reduced inflow for hydropower generation as shown in appendix this phenomenon shows that hydropower and pv power are interrelated it enables more electricity to be generated by maintaining a higher water head of the hydropower than with separate management and the energy utilization rate increases and water consumption rate decreases water head increases thereby improving the system power generation hence the increase in pv power output can make up for the decrease in hydropower output caused by the decrease in inflow to a certain extent this advantage is particularly pronounced in climate scenarios with reduced precipitation as shown in scenarios 1 to 465 in fig 3 4 1 2 indicator 2 assurance rate power supply reliability the scatter plots and boxplots of the monthly generation assurance rate are shown in fig 4 from the scatter plots the assurance rate of separate management shows large fluctuations in the amount of solar radiation change in scenarios with reduced precipitation in scenarios with increased mean precipitation the assurance rates were generally stable and all were close to 90 the scatter plots also show that changes in mean solar radiation will greatly impact the assurance rate when mean precipitation decreases conversely the assurance rate remains resistant to changes in solar radiation in scenarios in which precipitation increases the box length is very long with a variance value of 20 77 which indicates that the assurance rate varies greatly with changes in precipitation and solar radiation and the guaranteed rate is sensitive to climate variability the instability that arises also reflects the vulnerability of hydropower and pv power to climate change the monthly assurance rate for power generation is also better under the complementary management scheme fig 4 shows that the box length for the complementary operation system is shorter than the separate operation system with a minimum variance value of 12 03 this shows that the monthly assurance rate under the complementary operation system is more stable than the separate operating system under the various climate change scenarios additionally fig 4 shows that the assurance rate mean value of the complementary operation system for the 961 climate scenarios is 71 61 which is higher than the mean value of 63 14 for the separate operating system this higher overall assurance rate also reflects the superiority of the complementary system this is because in the process of deriving the complementary operating rules hydropower and pv power output work together to achieve the system required minimum output as much as possible in each time period ensuring the power supply assurance rate is one of the goals of the system operation in the derivation model when the overall output is lower than the required minimum output the hydropower generation is used to compensate for deficits from the pv station so as to adjust the overall output of the system needed to meet the output requirement in detail hydropower can store the excess hydropower in the flood season in the form of storage capacity and generate electricity when there is less inflow in the non flood season hence the monthly assurance rate for power generation is better in terms of the overall average level with the complementary management scheme in some scenarios with much higher radiation and higher precipitation the separate management performance is slightly better than the complementary management as the complementary operating rules are derived from a historical optimal operating trajectory they perform better when two resources are in a synergistic complementary when the precipitation is reduced to a small extent and the radiation is also reduced the complementarity of the two resources becomes poor as the mean annual inflow and pv power are reduced mostoftheinflowisusedtoobtain more annual power generation andhencelittlewaterisusedtorefillthe reservoir during the flood season the time periods increase when the power output is lower than the required minimum output during non flood seasons resulting in a decreased assurance rate when the mean annual precipitation remains unchanged and the radiation increases the complementary management is slightly lower than the separate management in a few scenarios but the assurance rate all are around 90 in those scenarios which is acceptable for the complementary management 4 1 3 indicator 3 water shortage index water supply reliability hydropower generation competes with water use further downstream the wsi can describe the destruction of the downstream water supply and can also describe the impact on downstream water supply by reservoir outflow the statistical results of the wsi are shown in fig 5 here we can see that the wsi is relatively low when mean annual precipitation decreases in scenarios 1 to 465 when there is less precipitation the inflow to the reservoir decreases resulting in less outflow and closer to the downstream water demand conversely the wsi increases with increased mean precipitation in scenarios 621 to 961 with increased precipitation the inflow to the reservoir increases allowing for much more power to be generated this in turn improves the water use efficiency resulting in an outflow that far exceeds the downstream water demand which is also the performance of water supply mismatch and reduces water supply benefits the results show that the wsi mean value for the 961 climate scenarios for the complementary operation system was 258 65 which is similar to the value of 295 43 for separate management the indicator value shows that the hybrid system can improve power generation efficiency while taking into account the downstream water demand after the implementation of the complementary management system additionally the box length for the complementary operation system is similar to that for the separate operation system with the variance also being similar for this indicator which comprehensively describes the characteristics of the downstream water shortage the performance of the two management modes is similar indicating that the downstream water supply effect is similar with and without complementary implementation it also shows that the reservoir is consistently able to meet the water demand further downstream after the implementation of the complementary 4 2 comparison of resilience with two management modes to climate change 4 2 1 identification results for acceptable thresholds as a further visual analysis the results are also shown in the form of contour plots with the value of the indicator representing the z dimension under the 961 climate scenarios the economy indicator annual power generation first column of fig 6 power supply reliability indicator assurance rate second column of fig 6 and water supply reliability indicator wsi third column of fig 6 are plotted in a climatic exposure space including 961 climate scenarios defined by changes in the mean monthly precipitation and solar radiation the result shows how the three performance indicators are affected by these two climatic variables changes under the complementary management and separate management modes the first and second rows represent the complementary management and separate management modes respectively the fourth column in fig 6 illustrates the zone of mutually acceptable performance represented by the white range of changes in climatic exposure leading to system success which satisfies the acceptable power generation assurance rate and wsi performance criteria based on fig 6 the following observations can be made first annual power generation is sensitive to changes in both precipitation and solar radiation but is more sensitive to changes in precipitation if solar radiation remains constant then increasing mean precipitation levels will lead to increased annual average power generation to a greater extent than when the precipitation is the same and solar radiation increases when comparing the two management modes the results showed that increased solar radiation while precipitation remained the same the annual power generation decreased degree of separate operation is higher than the degree of complementary operation which increased the acceptable threshold of annual power generation after the implementation of the complementary management mode at different mean precipitation levels the degree of sensitivity of the assurance rate to precipitation is different from the degree of sensitivity to solar radiation when the mean precipitation and solar radiation increase the changes have little effect on the assurance rate when the mean precipitation is lower than the historical average level the assurance rate is more sensitive to changes in precipitation and solar radiation an increase in solar radiation can reduce the wsi after the implementation of a complementary management mode from the wsi contour plots of complementary management we found that the wsi decreases when solar radiation increases while precipitation remains at a high level which in turn increases the efficiency of the water supply in the separate operation system changes in solar radiation also have a similar effect on the wsi value the mutually acceptable threshold of the complementary operation mode is greater than for the separate operation mode which indicates that complementary operation has a better mutually acceptable performance the advantage of complementary operation is that both hydropower and pv power stations will benefit from this operation approach this finding reveals that the mutually acceptable performance increased after the implementation of the complementary management mode which can improve the resilience of the hybrid power system to the effects of climate change 4 2 2 stress test with gcms prediction information fig 7 shows the results of stress tests which are conducted by feeding gcms prediction information into the above climatic exposure space it can be seen that for both management modes the 109 gcms sample points are distributed in the acceptable area white area and unacceptable area gray area of the climatic exposure space the points with the highest scatter density the red point area are all distributed in the white acceptable area for the separate management in fig 7 a the gcm scattered points are distributed in all three zones ⅰ ⅱ and iii of the climatic exposure space it indicates that in future gcms prediction scenarios there are some scenarios that fail to reach the acceptable threshold due to the low value of the power generation or guarantee rate index points in zone ⅰ and some scenarios that fail to reach the acceptable threshold due to the poor index value of the water supply index points in zone iii for the complementary management in fig 7 b the gcm scattered points are only located in zone ⅱ and iii it means that in future gcms prediction scenarios there are only some scenarios that do not reach the acceptable threshold zone iii due to poor water supply index values it also reflects the superiority of complementary management which can decrease the failure scenarios caused by the low value of the power generation or guarantee rate index however it should be noted that there are some gcms scattered points falling into the zone iii this is because power generation and water supply are two mutually exclusive indicators therefore in future complementary management it is necessary to properly balance and coordinate the goals of power generation and other comprehensive utilization for adequately utilizing the comprehensive benefits of the hydro pv hybrid power system 4 3 analysis of the complementary from the perspective of climate variables to further analyze the complementary system from the perspective of climate variables attempting to consider the complementarity of the two renewable energy resources can improve the mutually acceptable performance level for the system the input resource of hydropower is runoff which is mainly influenced by precipitation and evaporation within the river basin for pv solar energy is the input resource the amount of which is determined by the amount of sunshine and the total solar radiation correlation analysis and significance testing of four input factors were performed to analyze the resource complementarity for the hydro pv hybrid power system the analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between precipitation and sunshine duration and a strong correlation between evaporation and radiation fig 8 a and b show the correlation between sunshine duration and precipitation at the monthly and daily scales respectively the figures also show a significant negative correlation between sunshine duration pv and rainfall hydro with a monthly correlation coefficient of 0 40 and a daily correlation coefficient of 0 58 the p value shows the significance levels which are 0 00 for the monthly scale and daily scale and the significance testing is passed at the 0 01 level which indicates that the correlation between the sunshine duration and precipitation is significant fig 8 c and d show the correlation between solar radiation and evaporation at the monthly and daily scales respectively the figures show a significant positive correlation between solar radiation pv and evaporation hydro with monthly and daily correlation coefficients of 0 96 and 0 93 respectively the p values are 0 00 for the monthly scale and daily scale and the significance testing is passed at the 0 01 level which indicates that the positive correlation between the radiation and evaporation is significant the results of the correlation analysis illustrate the complementarity of hydropower and pv from the perspective of the energy resources and show that complementarity between the two resources can improve mutually acceptable performance as well as the resilience of the hydro pv hybrid power system to the effects of climate change 5 conclusions this paper has explored the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary the proposed climate hydrology operation bottom up framework was developed to identify the capacity of a hydro pv hybrid power system adapting to climate change three benefit indicator values were calculated to evaluate their performance under various climate change related scenarios furthermore a large scale hydro pv hybrid power system was conducted to explore the resilience of power systems in a real case from the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the complementary operation of these two power is an effective way to reinforce their resilience to the effects of climate change the range of changes in climatic exposure leading to system success by complementary management is increased under the climate related scenarios that we modeled which could increase about the 9 area in climatic exposure space leading to system success 2 the management scheme of complementary operation shows superiority compared to separate operation according to stress tests in gcms prediction information in the stress tests failure response occurs only in scenarios with poor water supply indictor in complementary operation while for separate operation it fails to reach the acceptable threshold due to all indicators including the poor index value of the water supply power generation or assurance rate 3 the complementarity of the system related climate variables can promote resilience to climate change for the hybrid power system there is a significant negative correlation between solar radiation and rainfall and a significant positive correlation between the radiation and evaporation at monthly and daily scales the complementary operation of the two power sources would be an effective way to improve the utilization efficiency of both sources although a framework for the resilience of the hybrid hydro pv power systems to climate change has been established a number of issues require further research in the future we will deepen the research on the flexible operation of the large scale hydro pv hybrid power systems to respond for changing environment credit authorship contribution statement zhikai yang

3119,the complementary operation of hydro photovoltaic pv hybrid power systems has become a popular and promising management way in modern power systems since hydropower and pv power depend strongly on precipitation and solar energy previous studies have recognized that climate change can affect the stability of standalone hydro or pv power and can threaten energy security however the vast majority of research studies stop at the impact assessment per se and are unexpanded to hybrid power systems the objective of this study was to explore how the complementary operation of this integrated system could be affected by climate change and identify its resilience to climate change a climate hydrology operation bottom up framework was developed to determine the acceptable range of climate change in climatic exposure space where the system can succeed to operate china s longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system was selected as the study site our analysis revealed that 1 the complementary operation of hydro and pv power reinforces the resilience of renewable energy sources to climate change since the range in climatic exposure space leading to system success is increased 2 the management scheme of complementary operation shows superiority compared to separate operation according to stress tests in gcms prediction information and 3 the complementarity of the two sources remains stable regardless of climate change that is if precipitation decreases then sunshine duration increases and evaporation increases while radiation increases thereby allowing for a more consistent level of power generation than independent hydropower and pv plant we propose therefore that managing hydropower and pv resources in a complementary manner can improve the resilience of hydro pv hybrid power systems to climate change and can lead to more effective power benefits keywords hydro photovoltaic hybrid power systems climate change resilience complementary operation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate the risks of climate change and achieve their carbon neutrality goals countries around the world are proactively developing renewable energy resources chu and majumdar 2012 cronin et al 2018 fuso nerini et al 2017 hellin and fisher 2019 macdonald et al 2016 trnka et al 2014 hydropower and photovoltaic pv power are important sources of renewable energy that can mitigate climate change and promote carbon neutrality feng et al 2019 by the end of 2021 hydropower had become the largest global renewable energy source and the rapid development of photovoltaic pv power has become one of the most popular renewable energy sources in recent years duan et al 2022 flecker et al 2022 however hydropower and pv power are all climate driven energy which strongly depend on precipitation and solar energy respectively kozarcanin et al 2019 climate change obviously affects hydro and pv power by influencing the precipitation patterns and solar resources lei et al 2014 schaeffer et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 despite also being key to social and economic development hydropower and pv projects often do not incorporate the effects of future climate change into their planning and operations schaeffer et al 2012 the threat to hydropower and pv power posed by climate change is marked with these two renewable energy sources contributing significantly to the electrical grid in many countries which creates challenges when managing them effectively plenty of studies and reports have shown the negative impacts of climate change on standalone hydropower or pv power plants and these works are mainly evaluated based on historical observations or future forecast information barnett et al 2008 cronin et al 2018 howells et al 2013 hsiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 qin et al 2020 schaeffer et al 2012 schlott et al 2018 sridharan et al 2019 tarroja et al 2016 teotónio et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016a regarding the perspective of the historical observation is to count the power losses caused by actual climate change that has occurred in history e g conway et al 2017 diffenbaugh et al 2015 another is a numerical simulation method based on future climate change prediction information burnett et al 2014 cronin et al 2018 li et al 2020 pan et al 2004 teotónio et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016b consequently many power systems have become increasingly vulnerable and functionally degraded as the climate approaches or breaks through the limit that was originally incorporated in design safety factors however the vast majority of research studies stop at the impact assessment per se to mitigate the threats of climate change on hydropower or pv power some engineering and non engineering measures are usually applied however the economic and environmental costs of retrofitting infrastructure are often enormous beh et al 2015 therefore exploring and designing non engineering measures adapting to climate change may be a priority strategy favored by policy makers the complementary operation of hydro pv hybrid power systems has become a popular and promising way in modern power systems li et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the manage pattern is an effective approach to simultaneously managing hydropower and photovoltaic pv power which can address uncertainties in reservoir inflow and pv power by leveraging the complementarity of hydro and solar power output on temporal spatial scales the complementary operation of hydro pv hybrid power systems has gained more and more attention mainly focusing on the long term operation method or short term stochastic hydro unit commitment model li et al 2021 ming et al 2018a ming et al 2018b yang et al 2018 cheng et al 2022 in these researches the main purpose of the long term operation is to derive operating rules to allocate input energy from a long term perspective li et al 2019 yang et al 2018 while short term scheduling deals with how the system effectively responds to real time load demands with maximum resource utilization guo et al 2022 ming et al 2018a ming et al 2018b with the construction of new large scale hydro pv hybrid power systems the resilience to climate change needs to be identified to enable sustainable use and inform decision makers however few studies address the climate change impact on the hybrid power systems and identify the capacity of the hybrid system adapting to climate change considering the drawbacks above this study used a bottom up framework to identify the capacity of a hydro pv hybrid power system to adapt to climate change and to compare the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary the main objectives of this study are summarized as below 1 to establish a climate hydrology operation coupled model for identifying the range in climatic exposure space leading to system success and failure 2 to conduct a stress test for comparing the resilience of hydro pv power with and without implementing the complementary based on gcms prediction information and 3 to analyze the complementary relationship of climate variables that drive the hydropower and pv power in different time scales this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the climatic exposure space generation the hydro pv hybrid power system operation module and the stress test design section 3 discusses the application of this method in a case study based on the longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system results and discussion are presented in section 4 then we conclude with a summary of the main outcomes in section 5 2 methodology the proposed methodology for analyzing the resilience of hydro pv hybrid power system to climate change consists of the following three separately modules 1 weather generator module to generate climate alteration scenarios two parameter monthly water balance model twbm as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflow from those climate alteration scenarios 2 multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation module to generate system performance indicators under climate change scenarios 3 identification of system acceptable thresholds by stress test under different operation modes and climate change the structure of the proposed methodology is described in fig 1 the details of each module are given as follows 2 1 weather generator and hydrological simulation module 2 1 1 weather generator model the climate change scenarios are simulated with the lars wg weather simulation model a stochastic weather generator developed by rothamsted research semenov 2008 semenov et al 1998 lars wg is a stochastic weather generator based on the series approach which produces synthetic daily time series of maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation semenov 2008 semenov et al 1998 semenov and stratonovitch 2010 the weather generator may be used to generate synthetic weather data that have the same statistical characteristics as the observed data or to generate synthetic weather data corresponding to a scenario of climate change trnka et al 2014 a series of precipitation and radiation mean alteration scenarios can be generated by the lars wg weather generator these realizations will all have the same statistical characteristics but they will differ on a day to day basis the various precipitation mean alteration conditions are used as input of hydrologic model for obtaining runoff consequences of climate change then the various runoff consequences and radiation mean alteration conditions are used as input of multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation model further details of the weather generator can be found in appendix 2 1 2 hydrological simulation model for the long term forecasting of the consequences of runoff distribution under different scenarios the monthly water balance model has been widely employed for converting precipitation into runoff to assess climate change impacts xiong and guo 1999 xiong et al 2019 in this study the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm was used for obtaining runoff levels from weather data generated by the lars wg the twbm is a month long hydrological model proposed by xiong and guo xiong and guo 1999 it has been widely used for monthly runoff simulation and forecast xiong and guo 1999 the inputs of the model include monthly precipitation and potential evaporation the actual monthly evaporation is calculated as follows 1 e m t c 1 e p m t tanh p m t ep m t e p m t c 2 1 λ δ δ γ r m t c 3 where e m t denotes the actual monthly evaporation under climate scenario m ep m t denotes the monthly pan evaporation

multi purpose hydro pv hybrid power system operation module 2 2 1 two management modes for hydro and pv power we hypothesize that the complementary operation of the two power systems could provide an opportunity to build a more sustainable and resilient power supply system under different climate change scenarios to compare the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary we modeled three indicators over a series of climate change related scenarios subject to two management schemes 1 the complementary management of the hydro pv plant and 2 the separate management of hydro and pv power mode 1 an integrated system operation using complementary operating rules eq 3 the first mode is complementary management which means operating the hydro pv plant by complementary operating rules the complementary operating rules are derived from historical optimal operating trajectory by implicit stochastic optimization which consists of three modules deterministic optimization selection of independent and decision variables and derivation of operating rules liu et al 2014 yang et al 2018 in the derivation model when the overall output is lower than the required minimum output the hydropower generation is used to compensate for deficits from the pv station so as to adjust the overall output of the system needed to meet the output requirement meanwhile the pv curtailment is considered by a pv power curtailment function which represents the relationship between the hydropower output and the pv curtailment rate further details can be found in ming et al 2019 therefore in these complementary operating rules the complementarity of both hydropower and pv power is taken into account 3 d m t α k a e m t β k α k i e m t s e m t β

station liu et al 2011 liu et al 2006 yang et al 2018 in this study three management evaluation indicators were used annual power generation economy the generation assurance rate power supply reliability and the water shortage index wsi water supply reliability power generation is a critical operational economic indicator while the power generation assurance rate must be high enough to ensure reliability in the electricity supply liu et al 2014 yang et al 2021 additionally the wsi is a proper quantitative indicator that can comprehensively describe the matching degree of water supply and demand and it is ideal to supply water as close to downstream comprehensive water requirements as possible ming et al 2019 si et al 2019 therefore the operation module has three different performance indicators of the system as a whole 1 indicator 1 the total generation output of the system 13 n m t 1 t t 1 t n hpv m t δ t t 2 indicator 2 the reliability of the system s output 14 f m t

s 2 3 2 identification of the mutually acceptable thresholds the stress test can effectively evaluate how the three performance indicators of the hydro pv hybrid power system respond to climate change in detail the isopleth map can describe intuitively the performance indicator change with climate statistics change and identify the conditions under which the system satisfies the performance indicator poff et al 2016 then the acceptable thresholds of the system with different operation schemes under climate change can be identified at the same time the sensitivity of the system to climate variables can be observed to identify which factor is sensitive to the hydro pv hybrid power system specifically the climate change scenarios data were then fed into the climate hydrology operation framework model to evaluate the outcomes of the three performance indicators under the two management schemes and the various climate change scenarios the results in the form of contour plots with the value of the indicator representing the z dimension under different climate scenarios can visually show how the management evaluation indicators respond to climate change when the indicator value exceeded or below a certain level of the historical simulated mean value deemed unacceptable for the system the value can be represented in the contour plots as a contour boundary line the boundary line of the three indicator values can then form a mutually acceptable threshold which can intuitively represent an acceptable level of climate change for the system in the hydro pv hybrid power systems resilience is defined as the range in climatic exposure space leading to energy system success in detail the climatic exposure space is generated by making a series of incremental changes to attributes of precipitation and radiation the range is the zone of mutually acceptable performance in climatic exposure space leading to system success which satisfies the minimum performance criteria for acceptable power generation assurance rate and wsi indicators simultaneously for the gcms prediction information they are used to stress test by feeding them into the above climate change exposure space firstly calculating how much the mean value of climate variables has changed relative to history then feeding them into the above climate change exposure space to observe where the gcms scattered points are distributed in the space 3 case study 3 1 overview the longyangxia hydro pv hybrid power system which is an integrated 850 mw grid connected pv power plant is the largest of its kind in the world it is located in the source basin of the yellow river sbyr on the qinghai tibet plateau china fig 2 as a separate climate zone the qinghai tibet plateau is not only the starting zone for weather changes in china but is also clearly experiencing the effects of climate change as it has warmed approximately three times as fast as the global average rate of warming over the past fifty years chen et al 2014 piao et al 2011 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2012 yi et al 2019 qiu 2008 as the first cascade hydropower station on the upper reaches of the yellow river longyangxia hydropower station was originally built to generate power control flooding provide irrigation and supply water the hydropower station contains a total of four turbines each with a capacity of 320 mw resulting in a total installed capacity of 1280 mw the pv power plant is located in the western part of the gonghe county 130 km from xining the first phase of the project saw 320 mw was installed in 2013 the second phase of the project installed 530 mw which was completed in 2015 creating a large scale grid connected pv power plant at 850 mw total capacity the system generates electricity that is transmitted to the grid through the longyangxia hydropower station transmission lines 3 2 input data and simulation setup the primary input data used in this study included three parts weather generator model data sets hydrologic simulation model data sets and gcms forecast information in this study the lars wg was calibrated using a meteorological observation dataset i e daily temperature rainfall and sunshine duration covering a 31 year period 1980 2010 the dataset was observed by 13 weather stations throughout the sbyr to verify the performance of the lars wg we generated several different realizations of weather time series by selecting a different random seed value at every weather station and comparing it with the observed data the climate change exposure space is generated by making a series of incremental changes to attributes of precipitation and radiation which is conducted by a weather generator the change in mean annual precipitation varies from 70 to 130 relative to history in discrete steps of 2 the shift in radiation settings is similar to the precipitation therefore the climate change exposure space includes a total of 961 31 31 scenarios we calibrated and validated the twbm using the streamflow observations 1980 2010 from the tangnaihe hydrometric station at the mouth of the sbyr as well as monthly precipitation and pan evaporation datasets taken from the 13 weather stations within the sbyr the calibration of the model was performed using the shuffled complex evolution approach developed by the university of arizona duan et al 1993 four evaluation criteria namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency the water balance indicator the correlation coefficient and root mean square error are used to evaluate the runoff simulation results prediction information about climate change was from several gcm simulation results under four emission scenarios and further downscaled using the bias correction approach the statistical downscaling procedure was developed by liu and zuo 2012 the emission scenarios comprised the representative concentration pathway 2 6 rcp2 6 scenario rcp4 5 scenario rcp6 0 scenario and rcp8 5 scenario samset et al 2020 to connect the time of hydrologic simulation module datasets the data period of forecast information is selected from 2011 to 2035 a detailed general information description of the 109 chosen gcms are given in appendix which includes a total of 109 future projection scenarios for precipitation and radiation changes 4 results and discussion 4 1 three performance indicators of two management modes under different climate scenarios 4 1 1 indicator 1 power generation economy fig 3 a shows the annual average power generation of the two management modes under various climate related scenarios the figure shows that both hydropower and pv power are strongly sensitive to climate change with the different performance indicators having different degrees of sensitivity the annual average power generation increases with increased precipitation and decreases with increased solar radiation mean which indicates that changes in precipitation and solar radiation will affect the annual average power generation the boxplots describe the distribution of the performance indicator values for the two management schemes and are presented in the second row of fig 3 b the solid line indicates the median value and the red dot represents the mean value the boxplots show that the mean value for annual power generation across 961 different climate scenarios is 6 80 billion kwh the box length of the separate operation is long as it has a large variance value of 3 86 billion kwh this shows that there are large fluctuations in annual average power generation under different climate related scenarios for the complementary operation scheme the mean power generation value across the 961 climate scenarios is 7 21 billion kwh which is higher than the mean power generation value for the separate operation by 0 41 billion kwh which demonstrates the superiority of the complementary management approach the box length of the complementary operation system is shorter than the separate operation system with a minimum variance value of 2 83 billion kwh this result reveals that the annual average power generation is more stable under the various climate change scenarios after the implementation of the complementary management system in the complementary management mode the increase of pv power generation can compensate for the hydropower with the electricity for example although an increase in solar radiation will lead to increased pv power generation it can lead to increased evaporation and a reduced inflow for hydropower generation as shown in appendix this phenomenon shows that hydropower and pv power are interrelated it enables more electricity to be generated by maintaining a higher water head of the hydropower than with separate management and the energy utilization rate increases and water consumption rate decreases water head increases thereby improving the system power generation hence the increase in pv power output can make up for the decrease in hydropower output caused by the decrease in inflow to a certain extent this advantage is particularly pronounced in climate scenarios with reduced precipitation as shown in scenarios 1 to 465 in fig 3 4 1 2 indicator 2 assurance rate power supply reliability the scatter plots and boxplots of the monthly generation assurance rate are shown in fig 4 from the scatter plots the assurance rate of separate management shows large fluctuations in the amount of solar radiation change in scenarios with reduced precipitation in scenarios with increased mean precipitation the assurance rates were generally stable and all were close to 90 the scatter plots also show that changes in mean solar radiation will greatly impact the assurance rate when mean precipitation decreases conversely the assurance rate remains resistant to changes in solar radiation in scenarios in which precipitation increases the box length is very long with a variance value of 20 77 which indicates that the assurance rate varies greatly with changes in precipitation and solar radiation and the guaranteed rate is sensitive to climate variability the instability that arises also reflects the vulnerability of hydropower and pv power to climate change the monthly assurance rate for power generation is also better under the complementary management scheme fig 4 shows that the box length for the complementary operation system is shorter than the separate operation system with a minimum variance value of 12 03 this shows that the monthly assurance rate under the complementary operation system is more stable than the separate operating system under the various climate change scenarios additionally fig 4 shows that the assurance rate mean value of the complementary operation system for the 961 climate scenarios is 71 61 which is higher than the mean value of 63 14 for the separate operating system this higher overall assurance rate also reflects the superiority of the complementary system this is because in the process of deriving the complementary operating rules hydropower and pv power output work together to achieve the system required minimum output as much as possible in each time period ensuring the power supply assurance rate is one of the goals of the system operation in the derivation model when the overall output is lower than the required minimum output the hydropower generation is used to compensate for deficits from the pv station so as to adjust the overall output of the system needed to meet the output requirement in detail hydropower can store the excess hydropower in the flood season in the form of storage capacity and generate electricity when there is less inflow in the non flood season hence the monthly assurance rate for power generation is better in terms of the overall average level with the complementary management scheme in some scenarios with much higher radiation and higher precipitation the separate management performance is slightly better than the complementary management as the complementary operating rules are derived from a historical optimal operating trajectory they perform better when two resources are in a synergistic complementary when the precipitation is reduced to a small extent and the radiation is also reduced the complementarity of the two resources becomes poor as the mean annual inflow and pv power are reduced mostoftheinflowisusedtoobtain more annual power generation andhencelittlewaterisusedtorefillthe reservoir during the flood season the time periods increase when the power output is lower than the required minimum output during non flood seasons resulting in a decreased assurance rate when the mean annual precipitation remains unchanged and the radiation increases the complementary management is slightly lower than the separate management in a few scenarios but the assurance rate all are around 90 in those scenarios which is acceptable for the complementary management 4 1 3 indicator 3 water shortage index water supply reliability hydropower generation competes with water use further downstream the wsi can describe the destruction of the downstream water supply and can also describe the impact on downstream water supply by reservoir outflow the statistical results of the wsi are shown in fig 5 here we can see that the wsi is relatively low when mean annual precipitation decreases in scenarios 1 to 465 when there is less precipitation the inflow to the reservoir decreases resulting in less outflow and closer to the downstream water demand conversely the wsi increases with increased mean precipitation in scenarios 621 to 961 with increased precipitation the inflow to the reservoir increases allowing for much more power to be generated this in turn improves the water use efficiency resulting in an outflow that far exceeds the downstream water demand which is also the performance of water supply mismatch and reduces water supply benefits the results show that the wsi mean value for the 961 climate scenarios for the complementary operation system was 258 65 which is similar to the value of 295 43 for separate management the indicator value shows that the hybrid system can improve power generation efficiency while taking into account the downstream water demand after the implementation of the complementary management system additionally the box length for the complementary operation system is similar to that for the separate operation system with the variance also being similar for this indicator which comprehensively describes the characteristics of the downstream water shortage the performance of the two management modes is similar indicating that the downstream water supply effect is similar with and without complementary implementation it also shows that the reservoir is consistently able to meet the water demand further downstream after the implementation of the complementary 4 2 comparison of resilience with two management modes to climate change 4 2 1 identification results for acceptable thresholds as a further visual analysis the results are also shown in the form of contour plots with the value of the indicator representing the z dimension under the 961 climate scenarios the economy indicator annual power generation first column of fig 6 power supply reliability indicator assurance rate second column of fig 6 and water supply reliability indicator wsi third column of fig 6 are plotted in a climatic exposure space including 961 climate scenarios defined by changes in the mean monthly precipitation and solar radiation the result shows how the three performance indicators are affected by these two climatic variables changes under the complementary management and separate management modes the first and second rows represent the complementary management and separate management modes respectively the fourth column in fig 6 illustrates the zone of mutually acceptable performance represented by the white range of changes in climatic exposure leading to system success which satisfies the acceptable power generation assurance rate and wsi performance criteria based on fig 6 the following observations can be made first annual power generation is sensitive to changes in both precipitation and solar radiation but is more sensitive to changes in precipitation if solar radiation remains constant then increasing mean precipitation levels will lead to increased annual average power generation to a greater extent than when the precipitation is the same and solar radiation increases when comparing the two management modes the results showed that increased solar radiation while precipitation remained the same the annual power generation decreased degree of separate operation is higher than the degree of complementary operation which increased the acceptable threshold of annual power generation after the implementation of the complementary management mode at different mean precipitation levels the degree of sensitivity of the assurance rate to precipitation is different from the degree of sensitivity to solar radiation when the mean precipitation and solar radiation increase the changes have little effect on the assurance rate when the mean precipitation is lower than the historical average level the assurance rate is more sensitive to changes in precipitation and solar radiation an increase in solar radiation can reduce the wsi after the implementation of a complementary management mode from the wsi contour plots of complementary management we found that the wsi decreases when solar radiation increases while precipitation remains at a high level which in turn increases the efficiency of the water supply in the separate operation system changes in solar radiation also have a similar effect on the wsi value the mutually acceptable threshold of the complementary operation mode is greater than for the separate operation mode which indicates that complementary operation has a better mutually acceptable performance the advantage of complementary operation is that both hydropower and pv power stations will benefit from this operation approach this finding reveals that the mutually acceptable performance increased after the implementation of the complementary management mode which can improve the resilience of the hybrid power system to the effects of climate change 4 2 2 stress test with gcms prediction information fig 7 shows the results of stress tests which are conducted by feeding gcms prediction information into the above climatic exposure space it can be seen that for both management modes the 109 gcms sample points are distributed in the acceptable area white area and unacceptable area gray area of the climatic exposure space the points with the highest scatter density the red point area are all distributed in the white acceptable area for the separate management in fig 7 a the gcm scattered points are distributed in all three zones ⅰ ⅱ and iii of the climatic exposure space it indicates that in future gcms prediction scenarios there are some scenarios that fail to reach the acceptable threshold due to the low value of the power generation or guarantee rate index points in zone ⅰ and some scenarios that fail to reach the acceptable threshold due to the poor index value of the water supply index points in zone iii for the complementary management in fig 7 b the gcm scattered points are only located in zone ⅱ and iii it means that in future gcms prediction scenarios there are only some scenarios that do not reach the acceptable threshold zone iii due to poor water supply index values it also reflects the superiority of complementary management which can decrease the failure scenarios caused by the low value of the power generation or guarantee rate index however it should be noted that there are some gcms scattered points falling into the zone iii this is because power generation and water supply are two mutually exclusive indicators therefore in future complementary management it is necessary to properly balance and coordinate the goals of power generation and other comprehensive utilization for adequately utilizing the comprehensive benefits of the hydro pv hybrid power system 4 3 analysis of the complementary from the perspective of climate variables to further analyze the complementary system from the perspective of climate variables attempting to consider the complementarity of the two renewable energy resources can improve the mutually acceptable performance level for the system the input resource of hydropower is runoff which is mainly influenced by precipitation and evaporation within the river basin for pv solar energy is the input resource the amount of which is determined by the amount of sunshine and the total solar radiation correlation analysis and significance testing of four input factors were performed to analyze the resource complementarity for the hydro pv hybrid power system the analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between precipitation and sunshine duration and a strong correlation between evaporation and radiation fig 8 a and b show the correlation between sunshine duration and precipitation at the monthly and daily scales respectively the figures also show a significant negative correlation between sunshine duration pv and rainfall hydro with a monthly correlation coefficient of 0 40 and a daily correlation coefficient of 0 58 the p value shows the significance levels which are 0 00 for the monthly scale and daily scale and the significance testing is passed at the 0 01 level which indicates that the correlation between the sunshine duration and precipitation is significant fig 8 c and d show the correlation between solar radiation and evaporation at the monthly and daily scales respectively the figures show a significant positive correlation between solar radiation pv and evaporation hydro with monthly and daily correlation coefficients of 0 96 and 0 93 respectively the p values are 0 00 for the monthly scale and daily scale and the significance testing is passed at the 0 01 level which indicates that the positive correlation between the radiation and evaporation is significant the results of the correlation analysis illustrate the complementarity of hydropower and pv from the perspective of the energy resources and show that complementarity between the two resources can improve mutually acceptable performance as well as the resilience of the hydro pv hybrid power system to the effects of climate change 5 conclusions this paper has explored the resilience of the two power systems to climate change with and without implementing the complementary the proposed climate hydrology operation bottom up framework was developed to identify the capacity of a hydro pv hybrid power system adapting to climate change three benefit indicator values were calculated to evaluate their performance under various climate change related scenarios furthermore a large scale hydro pv hybrid power system was conducted to explore the resilience of power systems in a real case from the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the complementary operation of these two power is an effective way to reinforce their resilience to the effects of climate change the range of changes in climatic exposure leading to system success by complementary management is increased under the climate related scenarios that we modeled which could increase about the 9 area in climatic exposure space leading to system success 2 the management scheme of complementary operation shows superiority compared to separate operation according to stress tests in gcms prediction information in the stress tests failure response occurs only in scenarios with poor water supply indictor in complementary operation while for separate operation it fails to reach the acceptable threshold due to all indicators including the poor index value of the water supply power generation or assurance rate 3 the complementarity of the system related climate variables can promote resilience to climate change for the hybrid power system there is a significant negative correlation between solar radiation and rainfall and a significant positive correlation between the radiation and evaporation at monthly and daily scales the complementary operation of the two power sources would be an effective way to improve the utilization efficiency of both sources although a framework for the resilience of the hybrid hydro pv power systems to climate change has been established a number of issues require further research in the future we will deepen the research on the flexible operation of the large scale hydro pv hybrid power systems to respond for changing environment credit authorship contribution statement zhikai yang
