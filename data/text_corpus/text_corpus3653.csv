18265,groundwater ecosystems face the challenge of energy limitation due to the absence of light driven primary production lack of space and low oxygen availability might further contribute to generally assumed low food web complexity chemolithoautotrophy provides additional input of carbon within the subsurface however we still do not understand how abundances of chemolithoautotrophs differences in surface carbon input and oxygen availability control subsurface food web complexity using a molecular approach we aimed to disentangle the different levels of potential trophic interactions in oligotrophic groundwater along a hillslope setting of alternating mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock with contrasting hydrochemical conditions and hotspots of chemolithoautotrophy across all sites groundwater harbored diverse protist communities including ciliophora cercozoa centroheliozoa and amoebozoa but correlations with hydrochemical parameters were less pronounced for eukaryotes compared to bacteria ciliophora affiliated reads dominated the eukaryotic data sets across all sites dna based evidence for the presence of metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida arthropoda and stenostomidae platyhelminthes was only found at wells where abundances of functional genes associated with chemolithoautotrophy were 10 100 times higher compared to wells without indications of these top predators at wells closer to recharge areas with presumably increased inputs of soil derived substances and biota fungi accounted for up to 85 of the metazoan curated eukaryotic sequence data together with a low potential for chemolithoautotrophy although we did not directly observe higher organisms our results point to the existence of complex food webs with several trophic levels in oligotrophic groundwater chemolithoautotrophy appears to provide strong support to more complex trophic interactions feeding in additional biomass produced by light independent co2 fixation graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary rock aquifers protists fungi trophic interactions 16s rrna v3 v4 18s rrna v1 v3 1 introduction an estimated 90 of the prokaryotic biomass on earth is hidden within the subsurface hosting mainly microbial communities of bacteria and archaea bar on et al 2018 but also protozoa fungi and metazoa play an active role in subsurface biogeochemical processes griebler and lueders 2009 in groundwater ecosystems prokaryotic activity is strongly influenced by nutrient availability supporting both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial biomass production contrasting with low intensity of top down control by higher trophic levels foulquier et al 2011 however selective grazing of bacterivorous protozoa may result in changes of the bacterial community composition novarino et al 1997 sinclair et al 1993 kinner et al 2002 stygofauna groundwater metazoans also consume microbial biomass and thus contribute substantially to water purification and maintenance of hydraulic connectivity but they can also stimulate microbial processes via excretion of organic substances reviewed in saccὸ et al 2019 however their distribution is strongly limited by the availability of food and oxygen mösslacher 2003 hahn 2006 photosynthesis driven primary production fuels complex food webs in pelagic freshwater or marine ecosystems with multiple trophic levels including unicellular organisms up to large metazoa brett and goldman 1997 d alelio et al 2016 due to the lack of sunlight and space and often anoxic conditions in the subsurface groundwater food webs have been believed to be species poor and often to comprise only one or two trophic levels gibert and deharveng 2002 but near surface groundwater still receives allochthonous organic matter input with spatial and temporal variation depending on the hydrological connectivity to the surface foulquier et al 2011 hutchins et al 2016 furthermore there is growing evidence of an important role of chemolithoautotrophic co2 fixation in subsurface carbon cycling pedersen 1997 alfreider et al 2003 akob and küsel 2011 herrmann et al 2015 forming an additional basis of aquifer food webs in fact biomass produced by chemolithoautotrophy represents a rather stable resource since its availability is largely decoupled from surface processes hutchins et al 2016 given a geogenic availability of the preferentially exploited inorganic electron donor in a recent study of karstic edwards aquifer hutchins et al 2016 showed that organic matter which was produced chemolithoautotrophically accounted for 25 69 of the organic matter utilized by stygobiont communities at higher trophic levels similarly 21 of the diet of cave adapted shrimps in coastal groundwater of the yucatan peninsula was based on carbon from methanotrophic bacteria brankovits et al 2017 however more detailed information is needed on how and how much chemolithoautotrophy affects eukaryotic species diversity their feeding strategies and trophic interactions among all community members along the groundwater food chain similarly we need to know how eukaryotic communities and their interactions are modulated by hydrochemical conditions the hainich critical zone exploratory cze located in central germany provides unique subsurface access to study groundwater ecology in sedimentary bedrock along a groundwater monitoring transect under temperate climate conditions the hillslope flow system in thin bedded limestone mudstone alternations is strongly compartmentalized with characteristic biogeochemical regimes from oxic to anoxic conditions küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 which allows for the exploration of surface subsurface interactions and controls of subsurface food webs under different redox regimes along the transect we identified certain hot spots for chemolithoautotrophy wegner et al 2019 several studies revealed corresponding hydrochemistry driven patterns of bacterial archaeal and fungal diversity in the groundwater lazar et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 nawaz et al 2018 while communities at higher trophic levels and their potential feeding strategies are largely unknown in this study we hypothesized that the number of trophic levels in particular the presence of metazoan top predators is primarily determined by oxygen availability in the hainich oligotrophic groundwater and that the identity of the food web s key players and their resulting interactions are shaped by the different hydrochemical regimes of the groundwater furthermore we assumed that the differences of chemolithoautotrophic potentials observed along the transect will affect trophic interactions within the subsurface food webs 2 methods 2 1 study site sampling of groundwater and chemical analysis in a central german cultural landscape nw thuringia the monitoring groundwater well transect of the hainich cze accesses triassic bedrock at the eastern hillslope of the hainich low mountain range the sloping muschelkalk strata comprise thin bedded marine alternations of limestones and mudstones and host a multi storey aquifer system kohlhepp et al 2017 the study site and its hydrogeological and hydrochemical properties have been previously described in detail küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 in brief oxic conditions occur in the limestone

h14 h32 in the downslope direction both shallow wells h42 h43 and deep wells h52 h53 of the minor aquifer assemblage are characterized by suboxic to anoxic conditions fig 1 a wells also differ with regard to nitrogen chemistry with moderate to high nitrate concentrations in wells h31 and h32 and lower concentrations in wells h13 h14 h42 h43 h52 and h53 fig 1a the groundwater of all wells is characterized by circumneutral ph 6 9 7 4 high concentrations of dissolved co2 and bicarbonate 0 6 1 6 mmol l 1 and 5 0 7 7 mmol l 1 respectively and low but rather steady contents of organic carbon

filtration dna extraction and amplicon sequencing performed for groundwater wells h41 and h52 in july 2016 revealed only very small variation between replicates of each site compared to the spatial differences we observed between sampling sites 2 3 sequence analysis bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences and eukaryotic 18s rrna gene sequences obtained from miseq illumina amplicon sequencing were analyzed using mothur v1 39 schloss et al 2009 along with the silva bacteria reference alignment v132 quast et al 2013 according to the schloss sop http www mothur org wiki schloss sop kozich et al 2013 chimera search was done using the uchime algorithm implemented in mothur raw read numbers ranged from 17816 to 267356 average 85049 and from 19000 to 318665 average 74958 for the eukaryotic and bacterial ssu rrna data sets respectively read numbers after quality filtering ranged from 3842 to 123272 average 41315 and from 9730 to 226296 average 40947 for the eukaryotic and bacterial ssu rrna data sets respectively supplementary tables 1 and 2 to improve approximation of the relative abundances of unicellular taxa based on the 18s rrna gene sequence data we removed all sequences affiliated with plants or metazoa prior to assignment of operational taxonomic units otus and further statistical analysis the uncorrected data are provided as supplementary material supplementary figs 1 and 2 bacterial and eukaryotic community data sets were normalized to the same number of sequence reads per sample 9730 reads for the bacterial communities and 6057 reads for the eukaryotic communities using the sub sample command implemented in mothur which led to the exclusion of a few samples with read numbers lower than 6057 for the eukaryotic data sets sequence analysis of rubisco encoding genes was carried out using mothur with a few adjustments necessary for the analysis of protein encoding genes including bioedit http www mbio ncsu edu bioedit bioedit html as described in kumar et al

tool mena molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi deng et al 2012 with settings as described in supplementary material networks were visualized using cytoscape v 3 4 1 3 results 3 1 groundwater harbors diverse communities of protists fungi and metazoa to address the question if eukaryotic and bacterial community patterns and abundances show similar preferences across the different depths and topographic positions and thus groundwater quality we compared bacterial and eukaryotic community structures for seven time points on the dna level in addition three and two time points were analyzed on the rna level for bacteria and eukaryotes respectively using a 0 03 distance cut off for the assignment of species level otus numbers of otus ranged from 297 to 4701 average 1134 for eukaryotic 18s rrna genes without metazoa and from 749 to 4456 average 2177 for bacterial 16s rrna genes supplementary tables 1 and 2 based on non metric multidimensional scaling clustering patterns were less distinct for the eukaryotic compared to the bacterial communities supplementary fig 3 using jaccard similarity indices of otu distribution patterns across samples for both communities samples from wells h13 h14 at the hilltop position and samples from wells h42 h43 and h52 h53 respectively clustered separately however temporal variation among samples taken from the same well was higher for the eukaryotic communities abundances of eukaryotic 18s rrna genes originating from protists and fungi varied by two orders of magnitude across sites and ranged from 1 6 105 to 4 8 107 genes per l groundwater in contrast abundances of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed lower spatial variations by only one order of magnitude with additionally rather stable abundances over time at each individual groundwater well fig 1b maximum bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances were observed at the two suboxic to anoxic wells h52 and h53 mean values 2 4 108 3 5 108 genes per l groundwater and lower abundances in the anoxic groundwater of wells h42 and h43 2 2 107 and 1 5 107 genes l 1 and in the oxic groundwater of the two downstream wells h41 4 0 107 genes l 1 and h51 2 8 107 genes l 1 across all sites we found a strong predominance of few species level taxa within the eukaryotic communities with the 15 most abundant otus accounting for 17 59 of the 18s rrna gene sequence reads fig 2 in general ciliophora formed the largest fraction of the eukaryotic sequence reads 18 81 with the highest contribution in the anoxic groundwater of wells h52 h53 followed by cercozoa with the highest fraction in the oxic wells h31 h32 h41 h51 mean values 5 2 48 a large part of this fraction was often accounted for by a single species level otu such as eukotu03 cercozoa 40 of the sequence reads in oxic well h41 or eukotu02 ciliophora 33 39 in wells h52 and h53 fig 2b other flagellate groups commonly observed in the groundwater included ochrophyta aquavolonida ichthyosporea and protalveolata fig 2 sequences affiliated with centroheliozoa amoebozoa tubulinea and discosea and pigoraptor were consistently detected in small fractions of usually less than 4 in both oxic and anoxic groundwater the largest read fraction of metazoan origin was affiliated with chaetonotidae gastrotricha which were found in both oxic and anoxic groundwater up to 53 of the non corrected data set supplementary figs 1 and 2 groundwater of wells of the lower oxic aquifer main aquifer except for the hilltop location occasionally harbored signals of the crustacean group cyclopoida maxillopoda 0 1 5 1 which were also found in lower read numbers in the anoxic groundwater of well h52 similarly sequences affiliated with stenostomidae 0 1 11 8 freshwater catenulid flatworms belonging to the platyhelminthes were detected under both oxic and anoxic conditions in wells h31 h32 h41 h51 and h52 sequences affiliated with these metazoan top predators were detected in 74 of the samples from oxic wells and in turn were absent from 75 of the anoxic wells pointing to a positive relationship between presence of metazoan top predators and oxic conditions chi square test p 0 0009 sequences affiliated with rotifera ploimida were only found in the groundwater of wells h31 h32 h41 h51 h42 and h43 supplemental figs 1 and 2 porifera accounted for up to 3 3 of the sequence reads in the anoxic wells h42 and h43 but for less than 0 6 across the other wells in turn sequence reads affiliated with subterranean polychaeta troglochaetus beranecki 99 8 sequence identity were occasionally observed in the oxic wells but were not detected in the anoxic wells except for the two wells at the hilltop position of the transect all wells also harbored sequence reads affiliated with cnidaria distantly related to antipatharia anthozoa 88 sequence identity occasionally we also found signatures of nematoda wells h14 h43 h52 h53 or of soil dwelling animals such as collembola wells h14 h31 h32 h42 h51 in addition we detected low numbers of sequence reads of other metazoa usually 10 reads in a few samples affiliated with malacostraca lumbriculida aranea acari and insecta and higher plants most likely originating from pollen notably for the samples obtained in march 2015 and june 2015 up to 99 9 of the 18s rrna gene sequence reads were affiliated with ascomycota hypocreales for six of the eight wells sampled at that time point fig 3 these increased fractions of ascomycota coincided with an increase in 18s rrna gene abundances by up to one order of magnitude suggesting that these fungi occurred sporadically in large amounts in addition to the groundwater protist and fungi community observed at the other time points fig 3 while ascomycota were also commonly detected in the groundwater of wells h42 and h43 mean values 15 9 19 9 of the sequence reads fig 2 they formed only a small fraction of the eukaryotic reads in the groundwater of the other wells 0 3 7 3 in wells h13 and h14 at the hilltop position we found an increased fraction of mucoromycota eukotu05 accounting for 38 of the sequence reads in well h13 chytridiomycota and smaller contributions of basidiomycota figs 2 and 3 despite their occasional predominance in the dna based communities ascomycota were only poorly represented in the communities derived from rna based sequencing the strongest indication of the presence of active fungi was obtained for wells h31 h42 and h43 where fungal reads accounted for 6 8 11 5 of the sequences of the rna based fraction across all sites the rna based fraction was mostly dominated by ciliophora affiliated reads fig 2 among metazoan groups cyclopoida chaetonotidae and rotifera were also detected on the rna level in selected wells supplementary fig 1 out of the 30 most abundant protist or fungal otus a considerable fraction did not show any correlation with 15 hydrochemical parameters tested in this study supplementary fig 4 for some eukaryotic groups dissolved oxygen or the parameter combination sodium magnesium ammonium and potassium played an important role in distinguishing sub communities that corresponded in a similar way to these parameters doc and toc were hardly involved in significant correlations since the availability of prey may be an important driver of the distribution patterns of eukaryotic taxa we correlated estimated total abundances of the 140 most abundant eukaryotic otus with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances among the protist groups 45 of all ciliophora affiliated otus and 60 of centroheliozoa or aquavolonida affiliated otus in this subset were positively correlated to bacterial abundances while this fraction was lower for other protist groups supplementary table 3 an overview of the taxonomic affiliation and the fasta sequences of all otus is provided as supplementary material supplementary data set euk taxonomy xls supplementary data sets rep otus protists fungi fasta rep otus metazoa plants fasta 3 2 cand patescibacteria and nitrospirae dominate the bacterial communities in contrast to the eukaryotic taxa the 30 most abundant bacterial species level taxa appeared to have specific preferences for a given hydrochemical environment supplementary fig 5 suggesting that the mechanisms driving bacterial and eukaryotic distribution patterns across the hillslope groundwater flow system were substantially different in general groundwater bacterial communities as potential prey for the eukaryotic taxa were dominated by members of the cand patescibacteria nitrospirae gamma and deltaproteobacteria which together accounted for 50 70 of the total community across sites and time points candidate phyla including cand patescibacteria cand parcubacteria cand class aby1 cand gracilibacteria cand saccharimonadia and cand omnitrophicaeota were especially abundant in the groundwater communities of oxic wells h14 and h32 with a contribution of almost 50 fig 4 a contrasting with their predominance on the dna level candidate phyla were strongly underrepresented in the bacterial communities derived from rna based sequencing here dominance was shifted in favor of thermodesulfovibrionia nitrospirae distantly related to the presumably facultative autotroph cand nitrobium arshad et al 2017 gamma and deltaproteobacteria and autotrophic brocadiaceae planctomycetes in wells h52 and h53 a single otu affiliated with thermodesulfovibrionia bacotu001 already accounted for 15 and 26 of the sequence reads on the dna and rna level respectively in the oxic groundwater of wells h31 h41 and h51 sequence reads affiliated with the genus nitrospira nitrospirae were strongly increased in the rna based communities up to 41 in well h41 with two otus bacotu004 and bacotu006 already accounting for 31 which could be either autotrophic nitrite oxidizers lücker et al 2010 or autotrophic comammox bacteria capable of complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 an overview of the taxonomic affiliation and the fasta sequences of all bacterial otus are provided as supplementary material supplementary

members nitrospira thermodesulfovibrionia brocadiaceae was further confirmed by high abundances of nxrb genes encoding nitrite oxido reductase of nitrospira h31 6 3 106 l 1 h41 1 4 106 l 1 or hzsa genes encoding hydrazine synthase of anammox bacteria brocadiaceae h52 4 7 107 l 1 h53 4 6 107 l 1 in the respective wells fig 5 to get more insight into autotrophic microbial groups using the calvin benson bassham cycle cbb that were previously identified as ubiquitous at our study site wegner et al 2019 we targeted cbbm cbbl ia and cbbl ic genes encoding rubisco form ii ia and ic respectively taking together the information from all functional genes tested the highest potential for co2 fixation was found in the groundwater of wells h52 and h53 followed by wells h31 h32 h41 ten to 100 times lower abundances of the respective genes were found in the groundwater of wells h42 and h43 and at the hilltop location of the transect wells h13 h14 fig 5 also the sum of all three rubisco encoding genes was highest in the anoxic wells h52 and h53 5 8 106 1 3 108 genes l 1 groundwater along with a maximum fraction of cbbm genes within the rubisco encoding gene pool cbbm or cbbl ia genes were mainly affiliated with sulfide thiosulfate or sulfur oxidizers related to sulfuricaulis limicola sulfurifustis variabilis sulfuricella denitrificans thiobacillus thiophilus t thioparus and cand thiodictyon syntrophicum followed by organisms capable of oxidation of reduced sulfur and hydrogen such as sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans supplemental figs 6a and b in addition the communities harboring cbbl ia and cbbl ic genes were dominated by potential hydrogen oxidizers such as hydrogenophaga sp at most sites while ammonia oxidizers affiliated with nitrosomonas sp and nitrosospira sp formed a large fraction of the community encoding cbbl ic genes in well h41 supplemental fig 6c 3 4 co occurrence networks and inferred trophic interactions various interactions between microorganisms such as competition mutualism or predation may lead to co occurrence or mutual exclusion of organisms resulting in distinct distribution patterns of sub communities to generate hypotheses about the potential underlying ecological mechanisms we used co occurrence network analysis of originally 2261 bacterial and 480 eukaryotic otus protists and fungi which resulted in a network with significant positive and negative interactions between 730 bacterial and 94 eukaryotic members represented as nodes in the network supplementary fig 7 24 of the eukaryotic otus had 5 or more links to other otus maximum 34 links indicating that protist and fungal species were highly interconnected in the groundwater microbial community the highest number of connections were found for representatives of tubulinea eukotu000402 cyclidium eukotu000290 ciliophora and perkinsidae eukotu000046 protalveolata negative interactions between bacterial and protist otus as an indicator of predator prey relationships chow et al 2014 were observed for some members of the cercozoa ichthyosporea cryptomonadales tubulinea choanoflagellida and protalveolata in contrast members of the ciliophora mostly exhibited positive interactions with bacterial otus notably we also found frequent negative connections among eukaryotic otus such as for cercozoa tubulinea pigoraptor cryptomonadales and prostomatea ciliophora across all bacterial otus involved in negative connections with eukaryotes taxonomic affiliation reflected the most abundant bacterial taxa in the groundwater including cand patescibacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes to summarize our key findings we constructed a simplified conceptual model assigning the different eukaryotic taxa to postulated feeding strategies and different levels in the trophic cascade top predators first and second level predators primary consumers including heterotrophic bacteria and fungi and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria as primary producers fig 6 evidence of metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida and platyhelminthes was restricted to the groundwater of wells h31 h32 h41 h51 h52 and h53 resulting in more complex food webs for these wells compared to the hilltop position of the transect wells h13 h14 and the anoxic wells h42 h43 representatives of first level predators cercozoa chaetonotidae ichthyosporea and cryptophyta and second level predators tubulinea centroheliozoa pigoraptor and pirsonia were detected across all sites based on the molecular data species affiliated with ciliophora as the most abundant protist group represented both first level and second level predators the bacterial community fraction with the genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy was estimated from the 16s rrna and functional gene based analysis and mean values per site ranged from 0 8 to 36 with the highest potential for chemolithoautotrophy in the groundwater of wells h52 h53 and the lowest potential at the hilltop location wells h13 h14 supplementary table 4 sequence based evidence of the presence of metazoan top predators cyclopoida stenostomidae was significantly linked to sites where the genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy was 10 or more of the bacterial community chi square test p 0 0024 thus our data suggest that increased complexity of trophic levels that included these top predators coincided with a high estimated genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy moreover we observed opposing trends between the potential for chemolithoautotrophy and the fraction of fungi affiliated sequence reads i e low genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy coincided with a high fraction of fungal reads within the 18s rrna gene data sets wells h13 h14 and h42 h43 and vice versa wells h52 h53 spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 534 p 0 0003 4 discussion we tested the hypothesis that the number of trophic levels in oligotrophic groundwater including invertebrates is primarily determined by oxygen availability we also expected trophic interactions and their key players to be shaped by the heterogeneity of hydrochemical conditions which is characteristic for the different habitats in a hillslope flow system indeed we found hydrochemistry driven distribution patterns of all groundwater organisms but patterns were stronger for bacterial than for eukaryotic communities bacteria depend directly on the availability of organic or inorganic electron donors while protists and metazoa often have a broad prey spectrum which might explain the weaker linkage to specific hydrochemical settings the subterranean food web structure paradigm assumed pervasive generalist feeding strategies low trophic complexity and short food chains gibert and deharveng 2002 hutchins et al 2016 this assumption of generalist feeding was recently challenged by francois et al 2015 demonstrating a high degree of trophic specialization for two isopod species obtained from caves here we collected molecular evidence for a high diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms in oligotrophic groundwater forming a complex trophic cascade based on their taxonomic affiliation and inferred feeding strategies previously mostly flagellates morpho species 10 μm of sessile or free living suspension feeders were identified in groundwater from a drinking water well accessing upper muschelkalk bedrock strata risse buhl et al 2013 like the groundwater monitoring transect of the hainich cze now we were able to provide evidence from molecular analysis for the presence of larger protists and even detect signals of metazoa as wells of the groundwater monitoring transect were specifically designed to also sample large organisms and particles by using coarse slotted well screens and coarse annulus backfill instead of filter sand in the main screen sections küsel et al 2016 inferred trophic interactions and their key players differed substantially across sites we found molecular evidence of the presence of metazoan top predators with the highest metazoan read fractions in oxic groundwater likely regardless of lithostratigraphic affiliation here a combination of oxic conditions and space given by fractures especially in the trochitenkalk main aquifer might have supported a high diversity of protists and the presence of larger metazoa with a broad range of feeding strategies and body size up to a few millimeters metazoan taxa can act as end members of the groundwater trophic cascade e g cyclopoida and platyhelminthes which are common members of groundwater habitats deharveng et al 2009 feed also on protozoan and metazoan prey morselli et al 1998 brandl 2005 while others contribute directly to the control of bacterial biomass e g chaetonotidae rotifera porifera bennett 1979 simoes et al 2013 manconi and pronzato 2015 no molecular evidence for metazoan top predators was found in anoxic even very shallow wells h42 h43 while surprisingly we detected sequences affiliated with these organisms in anoxic deep wells h52 h53 oxygen concentrations around 0 5 1 mg l 1 were thought as critical thresholds for stygofauna occurrence hahn 2006 which is still higher than the concentrations we measure in these wells kohlhepp et al 2017 many groundwater metazoa are known to tolerate hypoxic conditions for some time malard and hervant 1999 but they are not known to thrive without oxygen for longer times however the molecular signature of an organism cannot be equaled by the presence of a live organism because sequences may also originate from pieces of tissue or animal remains nonetheless sequences were found at the deep anoxic wells h52 h53 that are known to have less surface connectivity than the shallow anoxic wells h42 h43 where these sequences were not detected hence direct sampling of larger metazoa which needs special technical equipment is needed to shed more light on the presence of metazoa under conditions of low oxygen availability we also detected sequences affiliated with cnidaria distantly related to antipatharia anthozoa across almost all sites in marine environments these organisms act as suspension feeders but are also capable of feeding on larger metazoa wagner et al 2012 nonetheless given the low sequence identity we did not assign these cnidaria to a top predator position in the groundwater food web on the level of unicellular eukaryotes we observed a low but constant fraction of sequence reads affiliated with amoebozoa tubulinea and discosea centroheliozoa and pigoraptor across all sites which could act as first level or second level predators amoebozoa feed on bacteria fungi or smaller protists and therefore serve as important linkages in food webs between microbes and higher organisms anderson 2017 ren et al 2018 they can encyst and excyst relatively rapidly anderson 2017 which could facilitate their dispersal from soil to the groundwater and enable their persistence within the aquifers surface attachment is needed for naked amoeba while feeding on prey anderson 2017 suggesting that microorganisms colonizing surfaces of the aquifer rock are an important component of the aquifer food web recently we identified the bacterial communities colonizing rock fracture surfaces of rock material obtained during drilling those bacteria are distinct from the ones living within the rock matrix and bacteria colonizing rock surfaces range from organic matter decomposers in outcrop areas to chemolithoautotrophs in downdip positions lazar et al 2019 thus surface attached amoebozoa might feed on a broad spectrum of different bacterial taxa and functional groups depending on the local aquifer architecture and other habitat conditions similar to amoebozoa centrohelida and heliozoan like protists feed on bacteria other protists and larvae of invertebrates under preferentially oxic conditions gast 2017 which was reflected by the highest sequence read fraction affiliated with these organisms in the oxic groundwater of midslope wells h31 h32 and h41 although heliozoa are known as predators of the free water column they have frequently been observed in microscopy based studies of groundwater novarino et al 1997 loquay et al 2009 and could be enriched from groundwater of our site unpublished results further trophic complexity was added by molecular evidence for the presence of protists distantly related to the recently described pigoraptor a unicellular predator that feeds on eukaryotic prey hehenberger et al 2017 and to the genus pirsonia known as parasitoid nano flagellates kühn et al 2004 among all protist groups ciliophora appeared to be the most successful and competitive based on their representation in the sequence data sets on both the dna and rna level ciliophora can act both as primary and secondary predators fenchel 2013 their predominance across all sites might be due to their broad spectrum of feeding strategies and body sizes as well as to the ability of many ciliates to cope with microoxic conditions or live anaerobically dubber and gray 2011 only at sites with higher oxygen availability wells h31 h32 h41 and h51 other bacterivorous protists such as cercomonas cercozoa and goniomonas cryptomonadales made up a larger fraction of the eukaryotic sequence data sets suggesting that they could successfully compete with ciliates for bacterial prey our molecular findings of ciliate predominance are in contrast with previous microscopic assessments novarino et al 1997 given the fact that 18s rrna operon numbers per ciliate cell may often exceed 1000 or 10 000 gong et al 2013 we cannot rule out that the 18s rrna sequence data sets are biased towards ciliophora or the predominance of a few ciliophora affiliated community members in fact numbers of ciliophora individuals could be much lower than the sequence read fractions suggest consequently quantitative relationships between the different eukaryotic taxa cannot be resolved with the molecular data alone and the observed predominance of ciliophora affiliated sequence reads needs to be interpreted with caution the presence of the predatory surface sliders litonotus and loxophyllum fenchel 2013 points again to rock surface contact as important lifestyle for some groundwater ciliophora these protists seem to follow their bacterial prey more often than controlling its abundance as shown by the positive correlation of 45 of the most abundant ciliophora otus with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances similar relationships were previously observed for virus bacteria interactions chow et al 2014 compared to viral lysis grazing can be more influenced by size rather than taxonomy of the prey gonzález et al 1990 hahn and höfle 1999 in marine systems grazing by protozoa is thought to target primarily larger cells fuhrman 2009 consequently small sized cells belonging to the candidate phyla radiation brown et al 2015 luef et al 2015 should be less affected by grazing and establish and maintain larger populations however cand patescibacteria were equally frequent in negative interactions with protist otus in the microbial network as were proteobacteria or bacteroidetes suggesting that they might be equally affected by grazing as diverse stygobiont communities in fractured and karstic aquifers or oligotrophic subterranean environments can be supported by biomass produced by chemolithoautotrophy hutchins et al 2016 brankovits et al 2017 we aimed to link our findings on eukaryotic diversity and trophic interactions to the bacterial potential for chemolithoautotrophy as the basis of the groundwater food web overall we found striking coincidence of a high genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy and a high complexity of the groundwater food web in terms of molecular evidence for the presence of metazoan top predators which applied to both oxic h31 h32 h41 and anoxic conditions h52 h53 chemolithoautotrophic potentials were mainly linked to nitrification at site h41 a spatial zone characterized by nitrification opitz et al 2014 wegner et al 2019 and to anammox performed by brocadiaceae in the anoxic environments of wells h52 and h53 starke et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 here anammox bacteria occurred together with species level taxa affiliated with the poorly characterized class thermodesulfovibrionia nitrospirae which could also play a role in co2 fixation using the wood ljungdahl pathway linked to nitrogen or sulfur cycling arshad et al 2017 maximum abundances of rubisco encoding cbbm genes in these wells provided further support of a large chemolithoautotrophic community driven by the oxidation of reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds and hydrogen as slow growing bacterial populations are discussed to be more affected by grazing protists sinclair and alexander 1989 especially chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier or anammox bacteria populations that are known to have doubling times in the range of days to weeks kumar et al 2018 strous et al 1999 should be effectively reduced however given the limited quantitative information provided by the eukaryotic molecular data potential top down control mechanisms on chemolithoautotrophs remain currently unclear the highest fraction of sequence reads affiliated with fungal groups like mucoromycota chytridiomycota and ascomycota were found at the hilltop locations h13 h14 and shallow midslope positions h42 h43 where seepage may rapidly percolate through the soil cover these findings point to a direct import of fungi from surface soils or to fungal populations feeding on soil derived organic matter available at these sites here we also found a generally low genetic potential for autotrophic co2 fixation which might underline allochthonous carbon supply a high fraction of fungal signatures affiliated with hypocreales eukotu001 which are saprotrophic parasitic or pathogenic ascomycota temporarily appeared in some groundwater wells in march and june 2015 for most of these sites nawaz et al 2018 observed a similar shift towards ascomycota within the active fungal communities at the same time points this temporal ascomycota dominance may point to an event driven import from surface soils probably as fungal spores mediated by hydraulic events such as snowmelts or precipitation griebler and lueders 2009 dibbern et al 2014 küsel et al 2016 surface derived inputs may lead to temporary perturbations of the groundwater trophic interactions by an enhanced import of soil borne microorganisms especially of fungi and an increased availability of allochthonous organic carbon 5 conclusions our molecular findings suggest the existence of complex food webs in the groundwater of fractured sedimentary bedrock with several levels along the trophic cascade up to metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida or platyhelminthes we found strong evidence for a high genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy of up to 36 of the bacterial community probably supporting complex groundwater food webs under both oxic and anoxic conditions chemolithoautotrophy was energetically linked to nitrification anammox and the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen our sequence data clearly showed the omnipresence of ciliophora across the different groundwater wells most likely linked to their high versatility regarding oxygen requirements feeding strategies body size and prey spectrum taken together our study suggests a substantial input of carbon entering complex aquifer food webs via light independent co2 fixation author

18265,groundwater ecosystems face the challenge of energy limitation due to the absence of light driven primary production lack of space and low oxygen availability might further contribute to generally assumed low food web complexity chemolithoautotrophy provides additional input of carbon within the subsurface however we still do not understand how abundances of chemolithoautotrophs differences in surface carbon input and oxygen availability control subsurface food web complexity using a molecular approach we aimed to disentangle the different levels of potential trophic interactions in oligotrophic groundwater along a hillslope setting of alternating mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock with contrasting hydrochemical conditions and hotspots of chemolithoautotrophy across all sites groundwater harbored diverse protist communities including ciliophora cercozoa centroheliozoa and amoebozoa but correlations with hydrochemical parameters were less pronounced for eukaryotes compared to bacteria ciliophora affiliated reads dominated the eukaryotic data sets across all sites dna based evidence for the presence of metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida arthropoda and stenostomidae platyhelminthes was only found at wells where abundances of functional genes associated with chemolithoautotrophy were 10 100 times higher compared to wells without indications of these top predators at wells closer to recharge areas with presumably increased inputs of soil derived substances and biota fungi accounted for up to 85 of the metazoan curated eukaryotic sequence data together with a low potential for chemolithoautotrophy although we did not directly observe higher organisms our results point to the existence of complex food webs with several trophic levels in oligotrophic groundwater chemolithoautotrophy appears to provide strong support to more complex trophic interactions feeding in additional biomass produced by light independent co2 fixation graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary rock aquifers protists fungi trophic interactions 16s rrna v3 v4 18s rrna v1 v3 1 introduction an estimated 90 of the prokaryotic biomass on earth is hidden within the subsurface hosting mainly microbial communities of bacteria and archaea bar on et al 2018 but also protozoa fungi and metazoa play an active role in subsurface biogeochemical processes griebler and lueders 2009 in groundwater ecosystems prokaryotic activity is strongly influenced by nutrient availability supporting both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial biomass production contrasting with low intensity of top down control by higher trophic levels foulquier et al 2011 however selective grazing of bacterivorous protozoa may result in changes of the bacterial community composition novarino et al 1997 sinclair et al 1993 kinner et al 2002 stygofauna groundwater metazoans also consume microbial biomass and thus contribute substantially to water purification and maintenance of hydraulic connectivity but they can also stimulate microbial processes via excretion of organic substances reviewed in saccὸ et al 2019 however their distribution is strongly limited by the availability of food and oxygen mösslacher 2003 hahn 2006 photosynthesis driven primary production fuels complex food webs in pelagic freshwater or marine ecosystems with multiple trophic levels including unicellular organisms up to large metazoa brett and goldman 1997 d alelio et al 2016 due to the lack of sunlight and space and often anoxic conditions in the subsurface groundwater food webs have been believed to be species poor and often to comprise only one or two trophic levels gibert and deharveng 2002 but near surface groundwater still receives allochthonous organic matter input with spatial and temporal variation depending on the hydrological connectivity to the surface foulquier et al 2011 hutchins et al 2016 furthermore there is growing evidence of an important role of chemolithoautotrophic co2 fixation in subsurface carbon cycling pedersen 1997 alfreider et al 2003 akob and küsel 2011 herrmann et al 2015 forming an additional basis of aquifer food webs in fact biomass produced by chemolithoautotrophy represents a rather stable resource since its availability is largely decoupled from surface processes hutchins et al 2016 given a geogenic availability of the preferentially exploited inorganic electron donor in a recent study of karstic edwards aquifer hutchins et al 2016 showed that organic matter which was produced chemolithoautotrophically accounted for 25 69 of the organic matter utilized by stygobiont communities at higher trophic levels similarly 21 of the diet of cave adapted shrimps in coastal groundwater of the yucatan peninsula was based on carbon from methanotrophic bacteria brankovits et al 2017 however more detailed information is needed on how and how much chemolithoautotrophy affects eukaryotic species diversity their feeding strategies and trophic interactions among all community members along the groundwater food chain similarly we need to know how eukaryotic communities and their interactions are modulated by hydrochemical conditions the hainich critical zone exploratory cze located in central germany provides unique subsurface access to study groundwater ecology in sedimentary bedrock along a groundwater monitoring transect under temperate climate conditions the hillslope flow system in thin bedded limestone mudstone alternations is strongly compartmentalized with characteristic biogeochemical regimes from oxic to anoxic conditions küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 which allows for the exploration of surface subsurface interactions and controls of subsurface food webs under different redox regimes along the transect we identified certain hot spots for chemolithoautotrophy wegner et al 2019 several studies revealed corresponding hydrochemistry driven patterns of bacterial archaeal and fungal diversity in the groundwater lazar et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 nawaz et al 2018 while communities at higher trophic levels and their potential feeding strategies are largely unknown in this study we hypothesized that the number of trophic levels in particular the presence of metazoan top predators is primarily determined by oxygen availability in the hainich oligotrophic groundwater and that the identity of the food web s key players and their resulting interactions are shaped by the different hydrochemical regimes of the groundwater furthermore we assumed that the differences of chemolithoautotrophic potentials observed along the transect will affect trophic interactions within the subsurface food webs 2 methods 2 1 study site sampling of groundwater and chemical analysis in a central german cultural landscape nw thuringia the monitoring groundwater well transect of the hainich cze accesses triassic bedrock at the eastern

bacterial and eukaryotic community data sets were normalized to the same number of sequence reads per sample 9730 reads for the bacterial communities and 6057 reads for the eukaryotic communities using the sub sample command implemented in mothur which led to the exclusion of a few samples with read numbers lower than 6057 for the eukaryotic data sets sequence analysis of rubisco encoding

cytoscape v 3 4 1 3 results 3 1 groundwater harbors diverse communities of protists fungi and metazoa to address the question if eukaryotic and bacterial community patterns and abundances show similar preferences across the different depths and topographic positions and thus groundwater quality we compared bacterial and eukaryotic community structures for seven time points on the dna level in addition three and two time points were analyzed on the rna level for bacteria and eukaryotes respectively using a 0 03 distance cut off for the assignment of species level otus numbers of otus ranged from 297 to 4701 average 1134 for eukaryotic 18s rrna genes without metazoa and from 749 to 4456 average 2177 for bacterial 16s rrna genes supplementary tables 1 and 2 based on non metric multidimensional scaling clustering patterns were less distinct for the eukaryotic compared to the bacterial communities supplementary fig 3 using jaccard similarity indices of otu distribution patterns across samples for both communities samples from wells h13 h14 at the hilltop position and samples from wells h42 h43 and h52 h53 respectively clustered separately however temporal variation among samples taken from the same well was higher for the eukaryotic communities abundances of eukaryotic 18s rrna genes originating from protists and fungi varied by two orders of magnitude across sites and ranged from 1 6 105 to 4 8 107 genes per l groundwater in contrast abundances of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed lower spatial variations by only one order of magnitude with additionally rather stable abundances over time at each individual groundwater well fig 1b maximum bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances were observed at the two suboxic to anoxic wells h52 and h53 mean values 2 4 108 3 5 108 genes per l groundwater and lower abundances in the anoxic groundwater of wells h42 and h43 2 2 107 and 1 5 107 genes l 1 and in the oxic groundwater of the two downstream wells h41 4 0 107 genes l 1 and h51 2 8 107 genes l 1 across all sites we found a strong predominance of few species level taxa within the eukaryotic communities with the 15 most abundant otus accounting for 17 59 of the 18s rrna gene sequence reads fig 2 in general ciliophora formed the largest fraction of the eukaryotic sequence reads 18 81 with the highest contribution in the anoxic groundwater of wells h52 h53 followed by cercozoa with the highest fraction in the oxic wells h31 h32 h41 h51 mean values 5 2 48 a large part of this fraction was often accounted for by a single species level otu such as eukotu03 cercozoa 40 of the sequence reads in oxic well h41 or eukotu02 ciliophora 33 39 in wells h52 and h53 fig 2b other flagellate groups commonly observed in the groundwater included ochrophyta aquavolonida ichthyosporea and protalveolata fig 2 sequences affiliated with centroheliozoa amoebozoa tubulinea and discosea and pigoraptor were consistently detected in small fractions of usually less than 4 in both oxic and anoxic groundwater the largest read fraction of metazoan origin was affiliated with chaetonotidae gastrotricha which were found in both oxic and anoxic groundwater up to 53 of the non corrected data set supplementary figs 1 and 2 groundwater of wells of the lower oxic aquifer main aquifer except for the hilltop location occasionally harbored signals of the crustacean group cyclopoida maxillopoda 0 1 5 1 which were also found in lower read numbers in the anoxic groundwater of well h52 similarly sequences affiliated with stenostomidae 0 1 11 8 freshwater catenulid flatworms belonging to the platyhelminthes were detected under both oxic and anoxic conditions in wells h31 h32 h41 h51 and h52 sequences affiliated with these metazoan top predators were detected in 74 of the samples from oxic wells and in turn were absent from 75 of the anoxic wells pointing to a positive relationship between presence of metazoan top predators and oxic conditions chi square test p 0 0009 sequences affiliated with rotifera ploimida were only found in the groundwater of wells h31 h32 h41 h51 h42 and h43 supplemental figs 1 and 2 porifera accounted for up to 3 3 of the sequence reads in the anoxic wells h42 and h43 but for less than 0 6 across the other wells in turn sequence reads affiliated with subterranean polychaeta troglochaetus beranecki 99 8 sequence identity were occasionally observed in the oxic wells but were not detected in the anoxic wells except for the two wells at the hilltop position of the transect all wells also harbored sequence reads affiliated with cnidaria distantly related to antipatharia anthozoa 88 sequence identity occasionally we also found signatures of nematoda wells h14 h43 h52 h53 or of soil dwelling animals such as collembola wells h14 h31 h32 h42 h51 in addition we detected low numbers of sequence reads of other metazoa usually 10 reads in a few samples affiliated with malacostraca lumbriculida aranea acari and insecta and higher plants most likely originating from pollen notably for the samples obtained in march 2015 and june 2015 up to 99 9 of the 18s rrna gene sequence reads were affiliated with ascomycota hypocreales for six of the eight wells sampled at that time point fig 3 these increased fractions of ascomycota coincided with an increase in 18s rrna gene abundances by up to one order of magnitude suggesting that these fungi occurred sporadically in large amounts in addition to the groundwater protist and fungi community observed at the other time points fig 3 while ascomycota were also commonly detected in the groundwater of wells h42 and h43 mean values 15 9 19 9 of the sequence reads fig 2 they formed only a small fraction of the eukaryotic reads in the groundwater of the other wells 0 3 7 3 in wells h13 and h14 at the hilltop position we found an increased fraction of mucoromycota eukotu05 accounting for 38 of the sequence reads in well h13 chytridiomycota and smaller contributions of basidiomycota figs 2 and 3 despite their occasional predominance in the dna based communities ascomycota were only poorly represented in the communities derived from rna based sequencing the strongest indication of the presence of active fungi was obtained for wells h31 h42 and h43 where fungal reads accounted for 6 8 11 5 of the sequences of the rna based fraction across all sites the rna based fraction was mostly dominated by ciliophora affiliated reads fig 2 among metazoan groups cyclopoida chaetonotidae and rotifera were also detected on the rna level in selected wells supplementary fig 1 out of the 30 most abundant protist or fungal otus a considerable fraction did not show any correlation with 15 hydrochemical parameters tested in this study supplementary fig 4 for some eukaryotic groups dissolved oxygen or the parameter combination sodium magnesium ammonium and potassium played an important role in distinguishing sub communities that corresponded in a similar way to these parameters doc and toc were hardly involved in significant correlations since the availability of prey may be an important driver of the distribution patterns of eukaryotic taxa we correlated estimated total abundances of the 140 most abundant eukaryotic otus with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances among the protist groups 45 of all ciliophora affiliated otus and 60 of centroheliozoa or aquavolonida affiliated otus in this subset were positively correlated to bacterial abundances while this fraction was lower for other protist groups supplementary table 3 an

fasta rep otus metazoa plants fasta 3 2 cand patescibacteria and nitrospirae dominate the bacterial communities in contrast to the eukaryotic taxa the 30 most abundant bacterial species level taxa appeared to have specific preferences for a given hydrochemical environment supplementary fig 5 suggesting that the mechanisms driving bacterial and eukaryotic distribution patterns across the hillslope groundwater flow system were substantially different in general groundwater bacterial communities as potential prey for the eukaryotic taxa were dominated by members of the cand patescibacteria nitrospirae gamma and deltaproteobacteria which together accounted for 50 70 of the total community across sites and time points candidate phyla including cand patescibacteria cand parcubacteria cand class aby1 cand gracilibacteria cand saccharimonadia and cand omnitrophicaeota were especially abundant in the groundwater communities of oxic wells h14 and h32 with a contribution of almost 50 fig 4 a contrasting with their predominance on the dna level candidate phyla were strongly underrepresented in the bacterial communities derived from rna based sequencing here dominance was shifted in favor of thermodesulfovibrionia nitrospirae distantly related to the presumably facultative autotroph cand nitrobium arshad et al 2017 gamma and deltaproteobacteria and autotrophic brocadiaceae planctomycetes in wells h52 and h53 a single otu affiliated with thermodesulfovibrionia bacotu001 already accounted for 15 and 26 of the sequence reads on the dna and rna level respectively in the oxic groundwater of wells h31 h41 and h51 sequence reads affiliated with the genus nitrospira nitrospirae were strongly increased in the rna based communities up to 41 in well h41 with two otus bacotu004 and bacotu006 already accounting for 31 which could be either autotrophic nitrite oxidizers lücker et al 2010 or autotrophic comammox bacteria capable of complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 an overview of the taxonomic affiliation and the fasta sequences of all bacterial otus are provided as supplementary material supplementary data set bac taxonomy xls supplementary data set rep otus bac fasta 3 3 abundance and composition of key autotrophic bacterial communities the high abundance of presumably autotrophic community members nitrospira thermodesulfovibrionia brocadiaceae was further confirmed by high abundances of nxrb genes encoding nitrite oxido reductase of nitrospira h31 6 3 106 l 1 h41 1 4 106 l 1 or hzsa genes encoding hydrazine synthase of anammox bacteria brocadiaceae h52 4 7 107 l 1 h53 4 6 107 l 1 in the respective wells fig 5 to get more insight into autotrophic microbial groups using the calvin benson bassham cycle cbb that were previously identified as ubiquitous at our study site wegner et al 2019 we targeted cbbm cbbl ia and cbbl ic genes encoding rubisco form ii ia and ic respectively taking together the information from all functional genes tested the highest potential for co2 fixation was found in the groundwater of wells h52 and h53 followed by wells h31 h32 h41 ten to 100 times lower abundances of the respective genes were found in the groundwater of wells h42 and h43 and at the hilltop location of the transect wells h13 h14 fig 5 also the sum of all three rubisco encoding genes was highest in the anoxic wells h52 and h53 5 8 106 1 3 108 genes l 1 groundwater along with a maximum fraction of cbbm genes within the rubisco encoding gene pool cbbm or cbbl ia genes were mainly affiliated with sulfide thiosulfate or sulfur oxidizers related to sulfuricaulis limicola sulfurifustis variabilis sulfuricella denitrificans thiobacillus thiophilus t thioparus and cand thiodictyon syntrophicum followed by organisms capable of oxidation of reduced sulfur and hydrogen such as sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans supplemental figs 6a and b in addition the communities harboring cbbl ia and cbbl ic genes were dominated by potential hydrogen oxidizers such as hydrogenophaga sp at most sites while ammonia oxidizers affiliated with nitrosomonas sp and nitrosospira sp formed a large fraction of the community encoding cbbl ic genes in well h41 supplemental fig 6c 3 4 co occurrence networks and inferred trophic interactions various interactions between microorganisms such as competition mutualism or predation may lead to co occurrence or mutual exclusion of organisms resulting in distinct distribution patterns of sub communities to generate hypotheses about the potential underlying ecological mechanisms we used co occurrence network analysis of originally 2261 bacterial and 480 eukaryotic otus protists and fungi which resulted in a network with significant positive and negative interactions between 730 bacterial and 94 eukaryotic members represented as nodes in the network supplementary fig 7 24 of the eukaryotic otus had 5 or more links to other otus maximum 34 links indicating that protist and fungal species were highly interconnected in the groundwater microbial community the highest number of connections were found for representatives of tubulinea eukotu000402 cyclidium eukotu000290 ciliophora and perkinsidae eukotu000046 protalveolata negative interactions between bacterial and protist otus as an indicator of predator prey relationships chow et al 2014 were observed for some members of the cercozoa ichthyosporea cryptomonadales tubulinea choanoflagellida and protalveolata in contrast members of the ciliophora mostly exhibited positive interactions with bacterial otus notably we also found frequent negative connections among eukaryotic otus such as for cercozoa tubulinea pigoraptor cryptomonadales and prostomatea ciliophora across all bacterial otus involved in negative connections with eukaryotes taxonomic affiliation reflected the most abundant bacterial taxa in the groundwater including cand patescibacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes to summarize our key findings we constructed a simplified conceptual model assigning the different eukaryotic taxa to postulated feeding strategies and different levels in the trophic cascade top predators first and second level predators primary consumers including heterotrophic bacteria and fungi and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria as primary producers fig 6 evidence of metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida and platyhelminthes was restricted to the groundwater of wells h31 h32 h41 h51 h52 and h53 resulting in more complex food webs for these wells compared to the hilltop position of the transect wells h13 h14 and the anoxic wells h42 h43 representatives of first level predators cercozoa chaetonotidae ichthyosporea and cryptophyta and second level predators tubulinea centroheliozoa pigoraptor and pirsonia were detected across all sites based on the molecular data species affiliated with ciliophora as the most abundant protist group represented both first level and second level predators the bacterial community fraction with the genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy was estimated from the 16s rrna and functional gene based analysis and mean values per site ranged from 0 8 to 36 with the highest potential for chemolithoautotrophy in the groundwater of wells h52 h53 and the lowest potential at the hilltop location wells h13 h14 supplementary table 4 sequence based evidence of the presence of metazoan top predators cyclopoida stenostomidae was significantly linked to sites where the genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy was 10 or more of the bacterial community chi square test p 0 0024 thus our data suggest that increased complexity of trophic levels that included these top predators coincided with a high estimated genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy moreover we observed opposing trends between the potential for chemolithoautotrophy and the fraction of fungi affiliated sequence reads i e low genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy coincided with a high fraction of fungal reads within the 18s rrna gene data sets wells h13 h14 and h42 h43 and vice versa wells h52 h53 spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 534 p 0 0003 4 discussion we tested the hypothesis that the number of trophic levels in oligotrophic groundwater including invertebrates is primarily determined by oxygen availability we also expected trophic interactions and their key players to be shaped by the heterogeneity of hydrochemical conditions which is characteristic for the different habitats in a hillslope flow system indeed we found hydrochemistry driven distribution patterns of all groundwater organisms but patterns were stronger for bacterial than for eukaryotic communities bacteria depend directly on the availability of organic or inorganic electron donors while protists and metazoa often have a broad prey spectrum which might explain the weaker linkage to specific hydrochemical settings the subterranean food web structure paradigm assumed pervasive generalist feeding strategies low trophic complexity and short food chains gibert and deharveng 2002 hutchins et al 2016 this assumption of generalist feeding was recently challenged by francois et al 2015 demonstrating a high degree of trophic specialization for two isopod species obtained from caves here we collected molecular evidence for a high diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms in oligotrophic groundwater forming a complex trophic cascade based on their taxonomic affiliation and inferred feeding strategies previously mostly flagellates morpho species 10 μm of sessile or free living suspension feeders were identified in groundwater from a drinking water well accessing upper muschelkalk bedrock strata risse buhl et al 2013 like the groundwater monitoring transect of the hainich cze now we were able to provide evidence from molecular analysis for the presence of larger protists and even detect signals of metazoa as wells of the groundwater monitoring transect were specifically designed to also sample large organisms and particles by using coarse slotted well screens and coarse annulus backfill instead of filter sand in the main screen sections küsel et al 2016 inferred trophic interactions and their key players differed substantially across sites we found molecular evidence of the presence of metazoan top predators with the highest metazoan read fractions in oxic groundwater likely regardless of lithostratigraphic affiliation here a combination of oxic conditions and space given by fractures especially in the trochitenkalk main aquifer might have supported a high diversity of protists and the presence of larger metazoa with a broad range of feeding strategies and body size up to a few millimeters metazoan taxa can act as end members of the groundwater trophic cascade e g cyclopoida and platyhelminthes which are common members of groundwater habitats deharveng et al 2009 feed also on protozoan and metazoan prey morselli et al 1998 brandl 2005 while others contribute directly to the control of bacterial biomass e g chaetonotidae rotifera porifera bennett 1979 simoes et al 2013 manconi and pronzato 2015 no molecular evidence for metazoan top predators was found in anoxic even very shallow wells h42 h43 while surprisingly we detected sequences affiliated with these organisms in anoxic deep wells h52 h53 oxygen concentrations around 0 5 1 mg l 1 were thought as critical thresholds for stygofauna occurrence hahn 2006 which is still higher than the concentrations we measure in these wells kohlhepp et al 2017 many groundwater metazoa are known to tolerate hypoxic conditions for some time malard and hervant 1999 but they are not known to thrive without oxygen for longer times however the molecular signature of an organism cannot be equaled by the presence of a live organism because sequences may also originate from pieces of tissue or animal remains nonetheless sequences were found at the deep anoxic wells h52 h53 that are known to have less surface connectivity than the shallow anoxic wells h42 h43 where these sequences were not detected hence direct sampling of larger metazoa which needs special technical equipment is needed to shed more light on the presence of metazoa under conditions of low oxygen availability we also detected sequences affiliated with cnidaria distantly related to antipatharia anthozoa across almost all sites in marine environments these organisms act as suspension feeders but are also capable of feeding on larger metazoa wagner et al 2012 nonetheless given the low sequence identity we did not assign these cnidaria to a top predator position in the groundwater food web on the level of unicellular eukaryotes we observed a low but constant fraction of sequence reads affiliated with amoebozoa tubulinea and discosea centroheliozoa and pigoraptor across all sites which could act as first level or second level predators amoebozoa feed on bacteria fungi or smaller protists and therefore serve as important linkages in food webs between microbes and higher organisms anderson 2017 ren et al 2018 they can encyst and excyst relatively rapidly anderson 2017 which could facilitate their dispersal from soil to the groundwater and enable their persistence within the aquifers surface attachment is needed for naked amoeba while feeding on prey anderson 2017 suggesting that microorganisms colonizing surfaces of the aquifer rock are an important component of the aquifer food web recently we identified the bacterial communities colonizing rock fracture surfaces of rock material obtained during drilling those bacteria are distinct from the ones living within the rock matrix and bacteria colonizing rock surfaces range from organic matter decomposers in outcrop areas to chemolithoautotrophs in downdip positions lazar et al 2019 thus surface attached amoebozoa might feed on a broad spectrum of different bacterial taxa and functional groups depending on the local aquifer architecture and other habitat conditions similar to amoebozoa centrohelida and heliozoan like protists feed on bacteria other protists and larvae of invertebrates under preferentially oxic conditions gast 2017 which was reflected by the highest sequence read fraction affiliated with these organisms in the oxic groundwater of midslope wells h31 h32 and h41 although heliozoa are known as predators of the free water column they have frequently been observed in microscopy based studies of groundwater novarino et al 1997 loquay et al 2009 and could be enriched from groundwater of our site unpublished results further trophic complexity was added by molecular evidence for the presence of protists distantly related to the recently described pigoraptor a unicellular predator that feeds on eukaryotic prey hehenberger et al 2017 and to the genus pirsonia known as parasitoid nano flagellates kühn et al 2004 among all protist groups ciliophora appeared to be the most successful and competitive based on their representation in the sequence data sets on both the dna and rna level ciliophora can act both as primary and secondary predators fenchel 2013 their predominance across all sites might be due to their broad spectrum of feeding strategies and body sizes as well as to the ability of many ciliates to cope with microoxic conditions or live anaerobically dubber and gray 2011 only at sites with higher oxygen availability wells h31 h32 h41 and h51 other bacterivorous protists such as cercomonas cercozoa and goniomonas cryptomonadales made up a larger fraction of the eukaryotic sequence data sets suggesting that they could successfully compete with ciliates for bacterial prey our molecular findings of ciliate predominance are in contrast with previous microscopic assessments novarino et al 1997 given the fact that 18s rrna operon numbers per ciliate cell may often exceed 1000 or 10 000 gong et al 2013 we cannot rule out that the 18s rrna sequence data sets are biased towards ciliophora or the predominance of a few ciliophora affiliated community members in fact numbers of ciliophora individuals could be much lower than the sequence read fractions suggest consequently quantitative relationships between the different eukaryotic taxa cannot be resolved with the molecular data alone and the observed predominance of ciliophora affiliated sequence reads needs to be interpreted with caution the presence of the predatory surface sliders litonotus and loxophyllum fenchel 2013 points again to rock surface contact as important lifestyle for some groundwater ciliophora these protists seem to follow their bacterial prey more often than controlling its abundance as shown by the positive correlation of 45 of the most abundant ciliophora otus with bacterial 16s rrna gene abundances similar relationships were previously observed for virus bacteria interactions chow et al 2014 compared to viral lysis grazing can be more influenced by size rather than taxonomy of the prey gonzález et al 1990 hahn and höfle 1999 in marine systems grazing by protozoa is thought to target primarily larger cells fuhrman 2009 consequently small sized cells belonging to the candidate phyla radiation brown et al 2015 luef et al 2015 should be less affected by grazing and establish and maintain larger populations however cand patescibacteria were equally frequent in negative interactions with protist otus in the microbial network as were proteobacteria or bacteroidetes suggesting that they might be equally affected by grazing as diverse stygobiont communities in fractured and karstic aquifers or oligotrophic subterranean environments can be supported by biomass produced by chemolithoautotrophy hutchins et al 2016 brankovits et al 2017 we aimed to link our findings on eukaryotic diversity and trophic interactions to the bacterial potential for chemolithoautotrophy as the basis of the groundwater food web overall we found striking coincidence of a high genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy and a high complexity of the groundwater food web in terms of molecular evidence for the presence of metazoan top predators which applied to both oxic h31 h32 h41 and anoxic conditions h52 h53 chemolithoautotrophic potentials were mainly linked to nitrification at site h41 a spatial zone characterized by nitrification opitz et al 2014 wegner et al 2019 and to anammox performed by brocadiaceae in the anoxic environments of wells h52 and h53 starke et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 wegner et al 2019 here anammox bacteria occurred together with species level taxa affiliated with the poorly characterized class thermodesulfovibrionia nitrospirae which could also play a role in co2 fixation using the wood ljungdahl pathway linked to nitrogen or sulfur cycling arshad et al 2017 maximum abundances of rubisco encoding cbbm genes in these wells provided further support of a large chemolithoautotrophic community driven by the oxidation of reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds and hydrogen as slow growing bacterial populations are discussed to be more affected by grazing protists sinclair and alexander 1989 especially chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier or anammox bacteria populations that are known to have doubling times in the range of days to weeks kumar et al 2018 strous et al 1999 should be effectively reduced however given the limited quantitative information provided by the eukaryotic molecular data potential top down control mechanisms on chemolithoautotrophs remain currently unclear the highest fraction of sequence reads affiliated with fungal groups like mucoromycota chytridiomycota and ascomycota were found at the hilltop locations h13 h14 and shallow midslope positions h42 h43 where seepage may rapidly percolate through the soil cover these findings point to a direct import of fungi from surface soils or to fungal populations feeding on soil derived organic matter available at these sites here we also found a generally low genetic potential for autotrophic co2 fixation which might underline allochthonous carbon supply a high fraction of fungal signatures affiliated with hypocreales eukotu001 which are saprotrophic parasitic or pathogenic ascomycota temporarily appeared in some groundwater wells in march and june 2015 for most of these sites nawaz et al 2018 observed a similar shift towards ascomycota within the active fungal communities at the same time points this temporal ascomycota dominance may point to an event driven import from surface soils probably as fungal spores mediated by hydraulic events such as snowmelts or precipitation griebler and lueders 2009 dibbern et al 2014 küsel et al 2016 surface derived inputs may lead to temporary perturbations of the groundwater trophic interactions by an enhanced import of soil borne microorganisms especially of fungi and an increased availability of allochthonous organic carbon 5 conclusions our molecular findings suggest the existence of complex food webs in the groundwater of fractured sedimentary bedrock with several levels along the trophic cascade up to metazoan top predators such as cyclopoida or platyhelminthes we found strong evidence for a high genetic potential for chemolithoautotrophy of up to 36 of the bacterial community probably supporting complex groundwater food webs under both oxic and anoxic conditions chemolithoautotrophy was energetically linked to nitrification anammox and the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen our sequence data clearly showed the omnipresence of ciliophora across the different groundwater wells most likely linked to their high versatility regarding oxygen requirements feeding strategies body size and prey spectrum taken together our study suggests a substantial input of carbon entering complex aquifer food webs via light independent co2 fixation author

18266,electrodeionization edi is membrane based desalination utilizing ion exchange membranes and ion exchange resins by combining electrodialysis and ion exchanger edi can produce ultrapure water in a continuous flow manner although its theoretical mechanisms are well documented there is no experimental platform that can provide microscopic details inside of the system in this paper we present microscale edi that can visualize in situ ion concentration ph and fluid flows the platform was fabricated by filling ion exchange resins as a monolayer in a transparent polydimethylsiloxane channel between cation and anion exchange membranes according to operating voltages 0 15v distinct behaviors of ion concentration profile ph shift and fluid flows were observed in ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes it is noteworthy that overlimiting regimes can be sub categorized as water splitting and electroconvection regimes in the early stage 4 8v water splitting is dominant with ph change near the membranes and resins under a higher voltage 8 15v electroconvection starts to occur even water splitting tries to suppress the development of the extended space charge layer and corresponding electroconvective instability accelerated ionic migration by electroconvection can improve current efficiency up to 80 this is a clear departure from overlimiting dynamics in electrodialysis with electroconvection only ion exchanger with no distinct regime and even from that in previous edi experiments with water splitting only graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination electroconvection electrodeionization water splitting overlimiting current ion concentration polarization 1 introduction electrodeionization edi is a hybrid desalination process of electrodialysis ed and ion exchanger ix using ion exchange membranes and ion exchange resins alvarado and chen 2014 dimascio et al 1998 edi platform consists of densely packed ion exchange resins between juxtaposed ion exchange membranes fig 1 a in a desalted channel the resins adsorb ions in water by exchanging them with fixed ions on the resins ix step and conduct ions to the membranes to do this the membranes can discharge ions toward the concentrated channel easily quickly and consistently ed step such hybridization allows edi to overcome two inherent problems of ed and ix one of the inevitable trade off issues in ed is that the electric resistance of the desalted channel becomes higher as we desalinate water to obtain purer water therefore the required power is exponentially increased kabay et al 2002 on the other hand ix needs a chemical regeneration of the resins functional groups to recycle it so this process cannot be operated in a continuous flow manner as a hybrid of ed and ix edi system can reduce the resistance of the desalted channel by filling the channel with highly ion conductive anion cation exchange resins between anion cation exchange membranes aem cem ion conduction along the resins is much faster than that along the low concentration electrolyte during desalination wood et al 2010 simultaneously water splitting is known to be induced at the junction of cation anion exchange resins in the desalted channel meng et al 2004 the produced protons and hydroxide ions can regenerate the resins resulting in continuous operation without additional chemical regeneration step alvarado and chen 2014 nikonenko et al 2014 wood et al 2010 with such dynamic synergy between two technologies edi can not only segregate heavy ions e g metal ions and radioactive ions but also produce ultrapure water by completely removing ions in water such unique abilities of edi have been widely utilized for ultrapure water production and wastewater treatment in pharmaceutical semiconductor and power plants arar et al 2014 ganzi and parise 1990 wood et al 2010 1 1 voltage current responses in electromembrane desalinations in general voltage current responses in electromembrane desalination systems e g ed edi capacitive deionization show three distinctive regimes which are ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes fig 1b krol et al 1999 such regime diversification is due to anion cation selective transport and corresponding dynamic changes of ion concentration near ion exchange membranes and resins i e ion concentration polarization icp hoek and elimelech 2003 schoch et al 2008 when counter ions pass through a permselective membrane or resin the remaining co ions also need to be depleted for satisfying electroneutrality generating ion depletion zone on the other side supplied counter ions through the membrane or the resin attract co ions also for matching electroneutrality generating ion enrichment zone as a result ion concentration is polarized across the membrane or the resin here the ion depletion zone of icp governs a voltage current response probstein 2005 under a relatively low voltage negligible icp lets the voltage current follows ohm s law with nearly constant electric resistance ohmic regime fig 1b when icp becomes considerable at a higher voltage the development of the ion depletion zone increases the electric resistance the growth rate of the current is then slowed and finally saturated when the ion concentration becomes zero at the interface of the membrane resin and an electrolyte in ion depletion zone limiting regime this saturated current is called a limiting current which is the maximum ion flux by diffusion and electromigration bockris and reddy 2000 after that the current starts to increase again overlimiting regime fig 1b in this overlimiting regime two mechanisms would work to overcome the diffusion limit of ion flux water splitting lu et al 2010 wood et al 2010 and electroconvection nikonenko et al 2010 rubinstein and zaltzman 2000 first if the voltage is higher than 1 23 v water molecules can be split into protons and hydroxide ions i e called water splitting in the depletion zone on the membranes resins a local electric field would be focused in this low concentration zone and become strong enough to split water molecules then produced protons and hydroxide ions act as additional current carriers performing electro regeneration of resins this water splitting has been known as a dominant overlimiting mechanism in edi alvarado and chen 2014 song et al 2005 and ed with bipolar membranes pourcelly 2002 slouka et al 2013 in these systems at the bipolar junctions where cation and anion exchange membranes resins meet ions in there are depleted as like a semiconductor p n type junction facilitating electric field focusing and water splitting of course the generation of protons and hydroxide ions by water splitting helps to recover resins in edi but desalination efficiency decreases because we need to transport these additional ions too in addition to original salt ions in water slouka et al 2013 the strong counter ion depletion induces the imbalance of co ions and counter ions near the membranes resins this extended space charge layer is vulnerable to instability resulting in vortical flows and this so called electroconvection can enhance ion flux convectively mishchuk 2010 nikonenko et al 2010 electroconvection is a dominated overlimiting mechanism in ed and related systems with ion exchange membranes nikonenko et al 2010 2014 schoch et al 2008 without bipolar junctions electroconvection is initiated first in the depletion zone water splitting also occurs here if an applied voltage is enough but it is less dominant lee et al 2019 in fact water splitting may obstruct the development of electroconvection belova et al 2006 mishchuk 2010 dissociated h and oh alleviate the degree of ion depletion so water splitting curbs the extension of the space charge layer which is necessary for the electroconvection in contrast to water splitting it is noteworthy that electroconvection can facilitate ion flux without the generation of additional ions therefore this phenomenon has been used to enhance desalination performances in electromembrane processes kwak et al 2013 lee et al 2019 nikonenko et al 2017 1 2 overlimiting dynamics in edi edi has been usually operated in the overlimiting current regime where a relatively high voltage can induce water splitting dzyazko et al 2009 song et al 2005 with practical importance in many applications overlimiting dynamics of edi has been extensively studied meng et al proposed that water splitting takes place at contact points of anion and cation selective interfaces and regenerates ion exchange resins meng et al 2004 lu et al 2010 accounted for the influences of water splitting on desalination performance of edi h and oh decomposition appear at ion depletion zones near the resins they regenerate the resins so that functional groups of them become h oh forms and ready to exchange na cl ions again also h oh attract counter ions in electrolytes and relieve ion depletion near ion exchange membranes resins correspondingly water splitting improves electromigration of salt ions lu et al 2010 bouhidel and lakehal investigated edi s desalination metrics including current efficiency and salt removal ratio under various operating conditions voltage and flow rate and found that the optimal current density was expected at just after water splitting starts to occur bouhidel and lakehal 2006 the obtained optimal current density was placed in the range from 0 9 m a c m 2 to 3 5 m a c m 2 much higher current voltage than that reduces current efficiency because of too much ion flux from water splitting yet it is necessary for resin regeneration while previous works clearly demonstrated water splitting and resin recovery mechanisms ion transport phenomena within the edi cell are not fully optimized nor well characterized yet edi system engineering has been relying on a black box approach where only inputs current or voltage flow rate etc and outputs voltage or current conductance etc are measured indeed the existence of water splitting has been just anticipated based on the slope change of the voltage current response song et al 2005 2007 however no one has directly observed that i water splitting really starts to occur at this slope changing point and ii where water splitting starts to occur in the complex geometry of the edi cell in fact it is still not clear where is the optimal operating condition and what is the dominant ion transport phenomenon at that point in addition electroconvection has been commonly ignored in edi except mishchuk discussed the possible existence of nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena mishchuk 2010 therefore iii the existence effect of electroconvection and iv possible competition between electroconvection and water splitting are still beyond the reach of both experiment and theory in this paper we present a microscale edi platform in which the flow channels can be microscopically observed we display in situ ion concentration ph and fluid flows in the edi cell such detailed observations not only confirm distinguishable ion transport dynamics according to the three current regimes ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes but also reveal the co existence of water splitting and electroconvection in the edi cell for the first time with visualization results we measure desalination metrics including salt removal ratio energy consumption energy efficiency and current efficiency we also explain the effects of water splitting and electroconvection on the desalination performance of the system 2 material and method 2 1 device fabrication fig 2 a shows a half cell monolayer edi for in situ visualization due to its flexibility and transparency polydimethylsiloxane

the stokes number was calculated to confirm that the particles successfully trace the flow it was given as the ratio of the relaxation time of the particle t 0 ρ p d p 2 18 μ to the characteristic

accuracy error below 1 tropea and yarin 2007 finally a 10 mm nacl solution containing 20 wt of ph indicator hydrion one drop ind 1 0 11 0 micro essential laboratory inc brooklyn ny usa was used to visualize local ph shifts in the desalted channel kwak and han 2018 this halochromic material changes its own color when it bounds with h in electrolytes by changing the indicator s conjugated system which induces the shift of absorption wavelength by analyzing bright field images color change of the solution due to a ph indicator was quantified 3 results and discussion 3 1 voltage current responses in the micro edi fig 3 a shows the voltage current response of the micro edi cell which is divided into three regimes i ohmic regime at the initial stage where the current linearly increased with the voltage v 2 v ii limiting regime where the curve drew a plateau 2 v v 4 v and iii overlimiting regime which subsequently developed as the current increased again v 4 v such three discrete regime of the micro edi is similar to previous results as described in section 1 1 but there are three notable similarity and differences first the micro edi cell in this experiment has a limiting regime with two knees of the voltage current curve in previous edi systems however there was no limiting regime and only the single slope drop was observed in voltage current responses alvarado et al 2013 song et al 2005 in general previous edi cells were fabricated with multiple heterogeneous resin layers between the ion exchange membranes such non uniform geometry may induce the inhomogeneity of a local electric field in the cell then the local ion concentration as well as the threshold voltage of the limiting current can vary according to the locations correspondingly we cannot observe a separated plateau of the current response when it occurs with nearly zero ion concentration along the membrane electrolyte interface unlike previous systems we used a uniformly arrayed monolayer resins in the micro edi cell such geometric uniformity may allow us to develop a uniform ion depletion zone along the membrane and observe a limiting current regime with gentle slope changes second the slope in overlimiting regime is lower than that in ohmic regime which is a common characteristic of the voltage current responses in ed and edi alvarado et al 2013 kwak et al 2013 song et al 2005 and this is contrary to that in the systems with bipolar junctions slouka et al 2013 in the bipolar junction the development of ion depletion is generally much faster than that in bulk electrolyte because the membranes resins have much higher ion conductivities than electrolytes therefore the limiting current in bipolar junctions is generally lower than that in membrane electrolyte junctions and its threshold voltage is close to 1 23 v vermaas et al 2018 in this scenario when water splitting supplies protons and hydroxide ions in overlimiting regime these ions can pass through high conductive media i e membranes and resins rapidly as a result without the development of ion depletion in bulk electrolyte the slope of overlimiting current can be higher than that of ohmic regime strathmann et al 1997 vermaas et al 2018 however in edi systems including ours i the slope of voltage current curves is not higher than that of ohmic regime and ii the threshold voltages of overlimiting regimes are much higher than 1 23 v per a single cell this indicates that water splitting may take place in the depletion zone either at the membrane electrolyte interfaces and or at the bipolar junctions of the membrane resins first instead at bipolar junctions of the resins as predicted previously last the current response in overlimiting regime includes a unique characteristic a sudden rise of standard deviation fig 3b in the system with bipolar junctions when water splitting develops in overlimiting regime no considerable fluctuation of the current has been reported strathmann et al 1997 vermaas et al 2018 on the other hand when electroconvection develops the standard deviation of the current becomes larger because of vortex advection and the generation of chaotic eddies the vortex advection indicates the movement of electroconvective vortices carried by fluid flow and the generation of chaotic eddies indicates the generation of chaotic fluid flows driven by electroconvection kwak et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the standard deviation was comparatively low at an early stage of overlimiting regime 4 v v 8 v just as that of ohmic limiting regimes whereas it increases suddenly at a higher voltage v 8 v based on this overlimiting regime of the micro edi can be subdivided into two sections i water splitting dominant regime with a negligible current fluctuation 4 v v 8 v and ii electroconvection dominant regime with a considerable current fluctuation v 8 v this is a clear departure from overlimiting dynamics in ed with electroconvection only ix with no distinct regime and even from that in previous edi experiments with water splitting only to verify the hypothesis for explaining the above three characteristics we should investigate local ion concentration profiles ph shifts and the existence of electroconvection with visualization results in the micro edi system fig 4 we will discuss ion transport dynamics according to the current regimes in section 3 2 3 3 3 2 ion transport dynamics in ohmic limiting regimes v 4 v again in ohmic regime v 2 v the linear relation of a voltage and a current indicates the almost constant cell resistance with negligible icp accordingly there was no significant change of fluorescent intensity across the whole desalted channel fig 4a c 0 2v when the applied voltage arrived near the limiting regime 2 4 v the ion depletion zone occurs near the membrane first fig 4c i yet ion depletion zones were not developed near the resins since the local voltage across the resin is not high enough everywhere even when we apply the voltage up to 4 v we cannot observe considerable ph change by water splitting in the micro edi cell it may be due to the fact that the local voltage in the cell is lower than the threshold voltage 1 23 v the significant portion of the voltage will be dropped i in the concentrated electrode rinsing channel channel 1 and 3 in fig 2c and ii due to reaction overpotentials and or contact resistances at the electrodes thus the voltage was not focused sufficiently on the depletion zone so that water splitting is not observed and ph in the cell maintains its initial value 7 fig 4d 0 4v in these ohmic limiting regimes diffusion and electromigration are the major factors of ion transport therefore the fluid flows just along the resins fig 4b 0 4v 3 3 ion transport dynamics in overlimiting regime v 4 v next in overlimiting regime v 4 v the slope of voltage current curve is lower than that of ohmic limiting regimes due to the development of strong depletion zones along the membranes fluorescent intensity of the whole channel decreases as more salt ions are removed fig 4a and c i as we expected from the voltage current response two sub regimes are distinguished depending on the existence of ec fig 4b and ph shift fig 4d i water splitting regime with ph shift only 4 v v 8 v and ii electroconvection regime with ec too v 8 v 3 3 1 water splitting regime 4 v v 8 v at the voltage of 4 6 v the ion depletion zone near the membranes is expanded fig 4c i but icp near each resin is still not observed clearly fig 4c ii here water splitting is initiated near the membranes not everywhere bipolar junctions exists as enough voltage focused on the depletion zone fig 4d 6v correspondingly ph value shifts near the membrane only it supports the proposed water splitting mechanism of edi that water molecules would be decomposed at the contact points of membranes and resins meng et al 2004 the ph visualization additionally informs the ionic migration of decomposed co ions h on aem and oh on cem when water splitting occurs counter ions both salt ion and water splitting product migrate through the membranes co ions move along the resin surface by ion conduction and are discharged inside the channel in the vicinity of aem for example oh ion from water splitting passes through the membrane and it does not affect the ph shift in the desalted channel h ion moves along the resins comes out to the channel and makes the fluid acidic near the aem fig 4d 6 8v and e 8v it is also noted that ph shift is observed near the aem first fig 4e 8v because the depletion zone near the aem expands more quickly and quantitatively than that near the cem does lu et al 2010 in this water splitting regime the fluid flow doesn t have any other characteristics compared to that in ohmic limiting regimes fig 4b 4 6v although over 4 v is enough to generate electroconvection in ed kwak et al 2013 it is not observed yet in edi it is probably because water splitting can suppress the formation of an extended space charge layer near the membranes belova et al 2006 3 3 2 electroconvection regime v 8 v as the voltage increases the ion depletion zone becomes more significant and interestingly local ion concentration variation across the resin can be observed fig 4c ii 8 12 v the high voltage and fast ion flux through the resin generate ion enrichment zones at each resin even in the desalted channel where only depletion zones would occur by the membranes red arrow in fig 4c ii while water splitting reaction becomes vigorous ph shifts near the membranes is also deepened fig 4d e 8 12v now an alkaline ph shift near the cem is visualized clearly see supporting video the intensified ph shift at both anodic and cathodic sites also means that ion exchanging regeneration on the resins and the degree of desalination are all increased largely at the high voltage supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115310 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 in this regime electroconvection starts to be observed white arrow in fig 4b 8v see supporting video of course electroconvection becomes stronger at the higher voltage at 12 v electroconvective is strong enough to scatter fluorescent particles in a short time here it is noted that the edi cell has a concurrent effect of water splitting and electroconvection while water splitting regenerates resins electroconvection transfers ions in electrolyte toward the resins and membranes convectively however there is no electroconvection at the resins of the second row away or more from the aem fig 4b 8 12v it is presumably because the ion depletion and local electric field are not high enough to initiate electroconvection to overcome the effect of water splitting therefore electroconvection is generated only at the resins adjacent to the membranes 3 4 desalination metrics through microscopic observations of the current voltage responses and in situ ion flow ph variations we are able to categorize current regimes including new overlimiting sub regimes in this section we calculate four desalination metrics to evaluate desalination performance with respect to these current regimes and corresponding ion transport dynamics the metrics are presented as follows 1 salt removal ratio c 0 c d e s a l t e d c 0 2 energy consumption i v q 3 energy per ion removal epir i v q z k b t c 0 c d e s a l t e d 4 current efficiency ce z f q c 0 c d e s a l t e d i these four metrics are estimated under a constant applied voltage v 0 14 v and the averaged current response i the initial ion concentration is fixed as c 0 10 m m and the ion concentration of the desalted flow c d e s a l t e d is measured experimentally the desalted flow rate q is 10 μ l m i n k b is the boltzmann constant k b 1 38 10 23 m 2 k g s 2 k z is an ion valence of na and cl z 1 f is the faraday constant f 96500 c m o l and t is the absolute temperature t 298 k to calculate each metric the conductance of the desalted flow was measured and converted into c d e s a l t e d fig 5 a the conductance response was adopted after it was saturated by filling the dead volume of the conductivity electrode at 600s as shown in fig 5b the mean fluorescence intensity drop of the desalted flow calculated from fig 4c follows the conductance drop of the desalted flow the current response and salt removal ratio increase monotonically as the voltage increases fig 6 a consequently the energy consumption per producing desalted water also increases in the same manner fig 6b although salt removal ratio and energy consumption give us basic information about the quality of desalted water and required energy these two metrics cannot represent the system s efficiency instead epir and ce can elucidate it here epir indicates characteristic energy consumption required for desalting a pair of sodium and chloride ions zhao et al 2012 it is a non dimensional parameter adopting a scaling factor k b t as thermal energy 2 479 k j m o l given as the ratio of the electric power per produced water i v q to the characteristic energy carried by desalted ions z k b t c 0 c d e s a l t e d epir represents energy efficiency fig 6c the term can suggest optimal operating zones by quantifying the trade off issue between the input and output energies before the analysis of those two metrics impacts of ph change on conversion of conductivity to concentration should be considered the ph change indicates the generation of protons and hydroxide ions which have much faster ion diffusivity than na and cl dh 9 311 doh 5 273 dna 1 334 and dcl 2 032 10 9 m2 s in water at 25 c and 1 atm probstein 2005 h oh generation therefore increases the measured conductance in the desalted flow even the total number of h oh na cl i e total dissolved salts is maintained as a result ph shift would worsen both epir by increasing it and ce by decreasing it at the ohmic limiting regimes v 4 v slow electromigration and non faradaic effect e g reaction overpotential under a low voltage lead to a high epir 500 k b t bockris and reddy 2000 bouhidel and lakehal 2006 the voltage increment worsens epir as usual v 4 v with a large portion of electric power dissipation salt ions in bulk electrolyte migrate through solution rather than through the resins under the weak electric field as the conductivity of the solution is lower than that of the resins this ion transport leads to energy loss lu et al 2010 however epir is improved up to 400 k b t as water splitting starts to occur at the early stage of the overlimiting regime v 6 v as explained water splitting products regenerate resins near the membranes fig 4d 6v those regenerated resins perform ion conduction again and facilitate the migration of sodium and chloride ions improving the energy efficiency of the system interestingly epir value remains low at 8 v where electroconvection on the resins and the membranes was observed electroconvection would serve as an ion mixer resulting in three possible dynamics i it transports sodium and chloride ions in bulk electrolyte to the membrane convectively ii it improves ion conduction of the resin by transporting ions from one resin to adjacent resin and iii it also conveys ions from the resins to the membranes in the same manner therefore electroconvection can improve ion removal without scarifying epir when the voltage passes over 10 v the system can generate a highly purified water with salt removal ratio over 95 but at the same time water splitting occurs intensively and continuously supplies ions fig 4d 8 12v which lets the current keep increasing fig 3a 8 14v and consumes energy fig 6b 8 14v while salt removal ratio converges to one water splitting costs additional energy for desalting protons and hydroxide ions irrelevant to salt ions desalination thus such high voltage degrades the energy efficiency fig 6c 8 14v next ce implies the ratio of removed ions in the desalting process to the whole current sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 zhao et al 2012 in detail ce is a comparison with desalted ion flux z f q c 0 c d e s a l t e d and current flux i which means the proportion of effective ion transport through the membranes ce in edi depends on the properties of the membrane resin and operation condition including voltage current initial concentration and flow rate edi operation necessarily involves common loss of ce such as current leakage back diffusion of ions to the desalted channel imperfect permselectivity of the membranes and water splitting therefore ce varied around 0 1 0 8 lower than one dejean et al 1998 kumar et al 2019 pan et al 2017 although previous edi experiments can find the optimal operating condition by maximizing ce 0 8 corresponding voltage or current is in overlimiting regime but specific information about what effects determine the optimal condition has not been documented well bouhidel and lakehal 2006 here the calculated ce of the micro edi cell also varies in 0 1 0 8 but now we can observe detailed ion transport dynamics related to ce value fig 6d in ohmic limiting regime and water splitting regime at 2 8 v ce increases continuously at 2 v slow electromigration under low voltage reduces to low ce as mentioned ions move within the solution not along the resins yet while the current stays the plateau at the limiting regime increased voltage leads to ion conduction of the resins it increases salt removal ratio with little change of current and enhances ce it continuously increases even when water splitting is observed although generated protons and hydroxide ions imply additional ion flux which also needs to be removed these ions compensate for the loss by regeneration step notably one more leap of ce is obtained by entering the electroconvection dominant overlimiting regime electroconvection transports ions convectively to the resins and the membranes this enhanced convective ion transport eventually improves desalination performance without ce loss in the same manner with epir the saturation of salt removal as well as deepened water splitting finally lead to the decrease of ce v 10 v while previous edi experiments lacked information about their optimization point it would be presumably the initial stage of electroconvection regime which exerts the highest level of ce as a result if we consider epir and ce collectively the micro edi is optimized at 8 v which is the boundary of water splitting and electroconvection dominant overlimiting regimes figs 3 and 6c d although epir is minimized at 6 v 380 k b t ce is not fully saturated 0 62 because some portion of the current is consumed for water splitting at 8 v where electroconvection and water splitting started to be observed simultaneously ce arrives at the maximum value of 0 80 but epir attains the similar level 391 k b t as electroconvection enhances convective ion flux and corresponding salt removal without scarifying ce subsequent increase of the voltage or current drives the increase decrease of epir ce presumably due to significant water splitting even though electroconvection becomes stronger indeed the balance of water splitting and electroconvection would be the key to eliciting a high level of desalination with a high system efficiency 4 conclusion in this work we directly visualized ion concentration ph shift and electroconvection in the microscale edi platform utilizing a monolayer resin bed in situ visualization images were analyzed under the measurement of voltage current and conductivity the overlimiting dynamics was elucidated by the leverage of not only water splitting but also electroconvection overlimiting regime was sub categorized into water splitting and electroconvection regimes according to voltage current response and visualization results water splitting starts to be observed at the early stage of overlimiting regime v 6 v and electroconvection is observed after 8 v in addition we evaluated system efficiency through the desalination metrics epir and ce with the synergetic effect of water splitting and electroconvection the optimized point at 8 v performed the second lowest epir 391 k b t and the highest ce 0 80 this is the first time that the internal edi system was directly and distinctly visualized in a realistic model which is a departure from previous black box edi works the utilization of electroconvection in edi would suggest guidelines for how to improve the system efficiency how to optimize desalination performance and how to design effective cell for balancing water splitting and electroconvection

18266,electrodeionization edi is membrane based desalination utilizing ion exchange membranes and ion exchange resins by combining electrodialysis and ion exchanger edi can produce ultrapure water in a continuous flow manner although its theoretical mechanisms are well documented there is no experimental platform that can provide microscopic details inside of the system in this paper we present microscale edi that can visualize in situ ion concentration ph and fluid flows the platform was fabricated by filling ion exchange resins as a monolayer in a transparent polydimethylsiloxane channel between cation and anion exchange membranes according to operating voltages 0 15v distinct behaviors of ion concentration profile ph shift and fluid flows were observed in ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes it is noteworthy that overlimiting regimes can be sub categorized as water splitting and electroconvection regimes in the early stage 4 8v water splitting is dominant with ph change near the membranes and resins under a higher voltage 8 15v electroconvection starts to occur even water splitting tries to suppress the development of the extended space charge layer and corresponding electroconvective instability accelerated ionic migration by electroconvection can improve current efficiency up to 80 this is a clear departure from overlimiting dynamics in electrodialysis with electroconvection only ion exchanger with no distinct regime and even from that in previous edi experiments with water splitting only graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination electroconvection electrodeionization water splitting overlimiting current ion concentration polarization 1 introduction electrodeionization edi is a hybrid desalination process of electrodialysis ed and ion exchanger ix using ion exchange membranes and ion exchange resins alvarado and chen 2014 dimascio et al 1998 edi platform consists of densely packed ion exchange resins between juxtaposed ion exchange membranes fig 1 a in a desalted channel the resins adsorb ions in water by exchanging them with fixed ions on the resins ix step and conduct ions to the membranes to do this the membranes can discharge ions toward the concentrated channel easily quickly and consistently ed step such hybridization allows edi to overcome two inherent problems of ed and ix one of the inevitable trade off issues in ed is that the electric resistance of the desalted channel becomes higher as we desalinate water to obtain purer water therefore the required power is exponentially increased kabay et al 2002 on the other hand ix needs a chemical regeneration of the resins functional groups to recycle it so this process cannot be operated in a continuous flow manner as a hybrid of ed and ix edi system can reduce the resistance of the desalted channel by filling the channel with highly ion conductive anion cation exchange resins between anion cation exchange membranes aem cem ion conduction along the resins is much faster than that along the low concentration electrolyte during desalination wood et al 2010 simultaneously water splitting is known to be induced at the junction of cation anion exchange resins in the desalted channel meng et al 2004 the produced protons and hydroxide ions can regenerate the resins resulting in continuous operation without additional chemical regeneration step alvarado and chen 2014 nikonenko et al 2014 wood et al 2010 with such dynamic synergy between two technologies edi can not only segregate heavy ions e g metal ions and radioactive ions but also produce ultrapure water by completely removing ions in water such unique abilities of edi have been widely utilized for ultrapure water production and wastewater treatment in pharmaceutical semiconductor and power plants arar et al 2014 ganzi and parise 1990 wood et al 2010 1 1 voltage current responses in electromembrane desalinations in general voltage current responses in electromembrane desalination systems e g ed edi capacitive deionization show three distinctive regimes which are ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes fig 1b krol et al 1999 such regime diversification is due to anion cation selective transport and corresponding dynamic changes of ion concentration near ion exchange membranes and resins i e ion concentration polarization icp hoek and elimelech 2003 schoch et al 2008 when counter ions pass through a permselective membrane or resin the remaining co ions also need to be depleted for satisfying electroneutrality generating ion depletion zone on the other side supplied counter ions through the membrane or the resin attract co ions also for matching electroneutrality generating ion enrichment zone as a result ion concentration is polarized across the membrane or the resin here the ion depletion zone of icp governs a voltage current response probstein 2005 under a relatively low voltage negligible icp lets the voltage current follows ohm s law with nearly constant electric resistance ohmic regime fig 1b when icp becomes considerable at a higher voltage the development of the ion depletion zone increases the electric resistance the growth rate of the current is then slowed and finally saturated when the ion concentration becomes zero at the interface of the membrane resin and an electrolyte in ion depletion zone limiting regime this saturated current is called a limiting current which is the maximum ion flux by diffusion and electromigration bockris and reddy 2000 after that the current starts to increase again overlimiting regime fig 1b in this overlimiting regime two mechanisms would work to overcome the diffusion limit of ion flux water splitting lu et al 2010 wood et al 2010 and electroconvection nikonenko et al 2010 rubinstein and zaltzman 2000 first if the voltage is higher than 1 23 v water molecules can be split into protons and hydroxide ions i e called water splitting in the depletion zone on the membranes resins a local electric field would be focused in this low concentration zone and become strong enough to split water molecules then produced protons and hydroxide ions act as additional current carriers performing electro regeneration of resins this water splitting has been known as a dominant overlimiting mechanism in edi alvarado and chen 2014 song et al 2005 and ed with bipolar membranes pourcelly 2002 slouka et al 2013 in these systems at the bipolar junctions where cation and anion exchange membranes resins meet ions in there are depleted as like a semiconductor p n type junction facilitating electric field focusing and water splitting of course the generation of protons and hydroxide ions by water splitting helps to recover resins in edi but desalination efficiency decreases because we need to transport these additional ions too in addition to original salt ions in water slouka et al 2013 the strong counter ion depletion induces the imbalance of co ions and counter ions near the membranes resins this extended space charge layer is vulnerable to instability resulting in vortical flows and this so called electroconvection can enhance ion flux convectively mishchuk 2010 nikonenko et al 2010 electroconvection is a dominated overlimiting mechanism in ed and related systems with ion exchange membranes nikonenko et al 2010 2014 schoch et al 2008 without bipolar junctions electroconvection is initiated first in the depletion zone water splitting also occurs here if an applied voltage is enough but it is less dominant lee et al 2019 in fact water splitting may obstruct the development of electroconvection belova et al 2006 mishchuk 2010 dissociated h and oh alleviate the degree of ion depletion so water splitting curbs the extension of the space charge layer which is necessary for the electroconvection in contrast to water splitting it is noteworthy that electroconvection can facilitate ion flux without the generation of additional ions therefore this phenomenon has been used to enhance desalination performances in electromembrane processes kwak et al 2013 lee et al 2019 nikonenko et al 2017 1 2 overlimiting dynamics in edi edi has been usually operated in the overlimiting current regime where a relatively high voltage can induce water splitting dzyazko et al 2009 song et al 2005 with practical importance in many applications overlimiting dynamics of edi has been extensively studied meng et al proposed that water splitting takes place at contact points of anion and cation selective interfaces and regenerates ion exchange resins meng et al 2004 lu et al 2010 accounted for the influences of water splitting on desalination performance of edi h and oh decomposition appear at ion depletion zones near the resins they regenerate the resins so that functional groups of them become h oh forms and ready to exchange na cl ions again also h oh attract counter ions in electrolytes and relieve ion depletion near ion exchange membranes resins correspondingly water splitting improves electromigration of salt ions lu et al 2010 bouhidel and lakehal investigated edi s desalination metrics including current efficiency and salt removal ratio under various operating conditions voltage and flow rate and found that the optimal current density was expected at just after water splitting starts to occur bouhidel and lakehal 2006 the obtained optimal current density was placed in the range from 0 9 m a c m 2 to 3 5 m a c m 2 much higher current voltage than that reduces current efficiency because of too much ion flux from water splitting yet it is necessary for resin regeneration while previous works clearly demonstrated water splitting and resin recovery mechanisms ion transport phenomena within the edi cell are not fully optimized nor well characterized yet edi system engineering has been relying on a black box approach where only inputs current or voltage flow rate etc and outputs voltage or current conductance etc are measured indeed the existence of water splitting has been just anticipated based on the slope change of the voltage current response song et al 2005 2007 however no one has directly observed that i water splitting really starts to occur at this slope changing point and ii where water splitting starts to occur in the complex geometry of the edi cell in fact it is still not clear where is the optimal operating condition and what is the dominant ion transport phenomenon at that point in addition electroconvection has been commonly ignored in edi except mishchuk discussed the possible existence of nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena mishchuk 2010 therefore iii the existence effect of electroconvection and iv possible competition between electroconvection and water splitting are still beyond the reach of both experiment and theory in this paper we present a microscale edi platform in which the flow channels can be microscopically observed we display in situ ion concentration ph and fluid flows in the edi cell such detailed observations not only confirm distinguishable ion transport dynamics according to the three current regimes ohmic limiting and overlimiting regimes but also reveal the co existence of water splitting and electroconvection in the edi cell for the first time with visualization results we measure desalination metrics including salt removal ratio energy consumption energy efficiency and current efficiency we also explain the effects of water splitting and electroconvection on the desalination

lower than that of salt ions chambers and santiago 2009 ojeda et al 1988 in this experiment the dye concentration was 11 9 μ m only to occupy 1 19 of the whole ion concentration 10mm which was small enough to be neglected also we added 2 μ m fluorescent polystyrene particles phosphorex inc hopkinton ma usa in the solution as 3 33 m g l to visualize fluid flows between the resins and the membranes the stokes number was calculated to confirm that the particles successfully trace the flow it was given as the ratio of the relaxation time of the particle t 0 ρ p d p 2 18 μ to the characteristic

which induces the shift of absorption wavelength by analyzing bright field images color change of the solution due to a ph indicator was quantified 3 results and discussion 3 1 voltage current responses in the micro edi fig 3 a shows the voltage current response of the micro edi cell which is divided into three regimes i ohmic regime at the initial stage where the current linearly increased with the voltage v 2 v ii limiting regime where the curve drew a plateau 2 v v 4 v and iii overlimiting regime which subsequently developed as the current increased again v 4 v such three discrete regime of the micro edi is similar to previous results as described in section 1 1 but there are three notable similarity and differences first the micro edi cell in this experiment has a limiting regime with two knees of the voltage current curve in previous edi systems however there was no limiting regime and only the single slope drop was observed in voltage current responses alvarado et al 2013 song et al 2005 in general previous edi cells were fabricated with multiple heterogeneous resin layers between the ion exchange membranes such non uniform geometry may induce the inhomogeneity of a local electric field in the cell then the local ion concentration as well as the threshold voltage of the limiting current can vary according to the locations correspondingly we cannot observe a separated plateau of the current response when it occurs with nearly zero ion concentration along the membrane electrolyte interface unlike previous systems we used a uniformly arrayed monolayer resins in the micro edi cell such geometric uniformity may allow us to develop a uniform ion depletion zone along the membrane and observe a limiting current regime with gentle slope changes second the slope in overlimiting regime is lower than that in ohmic regime which is a common characteristic of the voltage current responses in ed and edi alvarado et al 2013 kwak et al 2013 song et al 2005 and this is contrary to that in the systems with bipolar junctions slouka et al 2013 in the bipolar junction the development of ion depletion is generally much faster than that in bulk electrolyte because the membranes resins have much higher ion conductivities than electrolytes therefore the limiting current in bipolar junctions is generally lower than that in membrane electrolyte junctions and its threshold voltage is close to 1 23 v vermaas et al 2018 in this scenario when water splitting supplies protons and hydroxide ions in overlimiting regime these ions can pass through high conductive media i e membranes and resins rapidly as a result without the development of ion depletion in bulk electrolyte the slope of overlimiting current can be higher than that of ohmic regime strathmann et al 1997 vermaas et al 2018 however in edi systems including ours i the slope of voltage current curves is not higher than that of ohmic regime and ii the threshold voltages of overlimiting regimes are much higher than 1 23 v per a single cell this indicates that water splitting may take place in the depletion zone either at the membrane electrolyte interfaces and or at the bipolar junctions of the membrane resins first instead at bipolar junctions of the resins as predicted previously last the current response in overlimiting regime includes a unique characteristic a sudden rise of standard deviation fig 3b in the system with bipolar junctions when water splitting develops in overlimiting regime no considerable fluctuation of the current has been reported strathmann et al 1997 vermaas et al 2018 on the other hand when electroconvection develops the standard deviation of the current becomes larger because of vortex advection and the generation of chaotic eddies the vortex advection indicates the movement of electroconvective vortices carried by fluid flow and the generation of chaotic eddies indicates the generation of chaotic fluid flows driven by electroconvection kwak et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the standard deviation was comparatively low at an early stage of overlimiting regime 4 v v 8 v just as that of ohmic limiting regimes whereas it increases suddenly at a higher voltage v 8 v based on this overlimiting regime of the micro edi can be subdivided into two sections i water splitting dominant regime with a negligible current fluctuation 4 v v 8 v and ii electroconvection dominant regime with a considerable current fluctuation v 8 v this is a clear departure from overlimiting dynamics in ed with electroconvection only ix with no distinct regime and even from that in previous edi experiments with water splitting only to verify the hypothesis for explaining the above three characteristics we should investigate local ion concentration profiles ph shifts and the existence of electroconvection with visualization results in the micro edi system fig 4 we will discuss ion transport dynamics according to the current regimes in section 3 2 3 3 3 2 ion transport dynamics in ohmic limiting regimes v 4 v again in ohmic regime v 2 v the linear relation of a voltage and a current indicates the almost constant cell resistance with negligible icp accordingly there was no significant change of fluorescent intensity across the whole desalted channel fig 4a c 0 2v when the applied voltage arrived near the limiting regime 2 4 v the ion depletion zone occurs near the membrane first fig 4c i yet ion depletion zones were not developed near the resins since the local voltage across the resin is not high enough everywhere even when we apply the voltage up to 4 v we cannot observe considerable ph change by water splitting in the micro edi cell it may be due to the fact that the local voltage in the cell is lower than the threshold voltage 1 23 v the significant portion of the voltage will be dropped i in the concentrated electrode rinsing channel channel 1 and 3 in fig 2c and ii due to reaction overpotentials and or contact resistances at the electrodes thus the voltage was not focused sufficiently on the depletion zone so that water splitting is not observed and ph in the cell maintains its initial value 7 fig 4d 0 4v in these ohmic limiting regimes diffusion and electromigration are the major factors of ion transport therefore the fluid flows just along the resins fig 4b 0 4v 3 3 ion transport dynamics in overlimiting regime v 4 v next in overlimiting regime v 4 v the slope of voltage current curve is lower than that of ohmic limiting regimes due to the development of strong depletion zones along the membranes fluorescent intensity of the whole channel decreases as more salt ions are removed fig 4a and c i as we expected from the voltage current response two sub regimes are distinguished depending on the existence of ec fig 4b and ph shift fig 4d i water splitting regime with ph shift only 4 v v 8 v and ii electroconvection regime with ec too v 8 v 3 3 1 water splitting regime 4 v v 8 v at the voltage of 4 6 v the ion depletion zone near the membranes is expanded fig 4c i but icp near each resin is still not observed clearly fig 4c ii here water splitting is initiated near the membranes not everywhere bipolar junctions exists as enough voltage focused on the depletion zone fig 4d 6v correspondingly ph value shifts near the membrane only it supports the proposed water splitting mechanism of edi that water molecules would be decomposed at the contact points of membranes and resins meng et al 2004 the ph visualization additionally informs the ionic migration of decomposed co ions h on aem and oh on cem when water splitting occurs counter ions both salt ion and water splitting product migrate through the membranes co ions move along the resin surface by ion conduction and are discharged inside the channel in the vicinity of aem for example oh ion from water splitting passes through the membrane and it does not affect the ph shift in the desalted channel h ion moves along the resins comes out to the channel and makes the fluid acidic near the aem fig 4d 6 8v and e 8v it is also noted that ph shift is observed near the aem first fig 4e 8v because the depletion zone near the aem expands more quickly and quantitatively than that near the cem does lu et al 2010 in this water splitting regime the fluid flow doesn t have any other characteristics compared to that in ohmic limiting regimes fig 4b 4 6v although over 4 v is enough to generate electroconvection in ed kwak et al 2013 it is not observed yet in edi it is probably because water splitting can suppress the formation of an extended space charge layer near the membranes belova et al 2006 3 3 2 electroconvection regime v 8 v as the voltage increases the ion depletion zone becomes more significant and interestingly local ion concentration variation across the resin can be observed fig 4c ii 8 12 v the high voltage and fast ion flux through the resin generate ion enrichment zones at each resin even in the desalted channel where only depletion zones would occur by the membranes red arrow in fig 4c ii while water splitting reaction becomes vigorous ph shifts near the membranes is also deepened fig 4d e 8 12v now an alkaline ph shift near the cem is visualized clearly see supporting video the intensified ph shift at both anodic and cathodic sites also means that ion exchanging regeneration on the resins and the degree of desalination are all increased largely at the high voltage supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115310 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 in this regime electroconvection starts to be observed white arrow in fig 4b 8v see supporting video of course electroconvection becomes stronger at the higher voltage at 12 v electroconvective is strong enough to scatter fluorescent particles in a short time here it is noted that the edi cell has a concurrent effect of water splitting and electroconvection while water splitting regenerates resins electroconvection transfers ions in electrolyte toward the resins and membranes convectively however there is no electroconvection at the resins of the second row away or more from the aem fig 4b 8 12v it is presumably because the ion depletion and local electric field are not high enough to initiate electroconvection to overcome the effect of water splitting therefore electroconvection is generated only at the resins adjacent to the membranes 3 4 desalination metrics through microscopic observations of the current voltage responses and in situ ion flow ph variations we are able to categorize current regimes including new overlimiting sub regimes in this section we calculate four desalination metrics to evaluate desalination performance with respect to these current regimes and corresponding ion transport dynamics the metrics are presented as follows 1 salt removal ratio c 0 c d e s a l t e d c 0 2 energy consumption i v q 3 energy per ion removal epir i v q z k b t c 0 c d e s a l t e d 4 current efficiency ce z f q c 0 c d e s a l t e d i these four metrics are estimated under a constant applied voltage v 0 14 v and the averaged current response i the initial ion concentration is fixed as c 0 10 m m and the ion concentration of the desalted flow c d e s a l t e d is measured experimentally the desalted flow rate q is 10 μ l m i n k b is the boltzmann constant k b 1 38 10 23 m 2 k g s 2 k z is an ion valence of na and cl z 1 f is the faraday constant f 96500 c m o l and t is the absolute temperature t 298 k to calculate each metric the conductance of the desalted flow was measured and converted into c d e s a l t e d fig 5 a the conductance response was adopted after it was saturated by filling the dead volume of the conductivity electrode at 600s as shown in fig 5b the mean fluorescence intensity drop of the desalted flow calculated from fig 4c follows the conductance drop of the desalted flow the current response and salt removal ratio increase monotonically as the voltage increases fig 6 a consequently the energy consumption per producing desalted water also increases in the same manner fig 6b although salt removal ratio and energy consumption give us basic information about the quality of desalted water and required energy these two metrics cannot represent the system s efficiency instead epir and ce can elucidate it here epir indicates characteristic energy consumption required for desalting a pair of sodium and chloride ions zhao et al 2012 it is a non dimensional parameter adopting a scaling factor k b t as thermal energy 2 479 k j m o l given as the ratio of the electric power per produced water i v q to the characteristic energy carried by desalted ions z k b t c 0 c d e s a l t e d epir represents energy efficiency fig 6c the term can suggest optimal operating zones by quantifying the trade off issue between the input and output energies before the analysis of those two metrics impacts of ph change on conversion of conductivity to concentration should be considered the ph change indicates the generation of protons and hydroxide ions which have much faster ion diffusivity than na and cl dh 9 311 doh 5 273 dna 1 334 and dcl 2 032 10 9 m2 s in water at 25 c and 1 atm probstein 2005 h oh generation therefore increases the measured conductance in the desalted flow even the total number of h oh na cl i e total dissolved salts is maintained as a result ph shift would worsen both epir by increasing it and ce by decreasing it at the ohmic limiting regimes v 4 v slow electromigration and non faradaic effect e g reaction overpotential under a low voltage lead to a high epir 500 k b t bockris and reddy 2000 bouhidel and lakehal 2006 the voltage increment worsens epir as usual v 4 v with a large portion of electric power dissipation salt ions in bulk electrolyte migrate through solution rather than through the resins under the weak electric field as the conductivity of the solution is lower than that of the resins this ion transport leads to energy loss lu et al 2010 however epir is improved up to 400 k b t as water splitting starts to occur at the early stage of the overlimiting regime v 6 v as explained water splitting products regenerate resins near the membranes fig 4d 6v those regenerated resins perform ion conduction again and facilitate the migration of sodium and chloride ions improving the energy efficiency of the system interestingly epir value remains low at 8 v where electroconvection on the resins and the membranes was observed electroconvection would serve as an ion mixer resulting in three possible dynamics i it transports sodium and chloride ions in bulk electrolyte to the membrane convectively ii it improves ion conduction of the resin by transporting ions from one resin to adjacent resin and iii it also conveys ions from the resins to the membranes in the same manner therefore electroconvection can improve ion removal without scarifying epir when the voltage passes over 10 v the system can generate a highly purified water with salt removal ratio over 95 but at the same time water splitting occurs intensively and continuously supplies ions fig 4d 8 12v which lets the current keep increasing fig 3a 8 14v and consumes energy fig 6b 8 14v while salt removal ratio converges to one water splitting costs additional energy for desalting protons and hydroxide ions irrelevant to salt ions desalination thus such high voltage degrades the energy efficiency fig 6c 8 14v next ce implies the ratio of removed ions in the desalting process to the whole current sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 zhao et al 2012 in detail ce is a comparison with desalted ion flux z f q c 0 c d e s a l t e d and current flux i which means the proportion of effective ion transport through the membranes ce in edi depends on the properties of the membrane resin and operation condition including voltage current initial concentration and flow rate edi operation necessarily involves common loss of ce such as current leakage back diffusion of ions to the desalted channel imperfect permselectivity of the membranes and water splitting therefore ce varied around 0 1 0 8 lower than one dejean et al 1998 kumar et al 2019 pan et al 2017 although previous edi experiments can find the optimal operating condition by maximizing ce 0 8 corresponding voltage or current is in overlimiting regime but specific information about what effects determine the optimal condition has not been documented well bouhidel and lakehal 2006 here the calculated ce of the micro edi cell also varies in 0 1 0 8 but now we can observe detailed ion transport dynamics related to ce value fig 6d in ohmic limiting regime and water splitting regime at 2 8 v ce increases continuously at 2 v slow electromigration under low voltage reduces to low ce as mentioned ions move within the solution not along the resins yet while the current stays the plateau at the limiting regime increased voltage leads to ion conduction of the resins it increases salt removal ratio with little change of current and enhances ce it continuously increases even when water splitting is observed although generated protons and hydroxide ions imply additional ion flux which also needs to be removed these ions compensate for the loss by regeneration step notably one more leap of ce is obtained by entering the electroconvection dominant overlimiting regime electroconvection transports ions convectively to the resins and the membranes this enhanced convective ion transport eventually improves desalination performance without ce loss in the same manner with epir the saturation of salt removal as well as deepened water splitting finally lead to the decrease of ce v 10 v while previous edi experiments lacked information about their optimization point it would be presumably the initial stage of electroconvection regime which exerts the highest level of ce as a result if we consider epir and ce collectively the micro edi is optimized at 8 v which is the boundary of water splitting and electroconvection dominant overlimiting regimes figs 3 and 6c d although epir is minimized at 6 v 380 k b t ce is not fully saturated 0 62 because some portion of the current is consumed for water splitting at 8 v where electroconvection and water splitting started to be observed simultaneously ce arrives at the maximum value of 0 80 but epir attains the similar level 391 k b t as electroconvection enhances convective ion flux and corresponding salt removal without scarifying ce subsequent increase of the voltage or current drives the increase decrease of epir ce presumably due to significant water splitting even though electroconvection becomes stronger indeed the balance of water splitting and electroconvection would be the key to eliciting a high level of desalination with a high system efficiency 4 conclusion in this work we directly visualized ion concentration ph shift and electroconvection in the microscale edi platform utilizing a monolayer resin bed in situ visualization images were analyzed under the measurement of voltage current and conductivity the overlimiting dynamics was elucidated by the leverage of not only water splitting but also electroconvection overlimiting regime was sub categorized into water splitting and electroconvection regimes according to voltage current response and visualization results water splitting starts to be observed at the early stage of overlimiting regime v 6 v and electroconvection is observed after 8 v in addition we evaluated system efficiency through the desalination metrics epir and ce with the synergetic effect of water splitting and electroconvection the optimized point at 8 v performed the second lowest epir 391 k b t and the highest ce 0 80 this is the first time that the internal edi system was directly and distinctly visualized in a realistic model which is a departure from previous black box edi works the utilization of electroconvection in edi would suggest guidelines for how to improve the system efficiency how to optimize desalination performance and how to design effective cell for balancing water splitting and electroconvection

18267,understanding the differences of biogeochemical processes between straight and bent channel is important for weighting them in urban river planning and reconstruction shifts in the assembly of the sediment microbial community of bent channels are key but understudied component of bend induced increases in biogeochemical reaction rates here the assembly of microbial community and its feedback to nitrogen transformation in urban river bends were firstly studied by coupling ecological theory aqueous biogeochemistry dna sequencing and hydrodynamic profiling it was found that the sediment particle size was the main driving force for producing the significant difference of microbial community structure in river bends homogeneous selection quantified by β nearest taxon index βnti emerged in the urban river bends and accounted for 79 2 of all ecological processes moreover a significant positive relationship between βnti and the sediment particle size indicated that shifts in particle size were associated with shifts in deterministic selective pressures which govern the composition of the microbial community the significant correlation between the βnti and changes in nitrate concentration also indicated that nitrate leads to deterministic processes which select microbial taxa these microbial taxa which are governed by deterministic processes show specific nitrogen transformation traits and react on the nitrate concentration a multiphase transport model allowed the separation of the effects of deterministic processes on nitrogen concentration from measured concentration influenced by complex biogeochemical processes the results indicated that both the ammonia transformation and microbial nitrogen removal were stimulated in coarse sediment regions of the river bends and were confirmed by abundant differences of microbial taxa that could promote ammoxidation and denitrification the coarse sediment benefits microbial nitrogen removal in urban river bends a discovery that should inform urban river reconstruction designs and the efforts to assess the environmental water capacity of urban rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban river bends microbial community nitrogen transformation sediment particle size hydrodynamical model 1 introduction river channels in nature have a variety of planforms such as meandering braiding branching and converging deng and singh 2002 due to significant engineering and anthropogenic interventions urban river channels are generally reconstructed into two planforms i e straight and bent channels with concrete or other impervious material compared with straight channels bent channels benefit the degradation of pollutants by increasing the water residence time and by recovering the physical habitat and riparian zone in the channel pan et al 2016 however excess bends may limit the hydraulic capacity of the channel thus increasing the risk of urban waterlogging which conflicts with other ecosystem services khaleghi and surian 2019 therefore how to set up straight and bend in the reconstruction of urban river channels remains a difficult decision making trade off to address this trade off it is necessary to understand the effect of bends of different shapes on the pollutant degradation rate and the hydraulic capacity of urban rivers to do so it is essential to reveal the biogeochemical processes of pollutants in different position of bent channels urban rivers are hotspots of regional nitrogen pollution excessive nitrogen loading to urban rivers accelerates the growth of algae that can deplete oxygen disrupt aquatic ecosystems and result in eutrophication and hypoxia which can even lead to dead zones zhang et al 2015 distinguish the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen in urban river bends is of great significance to alleviate nitrogen pollution xin et al 2019 the transport of nitrogen in urban river is dominate by water flow and sediment transport the flow of urban river bends is characterized by significant cross stream velocities which modify primary flow patterns and create helical flow trajectories opdyke et al 2006 this helical flow causes lateral movement of sediment in addition to the longitudinal movement at the surface of the river bed which results in the redistribution of nitrogen attached to sediment the unique combinations of depth mean velocity velocity gradients bed shear stress and sediment characterize different morphological units provide distinctive habitats for biota and further influence the distribution and diversity of aquatic organisms in river bends harrison et al 2011 the transformation processes of nitrogen are mainly regulated by biological processes since the influence of chemical processes for nitrogen is rather slight reisinger et al 2016 garcia et al 2012 reported that the complex hydromorphology of river bends supported benthic invertebrate diversity by provided habitats for these kuntz and tyler 2018 further demonstrated that an alteration of benthic invertebrates could reduce nitrate uptake in sediment and affect nitrogen transformation in urban river bends schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 documented that macrophytes occupy large proportions of the cross sectional area of urban river bends maltais landry et al 2007 studied the contribution of macrophyte species to pollutant removal in horizontal subsurface flow and found that macrophytes improved the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus compared with these studied aquatic organisms microbes play a more direct role in the regulation of biogeochemical systems in aquatic environments and participate in essential biogeochemical cycling events especially nitrogen cycling kuypers et al 2018 however the spatial distribution of the microbial community in bent channels and whether their distribution affects the nitrogen transformation still remain unknown over the past decades a wide range of studies investigated the relationships between river microbial community and environmental factors such as nutrients temperature hydrodynamics light and heavy metals li et al 2015 stanish et al 2016 yang et al 2019 among these environmental parameters hydrodynamics is considered as the major agent of physical force which drives the dynamics of the river microbial community by controlling the dispersal of suspended microorganisms battin et al 2016 the biofilm community composition besemer et al 2012 the architecture of these communities battin et al 2003 2007 and their metabolism singer et al 2010 in bent channels the hydrodynamics is shaped by curvature width and depth of the river bend blanckaert 2015 the bend induced hydrodynamics may change the structure of the microbial community and further affect nitrogen transformation recently it has been proved that river turbulence in particular turbulent mass transfer across the centration boundary layer imposes an upper limit on nitrate uptake by assimilation and denitrification which was dominated by the microbial community grant et al 2018 microbial community assembly is a core process in rivers and may respond to hydrodynamics nutrition and other environmental factors via ecological processes and feedback may be provided to the nitrogen transformation due to the composition of microbial community were regulated by these factors tripathi et al 2018 however the relationship between the assembly of the microbial community and nitrogen transformation still remains unclear recently it has been demonstrated that the microbial community assembly is governed by deterministic and stochastic processes stegen et al 2013 deterministic processes include ecological selection imposed by both abiotic and biotic factors which influence organismal fitness and thus determine the composition and relative abundance of species stochastic processes in contrast involve random birth death and dispersal events which result in patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance alone tripathi et al 2018 although both deterministic and stochastic processes act in parallel to regulate the microbial community assembly deterministic processes could be directly manipulated zhang et al 2019b identifying the deterministic processes that shape the microbial community assembly and identifying the relationship between deterministic processes and nitrogen transformation in urban river bends with concrete bank is critical to guide the design of urban river planform however a significant knowledge gap persists since the relationship between deterministic processes and nitrogen transformation in urban river bends has not been directly investigated therefore the objectives of the present study are to address the following questions i what is the distribution pattern of the microbial community in urban river bends ii how does this microbial community assemble in urban river bends iii how do the assembly processes of microbial community affect the nitrogen transformation processes in urban river bends to address these questions the distribution pattern of the microbial community was explored by statistical methods based on amplicon sequence variants asvs the community assembly of the microbial community was quantitated by the β nearest taxon index βnti which is based on the null model and could recognize the resource based influences that operate alongside influences of organismal dispersal stegen et al 2013 the effects of microbial community on nitrogen transformation were investigated by subtracting the stimulated concentration of nitrogen which represents effects of other processes in addition to those imposed by the microbial community on the nitrogen concentration from the actual concentration of nitrogen the obtained results guide the trade off between bent and straight channels and provide a theoretic basis for urban river reconstruction 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and processing samples were collected from river bends which are reaches of qinhuai river an urban river located in nanjing china a total of 16 sampling sites in these urban river bends are shown in fig 1 and sampling was conducted in november 2018 the sampling sites were set as 10 m from the shore and 150 200 m from each other across river bank in this study at each sampling site water profiles were determined in situ by measuring the water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and ph using a hach hq30d portable meter hach company loveland colorado usa water samples were collected in triplicate from just below the surface using a plexiglass water sampler psc 1a changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china samples were then homogenized filtered and stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles all water samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4 c the characterization of the water chemistry included the total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n as previously described niu et al 2018 three sediment samples were collected at each site using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china the first 5 cm were sliced mixed until homogenization and stored in sterile 50 ml screw cap tubes the remaining sediment approximately 1 l was combined and stored in a plastic bag and then immediately transported to the laboratory in an ice box the tubes were stored at 80 c until the dna could be extracted and the remaining sediment samples for physicochemical analysis were stored at 20 c and freeze dried the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of sediment were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l the total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations of sediment were measured as previously described zhang et al 2019a in addition the particle size distributions including d10 d50 d90 which are the intercepts for 10 50 and 90 of the cumulative curve respectively and mean particle size mps were determined by particle size analysis sedimat 4 12 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany all measured environmental factors are provided in table s1 2 2 measurement simulation and validation of hydrodynamics the flow field was measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp riv 600 trdi ltd thousand oaks california usa which could measure the mean three dimension velocity profiles each cross section was automatically divided into several continuous intervals by adcp and each interval consisted of several grids according to the depth there can be thousands of grids per section the three velocity dimensions in each grid were recorded as eastern velocity ve northern velocity vn and vertical velocity vv with directions judged by the inner gyroscope the velocity of each grid was calculated by vector addition of ve vn and vv the average velocity av and the bottom velocity bv were calculated as the average of all velocities in depth and velocities close to the riverbed respectively there can be abnormal values within the records which are caused by the unstable moving processes therefore records were screened and values between 10 quantile and 90 quantile were retained then the mean two dimension velocity vector addition of ve and vn of each interval was used to plot a heatmap of the flow field inverse distance weighted interpolation which was commonly used for hydraulic calculation was adopted to calculate velocities at unmeasured points the hydrodynamical situation of the urban river bends was simulated by mike 21 which is developed by the danish hydraulic institute the hydrodynamic module and mud transport module were used in this study the composition of sediment became stable after about 270 h as shown in fig s1 moreover the accuracy and uncertainty of the model were evaluated through the coupling with measured and simulated flow velocity no significant difference was found between them anova p 0 114 and the mean relative error was below 40 as shown in fig s2 the measured and simulated d50 were compared to prove the validation of the simulated sediment distribution there is no significant difference among them anova p 0 755 and the mean relative error was below 50 except r4 and l6 sampling sites as shown in fig s3 therefore the model was accurate and sufficiently stable for the hydrological simulation in this studied area wang et al 2019 it is generally accepted that the transport and transformation of materials in river system are carried in the solid and dissolved phase among them the transport of solid particle occurs in two forms i e bed load transport and suspended load transport according to the results of sediment distribution as shown in fig s4 the particle size is range from about 0 1 μm to about 260 μm within this range the sediment is considered to be transported as suspended load kasperek et al 2013 tanoue and handa 1979 proved that nitrogenous materials bound rather strongly to sedimentary particle by measuring nitrogen recovery of sediment they also proposed a model which could simulate the nitrogen concentration by surface area of sediment particles on this basis the nitrogen concentration in different forms caused by physical processes could be calculated by combining the distribution of sediment and the proportional constant which could represent the nitrogen concentration of unit surface area 2 3 dna extraction and processing for each sediment sample the case was cracked and the sample was removed using sterile instruments genomic dna was extracted from each homogenized sample using the e z n a soil dnakit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s instructions the quality of the extracted dna was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the dna was stored at 20 c until further analysis the universal bacterial primer set 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3

were as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna with 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s with a final extension of 10 min at 72 c barcodes that allow sample multiplexing during pyrosequencing were incorporated between the 341 adapter and the forward primers raw fastq files were firstly demultiplexed using in house perl scripts according to barcode sequence information for each sample with the following criteria i the 250 bp reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 10 bp sliding window discarding the truncated reads that were shorter than 50 bp ii exact barcode matching two nucleotide mismatches in primer matching reads containing ambiguous characters were removed iii only sequences that overlap for longer than 10 bp were assembled according to their overlap sequence reads that could not be assembled were discarded next with the newly established bioinformatics techniques presented in the qiime2 package v2018 6 an approach to denoise the single end sequence data was implemented bolyen et al 2018 to achieve this a denoising strategy was used based on the poisson distribution through the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm program dada2 v1 10 this was performed utilizing the qiime dada2 denoise single module on demultiplexed sequence data without truncation for reads bolyen et al 2018 the sequence reads corresponding to each sample of this study have been deposited in ncbi sra for public access bioproject number prjna557101 taxonomic identities were assigned to these representative sequences herein referred as asvs through the qiime feature classifier command utilizing the classify sklearn option 2 4 ecology process analyses ecology process analyses were performed in r v3 5 3 http cran r project org the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd was used to quantify turnover in the phylogenetic structure of communities the abundance of weighted βmntd was calculated using the comdistnt function in the picante package stegen et al 2013 to evaluate the potential for shifts in the relative balance between stochastic and deterministic ecological processes randomizations were used to generate a null distribution 999 randomizations for each βmntd estimate βmntd is a pairwise distance metric and a null βmntd distribution was generated for each pairwise community comparison βnti

scaling analysis nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the dissimilarity of the microbial community among samples noval rivas et al 2013 mantel test and canonical correspondence analysis cca were performed to test the correlation between microbial community and environmental factors the mantel test was calculated to identify the environmental factors that significantly correlated with microbial community mantel 1967 since the length of axis 1 of detrended correspondence analysis exceeded 4 0 cca was performed using these significant environmental factors ter braak 1986 the results were input into cca to visualize the correlation between environmental factors and microbial community structure multivariate regression tree mrt analysis de ath 2002 which is a constrained clustering method was conducted using the mvpart package with default parameters to relate the relative abundance of lineages to the site characteristics linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse analysis was used to determine the taxa contributing to the effect size among the microbial community of different sample groups segata et al 2011 this analysis was performed through the hutlab galaxy web application huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy and was incorporated the non parametric kruskal wallis sum rank test for significant differential abundance set at a significance level of p 0 05 followed by lda to estimate effect size at log 10 values the results were plotted to visualize taxa that demonstrated an lda of 2 for effect size in addition pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the correlative relationship between changes of environmental variables and βnti pearson 1895 anosim was used to test the difference of microbial community structure between sampling groups warton et al 2012 student s t test was used to compare the effects of the microbial community on the nitrogen concentration student 1908 kruskal wallis test was used to account for non independence among environmental factors between different groups kruskal and wallis 1952 3 results and discussion 3 1 bend induced sediment redistribution and cluster of microbial community as shown in fig 1 the flow with higher velocity from the channel center in a lateral direction toward the outer bank in both two continuous bends in this study region for the first bend with mild sinuosity θ 70 the flow with high velocity about 0 28 m s was concentrated near the inner banks for the second bend with high sinuosity θ 35 the flow with high velocity about 0 41 m s shift from the inner bank to the outer bank the discharge of the bend channel is about 80 m3 s and the average flow velocity is about 0 22 m s as indicated by garcia et al 2012 and wei et al 2016 the river bends were characterized by strong cross stream helicoidal flows caused by the centrifugal force which impels the water mass in the outward direction and causes transverse tilting of the water surface so that the flow with higher velocity from the channel center in a lateral direction toward the outer bank and vertically downward and the degree of helicity peaks downstream from the point of greatest channel curvature where near bed velocity gradients and bed shear stresses increase the results indicated that the sediment particle size was higher than others in these sampling sites including l1 l2 r1 r2 r3 and r4 which is in keep with the garcia et al 2012 and wei et al 2016 who attributed coarser grained sediments are deposited in the region with high velocity the measured velocity profile was in line with the hydrodynamics in the typical river bends in addition the cross sectional shape of the urban river bend was near symmetrical which differed from the cross sectional shape of the natural river bend garcia et al 2012 this is one of the characteristics of urban rivers where both river bank and bed were constructed by concrete with the intention to prevent erosion and to maintain stability considering the collective effects of primary flow and helicoidal flow the complex movement of water and sediment in urban river bends causes the redistribution of sediment heterogeneous sediments and different hydrodynamic properties together formed a variety of niches which may cause differences of the microbial community to explore the distribution patterns of the microbial community in urban river bends nmds was performed as shown in fig 2 a the sampling sites formed two clusters to further assess which factor caused this distribution pattern the environmental factors were added to nmds the results showed that the mps p 0 005 and d90 p 0 003 were the main driving factors to cause the different structure of the microbial community therefore it could be inferred that the complex hydrodynamics in urban river bends causes a redistribution of sediments by particle size which further changes the structure of the microbial community and causes the dissimilarity of microbial community to further confirm this inference the difference of sediment particle size across sampling sites was investigated the sediments with d50 larger than 40 μm were shown in r3 r4 r5 r6 l7 l8 and with smaller than 40 μm were shown in l3 l4 l5 l6 r7 and r8 it was found that sample grouping based on microbial community clustering was almost consistent with that based on sediments particle size distribution except l3 and r6 sampling sites due to grouping based on particle size distribution could show more consistent with the common understanding about bent channel the sampling sites were finally assigned into two groups named coarse sediment group r3 r4 r5 r6 l7 and l8 and fine sediment group l3 l4 l5 l6 r7 and r8 according to sediment particle size the l1 l2 r1 and r2 sampling sites were assigned into reference group due to these sampling sites belong to straight channel anosim testing was conducted to test the difference between microbial communities among these three groups the results showed that the microbial community differed significantly between the coarse sediment group and the fine sediment group p 0 015 however no significant differences were found between the reference group and either the coarse p 0 1964 or the fine sediment group p 0 404 mantel test and cca were performed to test the correlation between microbial community and environmental factors the mantel test indicated that mps p 0 028 d10 p 0 020 and d90 p 0 026 were significantly correlated with the microbial community composition these factors were selected to perform detrended correspondence analysis since the length of axis 1 exceeded 4 0 cca was performed using these significant environmental factors the results showed that d10 with the longest arrow had the strongest effects on microbial community composition in all sampling groups followed by d90 and mps fig 2b in addition the differences of sediment particle sizes between coarse and fine sediment groups were tested by kruskal wallis test the results showed that mps d50 and d90 significantly differed between fine and coarse sediment groups mrt analysis was also conducted as a second approach to corroborate the nmds cluster results as shown in fig 2c the mrt constructed from the data of the microbial community exhibited two splits and three levels the 16 samples were clustered into two groups by mps and the group with an mps less than 46 53 μm was split by nh4 n in water these results confirmed the hypothesis that the different sediment particle size was the main driving factor that caused difference in the structure of the microbial community 3 2 composition of the microbial community to further investigate the composition of the microbial community and their differences among three groups in urban river bends a series of statistical analyses were conducted first the microbial community richness and diversity indices were calculated and the results are provided in table s2 none of these indices showed any significant difference among the three groups which could be explained by the short distance of different sampling locations next the community composition at the phylum level was investigated to obtain general conclusions regarding community composition of urban river bends in total 33 bacterial phyla were obtained in the 16 sediment samples the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria which occupied 45 08 of the total bacterial sequences this was followed by chloroflexi bacteroidetes acidobacteria nitrospirae verrucomicrobia gemmatimonadetes actinobacteria firmicutes and nitrospinae which jointly accounted for 94 63 of the total bacterial sequences fig s5 both nitrospirae and nitrospinae are commonly observed in freshwater environments and are vital participants of the nitration transformation process jacob et al 2017 firmicutes is related to the ammonization of organic nitrogen indicating the potentially active nitrogen transformation processes in this area tai et al 2013 lefse was applied to determine highly differential taxonomy from phylum to order levels among samples from the coarse sediment group fine sediment group and reference group fig 3 a presents a cladogram showing the phylogenetic distribution of microbial lineages that were significantly associated lda value 2 with sediments from the coarse sediment fine sediment and reference group the corresponding lda values for each lineage are shown in fig 3b lefse analysis identified the microbial taxa that were mainly enriched in the coarse sediment group at the class level which included oxyphotobacteria fusobacteria saccharimonadales and erysiplotrichia in which erysipelotrichia belong to dominant phylum in fine sediment group the abundant difference taxa are nitrospira which belong to dominant phylum in reference group the abundant difference taxa are deltaproteobacteria bacteroidia dehalococcoidia leptospirae spirochaetia acetothermiia and caldisericia in which deltaproteobacteria bacteroidia and dehalococcoidia belong to dominant phylum the abundance of difference taxa may affect the nitrogen transformation in urban river bends according to the results of lefse sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium were enriched in coarse sediment previous studies demonstrated that sphingomonadaceae was present in nitrogen converting systems for both ammonium removal and denitrification świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 and cetobacterium had nitrate reduction activity tsuchiya et al 2008 nitrospira which were enriched in fine sediment may play a role in the nitrogen cycle by performing nitrite oxidation in the second step of nitrification when transforming nitrite to nitrate van kessel et al 2015 3 3 assembly of microbial community the microbial community composition was deemed to be controlled by various ecological processes including both deterministic processes and stochastic processes the βnti was based on a null model that factored out the influences of stochastic ecological processes such as organismal dispersal and ecological drift consequently it could provide a quantitative description of the ecological processes of the microbial community βnti 2 indicates that ecological selection pressures are consistent through time space which is termed homogenous selection resulting in low variation in the microbial composition βnti 2 indicated that ecological selection pressures changed through time space which is termed variable selection thus causing large shifts in microbiome composition βnti values between 2 and 2 indicated that the selective environment did not strongly determine differences or similarities between a given pair of microbiomes stegen et al 2013 therefore βnti was calculated and the results indicated that microbial community within each compartment of the urban river bend system were governed by homogeneous selection 79 2 followed by dispersal limitation 13 3 and ecological drift 7 5 to get deeper insights into the potential role of the environmental factors in deterministic processes which regulated the microbial community assembly pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were performed between each of the environmental factor changes and the βnti as shown in fig 4 a f changes of bv no3 n in water no3 n in sediment mps d10 and d90 were significantly correlated with the βnti the fitting curves of mps d10 d90 and no3 n in sediment formed slightly increasing straight lines these results indicated that as the difference in these environmental factors increased there was a transition in microbial community assembly processes from homogeneous selection to stochastic selection the fitting curve of bv and no3 n in water formed decreasing straight lines these results illustrated that as the change of bv and no3 n in water decreased indicating a transition of microbial community assembly processes from stochasticity to homogeneous selection in addition changes of t and tp in sediment were also significantly correlated with βnti and the fitting curves were nearly horizontal lines fig s6 these results indicated that the change of these environmental factors did not change ecological processes considering the effects of microbial community on particle size is rather slight atekwana et al 2006 it could be addressed that the sediment particle size affected the deterministic processes of the microbial community assembly and further influenced the composition of the microbial community the no3 n could change the microbial community composition by affecting deterministic processes however considering that the microbial community was deeply involved in nitrogen transformation in this urban river it can be inferred that the microbial community changes in response to deterministic processes in different regions of the river bends may have different effects on nitrogen transformation 3 4 microbial community influence on nitrogen transformation to address the effects of microbial community on nitrogen transformation different processes that affect the concentration of nitrogen in different forms including nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn in sediment had to be distinguished it is generally accepted that the concentration of nitrogen in the river sediment is affected by both physical processes and biochemical processes physical processes refer to the migration of nitrogen caused by water flow and sediment transport biochemical processes are mainly driven by the microbial community in the river due to the slight chemical transformation among different forms of nitrogen reisinger et al 2016 the concentration of different forms of nitrogen caused by physical processes could be simulated by a multiphase transport model moreover the measured concentration was the result of a combination of physical processes and biochemical processes therefore the effects of microbial community on the concentration of nitrogen in different forms could be calculated by subtracting the measured concentration from the simulated concentration the thus obtained value was defined as the concentration change caused by microbial community cmc if the cmc was positive the microbial community caused a decrease of nitrogen conversely if the cmc was negative it caused an increase of nitrogen as shown in fig 5 a the cmc of tn was positive in both coarse and fine sediments and the value in coarse sediment was significantly higher p 0 046 this illustrated that the microbial nitrogen removal existed in both coarse and fine sediments and the removal amount of tn was higher in coarse sediment furthermore the cmc of nitrogen in different form was investigated the cmc of nh4 n p 0 036 and no2 n p 0 04 were significantly different between coarse and fine sediment groups and the cmc of no3 n did not show a significant difference in coarse sediment nh4 n was transformed more than in fine sediment and more no2 n was generated than in fine sediment this could be associated with the taxa which could explain the differences between coarse and fine sediment groups identified by lefse the nitrification denitrification and nitrate reduction processes were accelerated in coarse sediment due to sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium these processes promoted the microbial nitrogen removal in coarse sediment which may contribute to the coupled nitrification denitrification the sediment particle size composition in the coarse sediment region could provide aerobic and anoxic niches for the processes greig et al 2007 as shown in fig s4 the peak of the distribution curve of coarse sediment occurred in larger particle sizes compared with fine sediment in addition nitrospira were enriched in fine sediment so that the cmc of no2 n in fine sediment was less than in coarse sediment 3 5 implications for aquatic environmental remediation and management in the reconstruction of urban rivers the trade off of river channel design bending or straightening needs to be weighed understanding the effects of different shapes of river channels on pollutant degradation rate and hydraulic capacity of urban rivers is necessary for an appropriate trade off the study provides insight into how bent channels change the microbial community structure by influencing the deterministic processes and how the changed microbial community affects nitrogen transformation the results suggest that the coarse sediment promoted microbial nitrogen removal compared with fine sediment due to the selection of sediment particle size the microbial community had more denitrification traits in coarse sediment this study showed that the sediment particle size composition in coarse sediment regions could provide specific niches for denitrification taxa in the river this finding should be considered in river remediation since it provides a theoretical basis for several river remediation techniques for example when the gabion box is used for river remediation the particle sizes of sand and gravel components could be designed to improve the capability of microbial nitrogen removal for constructed wetlands the microbial nitrogen removal capacity of constructed wetlands could also be improved by regulating the composition of sediment particle sizes many studies have demonstrated that the position and size of regions of coarse and fine sediments were highly dependent on the bend curvature clayton 2010 opdyke et al 2006 in this way the size of the coarse sediment region could be increased by changing the curvature of river bends with expanding coarse sediment region more nitrogen could be removed by microbial community due to the increased area of coarse sediment these effects enhance the capability of a river to remove nitrogen and provide a theoretical basis for an appropriate trade off between bent and straight river channels moreover it could be inferred that the capability of channels to degrade pollutants differed between bent and straight channels of urban rivers this difference should be considered when calculating the pollutant degradation rates and the water environmental capacity of urban rivers these results provide a significant reference for the development of discharge standards for water pollutants and river management 4 conclusion in this study both the distribution and assembly of microbial community in urban river bends were investigated furthermore nitrogen transformation processes were also investigated in the study region it was found that the structure of the microbial community differed significantly between coarse and fine sediment regions of urban river bends this biogeographic distribution was driven by bend induced sediment redistribution the homogeneous selection which accounts for 79 2 was the main ecological process in this study region and the βnti values were significantly correlated with the changes in sediment particle size and no3 n concentration the sediment particle size regulated the deterministic processes of microbial community assembly and imposed significant effects on nitrogen transformation coarse sediment regions of river bends benefit the nh4 n transformation and microbial nitrogen removal due to the presence of sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium which were found to be enriched in this region as identified by lefse in contrast the second step of the nitrification process was promoted in fine sediment due to the high abundance of nitrospira in this region this study offers insight into the microbial community assembly and nitrogen transformation processes of urban river bends which not only provides a theoretic basis for the appropriate trade off between bent and straight rivers but could also guide river remediation and management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18267,understanding the differences of biogeochemical processes between straight and bent channel is important for weighting them in urban river planning and reconstruction shifts in the assembly of the sediment microbial community of bent channels are key but understudied component of bend induced increases in biogeochemical reaction rates here the assembly of microbial community and its feedback to nitrogen transformation in urban river bends were firstly studied by coupling ecological theory aqueous biogeochemistry dna sequencing and hydrodynamic profiling it was found that the sediment particle size was the main driving force for producing the significant difference of microbial community structure in river bends homogeneous selection quantified by β nearest taxon index βnti emerged in the urban river bends and accounted for 79 2 of all ecological processes moreover a significant positive relationship between βnti and the sediment particle size indicated that shifts in particle size were associated with shifts in deterministic selective pressures which govern the composition of the microbial community the significant correlation between the βnti and changes in nitrate concentration also indicated that nitrate leads to deterministic processes which select microbial taxa these microbial taxa which are governed by deterministic processes show specific nitrogen transformation traits and react on the nitrate concentration a multiphase transport model allowed the separation of the effects of deterministic processes on nitrogen concentration from measured concentration influenced by complex biogeochemical processes the results indicated that both the ammonia transformation and microbial nitrogen removal were stimulated in coarse sediment regions of the river bends and were confirmed by abundant differences of microbial taxa that could promote ammoxidation and denitrification the coarse sediment benefits microbial nitrogen removal in urban river bends a discovery that should inform urban river reconstruction designs and the efforts to assess the environmental water capacity of urban rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban river bends microbial community nitrogen transformation sediment particle size hydrodynamical model 1 introduction river channels in nature have a variety of planforms such as meandering braiding branching and converging deng and singh 2002 due to significant engineering and anthropogenic interventions urban river channels are generally reconstructed into two planforms i e straight and bent channels with concrete or other impervious material compared with straight channels bent channels benefit the degradation of pollutants by increasing the water residence time and by recovering the physical habitat and riparian zone in the channel pan et al 2016 however excess bends may limit the hydraulic capacity of the channel thus increasing the risk of urban waterlogging which conflicts with other ecosystem services khaleghi and surian 2019 therefore how to set up straight and bend in the reconstruction of urban river channels remains a difficult decision making trade off to address this trade off it is necessary to understand the effect of bends of different shapes on the pollutant degradation rate and the hydraulic capacity of urban rivers to do so it is essential to reveal the biogeochemical processes of pollutants in different position of bent channels urban rivers are hotspots of regional nitrogen pollution excessive nitrogen loading to urban rivers accelerates the growth of algae that can deplete oxygen disrupt aquatic ecosystems and result in eutrophication and hypoxia which can even lead to dead zones zhang et al 2015 distinguish the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen in urban river bends is of great significance to alleviate nitrogen pollution xin et al 2019 the transport of nitrogen in urban river is dominate by water flow and sediment transport the flow of urban river bends is characterized by significant cross stream velocities which modify primary flow patterns and create helical flow trajectories opdyke et al 2006 this helical flow causes lateral movement of sediment in addition to the longitudinal movement at the surface of the river bed which results in the redistribution of nitrogen attached to sediment the unique combinations of depth mean velocity velocity gradients bed shear stress and sediment characterize different morphological units provide distinctive habitats for biota and further influence the distribution and diversity of aquatic organisms in river bends harrison et al 2011 the transformation processes of nitrogen are mainly regulated by biological processes since the influence of chemical processes for nitrogen is rather slight reisinger et al 2016 garcia et al 2012 reported that the complex hydromorphology of river bends supported benthic invertebrate diversity by provided habitats for these kuntz and tyler 2018 further demonstrated that an alteration of benthic invertebrates could reduce nitrate uptake in sediment and affect nitrogen transformation in urban river bends schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 documented that macrophytes occupy large proportions of the cross sectional area of urban river bends maltais landry et al 2007 studied the contribution of macrophyte species to pollutant removal in horizontal subsurface flow and found that macrophytes improved the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus compared with these studied aquatic organisms microbes play a more direct role in the regulation of biogeochemical systems in aquatic environments and participate in essential biogeochemical cycling events especially nitrogen cycling kuypers et al 2018 however the spatial distribution of the microbial community in bent channels and whether their distribution affects the nitrogen transformation still remain unknown over the past decades a wide range of studies investigated the relationships between river microbial community and environmental factors such as nutrients temperature hydrodynamics light and heavy metals li et al 2015 stanish et al 2016 yang et al 2019 among these environmental parameters hydrodynamics is considered as the major agent of physical force which drives the dynamics of the river microbial community by controlling the dispersal of suspended microorganisms battin et al 2016 the biofilm community composition besemer et al 2012 the architecture of these communities battin et al 2003 2007 and their metabolism singer et al 2010 in bent channels the hydrodynamics is shaped by curvature width and depth of the river bend blanckaert 2015 the bend induced hydrodynamics may change the structure of the microbial community and further affect nitrogen transformation recently it has been proved that river turbulence in particular turbulent mass transfer across the centration boundary layer imposes an upper limit on nitrate uptake by assimilation and denitrification which was dominated by the microbial community grant et al 2018 microbial community assembly is a core process in rivers and may respond to hydrodynamics nutrition and other environmental factors via ecological processes and feedback may be provided to the nitrogen transformation due to the composition of microbial community were regulated by these factors tripathi et al 2018 however the relationship between the assembly of the microbial community and nitrogen transformation still remains unclear recently it has been demonstrated that the microbial community assembly is governed by deterministic and stochastic processes stegen et al 2013 deterministic processes include ecological selection imposed by both abiotic and biotic factors which influence organismal fitness and thus determine the composition and relative abundance of species stochastic processes in contrast involve random birth death and dispersal events which result in patterns of species composition that are indistinguishable from those produced by random chance alone tripathi et al 2018 although both deterministic and stochastic processes act in parallel to regulate the microbial community assembly deterministic processes could be directly manipulated zhang et al 2019b identifying the deterministic processes that shape the microbial community assembly and identifying the relationship between deterministic processes and nitrogen transformation in urban river bends with concrete bank is critical to guide the design of urban river planform however a significant knowledge gap persists since the relationship between deterministic processes and nitrogen transformation in urban river bends has not been directly investigated therefore the objectives of the present study are to address the following questions i what is the distribution pattern of the microbial community in urban river bends ii how does this microbial community assemble in urban river bends iii how do the assembly processes of microbial community affect the nitrogen transformation processes in urban river bends to address these questions the distribution pattern of the microbial community was explored by statistical methods based on amplicon sequence variants asvs the community assembly of the microbial community was quantitated by the β nearest taxon index βnti which is based on the null model and could recognize the resource based influences that operate alongside influences of organismal dispersal stegen et al 2013 the effects of microbial community on nitrogen transformation were investigated by subtracting the stimulated concentration of nitrogen which represents effects of other processes in addition to those imposed by the microbial community on the nitrogen concentration from the actual concentration of nitrogen the obtained results guide the trade off between bent and straight channels and provide a theoretic basis for urban river reconstruction 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and processing samples were collected from river bends which are reaches of qinhuai river an urban river located in nanjing china a total of 16 sampling sites in these urban river bends are shown in fig 1 and sampling was conducted in november 2018 the sampling sites were set as 10 m from the shore and 150 200 m from each other across river bank in this study at each sampling site water profiles were determined in situ by measuring the water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and ph using a hach hq30d portable meter hach company loveland colorado usa water samples were collected in triplicate from just below the surface using a plexiglass water sampler psc 1a changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china samples were then homogenized filtered and stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles all water samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4 c the characterization of the water chemistry included the total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n as previously described niu et al 2018 three sediment samples were collected at each site using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china the first 5 cm were sliced mixed until homogenization and stored in sterile 50 ml screw cap tubes the remaining sediment approximately 1 l was combined and stored in a plastic bag and then immediately transported to the laboratory in an ice box the tubes were stored at 80 c until the dna could be extracted and the remaining sediment samples for physicochemical analysis were stored at 20 c and freeze dried the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of sediment were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l the total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations of sediment were measured as previously described zhang et al 2019a in addition the particle size distributions including d10 d50 d90 which are the intercepts for 10 50 and 90 of the cumulative curve respectively and mean particle size mps were determined by particle size analysis sedimat 4 12 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany all measured environmental factors are provided in table s1 2 2 measurement simulation and validation of hydrodynamics the flow field was measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp riv 600 trdi ltd thousand oaks california usa which could measure the mean three dimension velocity profiles each cross section was automatically divided into several continuous intervals by adcp and each interval consisted of several grids according to the depth there can be thousands of grids per section the three velocity dimensions in each grid were recorded as eastern velocity ve northern velocity vn and vertical velocity vv with directions judged by the inner gyroscope the velocity of each grid was calculated by vector addition of ve vn and vv the average velocity av and the bottom velocity bv were calculated as the average of all velocities in depth and velocities close to the riverbed respectively there can be abnormal values within the records which are caused by the unstable moving processes therefore records were screened and values between 10 quantile and 90 quantile were retained then the mean two dimension velocity vector addition of ve and vn of each interval was used to plot a heatmap of the flow field inverse distance weighted interpolation which was commonly used for hydraulic calculation was adopted to calculate velocities at unmeasured points the hydrodynamical situation of the urban river bends was simulated by mike 21 which is developed by the danish hydraulic institute the hydrodynamic module and mud transport module were used in this study the composition of sediment became stable after about 270 h as shown in fig s1 moreover the accuracy and uncertainty of the model were evaluated through the coupling with measured and simulated flow velocity no significant difference was found between them anova p 0 114 and the mean relative error was below 40 as shown in fig s2 the measured and simulated d50 were compared to prove the validation of the simulated sediment distribution there is no significant difference among them anova p 0 755 and the mean relative error was below 50 except r4 and l6 sampling sites as shown in fig s3 therefore the model was accurate and sufficiently stable for the hydrological simulation in this studied area wang et al 2019 it is generally accepted that the transport and transformation of materials in river system are carried in the solid and dissolved phase among them the transport of solid particle occurs in two forms i e bed load transport and suspended load transport according to the results of sediment distribution as shown in fig s4 the particle size is range from about 0 1 μm to about 260 μm within this range the sediment is considered to be transported as suspended load kasperek et al 2013 tanoue and handa 1979 proved that nitrogenous materials bound rather strongly to sedimentary particle by measuring nitrogen recovery of sediment they also proposed a model which could simulate the nitrogen concentration by surface area of sediment particles on this basis the nitrogen concentration in different forms caused by physical processes could be calculated by combining the distribution of sediment and the proportional constant which could represent the nitrogen concentration of unit surface area 2 3 dna extraction and processing for each sediment sample the case was cracked and the sample was removed using sterile instruments genomic dna was extracted from each homogenized sample using the e z n a soil dnakit omega bio tek norcross ga usa following the manufacturer s instructions the quality of the extracted dna was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the dna was stored at 20 c until further analysis the universal bacterial primer set 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3

were as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna with 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s and 72 c for 45 s with a final extension of 10 min at 72 c barcodes that allow sample multiplexing during pyrosequencing were incorporated between the 341 adapter and the forward primers raw fastq files were firstly demultiplexed using in house perl scripts according to barcode sequence information for each sample with the following criteria i the 250 bp reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 10 bp sliding window discarding the truncated reads that were shorter than 50 bp ii exact barcode matching two nucleotide mismatches in primer matching reads containing ambiguous characters were removed iii only sequences that overlap for longer than 10 bp were assembled according to their overlap sequence reads that could not be assembled were discarded next with the newly established bioinformatics techniques presented in the qiime2 package v2018 6 an approach to denoise the single end sequence data was implemented bolyen et al 2018 to achieve this a denoising strategy was used based on the poisson distribution through the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm program dada2 v1 10 this was performed utilizing the qiime dada2 denoise single module on demultiplexed sequence data without truncation for reads bolyen et al 2018 the sequence reads corresponding to each sample of this study have been deposited in ncbi sra for public access bioproject number prjna557101 taxonomic identities were assigned to these representative sequences

scaling analysis nmds and hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the dissimilarity of the microbial community among samples noval rivas et al 2013 mantel test and canonical correspondence analysis cca were performed to test the correlation between microbial community and environmental factors the mantel test was calculated to identify the environmental factors that significantly correlated with microbial community mantel 1967 since the length of axis 1 of detrended correspondence analysis exceeded 4 0 cca was performed using these significant environmental factors ter braak 1986 the results were input into cca to visualize the correlation between environmental factors and microbial community structure multivariate regression tree mrt analysis de ath 2002 which is a constrained clustering method was conducted using the mvpart package with default parameters to relate the relative abundance of lineages to the site characteristics linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse analysis was used to determine the taxa contributing to the effect size among the microbial community of different sample groups segata et al 2011 this analysis was performed through the hutlab galaxy web application huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy and was incorporated the non parametric kruskal wallis sum rank test for significant differential abundance set at a significance level of p 0 05 followed by lda to estimate effect size at log 10 values the results were plotted to visualize taxa that demonstrated an lda of 2 for effect size in addition pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the correlative relationship between changes of environmental variables and βnti pearson 1895 anosim was used to test the difference of microbial community structure between sampling groups warton et al 2012 student s t test was used to compare the effects of the microbial community on the nitrogen concentration student 1908 kruskal wallis test was used to account for non independence among environmental factors between different groups kruskal and wallis 1952 3 results and discussion 3 1 bend induced sediment redistribution and cluster of microbial community as shown in fig 1 the flow with higher velocity from the channel center in a lateral direction toward the outer bank in both two continuous bends in this study region for the first bend with mild sinuosity θ 70 the flow with high velocity about 0 28 m s was concentrated near the inner banks for the second bend with high sinuosity θ 35 the flow with high velocity about 0 41 m s shift from the inner bank to the outer bank the discharge of the bend channel is about 80 m3 s and the average flow velocity is about 0 22 m s as indicated by garcia et al 2012 and wei et al 2016 the river bends were characterized by strong cross stream helicoidal flows caused by the centrifugal force which impels the water mass in the outward direction and causes transverse tilting of the water surface so that the flow with higher velocity from the channel center in a lateral direction toward the outer bank and vertically downward and the degree of helicity peaks downstream from the point of greatest channel curvature where near bed velocity gradients and bed shear stresses increase the results indicated that the sediment particle size was higher than others in these sampling sites including l1 l2 r1 r2 r3 and r4 which is in keep with the garcia et al 2012 and wei et al 2016 who attributed coarser grained sediments are deposited in the region with high velocity the measured velocity profile was in line with the hydrodynamics in the typical river bends in addition the cross sectional shape of the urban river bend was near symmetrical which differed from the cross sectional shape of the natural river bend garcia et al 2012 this is one of the characteristics of urban rivers where both river bank and bed were constructed by concrete with the intention to prevent erosion and to maintain stability considering the collective effects of primary flow and helicoidal flow the complex movement of water and sediment in urban river bends causes the redistribution of sediment heterogeneous sediments and different hydrodynamic properties together formed a variety of niches which may cause differences of the microbial community to explore the distribution patterns of the microbial community in urban river bends nmds was performed as shown in fig 2 a the sampling sites formed two clusters to further assess which factor caused this distribution pattern the environmental factors were added to nmds the results showed that the mps p 0 005 and d90 p 0 003 were the main driving factors to cause the different structure of the microbial community therefore it could be inferred that the complex hydrodynamics in urban river bends causes a redistribution of sediments by particle size which further changes the structure of the microbial community and causes the dissimilarity of microbial community to further confirm this inference the difference of sediment particle size across sampling sites was investigated the sediments with d50 larger than 40 μm were shown in r3 r4 r5 r6 l7 l8 and with smaller than 40 μm were shown in l3 l4 l5 l6 r7 and r8 it was found that sample grouping based on microbial community clustering was almost consistent with that based on sediments particle size distribution except l3 and r6 sampling sites due to grouping based on particle size distribution could show more consistent with the common understanding about bent channel the sampling sites were finally assigned into two groups named coarse sediment group r3 r4 r5 r6 l7 and l8 and fine sediment group l3 l4 l5 l6 r7 and r8 according to sediment particle size the l1 l2 r1 and r2 sampling sites were assigned into reference group due to these sampling sites belong to straight channel anosim testing was conducted to test the difference between microbial communities among these three groups the results showed that the microbial community differed significantly between the coarse sediment group and the fine sediment group p 0 015 however no significant differences were found between the reference group and either the coarse p 0 1964 or the fine sediment group p 0 404 mantel test and cca were performed to test the correlation between microbial community and environmental factors the mantel test indicated that mps p 0 028 d10 p 0 020 and d90 p 0 026 were significantly correlated with the microbial community composition these factors were selected to perform detrended correspondence analysis since the length of axis 1 exceeded 4 0 cca was performed using these significant environmental factors the results showed that d10 with the longest arrow had the strongest effects on microbial community composition in all sampling groups followed by d90 and mps fig 2b in addition the differences of sediment particle sizes between coarse and fine sediment groups were tested by kruskal wallis test the results showed that mps d50 and d90 significantly differed between fine and coarse sediment groups mrt analysis was also conducted as a second approach to corroborate the nmds cluster results as shown in fig 2c the mrt constructed from the data of the microbial community exhibited two splits and three levels the 16 samples were clustered into two groups by mps and the group with an mps less than 46 53 μm was split by nh4 n in water these results confirmed the hypothesis that the different sediment particle size was the main driving factor that caused difference in the structure of the microbial community 3 2 composition of the microbial community to further investigate the composition of the microbial community and their differences among three groups in urban river bends a series of statistical analyses were conducted first the microbial community richness and diversity indices were calculated and the results are provided in table s2 none of these indices showed any significant difference among the three groups which could be explained by the short distance of different sampling locations next the community composition at the phylum level was investigated to obtain general conclusions regarding community composition of urban river bends in total 33 bacterial phyla were obtained in the 16 sediment samples the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria which occupied 45 08 of the total bacterial sequences this was followed by chloroflexi bacteroidetes acidobacteria nitrospirae verrucomicrobia gemmatimonadetes actinobacteria firmicutes and nitrospinae which jointly accounted for 94 63 of the total bacterial sequences fig s5 both nitrospirae and nitrospinae are commonly observed in freshwater environments and are vital participants of the nitration transformation process jacob et al 2017 firmicutes is related to the ammonization of organic nitrogen indicating the potentially active nitrogen transformation processes in this area tai et al 2013 lefse was applied to determine highly differential taxonomy from phylum to order levels among samples from the coarse sediment group fine sediment group and reference group fig 3 a presents a cladogram showing the phylogenetic distribution of microbial lineages that were significantly associated lda value 2 with sediments from the coarse sediment fine sediment and reference group the corresponding lda values for each lineage are shown in fig 3b lefse analysis identified the microbial taxa that were mainly enriched in the coarse sediment group at the class level which included oxyphotobacteria fusobacteria saccharimonadales and erysiplotrichia in which erysipelotrichia belong to dominant phylum in fine sediment group the abundant difference taxa are nitrospira which belong to dominant phylum in reference group the abundant difference taxa are deltaproteobacteria bacteroidia dehalococcoidia leptospirae spirochaetia acetothermiia and caldisericia in which deltaproteobacteria bacteroidia and dehalococcoidia belong to dominant phylum the abundance of difference taxa may affect the nitrogen transformation in urban river bends according to the results of lefse sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium were enriched in coarse sediment previous studies demonstrated that sphingomonadaceae was present in nitrogen converting systems for both ammonium removal and denitrification świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 and cetobacterium had nitrate reduction activity tsuchiya et al 2008 nitrospira which were enriched in fine sediment may play a role in the nitrogen cycle by performing nitrite oxidation in the second step of nitrification when transforming nitrite to nitrate van kessel et al 2015 3 3 assembly of microbial community the microbial community composition was deemed to be controlled by various ecological processes including both deterministic processes and stochastic processes the βnti was based on a null model that factored out the influences of stochastic ecological processes such as organismal dispersal and ecological drift consequently it could provide a quantitative description of the ecological processes of the microbial community βnti 2 indicates that ecological selection pressures are consistent through time space which is termed homogenous selection resulting in low variation in the microbial composition βnti 2 indicated that ecological selection pressures changed through time space which is termed variable selection thus causing large shifts in microbiome composition βnti values between 2 and 2 indicated that the selective environment did not strongly determine differences or similarities between a given pair of microbiomes stegen et al 2013 therefore βnti was calculated and the results indicated that microbial community within each compartment of the urban river bend system were governed by homogeneous selection 79 2 followed by dispersal limitation 13 3 and ecological drift 7 5 to get deeper insights into the potential role of the environmental factors in deterministic processes which regulated the microbial community assembly pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were performed between each of the environmental factor changes and the βnti as shown in fig 4 a f changes of bv no3 n in water no3 n in sediment mps d10 and d90 were significantly correlated with the βnti the fitting curves of mps d10 d90 and no3 n in sediment formed slightly increasing straight lines these results indicated that as the difference in these environmental factors increased there was a transition in microbial community assembly processes from homogeneous selection to stochastic selection the fitting curve of bv and no3 n in water formed decreasing straight lines these results illustrated that as the change of bv and no3 n in water decreased indicating a transition of microbial community assembly processes from stochasticity to homogeneous selection in addition changes of t and tp in sediment were also significantly correlated with βnti and the fitting curves were nearly horizontal lines fig s6 these results indicated that the change of these environmental factors did not change ecological processes considering the effects of microbial community on particle size is rather slight atekwana et al 2006 it could be addressed that the sediment particle size affected the deterministic processes of the microbial community assembly and further influenced the composition of the microbial community the no3 n could change the microbial community composition by affecting deterministic processes however considering that the microbial community was deeply involved in nitrogen transformation in this urban river it can be inferred that the microbial community changes in response to deterministic processes in different regions of the river bends may have different effects on nitrogen transformation 3 4 microbial community influence on nitrogen transformation to address the effects of microbial community on nitrogen transformation different processes that affect the concentration of nitrogen in different forms including nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn in sediment had to be distinguished it is generally accepted that the concentration of nitrogen in the river sediment is affected by both physical processes and biochemical processes physical processes refer to the migration of nitrogen caused by water flow and sediment transport biochemical processes are mainly driven by the microbial community in the river due to the slight chemical transformation among different forms of nitrogen reisinger et al 2016 the concentration of different forms of nitrogen caused by physical processes could be simulated by a multiphase transport model moreover the measured concentration was the result of a combination of physical processes and biochemical processes therefore the effects of microbial community on the concentration of nitrogen in different forms could be calculated by subtracting the measured concentration from the simulated concentration the thus obtained value was defined as the concentration change caused by microbial community cmc if the cmc was positive the microbial community caused a decrease of nitrogen conversely if the cmc was negative it caused an increase of nitrogen as shown in fig 5 a the cmc of tn was positive in both coarse and fine sediments and the value in coarse sediment was significantly higher p 0 046 this illustrated that the microbial nitrogen removal existed in both coarse and fine sediments and the removal amount of tn was higher in coarse sediment furthermore the cmc of nitrogen in different form was investigated the cmc of nh4 n p 0 036 and no2 n p 0 04 were significantly different between coarse and fine sediment groups and the cmc of no3 n did not show a significant difference in coarse sediment nh4 n was transformed more than in fine sediment and more no2 n was generated than in fine sediment this could be associated with the taxa which could explain the differences between coarse and fine sediment groups identified by lefse the nitrification denitrification and nitrate reduction processes were accelerated in coarse sediment due to sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium these processes promoted the microbial nitrogen removal in coarse sediment which may contribute to the coupled nitrification denitrification the sediment particle size composition in the coarse sediment region could provide aerobic and anoxic niches for the processes greig et al 2007 as shown in fig s4 the peak of the distribution curve of coarse sediment occurred in larger particle sizes compared with fine sediment in addition nitrospira were enriched in fine sediment so that the cmc of no2 n in fine sediment was less than in coarse sediment 3 5 implications for aquatic environmental remediation and management in the reconstruction of urban rivers the trade off of river channel design bending or straightening needs to be weighed understanding the effects of different shapes of river channels on pollutant degradation rate and hydraulic capacity of urban rivers is necessary for an appropriate trade off the study provides insight into how bent channels change the microbial community structure by influencing the deterministic processes and how the changed microbial community affects nitrogen transformation the results suggest that the coarse sediment promoted microbial nitrogen removal compared with fine sediment due to the selection of sediment particle size the microbial community had more denitrification traits in coarse sediment this study showed that the sediment particle size composition in coarse sediment regions could provide specific niches for denitrification taxa in the river this finding should be considered in river remediation since it provides a theoretical basis for several river remediation techniques for example when the gabion box is used for river remediation the particle sizes of sand and gravel components could be designed to improve the capability of microbial nitrogen removal for constructed wetlands the microbial nitrogen removal capacity of constructed wetlands could also be improved by regulating the composition of sediment particle sizes many studies have demonstrated that the position and size of regions of coarse and fine sediments were highly dependent on the bend curvature clayton 2010 opdyke et al 2006 in this way the size of the coarse sediment region could be increased by changing the curvature of river bends with expanding coarse sediment region more nitrogen could be removed by microbial community due to the increased area of coarse sediment these effects enhance the capability of a river to remove nitrogen and provide a theoretical basis for an appropriate trade off between bent and straight river channels moreover it could be inferred that the capability of channels to degrade pollutants differed between bent and straight channels of urban rivers this difference should be considered when calculating the pollutant degradation rates and the water environmental capacity of urban rivers these results provide a significant reference for the development of discharge standards for water pollutants and river management 4 conclusion in this study both the distribution and assembly of microbial community in urban river bends were investigated furthermore nitrogen transformation processes were also investigated in the study region it was found that the structure of the microbial community differed significantly between coarse and fine sediment regions of urban river bends this biogeographic distribution was driven by bend induced sediment redistribution the homogeneous selection which accounts for 79 2 was the main ecological process in this study region and the βnti values were significantly correlated with the changes in sediment particle size and no3 n concentration the sediment particle size regulated the deterministic processes of microbial community assembly and imposed significant effects on nitrogen transformation coarse sediment regions of river bends benefit the nh4 n transformation and microbial nitrogen removal due to the presence of sphingomonadaceae and cetobacterium which were found to be enriched in this region as identified by lefse in contrast the second step of the nitrification process was promoted in fine sediment due to the high abundance of nitrospira in this region this study offers insight into the microbial community assembly and nitrogen transformation processes of urban river bends which not only provides a theoretic basis for the appropriate trade off between bent and straight rivers but could also guide river remediation and management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18268,the functional diversity of two planktonic functional compartments the nano microphytoplankton and the mesozooplankton was used in order to better understand i the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions ii the impacts of human control replenishment and human activities on the catchment basin urbanization and catchment basin size it was based on a monthly seasonal survey on 7 freshwater drained marshes both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton displayed high seasonal variations linked to the environmental fluctuations and human control on sea lock gates winter presented the lower biomasses of both compartments winter that is characterized by low water temperature low light availability and high flood is actually related to the dominance of tychopelagic phytoplankton and k strategists zooplankton spring and summer were characterized by i the succession of pelagic large cells small cells and then taxa with alternatives food strategies due to nitrogen limitation and phosphorous desorption from the sediment leading to eutrophication processes and ii the dominance of r strategists for mesozooplankton the artificial summer replenishment acts positively on water quality by decreasing the eutrophication processes since the nitrogen inputs limit the proliferation of phytoplankton mixotrophs and diazotrophs and increase the ecological efficiency during the warm period both small and large catchment basins may lead to summer eutrophication processes in drained marshes since the largest ones imply higher hydrodynamic features at the root of large inputs of nitrogen nutrient favoring the phytoplankton development while the smallest ones exhibit hypoxia problems due to high proliferation of macrophytes urbanized marshes are less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nutrient inputs from urban waste however they exhibited a lower ecological efficiency the results suggest that a better management of the hydrodynamics of such anthropogenic systems can avoid eutrophication risks on coastal areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords drained marshes functional diversity plankton human control eutrophication 1 introduction non tidal wetlands such as marshes provide several goods and services to human populations despite their low surface area at the global scale costanza et al 1997 water flow regulation waste treatment nutrient cycling moderation of disturbance and nursery services de groot et al 2012 mea 2005 nowadays preservation and restauration of such systems appear thus essential to provide more water of better quality in a context of increasing human population and activities industry agriculture on coastline as well as to prevent waste discharge to marine systems lotze et al 2006 lubchenco et al 1991 meybeck and helmer 1996 noges et al 2009 through history polderization such as drainage of wetlands for human uses has left few natural and pristine marshlands in such systems hydrodynamic flows are now controlled by human management drained marshes support a large range of anthropogenic activities like shellfish and fish farming agriculture water purification facilities and cattle husbandry while maintaining at least a part of wetlands regulating services e g ability to remove nitrate drained from culture soils on catchment basin tortajada et al 2011 however polder areas are particularly sensitives to climate change through storm floods events causing marine submersion and thus high risks for local economical activities and populations chaumillon et al 2017 in order to increase their resilience socio economic vulnerability of these areas support the idea of growing with the sea rather than fighting against it management policies that restore natural coastal processes along coastline letting natural and socio ecosystems interact more dynamically are thus more and more adopted by several countries cormier et al 2013 klein et al 1998 however country plannings lead to compromise states between natural coastal dynamic systems and artificial anthropogenic systems entirely protected by dutch dikes they must thus be done in accordance with the stakeholders to be both environmentally and economically acceptable klein et al 1998 in others words they should consider the better compromise between the profits that such systems provide through the human activities developed in and the services they may assure in more natural state in this context a better kwowledge of drained marshes functioning is essential to evaluate their ability to maintain ecological functions and thus related services to human in order to adapt their restauration in a context of sustainable development water quality in freshwater marshes in particular drained marshes have been poorly studied worldwide due to their high vicinity to terrestrial inputs and human activities they are even more sensitive to eutrophication than rivers and lakes due to water stagnation moreover catchment basins characterised by large agriculture areas may imply sulfate accumulation that may have consequences on the biogeochemical cycle of phosphorous correll 1998 lucassen et al 2004 schindler 1977 previous works performed on freshwater drained marshes want to propose several hypothesis about the drained marshes management they first showed that a higher water renewal through natural groundwater inputs or artificial replenishment by adjacent rivers during summer reduces the eutrophication processes moreover a high risk of eutrophication linked to the size of the catchment basin mainly dominated by agriculture is advanced tortajada et al 2011 finally highly urbanized marshes may also present such eutrophication risks through nutrients inputs by sewage discharges consequently these first results suggest that a better knowledge about the role of these several activities on such anthropo systems may provide a better management and thus limit the eutrophication risks on coastal areas tortajada et al 2011 suggested that a better understanding of the processes behind these risks should be performed by studying the structure of the planktonic food webs ecosystem functioning is actually driven by the species that are living in tilman et al 1997 worm et al 2006 and ecological functions and services are efficient especially as their biodiversity is high cardinale et al 2012 biodiversity plays actually a buffering role on the resilience of the ecological functions and services provided by the ecosystems to human worm et al 2006 moreover functional diversity may have a greater impact on ecosystem functioning than taxonomic diversity since the richness in functional roles may be a more powerful driver of the processes than the species richness downing and leibold 2002 tilman et al 1997 functional diversity studies consist in aggregating the overwhelmingly diversity of organisms into groups of species sharing similar trait expression mc gill et al 2006 the recent interest in functional diversity through the trait based approach is explained by its ability to explain the organization of ecological communities and species niches litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 however the methodological challenge is to find among the increasing availability of traits the ones available in the literature as well as the ones that best link communities to environment anderson 2005 dray et al 2014 kleyer et al 2012 the main objectives of this study are thus to use the functional diversity of two planktonic functional compartments the nano microphytoplankton phytoplankton of size 2 200 μm and the mesozooplankton zooplankton larger than 200 μm in order to better understand i the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions ii the impacts of human control replenishment and human activities on the catchment basin agriculture urbanization the several hypothesis proposed by tortajada et al 2011 were tested 1 higher nutrient inputs from the catchment basin or urbanized activities may limit the proliferation of diazotrophs and mixotrophs phytoplankton functional groups and thus favor the ecological efficiency ii lower nutrient inputs and higher stagnation of the water may favor the macrophytes development versus phytoplankton development 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the charente maritime marshes represent the second largest french wetland zone 100 000 ha 46 10 n 01 12 w figs 1 and 2 this transitional area between continent ocean and atmosphere exhibits a high diversity of drained marsh types with replenished and unreplenished drained marshes with anthropogenic uses such as agriculture or urbanization on their catchment basins drained freshwater marshes constitute artificial hydrographic networks of channels and ditches for all marshes human control on sea locks allows to prevent drying and flooding throughout the year moreover for some marshes a replenishment channel brings water from the charente river to drained marshes and prevents artificially drying during summer while groundwater may assure a natural form of a replenishment for certain marshes i e replenished drained marshes 2 2 sampling strategy the 7 stations were sampled monthly from february 2009 to february 2010 along a water renewal gradient on one hand one station corresponds to unreplenished drained marshes stations 7 fig 1 and six to replenished drained marshes with one natural replenishment station 6 on the other hand five station present an artificial replenishment from the charente river stations 20 and 21 36 39 and 40 the several sampling marshes presented different catchment basin surfaces with large culture areas that may influence their water quality large i e 4000ha for station 6 median about 2000ha for stations 7 21 and 40 and small i e 1500ha for 20 36 39 moreover the smallest catchment basins were characterized by a high proliferation of macrophytes mainly duckweeds especially during summer finally an important urbanization was present for the station 20 with urban constructions presenting water treatment plant or houseold sewage discharges the replenishment effect was analyzed by confronting the station 7 no replenishment vs the stations 21 40 with replenishment presenting a same catchment basin area median size and no urbanization at the vicinity the effect of the catchment basin size was studied by confronting 3 groups stations 6 large 21 40 median and 36 39 small which are replenished marshes with no urbanization at the vicinity finally the urbanization effect was analyzed by comparing stations 36 39 none urbanization at the vicinity versus station 20 high urbanization which are replenished marshes with small catchment basin areas fig 1 for each marsh samples were realized in the middle of the main channel of the network to avoid the edge effect for each station date 7 stations x 13

also estimated according to masclaux et al 2015 nitrates and nitrites concentrations were pooled as nox the ratio n p corresponding to the ratio no3 no2 nh4 po4 3 was also considered 2 2 2 particulate material suspended particulate matter spm as well as c and n elemental c n and isotopic δ13c and δ15n ratios of particulate organic matter pom were assessed according to savoye et al 2012 2 2 3 planktonic communities for each station date in situ water was prefiltrered on 200 μm chlorophyll a concentrations was used as an index of phytoplankton biomass phyto the latter were evaluated for three size classes of phytoplankton pico nano and microphytoplankton using fractioned filtration 200 μm prefiltrered water was successively filtered on a 20 μm polycarbonate filter microphytoplankton ph3 a 3 μm polycarbonate filter nanophytoplankton ph2 and then a gf f filters 0 7 μm picophytoplankton ph1 filters were analyzed as described according to masclaux et al 2015 triplicates were performed and averaged for each station date at least 100 ml filtered per replicate chlorophyll a concentrations were then converted into carbon via the carbon to chlorophyll a ratio for each size class c 50 chla banse 1977 and were expressed in percent of the total chlorophyll biomass according to references referred above the active chlorophyll a active chla was defined by the ratio chla chla pheo irigoien and castel 1997 for each station date three subsamples of heterotrophic prokaryots hp and picophytoplankton were estimated according to masclaux et al 2015 abundances were averaged for each station date and hp abundances were converted into carbon biomasses hp according to lee and fuhrman 1987 picophytoplankton were considered in order to consider all the biological compartments presents in the planktonic food web as well as hp and others environmental parameters protozoa diversity abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nano microphytoplankton were estimated by the uthermohl method and converted in biovolumes μm3 by applying standard geometric formulae to each taxon hillebrand et al 1999 according to masclaux et al 2015 cell carbon were computed per taxon functional groups with conversion factors of 0 19 and 0 15 pgc μm 3 for ciliates and nanoflagellates respectively sakka hlaili et al 2008 average abundances of each taxon functional groups allowed then to calculate the total carbon biomass of nano microzooplankton per station date microzoo moreover tychoplankton had been considered has as temporary plankton organism even if it may be also have a benthic status growing in the sediment mesozooplankton was sampled at 1 m depth with a portable pump based zooplankton sampler equipped with a microprocessor that controlled flow sensor for precise determination of the volume of water processed by the sampler nayar et al 2002 two hundred liters were pumped for each station date and retrieved on a 200 μm mesh size sieve mesozooplankton was fixed in 5 final concentration water buffered formalin and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible under a dissecting stereomicroscope 63 the determination and measurements were performed on 200 individuals per sample frontier 1972 conversion in carbon biomasses per taxon was performed according to masclaux et al 2015 and allowed to estimate the total mesozooplankton carbon biomasses mesozoo the ecological efficiency was used as an index of the efficiency with which the energy is transferred from the first to the last trophic level in the planktonic trophic pathway it was estimated as the ratio between mesozooplankton and total phytoplankton biomasses grami et al 2008 2 2 4 specific and functional diversity of planktonic compartments nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton compartments present both a high diversity of functional groups that allows them to adapt to several environmental conditions barnett et al 2007 litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 and a low lifespan that provides them a high reactivity to environmental changes of both climate and anthropogenic origins beaugrand 2005 david et al 2012 2 2 4 1 nano microphytoplankton 158 taxonomic units of nano microphytoplankton were observed among 7 taxonomic groups bacillariophyta chlorophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta haptophyta dinophyta euglena and cyanobacteria they were classified according to several functional traits based upon their availability to metazooplankton grazers and their resource acquisition both types of traits might traduce their relationships with others planktonic compartments involved in the planktonic trophic pathways as well as their life habitat litchman and klausmeier 2008 reynolds 2006 the cell biovolume and surface when counting each individual cell was measured using a calibrated ocular micrometer biovolumes μm3 and surfaces μm2 were estimated by applying standard geometric formulae to each taxon hillebrand et al 1999 morphological criteria the surface volume ratio and the maximum linear dimension s v proposed by alves de souza et al 2008 were also used as indices of the c s r strategies for phytoplankton reynolds 2006 reynolds et al 2002 cell shape algal shapes might influence the ingestion ability by zooplankters hartmann and kunkel 1991 spheroid and cuboidal unicells class 1 are easily ingested elongated cells class 2 are more difficult to orientate and thus loosely packed for ingestion while long filaments caused by colonial forms class 3 are really quite difficult to ingest each taxon was classified according to their shape in these three classes nitrogen fixation some cyanobacteria are able to use atmospheric nitrogen which represents a clear advantage when dissolved nitrogen is limited le quéré et al 2005 toxicity the potential toxicity of any taxonomic units mainly cyanobacteria was also considered reynolds 2006 trophy some photosynthetic algae show capacities to ingulf prey cells some dinoflagellates or chryptophytes or absorb selected dissolved organic compounds osmotrophy certain euglenophyta as a facultative or a typical life style which is also a clear advantage under low dissolved nutrient conditions reynolds 2006 each taxon was classified according to its feeding mode either autotrophy or potential mixotrophy life habitat each taxon was classified according to its tychopelagic pelagic or mixed life style environmental plasticity according to their salinity tolerance they were split into typical limnic species versus euryhaline species which present higher tolerance to brackish environment 2 2 4 2 mesozooplankton fifty one taxonomic units were observed among 6 taxonomic groups cladocera copepoda ostracoda rotifers larvae of benthic mollusks benthic decapods they were classified according to several functional traits based upon their life strategies r and k strategies their resource acquisition and their life habitat barnett et al 2007 litchman et al 2013 the mean size as each individual organism was measured using a calibrated ocular micrometer when counting they were split by taxon into three size classes small mean length 0 3 mm median 0 3 0 6 mm and large 0 6 mm according to barnett et al 2007 the maximum population growth according to literature was split in three classes high median and low barnett et al 2007 the fastest generation time fgt correspond to the time duration between 2 generations according to literature barnett et al 2007 it was also split in three classes high for about 1 day median for 0 8 1 days and low for 0 8 days this trait was combined with the reproduction mode since high fgt corresponded to taxa displaying only a sexual reproduction and low fgt exhibited both sexual and asexual reproduction two traits as qualitative factors traducing their diet plasticity with the food size range and the degree of selectivity of their preys small median and large for both traits barnett et al 2007 two traits were common with nano microphytoplanktonic functional traits and traduce their habitat the life habitat tychopelagic pelagic or mixed life style and the environmental plasticity limnic vs euryhaline with higher tolerance to brackish waters 2 3 data analysis for charactering the environmental context of the drained marshes two way analyses of variance anova were applied to assess the spatio temporal differences of all environmental parameters and ecological efficiency anova habitat season some parameters were previously log transformed to assess the applicability conditions rare species were excluded using the abundance sorting method adapted from ibañez et al 1993 for both phyto and mesozooplankton databases 54 units were kept i e 34 of the total taxonomic units for phytoplankton and 27 taxa i e 53 of the total taxonomic units for mesozooplankton david 2017 david et al 2012 this method is based on an index mixing species abundances and frequencies retaining only the frequent and locally abundant taxa at least at one station date david 2017 for both compartments we used several traits proposed in the literature and described above barnett et al 2007 litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 and the omi gam coupled with the witomi methodological approaches to select the most appropriate traits to relate communities to environment karasiewicz et al 2017 kleyer et al 2012 the outlying mean index omi analysis was performed for the overall data 7 stations 13 months considering all the abiotic factors the parameters describing pom quantity quality and the planktonic communities described above this analysis allowed to determine taxa niche positions and breadths it was conducted for each database independently phytoplankton 54 taxa and mesozooplankton 27 taxa doledec et al 2000 moreover subniches or habitat estimations were conducted according to karasiewicz et al 2017 considering the 6 subsets reported in fig 1 in order to analyze the effect of resplenishment catchment basin size and urbanization taxa subniche dynamics were estimated by comparing marginality witomig and tolerance to the origin low witomig traducing a preference of the taxa for one habitat moreover the subniche parameters to the subset mean habitat conditions used by one taxa witomigk and tolerance k highlighted the taxa distribution within the subset habitat conditions low witomigk traducing a more common habitat for the taxa moreover the realized niche for each habitat was calculated as the percentage of the polygon area occupied by the group in the plane axis 2 vs axis 1 of the omi according to the total area occupied by each habitat the statistical significance of omi witomig witomigk and environmental parameters between subniches were tested by monte carlo permutation procedure with 10000 permutations doledec et al 2000 karasiewicz et al 2017 for each omi omi phytoplankton and omi mesozooplankton the taxa scores on the first two axes were used as response variables in generalized additive models gams with functional traits as explanatory variables kleyer et al 2012 multimodal inference based on all subsets selection of gams was used per axis and the best gam were obtained by using the akaike information criterion functional groups of taxa were obtained using a ward s hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distances between taxa predicted values from inference based gams on the first two omi axis the optimal number of functional groups was determined via the calinsky and harabasz index these functional groups were then brought face to face to their position relatively to the first omi axes and their related environmental parameters taxonomic richness shannon wiener diversity and pielou evenness were used to assess the structural diversity while functional richness evenness dispersion and divergence were calculated based on the functional traits highlighted by the omi gam to analyze the functional diversity per station date laliberte and legendre 2010 villéger et al 2008 one way generalized linear models glms were used for testing the relationships of the total biomasses and the several taxonomic and functional diversity indices between season or habitat for both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton two ways generalized linear models were used for testing the relationships of abundances specific richness witomig tolerance witomigk tolerance k realized niche percentage between functional groups and season or habitat glm functional groups season or glm functional groups habitat gaussian link functions were used for quantitative indices while poisson link function were applied for taxonomic and functional richness residuals normality and variance homogeneity were previously tested for each model abundances were log transformed in order to fit these applicability conditions all tests were performed with the r software r core team 2014 using the libraries subniche vegan ggplot2 and gam 3 results 3 1

and seasonal variations in drained marshes both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton displayed high seasonal variations linked to the environmental fluctuations these results are in accordance with those obtained for water quality for which most of the parameters presented some significant seasonal fluctuations in the same freshwater drained marshes as demonstrated by tortajada et al 2011 winter was characterized by a low biological activity with the lowest biomasses of all the planktonic compartments heterotrophic procaryots phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton while summer was marked by the highest biomasses winter period is actually not suitable to primary production due to temperature and probably to light limitation as suggested by masclaux et al 2015 however poc chla ratio presented a ratio of about 250 as most of the year data not shown traducing the large even not totally dominant part of the phytoplankton in the pom composition however pom δ13c exhibited their lowest values confirming the importance of terrestrial material mixed with freshwater microalgae in the pom composition at this season as highlighted by savoye et al 2003 2012 nano microphytoplankton was marked by a high contribution of large tychopelagic cells which may be due to high hydrodynamic features as demonstrated by guarini et al 2004b and david et al 2016 moreover cryptophytes and tychopelagic diatoms are dominant at this season to the detriment of chlorophytes confirming resuspension processes the latter taxonomic groups being less favored in turbulent environment cañavate et al 2016 ramade 2008 what s more nox and po4 3 displayed actually their highest values during winter the sea lock gates are actually opened to evacuate the surplus water coming from the catchment basin drained marshes are thus characterized by running water that probably exerted an erosive action on the sediment that may explain tychoplankton resuspension de jonge and van beusekom 1995 and high inputs of nutrients drained from the culture soils as demonstrated by tortajada et al 2011 none information is available in our systems about a possible atmospheric nitrogen inputs that may play an additional source of nutrients for phytoplankton especially in others urban systems suggested by peng et al 2019 however according to our knowledge the main anthropogenic activities are provided by wastewater treatment plant and those providing from private dwelling leaching or soil leaching a few industrial activities are present on the catchment basin on the other hand mesozooplankton was dominated by tychopelagic k strategists that are actually more competitive in cooler environment than r strategists for which faster growth and high turnover is favored by warmer conditions david et al 2016b elliott and whitfield 2011 jerling and wooldridge 1991 litchman et al 2013 this confirms the high contribution of tychopelagic species due to resuspension and thus the high benthos pelagos coupling at this season the decreasing temperature and the increasing precipitation at the fall period lead to the human action such as the opening of the sea lock gates this implies a running water that seems to contribute to the decrease of the taxa with alternative food diet hydrodynamic features may lead to a more detritical environment as testified by the highest value of poc chla ratio data not shown that may be explained by the degradation of the accumulated pom according to savoye et al 2003 drained marshes insure the ability to remove nitrate drained from culture soils on catchment basin since the winter nox concentrations brought from the catchment basin was reduced by 99 as it was highlighted by tortajada et al 2011 however eutrophication is marked during summer and may lead to hypoxia lowest o2 saturation and potential toxic environment actually cyanobacteria may produce toxins karjalainen et al 2007 and protease inhibitors that limit their digestibility and may affect the higher trophic levels agrawal et al 2001 no significant differences were highlighted concerning functional richness and divergence for both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton traducing a coexistence of the several functional groups over the seasonal cycle probably due to the high food availability as suggested by hillerislambers et al 2012 each group may find a favorable environment even if competition participate to the dominance of one or other according to the seasonal period 4 2 impact of human activities 4 2 1 summer replenishment the effect of artificial summer resplenishment from the adjacent charente river was performed considering non urbanized marshes displaying the same size of catchment basin this human action is an additional management on marshes allowing to maintain a sufficient stock of water to prevent the drying up of small channels and supplies both cattle husbandry and local maize culture occupying until 70 of the catchment basin area the water level decreases actually of some centimeters per day during summer for unresplenished marshes our data showed that replenishment decreases drastically the summer eutrophication this results confirm the typology of tortajada et al 2011 that highlighted an increasing eutrophication with a decreasing replenishment moreover dembowska and napiórkowski 2015 suggested that replenishment had already been described as a structuring factor for phytoplankton phytoplankton biomasses were actually lower for replenished than for unreplenished marshes when the sea lock gates are closed and the replenishment active from the end of spring to the beginning of fall during summer replenished marshes are characterized by smaller biomasses of small pelagic autotrophs and mixotrophs n2 fixators however the biological trait motility would have been interesting to consider for such system motile species could have been favored by running water during summer pom quantity microzooplankton and hp accumulation are also less pronounced in replenished waters during summer as it was highlighted by masclaux et al 2015 this traduces a lower n nutrient limitation for replenished marshes nox displayed higher concentrations in replenished compared to unreplenished marshes during spring and summer since it is brought by the charente river moreover small tychopelagic cells displayed higher biomasses for replenished marshes probably due to the higher hydrodynamics all the year due to the running water induced by the connection with the river favoring tychopelagic resuspension guarini et al 2004a the connection with the river all year round may limit water stagnation phosphorous release and thus eutrophication processes in replenished marshes the nitrogen nutrient limitation explained the fact that mixotrophs and n2 fixators displayed higher biomasses for unreplenished marshes their tolerance to n nutrient limitation is largest in the latter marshes compared with the others functional groups since they are more adapted to such environment than the others functional groups moreover water stagnation and high temperature favor the proliferation of mixotrophic dinoflagellates for unreplenished marshes as suggested by litchman et al 2012 the higher functional divergence recorded for these systems may thus be explained by the higher contribution of mixotrophs n2 fixators during the summer period in contrast with replenished marshes contrasting with the lower phytoplankton biomass zooplankton biomasses displayed higher biomasses richness and dispersion for replenished marshes with a higher contribution of all functional groups except tychopelagic k strategists notably from spring to fall this may be explained by the low nutritive quality or even toxicity that may exhibit certain phytoplankton taxa favored during the eutrophication processes that are larger for unresplenished marshes and may affect the higher trophic levels agrawal et al 2001 this higher zooplankton biomasses contrasting with the lower phytoplankton biomasses might thus explain the higher ecological efficiency observed for replenished waters 4 2 2 catchment basin size agriculture effect the comparison between non urbanized and replenished marshes of different catchment basin size report the effect of agriculture on water quality and plankton diversity the largest catchment basin displayed the largest area of agriculture 4700ha and 2000 with 72 of agriculture occupation for station 6 and 20 respectively compared with the smallest catchment basin size 900ha 37 40 small catchment basin with lower agriculture activity implied a lower quantity of nox brought during winter and explained thus the lower biomasses of nano microphytoplankton all year round even if lower inputs of wintering nox in small catchment basin should prevent the development of small pelagic taxa such as organisms with alternative food ressources mixotrophs and n2 fixators the latter functional groups did not displayed significant lower biomasses in contrast hypoxia periods lowest o2 saturation are more recurrent moreover tychopelagic phytoplankton taxa are also disfavored for small catchment basin probably due to the lower hydrodynamics features compared to marshes with large catchment basin a larger water volume is actually condensed in small channels favoring microphytobenthos resuspension during winter as suggested above the lower hydrodynamics features as well the lower nutrient inputs lead to the development of macrophytes that are actually more competitive than phytoplankton in nutrient limited environment as demonstrated by sand jensen and borum 1991 in contrast bronmark and weisner 1992 suggested that high hydrodynamics features in marshes with large catchment basin may favor phytoplankton development from the beginning of the spring and may prevent macrophytes development aquatic macrophytes play an important role in structuring communities in aquatic environments increase habitat complexity and heterogeneity and may provide food sources for various organisms like invertebrates fishes and waterbirds thomaz and cunha 2010 there are also known to greatly participate to heavy metal remediation abdallah 2012 however our systems are dominated by free leaved macrophytes at the surface of the water column mainly duckweeds janse and van puijenbroek 1998 suggested that a high cover of free floating plant may implies anoxic conditions that have a negative effect on freshwater ecosystems reducing animal biomasses and diversity moreover they are primacy for light in contrast chambers et al 1989 highlighted that rooted submerged macrophytes use a large part of their nutrient need from the sediment while the presence of submerged macrophytes usually implies low plankton biomasses and low eutrophication in ponds mukhopadhyay and dewanji 2004 consequently free leaving plants out compete submerged macrophytes due to light availability and cause a nutrient and light depletion in the water column that may cause eutrophication processes and lower plankton biomasses notably during summer period parr and mason 2004 scheffer et al 2003 consequently even if largest catchment basin and thus higher agriculture activity may lead to summer eutrophication processes since they imply higher nox and pom concentrations as reported by tortajada et al 2011 small catchment basin also presented eutrophication processes with higher hypoxia problems due to a high proliferation of free living plants at the surface of the water that limits light availability and favors mixotrophs n2 fixators during summer even if no significant differences in biomasses were highlighted zooplankton exhibited a lower taxonomic richness for marshes with small catchment basin characterized by large covers of duckweeds some taxa such as copepods and cladocerans seems to be disfavored in such habitat previous works showed actually that copepods may be disfavored by low oxygen concentrations appeltans et al 2003 mialet et al 2011 and that cladocerans abundances are mainly related to chla de los rios and soto 2007 mialet et al 2011 this habitat displayed lower phytoplankton however due to the lowest phytoplankton biomasses the marshes displaying the smallest catchment basin exhibited the lowest ecological efficiency and thus less food at least for higher trophic levels based on the planktonic trophic pathways 4 2 3 urbanization the comparison between urbanized and non urbanized replenished marshes with small catchment basin report the effect of the presence of water purification facilities on the marsh as well as leaching water from housing mcclelland and valiela 1998 suggest that the higher pom δ15n exhibited in urbanized marshes traduced the clear influence of urban waste in such habitat even though the lower contribution of n2 fixators during summer may also contributed to these high values no differences were observed for plankton biomasses between the two kinds of marshes contrasting with others studies that report a decreasing biomass when urbanization is present kentzer et al 2010 murakami and inoue kohama 2016 in contrast urbanized marshes exhibited a higher contribution of small pelagic autotrophs and a lower contribution of organisms characterized by alternative food sources mixotrophy n2 fixation this may be explained by the largest concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 that are released from water purification facilities or leaching waters that prevent nutrient limitations oxygen depletion is thus lower during summer due to these lowest heterotrophic taxa contribution moreover zooplankton assemblage was marked by a lower biomass of k strategists in favor of r strategists in particular rotifers and cladocerans cladocerans are actually mainly related to chla concentrations biomasses as suggested by de los rios and soto 2007 and mialet et al 2011 and may be thus favored by the highest contribution of small pelagic autotrophs during summer versus mixotrophs in our systems moreover rotifers especially brachonius that dominated during summer exhibited low selectivity on small preys in contrast with the k strategists copepods that are generally more opportunists according to the review of barnett et al 2007 cladocerans and rotifers may thus present asexual reproduction in this favorable nutritive environment that confer them higher growth rates and thus a higher competitivity than k strategists in urbanized marshes as proposed by litchman et al 2013 finally urbanized marshes are thus less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nitrogen nutrient inputs from urban waste that prevent the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators however they exhibited a lower ecological efficiency and thus less available food for the higher trophic levels 4 3 inputs of a functional approach on the drained marshes functioning the functional diversity approach complete greatly the knowledge about the functioning of such systems in aggregating the overwhelmingly diversity of organisms into groups of species sharing similar functions as suggested by mc gill et al 2006 this approach underlines the pelagic coupling during winter while the rest of the seasonal cycle was marked by an autochthonous pelagic production it also brings information about the mechanisms behind the functioning of these systems due to nutrients limitation with the demonstration of a seasonal succession of large small pelagic autotrophs and then small pelagic with alternative nutrition mode mixotrophy and n2 fixation the latter may provide toxic and unsuitable food for higher trophic levels decreasing thus the ecological efficiency during the warming periods finally it is informative on the process of competition between macrophytes and phytoplankton the former been more favored in less nutrient and hydrodynamics environment the results highlight thus the powerful of the trait based approach to understand both the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions as well as the impacts of man control and human activities on the catchment basin previous works have actually prove its efficiency to explore the organization of ecological communities and species niches for plankton compartments even though the difficulties related to the bibliographic synthesis necessary to compile the traits for all species and the data treatment methodology breton et al 2017 david et al 2012 kruk et al 2002 the combination between the omi gam proposed by kleyer et al 2012 and witomi analysis by karasiewicz et al 2017 has been particularly powerful in this work the former allowed to find among the available traits the ones that best linked communities to environment and to determine functional groups kleyer et al 2012 while the latter provide interpretations on niche dynamic by considering the several drained marshes as different habitat conditions karasiewicz et al 2017 for nano microphytoplankton it was not surprising that size and trophy traits were significant functional features in relating communities to environmental conditions both kind of traits are actually a way to adapt to nutrient limitation through the surface biovolume ratio allowing small cells to better absorb nutrients in the case of a n p desequilibrium and through a mixotrophs or n2 fixation nutrition mode when complete depletion of them the high seasonal fluctuations of nutrients until complete depletion drive thus the functional assemblage of phytoplankton in drained marshes concerning mesozooplankton growth rates and fastest generation time related to reproduction modes were significant traits explaining the assemblages in drained marshes the functional groups obtained was related to the r and k life strategies proposed for these organisms by the litchman model litchman et al 2013 adapted from the mcarthur and wilson theory macarthur and wilson 1967 r strategists presented high growth rates with the ability of asexual reproduction when environmental conditions are favorable and are characterized by a low energetic investment for defense and offspring protection in contrast k strategists displayed low growth rates with only sexual reproduction and a great energetic investment for defense and offspring protection even if r strategists are in theory less able to select their preys than k strategists the trait concerning food selectivity were not significant in our results in contrast r strategists cladocerans and rotifers seemed favored by a certain food environment high phytoplankton biomasses contrary to k strategists which were more dependent of abiotic environment for both compartments life habitat was a significant functional trait related to the omi niche the hydrodynamics play actually a great role in plankton communities with high resuspension of tychopelagic forms during flood time 4 4 how to perform such preliminary results the most marshes of the world and specially in europe are affected by human activity such as artificial replenishment urbanization and catchment basin size however a fewworks report the impact of human actions the latter on plankton communities in relation with their impacts on planktonic communities this work reports two functional approach but independently for nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton in this case is very difficult to analyze the processes between the two compartments however some traits used in this study provide several indications to make any assumptions about them for nano microphytoplankton cell shape and biovolume as well as potential toxicity may influence their ingestion availability for zooplankters concerning zooplankton k versus r strategists deduced according to several traits may condition their availability to adapt to several kind of food in that case some assumption could be made about the potential top down and bottom up control among the several planktonic pathways and thus about the impact of anthropogenic action within such pathways for example small catchment basin and unreplenished marshes during summer may imply the development of small phytoplankton even toxic or indigestible preys to zooplankton and thus bottom up effect however the result of ecological efficiency are not so clear our study is not enough in depth to explore such processes even if functional approach includes usually both ecological habitat preference related to abiotic tolerance or biotic interactions and biological e g life history physiological behavioral or morphological features traits wu et al 2017 only the latter type of traits were considered in this paper moreover some of the biological traits such as the motility were not taken into account this was due to the lack of information about the former kind of functional traits for a lot of species and could explain the part of unexplained deviance concerning the gam on the two first axis revealed by the omi analysis for both nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton in addition it would have been interesting to access to i a larger number of sampling marshes for each kind of habitat and ii to reproduce this work several years interannual survey in order to confirm the results coastal systems are usually more marked by seasonal rather than interannual fluctuations of plankton communities and water quality david et al 2005 tortajada et al 2011 however this was not practicable due to the heaveness of this work considering all the parameters that were sampled both cost and time consuming nevertheless the present study revealed novelty and interesting information about the seasonal and anthropogenic impacts on plankton communities in drained marshes 5 conclusions in a context in which polder areas are particularly sensitives to climate change through storm floods events causing marine submersion and thus high risks for local economical activities and populations a better understanding of how socio economic vulnerability of these areas support the idea of growing with the sea rather than fighting against it to increase their resilience however this implies a better knowledge of how human impacts act on such systems e g drained marshes the artificial summer replenishment which represents an additional man control on drained marshes acts positively on water quality i by decreasing the eutrophication processes by assuring a recurrent input of nitrogen nutrient preventing the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators ii by increasing the ecological efficiency during the warmer period providing largest food for the higher trophic levels based on the planktonic trophic pathways both small and large catchment basins may lead to summer eutrophication processes since the largest ones imply higher nutrients and pom concentrations and the smallest ones exhibit hypoxia problems due to higher proliferation of free floating macrophytes however the large catchment basin displayed lower ecological efficiency and thus less food for the higher trophic levels moreover the latter may also cause harmful effects due to higher pesticides inputs urbanized marshes are less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nitrogen nutrient inputs from urban waste which prevent the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators but exhibited a lower ecological efficiency and thus less available food for the higher trophic levels nevertheless urban sewage inputs may also be a source of contaminant for coastal waters such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the several tools used in this analysis doubtless complete the informations provided by the works deployed on the protocols recommended by the water quality evaluation system wqes for the european water framework directive this was suggested by previous results concerning the spatio temporal fluctuations of drained marshes functioning and the effect of the several human activities they confirm that a better management of the hydrodynamics of such anthropogenic systems submitted to diverse human controls i e replenishment and several levels of human impact according to its activity on the catchment basin agriculture urbanization occupation can prevent eutrophication risks on coastal areas this should be taken in consideration in a growing with the sea policies in order to maintain ecological functions and related services and thus adapt their restauration in a context of sustainable development preventing the eutrophication linked to po4 3 desorption from the sediment during summer is a challenge for the management of such anthropo system several strategies necessitate human actions while decreasing the n p ratio from the water purification installation or dragging sediment that is charged in nutrient are realists others solutions such as adding aluminium sulfates to increase the phosphate adsorption restoring the macrophytes cover or introducing phytoplanktonophage fishes are more dangerous for the autochtonous species and the ecosystem functioning aluminium sulfate may be harmful for the sediment biogeochemistry and the introduction of non native species may disturb the ecosystem functioning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper aknowledment this study was performed by the personal of the university of bordeaux the university of la rochelle as well as the union des marais de charente maritime by

18268,the functional diversity of two planktonic functional compartments the nano microphytoplankton and the mesozooplankton was used in order to better understand i the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions ii the impacts of human control replenishment and human activities on the catchment basin urbanization and catchment basin size it was based on a monthly seasonal survey on 7 freshwater drained marshes both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton displayed high seasonal variations linked to the environmental fluctuations and human control on sea lock gates winter presented the lower biomasses of both compartments winter that is characterized by low water temperature low light availability and high flood is actually related to the dominance of tychopelagic phytoplankton and k strategists zooplankton spring and summer were characterized by i the succession of pelagic large cells small cells and then taxa with alternatives food strategies due to nitrogen limitation and phosphorous desorption from the sediment leading to eutrophication processes and ii the dominance of r strategists for mesozooplankton the artificial summer replenishment acts positively on water quality by decreasing the eutrophication processes since the nitrogen inputs limit the proliferation of phytoplankton mixotrophs and diazotrophs and increase the ecological efficiency during the warm period both small and large catchment basins may lead to summer eutrophication processes in drained marshes since the largest ones imply higher hydrodynamic features at the root of large inputs of nitrogen nutrient favoring the phytoplankton development while the smallest ones exhibit hypoxia problems due to high proliferation of macrophytes urbanized marshes are less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nutrient inputs from urban waste however they exhibited a lower ecological efficiency the results suggest that a better management of the hydrodynamics of such anthropogenic systems can avoid eutrophication risks on coastal areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords drained marshes functional diversity plankton human control eutrophication 1 introduction non tidal wetlands such as marshes provide several goods and services to human populations despite their low surface area at the global scale costanza et al 1997 water flow regulation waste treatment nutrient cycling moderation of disturbance and nursery services de groot et al 2012 mea 2005 nowadays preservation and restauration of such systems appear thus essential to provide more water of better quality in a context of increasing human population and activities industry agriculture on coastline as well as to prevent waste discharge to marine systems lotze et al 2006 lubchenco et al 1991 meybeck and helmer 1996 noges et al 2009 through history polderization such as drainage of wetlands for human uses has left few natural and pristine marshlands in such systems hydrodynamic flows are now controlled by human management drained marshes support a large range of anthropogenic activities like shellfish and fish farming agriculture water purification facilities and cattle husbandry while maintaining at least a part of wetlands regulating services e g ability to remove nitrate drained from culture soils on catchment basin tortajada et al 2011 however polder areas are particularly sensitives to climate change through storm floods events causing marine submersion and thus high risks for local economical activities and populations chaumillon et al 2017 in order to increase their resilience socio economic vulnerability of these areas support the idea of growing with the sea rather than fighting against it management policies that restore natural coastal processes along coastline letting natural and socio ecosystems interact more dynamically are thus more and more adopted by several countries cormier et al 2013 klein et al 1998 however country plannings lead to compromise states between natural coastal dynamic systems and artificial anthropogenic systems entirely protected by dutch dikes they must thus be done in accordance with the stakeholders to be both environmentally and economically acceptable klein et al 1998 in others words they should consider the better compromise between the profits that such systems provide through the human activities developed in and the services they may assure in more natural state in this context a better kwowledge of drained marshes functioning is essential to evaluate their ability to maintain ecological functions and thus related services to human in order to adapt their restauration in a context of sustainable development water quality in freshwater marshes in particular drained marshes have been poorly studied worldwide due to their high vicinity to terrestrial inputs and human activities they are even more sensitive to eutrophication than rivers and lakes due to water stagnation moreover catchment basins characterised by large agriculture areas may imply sulfate accumulation that may have consequences on the biogeochemical cycle of phosphorous correll 1998 lucassen et al 2004 schindler 1977 previous works performed on freshwater drained marshes want to propose several hypothesis about the drained marshes management they first showed that a higher water renewal through natural groundwater inputs or artificial replenishment by adjacent rivers during summer reduces the eutrophication processes moreover a high risk of eutrophication linked to the size of the catchment basin mainly dominated by agriculture is advanced tortajada et al 2011 finally highly urbanized marshes may also present such eutrophication risks through nutrients inputs by sewage discharges consequently these first results suggest that a better knowledge about the role of these several activities on such anthropo systems may provide a better management and thus limit the eutrophication risks on coastal areas tortajada et al 2011 suggested that a better understanding of the processes behind these risks should be performed by studying the structure of the planktonic food webs ecosystem functioning is actually driven by the species that are living in tilman et al 1997 worm et al 2006 and ecological functions and services are efficient especially as their biodiversity is high cardinale et al 2012 biodiversity plays actually a buffering role on the resilience of the ecological functions and services provided by the ecosystems to human worm et al 2006 moreover functional diversity may have a greater impact on ecosystem functioning than taxonomic diversity since the richness in functional roles may be a more powerful driver of the processes than the species richness downing and leibold 2002 tilman et al 1997 functional diversity studies consist in aggregating the overwhelmingly diversity of organisms into groups of species sharing similar trait expression mc gill et al 2006 the recent interest in functional diversity through the trait based approach is explained by its ability to explain the organization of ecological communities and species niches litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 however the methodological challenge is to find among the increasing availability of traits the ones available in the literature as well as the ones that best link communities to environment anderson 2005 dray et al 2014 kleyer et al 2012 the main objectives of this study are thus to use the functional diversity of two planktonic functional compartments the nano microphytoplankton phytoplankton of size 2 200 μm and the mesozooplankton zooplankton larger than 200 μm in order to better understand i the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions ii the impacts of human control replenishment and human activities on the catchment basin agriculture urbanization the several hypothesis proposed by tortajada et al 2011 were tested 1 higher nutrient inputs from the catchment basin or urbanized activities may limit the proliferation of diazotrophs and mixotrophs phytoplankton functional groups and thus favor the ecological efficiency ii lower nutrient inputs and higher stagnation of the water may favor the macrophytes development versus phytoplankton development 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the charente maritime marshes represent the second largest french wetland zone 100 000 ha 46 10 n 01 12 w figs 1 and 2 this transitional area between continent ocean and atmosphere exhibits a high diversity of drained marsh types with replenished and unreplenished drained marshes with anthropogenic uses such as agriculture or urbanization on their catchment basins drained freshwater marshes constitute artificial hydrographic networks of channels and ditches for all marshes human control on sea locks allows to prevent drying and flooding throughout the year moreover for some marshes a replenishment channel brings water from the charente river to drained marshes and prevents artificially drying during summer while groundwater may assure a natural form of a replenishment for certain marshes i e replenished drained marshes 2 2 sampling strategy the 7 stations were sampled monthly from february 2009 to february 2010 along a water renewal gradient on one hand one station corresponds to unreplenished drained marshes stations 7 fig 1 and six to replenished drained marshes with one natural replenishment station 6 on the other hand five station present an artificial replenishment from the charente river stations 20 and 21 36 39 and 40 the several sampling marshes presented different catchment basin surfaces with large culture areas that may influence their water quality large i e 4000ha for station 6 median about 2000ha for stations 7 21 and 40 and small i e 1500ha for 20 36 39 moreover the smallest catchment basins were characterized by a high proliferation of macrophytes mainly duckweeds especially during summer finally an important urbanization was present for the station 20 with urban constructions presenting water treatment plant or houseold sewage discharges the replenishment effect was analyzed by confronting the station 7 no replenishment vs the stations 21 40 with replenishment presenting a same catchment basin area median size and no urbanization at the vicinity the effect of the catchment basin size was studied by confronting 3 groups stations 6 large 21 40 median and 36 39 small which are replenished marshes with no urbanization at the vicinity finally the urbanization effect was analyzed by comparing stations 36 39 none urbanization at the vicinity versus station 20 high urbanization which are replenished marshes with small catchment basin areas fig 1 for each marsh samples were realized in the middle of the main channel of the network to avoid the edge effect for each station date 7 stations x 13 months several physico chemical and biological parameters were sampled the four seasons were determined considering the calendar information winter spring summer and fall as well as the period of sea lock gates closing controlled by the stakeholders usually between spring and summer 2 2 1 abiotic parameters at each station date conductivity cond water temperature twater ph and dissolved oxygen were evaluated in situ with a probe wtw cellox325 3 it should be noted that dissolved oxygen is expressed in relatively to the oxygen saturation throughout the manuscript nutrients concentrations were also estimated according to masclaux et al 2015 nitrates and nitrites concentrations were pooled as nox the ratio n p corresponding to the ratio no3 no2 nh4 po4 3 was also considered 2 2 2 particulate material suspended particulate matter spm as well as c and n elemental c n and isotopic δ13c and δ15n ratios of particulate organic matter pom were assessed according to savoye et al 2012 2 2 3 planktonic communities for each station date in situ water was prefiltrered on 200 μm chlorophyll a concentrations was used as an index of phytoplankton biomass phyto the latter were evaluated for three size classes of phytoplankton pico nano and microphytoplankton using fractioned filtration 200 μm prefiltrered water was successively filtered on a 20 μm polycarbonate filter microphytoplankton ph3 a 3 μm polycarbonate filter nanophytoplankton ph2 and then a gf f filters 0 7 μm picophytoplankton ph1 filters were analyzed as described according to masclaux et al 2015 triplicates were performed and averaged for each station date at least 100 ml filtered per replicate chlorophyll a concentrations were then converted into carbon via the carbon to chlorophyll a ratio for each size class c 50 chla banse 1977 and were expressed in percent of the total chlorophyll biomass according to references referred above the active chlorophyll a active chla was defined by the ratio chla chla pheo irigoien and castel 1997 for each station date three subsamples of heterotrophic prokaryots hp and picophytoplankton were estimated according to masclaux et al 2015 abundances were averaged for each station date and hp abundances were converted into carbon biomasses hp according to lee and fuhrman 1987 picophytoplankton were considered in order to consider all the biological compartments presents in the planktonic food web as well as hp and others environmental parameters protozoa diversity abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and nano microphytoplankton were estimated by the uthermohl method and converted in biovolumes μm3 by applying standard geometric formulae to each taxon hillebrand et al 1999 according to masclaux et al 2015 cell carbon were computed per taxon functional groups with conversion factors of 0 19 and 0 15 pgc μm 3 for ciliates and nanoflagellates respectively sakka hlaili et al 2008 average abundances of each taxon functional groups allowed then to calculate the total carbon biomass of nano microzooplankton per station date microzoo moreover tychoplankton had been considered has as temporary plankton organism even if it may be also have a benthic status growing in the sediment mesozooplankton was sampled at 1 m depth with a portable pump based zooplankton sampler equipped with a microprocessor that controlled flow sensor for precise determination of the volume of water processed by the sampler nayar et al 2002 two hundred liters were pumped for each station date and retrieved on a 200 μm mesh size sieve mesozooplankton was fixed in 5 final concentration water buffered formalin and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible under a dissecting stereomicroscope 63 the determination and measurements were performed on 200 individuals per sample frontier 1972 conversion in carbon biomasses per taxon was performed according to masclaux et al 2015 and allowed to estimate the total mesozooplankton carbon biomasses mesozoo the ecological efficiency was used as an index of the efficiency with which the energy is transferred from the first to the last trophic level in the planktonic trophic pathway it was estimated as the ratio between mesozooplankton and total phytoplankton biomasses grami et al 2008 2 2 4 specific and functional diversity of planktonic compartments nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton compartments present both a high diversity of functional groups that allows them to adapt to several environmental conditions barnett et al 2007 litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 and a low lifespan that provides them a high reactivity to environmental changes of both climate and anthropogenic origins beaugrand 2005 david et al 2012 2 2 4 1 nano microphytoplankton 158 taxonomic units of nano microphytoplankton were observed among 7 taxonomic groups bacillariophyta chlorophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta haptophyta dinophyta euglena and cyanobacteria they were classified according to several functional traits based upon their availability to metazooplankton grazers and their resource acquisition both types of traits might traduce their relationships with others planktonic compartments involved in the planktonic trophic pathways as well as their life habitat litchman and klausmeier 2008 reynolds 2006 the cell biovolume and surface when counting each individual cell was measured using a calibrated ocular micrometer biovolumes μm3 and surfaces μm2 were estimated by applying standard geometric formulae to each taxon hillebrand et al 1999 morphological criteria the surface volume ratio and the maximum linear dimension s v proposed by alves de souza et al 2008 were also used as indices of the c s r strategies for phytoplankton reynolds 2006 reynolds et al 2002 cell shape algal shapes might influence the ingestion ability by zooplankters hartmann and kunkel 1991 spheroid and cuboidal unicells class 1 are easily ingested elongated cells class 2 are more difficult to orientate and thus loosely packed for ingestion while long filaments caused by colonial forms class 3 are really quite difficult to ingest each taxon was classified according to their shape in these three classes nitrogen fixation some cyanobacteria are able to use atmospheric nitrogen which represents a clear advantage when dissolved nitrogen is limited le quéré et al 2005 toxicity the potential toxicity of any taxonomic units mainly cyanobacteria was also considered reynolds 2006 trophy some photosynthetic algae show capacities to ingulf prey cells some dinoflagellates or chryptophytes or absorb selected dissolved organic compounds osmotrophy certain euglenophyta as a facultative or a typical life style which is also a clear advantage under low dissolved nutrient conditions reynolds 2006 each taxon was classified according to its feeding mode either autotrophy or potential mixotrophy life habitat each taxon was classified according to its tychopelagic pelagic or mixed life style environmental plasticity according to their salinity tolerance they were split into typical limnic species versus euryhaline species which present higher tolerance to brackish environment 2 2 4 2 mesozooplankton fifty one taxonomic units were observed among 6 taxonomic groups cladocera copepoda ostracoda rotifers larvae of benthic mollusks benthic decapods they were classified according to several functional traits based upon their life strategies r and k strategies their resource acquisition and their life habitat barnett et al 2007 litchman et al 2013 the mean size as each individual organism was measured using a calibrated ocular micrometer when counting they were split by taxon into three size classes small mean length 0 3 mm median 0 3 0 6 mm and large 0 6 mm according to barnett et al 2007 the maximum population growth according to literature was split in three classes high median and low barnett et al 2007 the fastest generation time fgt correspond to the time duration between 2 generations according to literature barnett et al 2007 it was also split in three classes high for about 1 day median for 0 8 1 days and low for 0 8 days this trait was combined with the reproduction mode since high fgt corresponded to taxa displaying only a sexual reproduction and low fgt exhibited both sexual and asexual reproduction two traits as qualitative factors traducing their diet plasticity with the food size range and the degree of selectivity of their preys small median and large for both traits barnett et al 2007 two traits were common with nano microphytoplanktonic functional traits and traduce their habitat the life habitat tychopelagic pelagic or mixed life style and the environmental plasticity limnic vs euryhaline with higher tolerance to brackish waters 2 3 data analysis for charactering the environmental context of the drained marshes two way analyses of variance anova were applied to assess the spatio temporal differences of all environmental parameters and ecological efficiency anova habitat season some parameters were previously log transformed to assess the applicability conditions rare species were excluded using the abundance sorting method adapted from ibañez et al 1993 for both phyto and mesozooplankton databases 54 units were kept i e 34 of the total taxonomic units for phytoplankton and 27 taxa i e 53 of the total taxonomic units for mesozooplankton david 2017 david et al 2012 this method is based on an index mixing species abundances and frequencies retaining only the frequent and locally abundant taxa at least at one station date david 2017 for both compartments we used several traits proposed in the literature and described above barnett et al 2007 litchman and klausmeier 2008 litchman et al 2013 and the omi gam coupled with the witomi methodological approaches to select the most appropriate traits to relate communities to environment karasiewicz et al 2017 kleyer et al 2012 the outlying mean index omi analysis was performed for the overall data 7 stations 13 months considering all the abiotic factors the parameters describing pom quantity quality and the planktonic communities described above this analysis allowed to determine taxa niche positions and breadths it was conducted for each database independently phytoplankton 54 taxa and mesozooplankton 27 taxa doledec et al 2000 moreover subniches or habitat estimations were conducted according to karasiewicz et al 2017 considering the 6 subsets reported in fig 1 in order to analyze the effect of resplenishment catchment basin size and urbanization taxa subniche dynamics were estimated by comparing marginality witomig and tolerance to the origin low witomig traducing a preference of the taxa for one habitat moreover the subniche parameters to the subset mean habitat conditions used by one taxa witomigk and tolerance k highlighted the taxa distribution within the subset habitat conditions low witomigk traducing a more common habitat for the taxa moreover the realized niche for each habitat was calculated as the percentage of the polygon area occupied by the group in the plane axis 2 vs axis 1 of the omi according to the total area occupied by each habitat the statistical significance of omi witomig witomigk and environmental parameters between subniches were tested by monte carlo permutation procedure with 10000 permutations doledec et al 2000 karasiewicz et al 2017 for each omi omi phytoplankton and omi mesozooplankton the taxa scores on the first two axes were used as response variables in generalized additive models gams with functional traits as explanatory variables kleyer et al 2012 multimodal inference based on all subsets selection of gams was used per axis and the best gam were obtained by using the akaike information criterion functional groups of taxa were obtained using a ward s hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distances between taxa predicted values from inference based gams on the first two omi axis the optimal number of functional groups was determined via the calinsky and harabasz index these functional groups were then brought face to face to their position relatively to the first omi axes and their related environmental parameters taxonomic richness shannon wiener diversity and pielou evenness were used to assess the structural diversity while functional richness evenness dispersion and divergence were calculated based on the functional traits highlighted by the omi gam to analyze the functional diversity per station date laliberte and legendre 2010 villéger et al 2008 one way generalized linear models glms were used for testing the relationships of the total biomasses and the several taxonomic and functional diversity indices between season or habitat for both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton two ways generalized linear models were used for testing the relationships of abundances specific richness witomig tolerance witomigk tolerance k realized niche percentage between functional groups and season or habitat glm functional groups season or glm functional groups habitat gaussian link functions were used for quantitative indices while poisson link function were applied for taxonomic and functional richness residuals normality and variance homogeneity were previously tested for each model abundances were log transformed in order to fit these applicability conditions all tests were performed with the r software r core team 2014 using the libraries subniche vegan ggplot2 and gam 3 results 3 1

and seasonal variations in drained marshes both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton displayed high seasonal variations linked to the environmental fluctuations these results are in accordance with those obtained for water quality for which most of the parameters presented some significant seasonal fluctuations in the same freshwater drained marshes as demonstrated by tortajada et al 2011 winter was characterized by a low biological activity with the lowest biomasses of all the planktonic compartments heterotrophic procaryots phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton while summer was marked by the highest biomasses winter period is actually not suitable to primary production due to temperature and probably to light limitation as suggested by masclaux et al 2015 however poc chla ratio presented a ratio of about 250 as most of the year data not shown traducing the large even not totally dominant part of the phytoplankton in the pom composition however pom δ13c exhibited their lowest values confirming the importance of terrestrial material mixed with freshwater microalgae in the pom composition at this season as highlighted by savoye et al 2003 2012 nano microphytoplankton was marked by a high contribution of large tychopelagic cells which may be due to high hydrodynamic features as demonstrated by guarini et al 2004b and david et al 2016 moreover cryptophytes and tychopelagic diatoms are dominant at this season to the detriment of chlorophytes confirming resuspension processes the latter taxonomic groups being less favored in turbulent environment cañavate et al 2016 ramade 2008 what s more nox and po4 3 displayed actually their highest values during winter the sea lock gates are actually opened to evacuate the surplus water coming from the catchment basin drained marshes are thus characterized by running water that probably exerted an erosive action on the sediment that may explain tychoplankton resuspension de jonge and van beusekom 1995 and high inputs of nutrients drained from the culture soils as demonstrated by tortajada et al 2011 none information is available in our systems about a possible atmospheric nitrogen inputs that may play an additional source of nutrients for phytoplankton especially in others urban systems suggested by peng et al 2019 however according to our knowledge the main anthropogenic activities are provided by wastewater treatment plant and those providing from private dwelling leaching or soil leaching a few industrial activities are present on the catchment basin on the other hand mesozooplankton was dominated by tychopelagic k strategists that are actually more competitive in cooler environment than r strategists for which faster growth and high turnover is favored by warmer conditions david et al 2016b elliott and whitfield 2011 jerling and wooldridge 1991 litchman et al 2013 this confirms the high contribution of tychopelagic species due to resuspension and thus the high benthos pelagos coupling at this season the decreasing temperature and the increasing precipitation at the fall period lead to the human action such as the opening of the sea lock gates this implies a running water that seems to contribute to the decrease of the taxa with alternative food diet hydrodynamic features may lead to a more detritical environment as testified by the highest value of poc chla ratio data not shown that may be explained by the degradation of the accumulated pom according to savoye et al 2003 drained marshes insure the ability to remove nitrate drained from culture soils on catchment basin since the winter nox concentrations brought from the catchment basin was reduced by 99 as it was highlighted by tortajada et al 2011 however eutrophication is marked during summer and may lead to hypoxia lowest o2 saturation and potential toxic environment actually cyanobacteria may produce toxins karjalainen et al 2007 and protease inhibitors that limit their digestibility and may affect the higher trophic levels agrawal et al 2001 no significant differences were highlighted concerning functional richness and divergence for both nano microphyto and mesozooplankton traducing a coexistence of the several functional groups over the seasonal cycle probably due to the high food availability as suggested by hillerislambers et al 2012 each group may find a favorable environment even if competition participate to the dominance of one or other according to the seasonal period 4 2 impact of human activities 4 2 1 summer replenishment the effect of artificial summer resplenishment from the adjacent charente river was performed considering non urbanized marshes displaying the same size of catchment basin this human action is an additional management on marshes allowing to maintain a sufficient stock of water to prevent the drying up of small channels and supplies both cattle husbandry and local maize culture occupying until 70 of the catchment basin area the water level decreases actually of some centimeters per day during summer for unresplenished marshes our data showed that replenishment decreases drastically the summer eutrophication this results confirm the typology of tortajada et al 2011 that highlighted an increasing eutrophication with a decreasing replenishment moreover dembowska and napiórkowski 2015 suggested that replenishment had already been described as a structuring factor for phytoplankton phytoplankton biomasses were actually lower for replenished than for unreplenished marshes when the sea lock gates are closed and the replenishment active from the end of spring to the beginning of fall during summer replenished marshes are characterized by smaller biomasses of small pelagic autotrophs and mixotrophs n2 fixators however the biological trait motility would have been interesting to consider for such system motile species could have been favored by running water during summer pom quantity microzooplankton and hp accumulation are also less pronounced in replenished waters during summer as it was highlighted by masclaux et al 2015 this traduces a lower n nutrient limitation for replenished marshes nox displayed higher concentrations in replenished compared to unreplenished marshes during spring and summer since it is brought by the charente river moreover small tychopelagic cells displayed higher biomasses for replenished marshes probably due to the higher hydrodynamics all the year due to the running water induced by the connection with the river favoring tychopelagic resuspension guarini et al 2004a the connection with the river all year round may limit water stagnation phosphorous release and thus eutrophication processes in replenished marshes the nitrogen nutrient limitation explained the fact that mixotrophs and n2 fixators displayed higher biomasses for unreplenished marshes their tolerance to n nutrient limitation is largest in the latter marshes compared with the others functional groups since they are more adapted to such environment than the others functional groups moreover water stagnation and high temperature favor the proliferation of mixotrophic dinoflagellates for unreplenished marshes as suggested by litchman et al 2012 the higher functional divergence recorded for these systems may thus be explained by the higher contribution of mixotrophs n2 fixators during the summer period in contrast with replenished marshes contrasting with the lower phytoplankton biomass zooplankton biomasses displayed higher biomasses richness and dispersion for replenished marshes with a higher contribution of all functional groups except tychopelagic k strategists notably from spring to fall this may be explained by the low nutritive quality or even toxicity that may exhibit certain phytoplankton taxa favored during the eutrophication processes that are larger for unresplenished marshes and may affect the higher trophic levels agrawal et al 2001 this higher zooplankton biomasses contrasting with the lower phytoplankton biomasses might thus explain the higher ecological efficiency observed for replenished waters 4 2 2 catchment basin size agriculture effect the comparison between non urbanized and replenished marshes of different catchment basin size report the effect of agriculture on water quality and plankton diversity the largest catchment basin displayed the largest area of agriculture 4700ha and 2000 with 72 of agriculture occupation for station 6 and 20 respectively compared with the smallest catchment basin size 900ha 37 40 small catchment basin with lower agriculture activity implied a lower quantity of nox brought during winter and explained thus the lower biomasses of nano microphytoplankton all year round even if lower inputs of wintering nox in small catchment basin should prevent the development of small pelagic taxa such as organisms with alternative food ressources mixotrophs and n2 fixators the latter functional groups did not displayed significant lower biomasses in contrast hypoxia periods lowest o2 saturation are more recurrent moreover tychopelagic phytoplankton taxa are also disfavored for small catchment basin probably due to the lower hydrodynamics features compared to marshes with large catchment basin a larger water volume is actually condensed in small channels favoring microphytobenthos resuspension during winter as suggested above the lower hydrodynamics features as well the lower nutrient inputs lead to the development of macrophytes that are actually more competitive than phytoplankton in nutrient limited environment as demonstrated by sand jensen and borum 1991 in contrast bronmark and weisner 1992 suggested that high hydrodynamics features in marshes with large catchment basin may favor phytoplankton development from the beginning of the spring and may prevent macrophytes development aquatic macrophytes play an important role in structuring communities in aquatic environments increase habitat complexity and heterogeneity and may provide food sources for various organisms like invertebrates fishes and waterbirds thomaz and cunha 2010 there are also known to greatly participate to heavy metal remediation abdallah 2012 however our systems are dominated by free leaved macrophytes at the surface of the water column mainly duckweeds janse and van puijenbroek 1998 suggested that a high cover of free floating plant may implies anoxic conditions that have a negative effect on freshwater ecosystems reducing animal biomasses and diversity moreover they are primacy for light in contrast chambers et al 1989 highlighted that rooted submerged macrophytes use a large part of their nutrient need from the sediment while the presence of submerged macrophytes usually implies low plankton biomasses and low eutrophication in ponds mukhopadhyay and dewanji 2004 consequently free leaving plants out compete submerged macrophytes due to light availability and cause a nutrient and light depletion in the water column that may cause eutrophication processes and lower plankton biomasses notably during summer period parr and mason 2004 scheffer et al 2003 consequently even if largest catchment basin and thus higher agriculture activity may lead to summer eutrophication processes since they imply higher nox and pom concentrations as reported by tortajada et al 2011 small catchment basin also presented eutrophication processes with higher hypoxia problems due to a high proliferation of free living plants at the surface of the water that limits light availability and favors mixotrophs n2 fixators during summer even if no significant differences in biomasses were highlighted zooplankton exhibited a lower taxonomic richness for marshes with small catchment basin characterized by large covers of duckweeds some taxa such as copepods and cladocerans seems to be disfavored in such habitat previous works showed actually that copepods may be disfavored by low oxygen concentrations appeltans et al 2003 mialet et al 2011 and that cladocerans abundances are mainly related to chla de los rios and soto 2007 mialet et al 2011 this habitat displayed lower phytoplankton however due to the lowest phytoplankton biomasses the marshes displaying the smallest catchment basin exhibited the lowest ecological efficiency and thus less food at least for higher trophic levels based on the planktonic trophic pathways 4 2 3 urbanization the comparison between urbanized and non urbanized replenished marshes with small catchment basin report the effect of the presence of water purification facilities on the marsh as well as leaching water from housing mcclelland and valiela 1998 suggest that the higher pom δ15n exhibited in urbanized marshes traduced the clear influence of urban waste in such habitat even though the lower contribution of n2 fixators during summer may also contributed to these high values no differences were observed for plankton biomasses between the two kinds of marshes contrasting with others studies that report a decreasing biomass when urbanization is present kentzer et al 2010 murakami and inoue kohama 2016 in contrast urbanized marshes exhibited a higher contribution of small pelagic autotrophs and a lower contribution of organisms characterized by alternative food sources mixotrophy n2 fixation this may be explained by the largest concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 that are released from water purification facilities or leaching waters that prevent nutrient limitations oxygen depletion is thus lower during summer due to these lowest heterotrophic taxa contribution moreover zooplankton assemblage was marked by a lower biomass of k strategists in favor of r strategists in particular rotifers and cladocerans cladocerans are actually mainly related to chla concentrations biomasses as suggested by de los rios and soto 2007 and mialet et al 2011 and may be thus favored by the highest contribution of small pelagic autotrophs during summer versus mixotrophs in our systems moreover rotifers especially brachonius that dominated during summer exhibited low selectivity on small preys in contrast with the k strategists copepods that are generally more opportunists according to the review of barnett et al 2007 cladocerans and rotifers may thus present asexual reproduction in this favorable nutritive environment that confer them higher growth rates and thus a higher competitivity than k strategists in urbanized marshes as proposed by litchman et al 2013 finally urbanized marshes are thus less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nitrogen nutrient inputs from urban waste that prevent the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators however they exhibited a lower ecological efficiency and thus less available food for the higher trophic levels 4 3 inputs of a functional approach on the drained marshes functioning the functional diversity approach complete greatly the knowledge about the functioning of such systems in aggregating the overwhelmingly diversity of organisms into groups of species sharing similar functions as suggested by mc gill et al 2006 this approach underlines the pelagic coupling during winter while the rest of the seasonal cycle was marked by an autochthonous pelagic production it also brings information about the mechanisms behind the functioning of these systems due to nutrients limitation with the demonstration of a seasonal succession of large small pelagic autotrophs and then small pelagic with alternative nutrition mode mixotrophy and n2 fixation the latter may provide toxic and unsuitable food for higher trophic levels decreasing thus the ecological efficiency during the warming periods finally it is informative on the process of competition between macrophytes and phytoplankton the former been more favored in less nutrient and hydrodynamics environment the results highlight thus the powerful of the trait based approach to understand both the drained marshes functioning and their related ecological functions as well as the impacts of man control and human activities on the catchment basin previous works have actually prove its efficiency to explore the organization of ecological communities and species niches for plankton compartments even though the difficulties related to the bibliographic synthesis necessary to compile the traits for all species and the data treatment methodology breton et al 2017 david et al 2012 kruk et al 2002 the combination between the omi gam proposed by kleyer et al 2012 and witomi analysis by karasiewicz et al 2017 has been particularly powerful in this work the former allowed to find among the available traits the ones that best linked communities to environment and to determine functional groups kleyer et al 2012 while the latter provide interpretations on niche dynamic by considering the several drained marshes as different habitat conditions karasiewicz et al 2017 for nano microphytoplankton it was not surprising that size and trophy traits were significant functional features in relating communities to environmental conditions both kind of traits are actually a way to adapt to nutrient limitation through the surface biovolume ratio allowing small cells to better absorb nutrients in the case of a n p desequilibrium and through a mixotrophs or n2 fixation nutrition mode when complete depletion of them the high seasonal fluctuations of nutrients until complete depletion drive thus the functional assemblage of phytoplankton in drained marshes concerning mesozooplankton growth rates and fastest generation time related to reproduction modes were significant traits explaining the assemblages in drained marshes the functional groups obtained was related to the r and k life strategies proposed for these organisms by the litchman model litchman et al 2013 adapted from the mcarthur and wilson theory macarthur and wilson 1967 r strategists presented high growth rates with the ability of asexual reproduction when environmental conditions are favorable and are characterized by a low energetic investment for defense and offspring protection in contrast k strategists displayed low growth rates with only sexual reproduction and a great energetic investment for defense and offspring protection even if r strategists are in theory less able to select their preys than k strategists the trait concerning food selectivity were not significant in our results in contrast r strategists cladocerans and rotifers seemed favored by a certain food environment high phytoplankton biomasses contrary to k strategists which were more dependent of abiotic environment for both compartments life habitat was a significant functional trait related to the omi niche the hydrodynamics play actually a great role in plankton communities with high resuspension of tychopelagic forms during flood time 4 4 how to perform such preliminary results the most marshes of the world and specially in europe are affected by human activity such as artificial replenishment urbanization and catchment basin size however a fewworks report the impact of human actions the latter on plankton communities in relation with their impacts on planktonic communities this work reports two functional approach but independently for nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton in this case is very difficult to analyze the processes between the two compartments however some traits used in this study provide several indications to make any assumptions about them for nano microphytoplankton cell shape and biovolume as well as potential toxicity may influence their ingestion availability for zooplankters concerning zooplankton k versus r strategists deduced according to several traits may condition their availability to adapt to several kind of food in that case some assumption could be made about the potential top down and bottom up control among the several planktonic pathways and thus about the impact of anthropogenic action within such pathways for example small catchment basin and unreplenished marshes during summer may imply the development of small phytoplankton even toxic or indigestible preys to zooplankton and thus bottom up effect however the result of ecological efficiency are not so clear our study is not enough in depth to explore such processes even if functional approach includes usually both ecological habitat preference related to abiotic tolerance or biotic interactions and biological e g life history physiological behavioral or morphological features traits wu et al 2017 only the latter type of traits were considered in this paper moreover some of the biological traits such as the motility were not taken into account this was due to the lack of information about the former kind of functional traits for a lot of species and could explain the part of unexplained deviance concerning the gam on the two first axis revealed by the omi analysis for both nano microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton in addition it would have been interesting to access to i a larger number of sampling marshes for each kind of habitat and ii to reproduce this work several years interannual survey in order to confirm the results coastal systems are usually more marked by seasonal rather than interannual fluctuations of plankton communities and water quality david et al 2005 tortajada et al 2011 however this was not practicable due to the heaveness of this work considering all the parameters that were sampled both cost and time consuming nevertheless the present study revealed novelty and interesting information about the seasonal and anthropogenic impacts on plankton communities in drained marshes 5 conclusions in a context in which polder areas are particularly sensitives to climate change through storm floods events causing marine submersion and thus high risks for local economical activities and populations a better understanding of how socio economic vulnerability of these areas support the idea of growing with the sea rather than fighting against it to increase their resilience however this implies a better knowledge of how human impacts act on such systems e g drained marshes the artificial summer replenishment which represents an additional man control on drained marshes acts positively on water quality i by decreasing the eutrophication processes by assuring a recurrent input of nitrogen nutrient preventing the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators ii by increasing the ecological efficiency during the warmer period providing largest food for the higher trophic levels based on the planktonic trophic pathways both small and large catchment basins may lead to summer eutrophication processes since the largest ones imply higher nutrients and pom concentrations and the smallest ones exhibit hypoxia problems due to higher proliferation of free floating macrophytes however the large catchment basin displayed lower ecological efficiency and thus less food for the higher trophic levels moreover the latter may also cause harmful effects due to higher pesticides inputs urbanized marshes are less subjected to eutrophication during summer than non urbanized marshes due to more recurrent nitrogen nutrient inputs from urban waste which prevent the proliferation of mixotrophs and n2 fixators but exhibited a lower ecological efficiency and thus less available food for the higher trophic levels nevertheless urban sewage inputs may also be a source of contaminant for coastal waters such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the several tools used in this analysis doubtless complete the informations provided by the works deployed on the protocols recommended by the water quality evaluation system wqes for the european water framework directive this was suggested by previous results concerning the spatio temporal fluctuations of drained marshes functioning and the effect of the several human activities they confirm that a better management of the hydrodynamics of such anthropogenic systems submitted to diverse human controls i e replenishment and several levels of human impact according to its activity on the catchment basin agriculture urbanization occupation can prevent eutrophication risks on coastal areas this should be taken in consideration in a growing with the sea policies in order to maintain ecological functions and related services and thus adapt their restauration in a context of sustainable development preventing the eutrophication linked to po4 3 desorption from the sediment during summer is a challenge for the management of such anthropo system several strategies necessitate human actions while decreasing the n p ratio from the water purification installation or dragging sediment that is charged in nutrient are realists others solutions such as adding aluminium sulfates to increase the phosphate adsorption restoring the macrophytes cover or introducing phytoplanktonophage fishes are more dangerous for the autochtonous species and the ecosystem functioning aluminium sulfate may be harmful for the sediment biogeochemistry and the introduction of non native species may disturb the ecosystem functioning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

18269,arsenic field test kits are widely used to measure arsenic levels in drinking water sources especially in countries like bangladesh where water supply is highly decentralized and water quality testing infrastructure is limited from a public health perspective the ability of a measurement technique to distinguish samples above and below relevant and actionable drinking water standards is paramount in this study the performance of eight commercially available field test kits was assessed by comparing kit estimates to hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy hg aas analyses the results of tests that control for user dependent color matching errors showed that two kits lamotte and quick ii kits provided accurate and precise estimates of arsenic four kits econo quick quick wagtech and merck kits were either accurate or precise but not both and two kits hach and econo quick ii kits were neither accurate nor precise tests were performed for arsenic concentration ranges commonly found in natural waters and treated waters such as community drinking water filter systems and also on laboratory generated arsenic standards in di water for those kits that did not perform well test strips often produced colors too light compared to manufacturer provided arsenic color calibration charts based on these results we recommend stakeholders carefully re consider the use of poorly performing field test kits until better quality control of components of these kits is implemented in addition we recommend that field test kit manufacturers provide suitable internal standards in every kit box for users to verify the veracity of manufacturer provided color charts graphical abstract image 1 keywords test kit field kit arsenic bangladesh color matching 1 introduction due to unsafe levels of arsenic in drinking water more than 100 million people worldwide including an estimated 35 to 77 million in bangladesh face serious risks of developing skin lesions and various types of cancer argos et al 2010 dhar et al 1997 karim 2000 smith et al 2000 adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality quansah et al 2015 and cardiovascular disease chen et al 2011 testing water quality and sharing the results with affected users has been one of the most effective interventions for reducing the number of households consuming arsenic contaminated water ahmed et al 2006 in the early 2000s over five million wells were tested for arsenic as part of concerted well screening programs in bangladesh george et al 2012 hossain et al 2006 johnston and sarker 2007 who 2012 since that time several million new wells have been installed although many have not yet been tested ahmed et al 2006 chakraborti et al 2010 george et al 2012 given that performance of arsenic removing filters is variable and that arsenic in shallow tube wells can change over time ravenscroft et al 2004 more frequent water testing in affected geographies is of paramount importance hossain et al 2006 the most recent multiple index cluster survey report bbs and unicef 2015 indicates that 25 of the populace in bangladesh is drinking water that tested above the world health organization drinking water guideline for arsenic 10 μg l and over 12 of households are drinking water containing more than the bangladesh national arsenic drinking water standard of 50 μg l although many arsenic measurement methods exist in rural low income communities easy to use and low cost colorimetry based arsenic field test kits are the most popular jakariya et al 2007 kinniburgh and kosmus 2002 ma et al 2014 melamed 2005 van geen et al 2005 however the accuracy of these kits especially when used to classify water samples based on relevant drinking water safety standards has been questioned feldmann 2008 rahman et al 2002 the last systematic reviews of arsenic field test kits were done over a decade ago ahuja 2008 spear et al 2006 and recent literature lacks studies evaluating kit performance in field tests of groundwater and surface water samples arias et al 2014 given the prevalence of simple arsenic test kits use in countries such as bangladesh an updated analysis of their accuracy precision and other potential shortcomings for field applications is urgently needed this study examined eight commercially available arsenic field test kits on both laboratory generated arsenic water standards and actual well water samples in bangladesh each kit was assessed by comparing the field kit results to arsenic measured by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy hg aas sources of possible measurement error including kit based and human based error were evaluated a qualitative comparison of ease of use was also conducted critical assessment of these factors enables stakeholders to select suitable field test kits for their needs it also provides insights to manufacturers for improving field test kit accuracy reliability and ease of use the performance of hach ez kit was of particular interest to this study since it is widely used in bangladesh where no other arsenic field test kits are currently readily available on the market some previous studies have found the hach ez kit to significantly underestimate arsenic concentrations rahman et al 2002 spear et al 2006 in contrast a different study van geen et al 2005 reported better kit performance and recommended its continued use for screening of wells the same study also reported that increasing the reaction time from 20 to 40 min significantly improves the accuracy of the kit particularly in the 50 100 μg l region subsequent studies george et al 2012 steinmaus et al 2006 using this modified reaction time protocol also reported good results however a more detailed investigation of the hach kit kearns and tyson 2012 found it necessary to further increase the reaction time above 40 min or increase reaction temperature to 35 c to obtain similar color to the printed reference chart color blocks for equivalent arsenic concentrations this later study also found that a reaction time of 24 h produced better results for concentrations around 10 μg l but noted color fading for higher concentrations over longer test durations making it unclear whether the extended reaction times will always be beneficial while increased reaction time may improve accuracy we only evaluated the hach kit using the 20 min reaction time as this remains the manufacturer s recommendation and the modified protocol reported in literature is not likely to be used in the field similarly the performance of the econo quick kit was of interest in this study given its comparatively low price and recent evidence indicating it is accurate and precise george et al 2012 van geen et al 2014 especially in the concentration range needed to classify samples according to the bangladesh drinking water standard further this kit was used in the most recent multiple indicator cluster survey bbs and unicef 2015 that tested arsenic in 13 000 households across the country 2 materials and methods 2 1 field test kits the eight field test kits included in this study tables 1 and si tables s3 s10 cover a range of arsenic concentrations 0 1000 μg l and costs 0 63 4 67 usd per test each can be purchased on the international market but at the time of this study only the hach ez kit could be purchased in bangladesh arsenic detection for all kits in this study is based on the gutzeit method bird 1901 gutzeit 1879 specifically aqueous arsenic species are converted to gaseous arsenic hydride through the addition of chemical reducing agents in a reaction bottle the resulting arsenic hydride gas reacts with a mercuric bromide test strip located in the headspace of the reactor bottle forming a colored complex that shifts from yellow to orange to brown with increasing arsenic concentrations the final color is compared against a concentration calibrated color chart provided by the manufacturer to determine the water s arsenic concentration some manufacturers offer color scanners e g arsenator palintest gateshead uk and quick scan industrial testing system rock hill south carolina usa with pre loaded color concentration calibrations which enable a digital read out of test results color scanners reduce the potential error and variability associated with a manual color matching and interpolation allows for more accurate results with field kits as has been reported for the wagtech kit safarzadeh amiri et al 2011 recent studies have utilized mobile phone camera images haque et al 2018 digital camera images sekine et al 2018 and a flatbed office scanned images kearns and edson 2018 for this purpose generic color scanners e g x rite grand rapids michigan usa can also be used for color matching with any of the kits kearns and tyson 2012 2 2 field test kit evaluation the measurement of arsenic by each kit was carried out in accordance with the corresponding manufacturer s instructions an optional sulfide interference mitigation step was followed for all kits except for the wagtech g kit which does not list the step as being optional and the merck h kit which does not have a specific procedural step for sulfide mitigation for the hach a kit additional tests were performed with and without the sulfide removal step to assess possible effects on test accuracy four kits lamotte b econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f recommend in their procedures that samples testing above 30 μg l 30 μg l 50 μg l and 10 μg l respectively should be diluted and re tested for the most accurate results the dilution step time was infeasible with our study design and therefore all results presented are based on tests of undiluted samples to reduce errors caused by procedural inaccuracies and variance among testers three experienced analysts performed all tests all water samples were tested in triplicate for each reacted test strip the color was recorded using a portable digital color scanner x rite rm200qc grand rapids michigan usa in d65 daylight mode for a subset of water samples the completed test strips were also presented to a five person panel consisting of government and ngo employees who regularly use arsenic field test kits the panel was asked to evaluate whether the test result indicated an arsenic concentration above or below 50 μg l by comparing the color of the test strip to the manufacturer provided color chart panelists were not allowed to view other panel members responses or review previous determinations when recording an answer each water sample was tested in triplicate and presented to panelists in a randomized order all test strips were scanned and evaluated by the panel within 2 minutes of test completion as recommended by field test kit manufacturers the study protocol involving evaluation of test results by a panel of field test kit users was approved by the university of michigan institutional review board 2 3 water samples field kit tests were run on water samples from shallow and deep aquifer wells surface waters and rural drinking water infrastructure in phulsara union in the southwest of bangladesh see si table s2 for details on water samples characteristics used in this study to ensure that a single water sample could be used for all field test kits a large volume 3 5 l was collected directly into a container from the water source immediately after collection subsamples were aliquoted into 250 or 500 ml plastic bottles filled to the brim ensuring no headspace and then sealed with an airtight cap to minimize oxidation of redox sensitive elements such as iron oremland and stolz 2005 pande et al 2001 plastic sample bottles were pre washed with 10 v v hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany and then rinsed thrice with the sample water before sample collection all field tests were completed within 3 hours of sample collection one sample aliquot was acidified up to 2 v v hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany for subsequent laboratory hg aas analysis apha 1998 in addition dilutions of laboratory arsenic standards with distilled water were also tested a primary arsenic iii standard in nitric acid sigma aldrich st louis usa was used to prepare such laboratory dilutions for all kits except the hach kit for which a standard in sodium hydroxide hach loveland usa was used per the manufacturer s recommendation ph adjustments were made to the diluted solutions as needed before testing using sodium hydroxide merck darmstadt germany and or hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany to fall within the ph 5 7 range that some manufacturers recommend 2 4 processing color data for all samples the arsenic reacted test strips were scanned in triplicate using the x rite scanner which records color information in three dimensions light l chroma c and hue h each completed test strip was scanned three times and the average l c and h values were used for calculations the color difference metric cmc 2 1 from the color measurement committee clarke et al 2008 kim et al 2011 was used to determine closest match to the manufacturer provided color chart see si section s1 for more details 2 5 laboratory generated color charts laboratory generated color charts were generated by reproducing the colors recorded by the color scanner and pairing with hg aas measurements of the sample the web application at http colorizer org was used to generate color tiles from the lab color values recorded by the scanner these laboratory generated charts enabled assessment of the accuracy of manufacturer provided color charts 2 6 analytical methods a portion of each water sample was preserved by adding 2 v v of 6m hcl merck darmstadt germany for later laboratory testing of arsenic concentration by hg aas shimadzu scientific instruments kyoto japan apha 1998 the temperature and ph of water samples shown in table s2 of the supplementary information were measured using a standard probe dkk toa japan and adjusted as needed to fall within the appropriate ranges specified in the instructions of a given field test kit a subset of preserved samples was sent to a commercial laboratory bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir dhaka for an icp ms measurement for cross verification 2 7 ease of use informational interviews with broad range of field test kit users n 15 in bangladesh were conducted to define desirable attributes that made a field kit easy to use each kit was rated by the authors against these metrics to generate an ease of use comparison si table s1 3 results 3 1 quality control and quality assurance the detection limit of the laboratory reference method using hg aas for arsenic was determined as 0 7 μg l a six point calibration curve of standards between 1 and 12 μg l was generated daily and if the internal standard run every ten samples to check for instrumental drift varied by more than 10 the system was recalibrated recoveries of 10 100 μg l standard additions to distilled water and groundwater sample matrices showed recoveries between 120 20 a set of six samples between 40 μg l and 170 μg l were sent to a commercial laboratory at bcsir for cross laboratory verification and showed consistent results with rsd between the sets at 9 3 2 comparison of field kit and laboratory hg aas results a total of 314 arsenic field test kit measurements were run across 21 water samples and 14 different field test kit boxes of the eight commercial products arsenic concentrations ranged from 1 to 200 μg l in water samples of various background matrices including laboratory arsenic standards in di water and well water samples a panel of five experienced field kit users in bangladesh were asked to determine if the samples were above or below 50 μg l by color matching of the test strips to standard colors on the reference charts provided by the manufacturers their evaluation was then compared to the hg aas verified arsenic concentrations of the same samples fig 1 thus the errors in the kit measurements could include both user based errors manual color matching and kit based errors based on test strip colors coming out too light or too dark compared to color chart points corresponding to hg aas verified arsenic concentrations based on the results shown in fig 1 the kits were ranked based on three factors first the highest overall percentage of user responses in agreement with the hg aas measurements led to the following ranking with agreement value in parenthesis econo quick c 86 lamotte b 86 quick ii f 79 merck h 77 quick e 76 econo quick ii d 61 wagtech g 61 hach a 59 second the overall lowest percentage of user responses indicating a sample was 50 μg l when the hg aas measurements indicated it was 50 μg l false positives led to the following ranking with false positives in parenthesis merck h 0 econo quick c 1 quick e 4 lamotte b 6 quick ii f 12 econo quick ii d 39 wagtech g 39 hach a 40 third the overall lowest percentage of user responses indicating a sample was 50 μg l when the hg aas measurements indicated it was 50 μg l false negatives led to the following ranking with false negatives in parenthesis hach a 0 econo quick ii d 0 wagtech g 0 lamotte b 9 quick ii f 9 econo quick c 13 quick e 20 merck h 23 from the overall percentage of responses in agreement with aas and considering that false positives underestimating arsenic are far worse than false negatives overestimating arsenic for making decisions about well water safety according to the bangladesh national standard it is apparent that the hach a wagtech g and econo quick ii d were the three most poorly performing kits fig 2 shows arsenic concentrations estimated by the x rite color scanner of field test kit results y axis versus the arsenic concentrations measured using hg aas x axis human based color matching errors were effectively eliminated with the use of a color scanner thus the differences between the x rite color scanner results and the hg aas results are solely attributable to kit based errors without kit based errors results would have an intercept of 0 and a slope equal to 1 see ideal kit in top left panel linear fits to the data in fig 2 show the degree to which a field test kit conformed to this error free ideal a slope greater than 1 indicates a positive bias i e the field test kit estimates a higher concentration than the hg aas measured value while a value less than 1 indicates a negative bias i e the field test kit underestimates the concentration a lack of linearity and slopes greater than or less than 1 indicate kit based sources of error in the field test kit measurement this analysis is similar to the one used in an earlier study for evaluating the relative accuracy and precision of three arsenic field test kits including the hach kit george et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the lamotte b quick e and quick ii f kits had slopes closest to 1 1 2 1 3 indicating they were relatively accurate but with a slight positive bias tendency to overestimate the merck h kit had a slope of 0 73 indicating that it was relatively accurate but had a slight negative bias tendency to underestimate the econo quick c kit had a slope much greater than 1 2 0 indicating a large positive bias the remaining three kits hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g had much lower slopes 0 20 0 41 indicating a substantial negative bias a high degree of precision was found in case of econo quick c r2 0 94 lamotte b r2 0 88 wagtech g r2 0 86 and quick ii f r2 0 82 kits implying consistency in measurements across a range of concentrations in contrast the linearity was poor for the quick e r2 0 63 merck h r2 0 54 hach a r2 0 47 and econo quick ii d r2 0 33 kits indicating high variability in field test kit response across several samples based on the slope and linearity analyses the lamotte b and the quick ii f kits performed best in terms of accuracy and precision the econo quick c quick e merck h and wagtech g kits were either accurate or precise but not both interestingly while the econo quick kit showed a high positive bias tendency to overestimate it did so in a very consistent manner r2 0 94 suggesting that a re calibrated color chart with darker color blocks would result in better accuracy the wagtech g kit on the other hand while precise r2 0 86 consistently and significantly underestimates arsenic concentration indicating a re calibrated color chart will likely be unreliable due to the lighter colors generated overall based on the high degree of underestimation and the corresponding greatest number of false positives we classify three kits hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g as performing poorly as a result samples with concentrations higher than 100 μg l were assessed by these kits to be below 50 μg l furthermore these results suggest the false positives in panelist responses i e misclassification of water samples above the drinking water standard as meeting the standard for these three kits were largely due to kit based errors the poor performance of the hach kit is especially concerning given it is currently the most widely used and only readily available kit on the market in bangladesh based on the poor results discussed above four additional lots of the hach kit were acquired and tested in bangladesh between january 2017 and february 2018 the potential interference caused by the optional sulfide removal step in the procedure was also investigated in these additional tests the results si section s3 confirmed the initial finding that the hach kit substantially underestimates the concentration of arsenic 3 3 laboratory generated color charts with reference to fig 3 all colors were regenerated from x rite scans of the test strips or manufacturer charts respectively as described in the methods section for the manufacturer calibrations we represented only four points from their respective color charts 0 25 50 100 as these were points that overlapped for all color charts the authors note that the eye test for the reproduced manufacturer color charts shows some variability most notably in case of the zero values scanning artifacts may arise based on the quality of the color chart image and the material on which it is printed while a reasonable zero value white color blocks resulted from the scans of the paper based charts for kits b c d e f g scans of the charts of kits a and h produced noticeably darker off white colors compared to unreacted test strips this problem was particularly acute for the hach a kit where a laminated color chart affixed to a curved box surface resulted in a rather dark gray zero concentration block to overcome this limitation the hach manufacturer calibration shown in fig 3 and the analysis based on it in fig 2 was re generated from a color scan of a re printed digital image of the hach a color chart from the manufacturer rather using the color scan of the chart affixed to the kit box see section s2 of the supplementary information for a further discussion and resolution of this issue as shown in fig 3 laboratory generated color charts differ substantially from the manufacturer provided color charts for several kits the greatest color difference between the manufacturer s and laboratory generated color charts occurred with the hach a and econo quick ii d kits which showed considerable negative bias in fig 2 as well as the econo quick c kit which showed substantial positive bias these results imply that kit based calibration errors could be addressed through laboratory calibration of field test kits using known standards especially when the actual kit performance led to darker color blocks than the manufacturer provided color chart for all field test kits and samples analyzed the laboratory color blocks generated from arsenic standards prepared in di water closely resemble the colors generated from field samples at near equivalent concentrations this indicates water sample matrix effects are unlikely to have played a significant role in poor kit performance observed in our studies fig 3 also illustrates the variability that arises when the same sample is tested multiple times this variability of color difference among triplicates in fig 3 is a measure of precision a lack of color reproducibility is seen most clearly with the hach a econo quick ii d and merck h kits these kits also showed low r2 values in fig 2 another indication of non calibration kit based precision error as mentioned previously laboratory calibration does not address this error it should be noted that we were unable to generate similar color charts in fig 3 with the lamotte b and wagtech g kits due to logistical challenges of ordering and obtaining test strips for these two kits while in bangladesh 4 discussion 4 1 implications in bangladesh it is common practice to make decisions on which water sources are safe to use based on a single field test kit result and whether the value is above or below the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l rahman et al 2002 therefore it is imperative that the field test kits perform accurately enough for the purpose of classifying samples against the relevant drinking water standards furthermore stakeholders who use these field test kits must understand the potential shortcomings of a kit including its tendency to overestimate or underestimate arsenic concentrations and the magnitude of precision and accuracy errors in this study the hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g tended to underestimate arsenic concentrations leading to false positive assessments as noted previously a recent study also reported significant underestimation by the hach a kit and the quick econo ii kit kearns et al 2019 but samples were acidified for later kit analysis instead of being tested right away which could have contributed to the poor results in the case of econo quick ii d the recommended diluting and re testing samples that test above 30 μg l was not implemented also a possible source of suboptimal performance the hach a kit was used in the government backed well screening program in bangladesh which tested over five million water access points between 2000 and 2004 the accuracy of the hach kit was questioned by a study in 2002 rahman et al 2002 a subsequent study van geen et al 2005 reported good agreement between hach kit results and laboratory graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy gf aas measurements and improved accuracy when the reaction time was increased to 40 min others have found improved performance for the hach kit with increasing the reaction time as well george et al 2012 health and islam 2012 kearns and tyson 2012 steinmaus et al 2006 despite these findings manufacturer provided instructions continue to state a 20 min reaction time should be used for the hach kit and based on our observations this is still the procedure followed by government and ngo field test kit users in bangladesh given that the hach a kit is the only readily available field kit on the market in bangladesh at the time of writing this article these findings should be cause for concern to ngos and government employees who use this kit for discerning acceptable water quality the lamotte b and quick ii f kits performed best but at more than 4 usd per test they are the most expensive table 1 and not significantly cheaper than instrument based laboratory methods 6 30 usd per test which are more accurate these performance findings are consistent with previous studies kaufman et al 2003 spear et al 2006 the quick e kit offers slightly lower accuracy at less than half the cost 1 8 usd per test a finding also consistent with a previous study abbgy et al 2002 while the lamotte b econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f kits recommend diluting and re analyzing samples that test above 30 μg l 30 μg l 50 μg l and 10 μg l respectively this additional step was not performed in the present study it is possible that implementing this step would have further improved the performance of these three kits the econo quick c merck h and quick e kits were either accurate or precise but not both in our study a prior study using the merck h jakariya et al 2007 kit reported good performance and a low rate of misclassification of the true arsenic concentration based on color matching to the manufacturer provided color charts the econo quick c kit is the cheapest kit 0 6 usd per test among the group we tested a study by spear et al 2006 reported average performance of this kit with a negative bias in the limited samples tested more recent and extensive studies with the kit have indicated good performance george et al 2012 van geen et al 2014 but with a positive bias at higher concentrations another study arias et al 2014 indicates that the econo quick c kit showed high agreement 97 with laboratory methods when used on groundwater samples but lower agreement 68 when used on surface waters suggesting the potential of matrix affects with surface water van geen et al 2019 report that the kit tends to overestimate by a factor of two the arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l with a very low rate of false positives samples that were actually higher than the drinking water standard being classified as meeting standard in our study we saw this tendency to overestimate by a factor of two across the entire range of arsenic concentrations tested 10 200 μg l for this kit however we acknowledge that our sample size in the concentration range below 50 μg l is limited the most recent multiple index cluster survey report bbs and unicef 2015 utilized the econo quick c kit this kit has the potential to offer a more reliable alternative to the hach kit in bangladesh at a similar cost per test the substantial but consistent positive bias we observed with this kit could be corrected by recalibration even without recalibration it is a superior alternative as the health implications of overestimating arsenic concentration are far less severe than those associated with underestimating it given that our study did not investigate variability between multiple lots of a kit except for the hach kit it is possible that the findings for other kits reported here may not be representative of performance averaged over multiple lots repeating these tests over several different lots of each kit would build a stronger body of evidence of the relative performance of each kit as reported here and whether quality control is a general concern from one kit to the next 4 2 ease of use user preference and ability to perform field test kit procedures accurately can be influenced by the ease of use of a field test kit arora et al 2009 field test kits were assessed based on the ease of use considering several factors that were identified through interviews of field test kit users these included a procedure number of active steps number of reagents b packaging reagents bottle cap overall packaging c color chart range of concentrations type of color chart e g paper paper with a viewing aperture in the middle of color tile printed on bottle etc number of color tiles around 10 μg l number of color tiles around 50 μg l and d instruction manual language instruction clarity the authors also subjectively ranked the kits against each parameter see si table s1 the procedures and packaging for hach a wagtech g and merck h kits were rated highly e g the procedures were easy to follow and the reagent packaging made it simple to use however their color charts and instruction manuals did not rate as well when compared to others the lamotte b econo quick c econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f procedures ranked lower but their color charts and the clarity of instruction manuals generally rated higher 5 conclusions the findings of this study raise concerns with the performance of several of the kits tested especially those that underestimate arsenic concentration and result in false positives the findings were similar across a range of field samples including engineered and natural water sources and laboratory standards which demonstrates poor results across a broad range of sample matrices and concentrations one way of addressing kit based errors due to manufacturer calibration chart bias is to use custom calibrations viz scanner generated color blocks of verified arsenic standard solutions for a given kit this offers a promising option for making the econo quick c kit which showed a consistent positive bias more accurate however this approach does not address all errors associated with poorly performing kits such as the hach a and econo quick ii d kits which in addition to high inaccuracy in the 10 100 μg l range also exhibited poor reproducibility and low color intensity making color matching unreliable for the hach kit in particular the manufacturer should consider the results of a number of studies cited in this work that indicate the current kit with a reaction time of 20 min is inadequate and either modify the kit chemical component amounts or the procedures including reaction time accordingly so that the color chart provided is more representative of the kit s actual performance in the field more broadly the results of this study suggest that field test kit results should be viewed only as a preliminary indication of potential arsenic contamination stakeholders should carefully consider whether the benefits of using periodic field test kit results outweigh the risks of an inaccurate assessment and a false positive result versus conducting a more accurate and expensive laboratory instrumental analysis of water samples at a minimum re testing samples found to be close to the relevant drinking water standard e g 10 or 50 μg l would be prudent to reduce the number of misclassified drinking water sources as safe i e below the national arsenic standard when they are not before use manufacturers and users of arsenic field test kits would benefit by being able to evaluate each kit against a verified arsenic standard in order to confirm that the calibration chart provided by a manufacturer accurately reflects the colors produced by the kit the industrial testing systems its kits econo quick c econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f recommend testing a diluted inorganic standard for familiarization with the kit while the merck h kit procedure suggests it as a quality assurance protocol but neither kit provides a standard leading us to believe that this would rarely happen in practice manufacturers should consider producing certified standards in the concentrations of interest for high volume test kit users to purchase for quality assurance if challenges of safety and stability can be ensured providing aliquots of a verified arsenic standard in each kit would allow users to test whether the kit is

early 2000s over five million wells were tested for arsenic as part of concerted well screening programs in bangladesh george et al 2012 hossain et al 2006 johnston and sarker 2007 who 2012 since that time several million new wells have been installed although many have not yet been tested ahmed et al 2006 chakraborti et al 2010 george et al 2012 given that performance of arsenic removing filters is variable and that arsenic in shallow tube wells can change over time ravenscroft et al 2004 more frequent water testing in affected geographies is of paramount importance hossain et al 2006 the most recent multiple index cluster survey report bbs and unicef 2015 indicates that 25 of the populace in bangladesh is drinking water that tested above the world health organization drinking water guideline for arsenic 10 μg l and over 12 of households are drinking water containing more than the bangladesh national arsenic drinking water standard of 50 μg l although many arsenic measurement methods exist in rural low income communities easy to use and low cost colorimetry based arsenic field test kits are the most popular jakariya et al 2007 kinniburgh and kosmus 2002 ma et al 2014 melamed 2005 van geen et al 2005 however the accuracy of these kits especially when used to classify water samples based on relevant drinking water safety standards has been questioned feldmann 2008 rahman et al 2002 the last systematic reviews of arsenic field test kits were done over a decade ago ahuja 2008 spear et al 2006 and recent literature lacks studies evaluating kit performance in field tests of groundwater and surface water samples arias et al 2014 given the prevalence of simple arsenic test kits use in countries such as bangladesh an updated analysis of their accuracy precision and other potential shortcomings for field applications is urgently needed this study examined eight commercially available arsenic field test kits on both laboratory generated arsenic water standards and actual well water samples in bangladesh each kit was assessed by comparing the field kit results to arsenic measured by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy hg aas sources of possible measurement error including kit based and human based error were evaluated a qualitative comparison of ease of use was also conducted critical assessment of these factors enables stakeholders to select suitable field test kits for their needs it also provides insights to manufacturers for improving field test kit accuracy reliability and ease of use the performance of hach ez kit was of particular interest to this study since it is widely used in bangladesh where no other arsenic field test kits are currently readily available on the market some previous studies have found the hach ez kit to significantly underestimate arsenic concentrations rahman et al 2002 spear et al 2006 in contrast a different study van geen et al 2005 reported better kit performance and recommended its continued use for screening of wells the same study also reported that increasing the reaction time from 20 to 40 min significantly improves the accuracy of the kit particularly in the 50 100 μg l region subsequent studies george et al 2012 steinmaus et al 2006 using this modified reaction time protocol also reported good results however a more detailed investigation of the hach kit kearns and tyson 2012 found it necessary to further increase the reaction time above 40 min or increase reaction temperature to 35 c to obtain similar color to the printed reference chart color blocks for equivalent arsenic concentrations this later study also found that a reaction time of 24 h produced better results for concentrations around 10 μg l but noted color fading for higher concentrations over longer test durations making it unclear whether the extended reaction times will always be beneficial while increased reaction time may improve accuracy we only evaluated the hach kit using the 20 min reaction time as this remains the manufacturer s recommendation and the modified protocol reported in literature is not likely to be used in the field similarly the performance of the econo quick kit was of interest in this study given its comparatively low price and recent evidence indicating it is accurate and precise george et al 2012 van geen et al 2014 especially in the concentration range needed to classify samples according to the bangladesh drinking water standard further this kit was used in the most recent multiple indicator cluster survey bbs and unicef 2015 that tested arsenic in 13 000 households across the country 2 materials and methods 2 1 field test kits the eight field test kits included in this study tables 1 and si tables s3 s10 cover a range of arsenic concentrations 0 1000 μg l and costs 0 63 4 67 usd per test each can be purchased on the international market but at the time of this study only the hach ez kit could be purchased in bangladesh arsenic detection for all kits in this study is based on the gutzeit method bird 1901 gutzeit 1879 specifically aqueous arsenic species are converted to gaseous arsenic hydride through the addition of chemical reducing agents in a reaction bottle the resulting arsenic hydride gas reacts with a mercuric bromide test strip located in the headspace of the reactor bottle forming a colored complex that shifts from yellow to orange to brown with increasing arsenic concentrations the final color is compared against a concentration calibrated color chart provided by the manufacturer to determine the water s arsenic concentration some manufacturers offer color scanners e g arsenator palintest gateshead uk and quick scan industrial testing system rock hill south carolina usa with pre loaded color concentration calibrations which enable a digital read out of test results color scanners reduce the potential error and variability associated with a manual color matching and interpolation allows for more accurate results with field kits as has been reported for the wagtech kit safarzadeh amiri et al 2011 recent studies have utilized mobile phone camera images haque et al 2018 digital camera images sekine et al 2018 and a flatbed office scanned images kearns and edson 2018 for this purpose generic color scanners e g x rite grand rapids michigan usa can also be used for color matching with any of the kits kearns and tyson 2012 2 2 field test kit evaluation the measurement of arsenic by each kit was carried out in accordance with the corresponding manufacturer s instructions an optional sulfide interference mitigation step was followed for all kits except for the wagtech g kit which does not list the step as being optional and the merck h kit which does not have a specific procedural step for sulfide mitigation for the hach a kit additional tests were performed with and without the sulfide removal step to assess possible effects on test accuracy four kits lamotte b econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f recommend in their procedures that samples testing above 30 μg l 30 μg l 50 μg l and 10 μg l respectively should be diluted and re tested for the most accurate results the dilution step time was infeasible with our study design and therefore all results presented are based on tests of undiluted samples to reduce errors caused by procedural inaccuracies and variance among testers three experienced analysts performed all tests all water samples were tested in triplicate for each reacted test strip the color was recorded using a portable digital color scanner x rite rm200qc grand rapids michigan usa in d65 daylight mode for a subset of water samples the completed test strips were also presented to a five person panel consisting of government and ngo employees who regularly use arsenic field test kits the panel was asked to evaluate whether the test result indicated an arsenic concentration above or below 50 μg l by comparing the color of the test strip to the manufacturer provided color chart panelists were not allowed to view other panel members responses or review previous determinations when recording an answer each water sample was tested in triplicate and presented to panelists in a randomized order all test strips were scanned and evaluated by the panel within 2 minutes of test completion as recommended by field test kit manufacturers the study protocol involving evaluation of test results by a panel of field test kit users was approved by the university of michigan institutional review board 2 3 water samples field kit tests were run on water samples from shallow and deep aquifer wells surface waters and rural drinking water infrastructure in phulsara union in the southwest of bangladesh see si table s2 for details on water samples characteristics used in this study to ensure that a single water sample could be used for all field test kits a large volume 3 5 l was collected directly into a container from the water source immediately after collection subsamples were aliquoted into 250 or 500 ml plastic bottles filled to the brim ensuring no headspace and then sealed with an airtight cap to minimize oxidation of redox sensitive elements such as iron oremland and stolz 2005 pande et al 2001 plastic sample bottles were pre washed with 10 v v hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany and then rinsed thrice with the sample water before sample collection all field tests were completed within 3 hours of sample collection one sample aliquot was acidified up to 2 v v hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany for subsequent laboratory hg aas analysis apha 1998 in addition dilutions of laboratory arsenic standards with distilled water were also tested a primary arsenic iii standard in nitric acid sigma aldrich st louis usa was used to prepare such laboratory dilutions for all kits except the hach kit for which a standard in sodium hydroxide hach loveland usa was used per the manufacturer s recommendation ph adjustments were made to the diluted solutions as needed before testing using sodium hydroxide merck darmstadt germany and or hydrochloric acid merck darmstadt germany to fall within the ph 5 7 range that some manufacturers recommend 2 4 processing color data for all samples the arsenic reacted test strips were scanned in triplicate using the x rite scanner which records color information in three dimensions light l chroma c and hue h each completed test strip was scanned three times and the average l c and h values were used for calculations the color difference metric cmc 2 1 from the color measurement committee clarke et al 2008 kim et al 2011 was used to determine closest match to the manufacturer provided color chart see si section s1 for more details 2 5 laboratory generated color charts laboratory generated color charts were generated by reproducing the colors recorded by the color scanner and pairing with hg aas measurements of the sample the web application at http colorizer org was used to generate color tiles from the lab color values recorded by the scanner these laboratory generated charts enabled assessment of the accuracy of manufacturer provided color charts 2 6 analytical methods a portion of each water sample was preserved by adding 2 v v of 6m hcl merck darmstadt germany for later laboratory testing of arsenic concentration by hg aas shimadzu scientific instruments kyoto japan apha 1998 the temperature and ph of water samples shown in table s2 of the supplementary information were measured using a standard probe dkk toa japan and adjusted as needed to fall within the appropriate ranges specified in the instructions of a given field test kit a subset of preserved samples was sent to a commercial laboratory bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir dhaka for an icp ms measurement for cross verification 2 7 ease of use informational interviews with broad range of field test kit users n 15 in bangladesh were conducted to define desirable attributes that made a field kit easy to use each kit was rated by the authors against these metrics to generate an ease of use comparison si table s1 3 results 3 1 quality control and quality assurance the detection limit of the laboratory reference method using hg aas for arsenic was determined as 0 7 μg l a six point calibration curve of standards between 1 and 12 μg l was generated daily and if the internal standard run every ten samples to check for instrumental drift varied by more than 10 the system was recalibrated recoveries of 10 100 μg l standard additions to distilled water and groundwater sample matrices showed recoveries between 120 20 a set of six samples between 40 μg l and 170 μg l were sent to a commercial laboratory at bcsir for cross laboratory verification and showed consistent results with rsd between the sets at 9 3 2 comparison of field kit and laboratory hg aas results a total of 314 arsenic field test kit measurements were run across 21 water samples and 14 different field test kit boxes of the eight commercial products arsenic concentrations ranged from 1 to 200 μg l in water samples of various background matrices including laboratory arsenic standards in di water and well water samples a panel of five experienced field kit users in bangladesh were asked to determine if the samples were above or below 50 μg l by color matching of the test strips to standard colors on the reference charts provided by the manufacturers their evaluation was then compared to the hg aas verified arsenic concentrations of the same samples fig 1 thus the errors in the kit measurements could include both user based errors manual color matching and kit based errors based on test strip colors coming out too light or too dark compared to color chart points corresponding to hg aas verified arsenic concentrations based on the results shown in fig 1 the kits were ranked based on three factors first the highest overall percentage of user responses in agreement with the hg aas measurements led to the following ranking with agreement value in parenthesis econo quick c 86 lamotte b 86 quick ii f 79 merck h 77 quick e 76 econo quick ii d 61 wagtech g 61 hach a 59 second the overall lowest percentage of user responses indicating a sample was 50 μg l when the hg aas measurements indicated it was 50 μg l false positives led to the following ranking with false positives in parenthesis merck h 0 econo quick c 1 quick e 4 lamotte b 6 quick ii f 12 econo quick ii d 39 wagtech g 39 hach a 40 third the overall lowest percentage of user responses indicating a sample was 50 μg l when the hg aas measurements indicated it was 50 μg l false negatives led to the following ranking with false negatives in parenthesis hach a 0 econo quick ii d 0 wagtech g 0 lamotte b 9 quick ii f 9 econo quick c 13 quick e 20 merck h 23 from the overall percentage of responses in agreement with aas and considering that false positives underestimating arsenic are far worse than false negatives overestimating arsenic for making decisions about well water safety according to the bangladesh national standard it is apparent that the hach a wagtech g and econo quick ii d were the three most poorly performing kits fig 2 shows arsenic concentrations estimated by the x rite color scanner of field test kit results y axis versus the arsenic concentrations measured using hg aas x axis human based color matching errors were effectively eliminated with the use of a color scanner thus the differences between the x rite color scanner results and the hg aas results are solely attributable to kit based errors without kit based errors results would have an intercept of 0 and a slope equal to 1 see ideal kit in top left panel linear fits to the data in fig 2 show the degree to which a field test kit conformed to this error free ideal a slope greater than 1 indicates a positive bias i e the field test kit estimates a higher concentration than the hg aas measured value while a value less than 1 indicates a negative bias i e the field test kit underestimates the concentration a lack of linearity and slopes greater than or less than 1 indicate kit based sources of error in the field test kit measurement this analysis is similar to the one used in an earlier study for evaluating the relative accuracy and precision of three arsenic field test kits including the hach kit george et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the lamotte b quick e and quick ii f kits had slopes closest to 1 1 2 1 3 indicating they were relatively accurate but with a slight positive bias tendency to overestimate the merck h kit had a slope of 0 73 indicating that it was relatively accurate but had a slight negative bias tendency to underestimate the econo quick c kit had a slope much greater than 1 2 0 indicating a large positive bias the remaining three kits hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g had much lower slopes 0 20 0 41 indicating a substantial negative bias a high degree of precision was found in case of econo quick c r2 0 94 lamotte b r2 0 88 wagtech g r2 0 86 and quick ii f r2 0 82 kits implying consistency in measurements across a range of concentrations in contrast the linearity was poor for the quick e r2 0 63 merck h r2 0 54 hach a r2 0 47 and econo quick ii d r2 0 33 kits indicating high variability in field test kit response across several samples based on the slope and linearity analyses the lamotte b and the quick ii f kits performed best in terms of accuracy and precision the econo quick c quick e merck h and wagtech g kits were either accurate or precise but not both interestingly while the econo quick kit showed a high positive bias tendency to overestimate it did so in a very consistent manner r2 0 94 suggesting that a re calibrated color chart with darker color blocks would result in better accuracy the wagtech g kit on the other hand while precise r2 0 86 consistently and significantly underestimates arsenic concentration indicating a re calibrated color chart will likely be unreliable due to the lighter colors generated overall based on the high degree of underestimation and the corresponding greatest number of false positives we classify three kits hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g as performing poorly as a result samples with concentrations higher than 100 μg l were assessed by these kits to be below 50 μg l furthermore these results suggest the false positives in panelist responses i e misclassification of water samples above the drinking water standard as meeting the standard for these three kits were largely due to kit based errors the poor performance of the hach kit is especially concerning given it is currently the most widely used and only readily available kit on the market in bangladesh based on the poor results discussed above four additional lots of the hach kit were acquired and tested in bangladesh between january 2017 and february 2018 the potential interference caused by the optional sulfide removal step in the procedure was also investigated in these additional tests the results si section s3 confirmed the initial finding that the hach kit substantially underestimates the concentration of arsenic 3 3 laboratory generated color charts with reference to fig 3 all colors were regenerated from x rite scans of the test strips or manufacturer charts respectively as described in the methods section for the manufacturer calibrations we represented only four points from their respective color charts 0 25 50 100 as these were points that overlapped for all color charts the authors note that the eye test for the reproduced manufacturer color charts shows some variability most notably in case of the zero values scanning artifacts may arise based on the quality of the color chart image and the material on which it is printed while a reasonable zero value white color blocks resulted from the scans of the paper based charts for kits b c d e f g scans of the charts of kits a and h produced noticeably darker off white colors compared to unreacted test strips this problem was particularly acute for the hach a kit where a laminated color chart affixed to a curved box surface resulted in a rather dark gray zero concentration block to overcome this limitation the hach manufacturer calibration shown in fig 3 and the analysis based on it in fig 2 was re generated from a color scan of a re printed digital image of the hach a color chart from the manufacturer rather using the color scan of the chart affixed to the kit box see section s2 of the supplementary information for a further discussion and resolution of this issue as shown in fig 3 laboratory generated color charts differ substantially from the manufacturer provided color charts for several kits the greatest color difference between the manufacturer s and laboratory generated color charts occurred with the hach a and econo quick ii d kits which showed considerable negative bias in fig 2 as well as the econo quick c kit which showed substantial positive bias these results imply that kit based calibration errors could be addressed through laboratory calibration of field test kits using known standards especially when the actual kit performance led to darker color blocks than the manufacturer provided color chart for all field test kits and samples analyzed the laboratory color blocks generated from arsenic standards prepared in di water closely resemble the colors generated from field samples at near equivalent concentrations this indicates water sample matrix effects are unlikely to have played a significant role in poor kit performance observed in our studies fig 3 also illustrates the variability that arises when the same sample is tested multiple times this variability of color difference among triplicates in fig 3 is a measure of precision a lack of color reproducibility is seen most clearly with the hach a econo quick ii d and merck h kits these kits also showed low r2 values in fig 2 another indication of non calibration kit based precision error as mentioned previously laboratory calibration does not address this error it should be noted that we were unable to generate similar color charts in fig 3 with the lamotte b and wagtech g kits due to logistical challenges of ordering and obtaining test strips for these two kits while in bangladesh 4 discussion 4 1 implications in bangladesh it is common practice to make decisions on which water sources are safe to use based on a single field test kit result and whether the value is above or below the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l rahman et al 2002 therefore it is imperative that the field test kits perform accurately enough for the purpose of classifying samples against the relevant drinking water standards furthermore stakeholders who use these field test kits must understand the potential shortcomings of a kit including its tendency to overestimate or underestimate arsenic concentrations and the magnitude of precision and accuracy errors in this study the hach a econo quick ii d and wagtech g tended to underestimate arsenic concentrations leading to false positive assessments as noted previously a recent study also reported significant underestimation by the hach a kit and the quick econo ii kit kearns et al 2019 but samples were acidified for later kit analysis instead of being tested right away which could have contributed to the poor results in the case of econo quick ii d the recommended diluting and re testing samples that test above 30 μg l was not implemented also a possible source of suboptimal performance the hach a kit was used in the government backed well screening program in bangladesh which tested over five million water access points between 2000 and 2004 the accuracy of the hach kit was questioned by a study in 2002 rahman et al 2002 a subsequent study van geen et al 2005 reported good agreement between hach kit results and laboratory graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy gf aas measurements and improved accuracy when the reaction time was increased to 40 min others have found improved performance for the hach kit with increasing the reaction time as well george et al 2012 health and islam 2012 kearns and tyson 2012 steinmaus et al 2006 despite these findings manufacturer provided instructions continue to state a 20 min reaction time should be used for the hach kit and based on our observations this is still the procedure followed by government and ngo field test kit users in bangladesh given that the hach a kit is the only readily available field kit on the market in bangladesh at the time of writing this article these findings should be cause for concern to ngos and government employees who use this kit for discerning acceptable water quality the lamotte b and quick ii f kits performed best but at more than 4 usd per test they are the most expensive table 1 and not significantly cheaper than instrument based laboratory methods 6 30 usd per test which are more accurate these performance findings are consistent with previous studies kaufman et al 2003 spear et al 2006 the quick e kit offers slightly lower accuracy at less than half the cost 1 8 usd per test a finding also consistent with a previous study abbgy et al 2002 while the lamotte b econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f kits recommend diluting and re analyzing samples that test above 30 μg l 30 μg l 50 μg l and 10 μg l respectively this additional step was not performed in the present study it is possible that implementing this step would have further improved the performance of these three kits the econo quick c merck h and quick e kits were either accurate or precise but not both in our study a prior study using the merck h jakariya et al 2007 kit reported good performance and a low rate of misclassification of the true arsenic concentration based on color matching to the manufacturer provided color charts the econo quick c kit is the cheapest kit 0 6 usd per test among the group we tested a study by spear et al 2006 reported average performance of this kit with a negative bias in the limited samples tested more recent and extensive studies with the kit have indicated good performance george et al 2012 van geen et al 2014 but with a positive bias at higher concentrations another study arias et al 2014 indicates that the econo quick c kit showed high agreement 97 with laboratory methods when used on groundwater samples but lower agreement 68 when used on surface waters suggesting the potential of matrix affects with surface water van geen et al 2019 report that the kit tends to overestimate by a factor of two the arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l with a very low rate of false positives samples that were actually higher than the drinking water standard being classified as meeting standard in our study we saw this tendency to overestimate by a factor of two across the entire range of arsenic concentrations tested 10 200 μg l for this kit however we acknowledge that our sample size in the concentration range below 50 μg l is limited the most recent multiple index cluster survey report bbs and unicef 2015 utilized the econo quick c kit this kit has the potential to offer a more reliable alternative to the hach kit in bangladesh at a similar cost per test the substantial but consistent positive bias we observed with this kit could be corrected by recalibration even without recalibration it is a superior alternative as the health implications of overestimating arsenic concentration are far less severe than those associated with underestimating it given that our study did not investigate variability between multiple lots of a kit except for the hach kit it is possible that the findings for other kits reported here may not be representative of performance averaged over multiple lots repeating these tests over several different lots of each kit would build a stronger body of evidence of the relative performance of each kit as reported here and whether quality control is a general concern from one kit to the next 4 2 ease of use user preference and ability to perform field test kit procedures accurately can be influenced by the ease of use of a field test kit arora et al 2009 field test kits were assessed based on the ease of use considering several factors that were identified through interviews of field test kit users these included a procedure number of active steps number of reagents b packaging reagents bottle cap overall packaging c color chart range of concentrations type of color chart e g paper paper with a viewing aperture in the middle of color tile printed on bottle etc number of color tiles around 10 μg l number of color tiles around 50 μg l and d instruction manual language instruction clarity the authors also subjectively ranked the kits against each parameter see si table s1 the procedures and packaging for hach a wagtech g and merck h kits were rated highly e g the procedures were easy to follow and the reagent packaging made it simple to use however their color charts and instruction manuals did not rate as well when compared to others the lamotte b econo quick c econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f procedures ranked lower but their color charts and the clarity of instruction manuals generally rated higher 5 conclusions the findings of this study raise concerns with the performance of several of the kits tested especially those that underestimate arsenic concentration and result in false positives the findings were similar across a range of field samples including engineered and natural water sources and laboratory standards which demonstrates poor results across a broad range of sample matrices and concentrations one way of addressing kit based errors due to manufacturer calibration chart bias is to use custom calibrations viz scanner generated color blocks of verified arsenic standard solutions for a given kit this offers a promising option for making the econo quick c kit which showed a consistent positive bias more accurate however this approach does not address all errors associated with poorly performing kits such as the hach a and econo quick ii d kits which in addition to high inaccuracy in the 10 100 μg l range also exhibited poor reproducibility and low color intensity making color matching unreliable for the hach kit in particular the manufacturer should consider the results of a number of studies cited in this work that indicate the current kit with a reaction time of 20 min is inadequate and either modify the kit chemical component amounts or the procedures including reaction time accordingly so that the color chart provided is more representative of the kit s actual performance in the field more broadly the results of this study suggest that field test kit results should be viewed only as a preliminary indication of potential arsenic contamination stakeholders should carefully consider whether the benefits of using periodic field test kit results outweigh the risks of an inaccurate assessment and a false positive result versus conducting a more accurate and expensive laboratory instrumental analysis of water samples at a minimum re testing samples found to be close to the relevant drinking water standard e g 10 or 50 μg l would be prudent to reduce the number of misclassified drinking water sources as safe i e below the national arsenic standard when they are not before use manufacturers and users of arsenic field test kits would benefit by being able to evaluate each kit against a verified arsenic standard in order to confirm that the calibration chart provided by a manufacturer accurately reflects the colors produced by the kit the industrial testing systems its kits econo quick c econo quick ii d quick e and quick ii f recommend testing a diluted inorganic standard for familiarization with the kit while the merck h kit procedure suggests it as a quality assurance protocol but neither kit provides a standard leading us to believe that this would rarely happen in practice manufacturers should consider producing certified standards in the concentrations of interest for high volume test kit users to purchase for quality assurance if challenges of safety and stability can be ensured providing aliquots of a verified arsenic standard in each kit would allow users to test whether the kit is
