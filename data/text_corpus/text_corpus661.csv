3305,hourly precipitation data from 1971 to 2020 collected from 98 stations distributed across the yellow river basin were analyzed to detect changes in characteristics on rainfall and rainfall erosivity for all storms and storms with extreme erosivity greater than 90th percentile results showed that over the past 50 years rainfall erosivity at both event and seasonal scales over the whole basin increased significantly p 0 05 with rates of 5 46 and 6 86 decade 1 respectively compared to the 1981 2010 average values approximate 80 of 98 stations showed increasing trends and 20 of stations had statistically significant trends p 0 1 the increase of rainfall erosivity resulted from the significant increasing trends of average storm precipitation p 0 1 duration p 0 1 rainfall energy p 0 05 and maximum 1 h intensity p 0 05 in addition the total extreme erosivity showed significant upward trends at a relative rate of 6 05 decade 1 p 0 05 extreme erosivity storms occurred more frequently and with higher rainfall energy during the study period p 0 05 trends for seasonal total and extreme erosivity were also estimated based on daily rainfall data and the changing magnitudes were similar to those based on hourly rainfall data which suggested daily rainfall can be applied to detect interannual and long term variations of rainfall erosivity in the absence of rainfall data with higher resolution it was suggested that soil and water conservation strategies and vegetation projects conducted within the yellow river basin should be continued and enhanced in the future keywords yellow river basin rainfall erosivity extreme precipitation sediment reduction climate change 1 introduction the increase in atmospheric temperatures caused by climate change induces a more intense global water cycle leading to greater evaporation rates and increased water vapor contents in the atmosphere the additional latent heating caused by the increased moisture convergence is resulting in the increase of heavy and extreme precipitation and the decrease of trace light and moderate precipitation gordon et al 1992 mason et al 1999 goswami et al 2006 qian et al 2007 shiu et al 2012 extreme rainfall is expected to change under warming with respect to its duration frequency and intensity goswami et al 2006 swain et al 2018 moreover the increasing temperature may also change precipitation s temporal and spatial patterns wasko sharma 2015 wasko et al 2016 it was reported that temporal patterns were less uniform and the peak precipitation was more intense as temperatures increase wasko and sharma 2015 visser et al 2021 and the spatial extent of storms had tended to decrease as well wasko et al 2016 previous studies have typically used daily rainfall data to detect long term trends in precipitation and extremes as daily rainfall data are readily available and usually have long temporal series goswami et al 2006 miao et al 2016 papalexiou and montanari 2019 however daily data have limitations for describing storm characteristics and inter storm structures yu et al 2010 daily data overestimate rainfall duration and underestimate rainfall intensity and do not depict the peak intensity well hourly observations allow the examination of sub daily storm characteristics and precipitation intensities li et al 2013 yin et al 2007 yin et al 2011 yu et al 2010 and reveal the behavior of the tails of the distribution of precipitation papalexiou et al 2018 yin et al 2011 used hourly data to detect the long term trend of precipitation in the haihe river basin although the rainfall hours and amounts during summer june to august decreased consistently over the basin the mean and peak intensities of short duration storms duration 6 h increased for most stations moreover the literature has shown that long term trends of rainfall intensity using hourly data may differ from those using daily data li et al 2008 yu et al 2010 zhai et al 2005 westra et al 2014 based on daily rainfall li et al 2008 reported that the daily rainfall intensity in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river valley showed a significant increase while the trend in north china was insignificant however based on hourly rainfall yu et al 2010 reported a negative rainfall intensity change for the yangtze river valley and a significant positive trend in north china high resolution precipitation data are also crucial in soil loss prediction foster 2004 rainfall is the main force that can detach and transport soil particles from the soil surface and lead to water induced soil erosion and rainfall erosivity describes the potential capacity of rainfall to cause soil loss the commonly used variables related to rainfall erosivity calculations in empirical soil loss prediction tools such as storm rainfall kinetic energy e and the maximum 30 min intensity i 30 are all event based variables that should be derived from the sub daily data foster 2004 renard et al 1997 wischmeier 1959 the increase in rainfall intensity and frequency of extreme events may enhance the likelihood of soil erosion ipcc 2021 long term high resolution sub daily precipitation data is one of primary choices that can be used to detect the variation in trends of rainfall erosivity fiener et al 2013 klik and konecny 2013 meusburger et al 2012 because of the limited availability of aforementioned data the statistical models related to more widely available daily rainfall data have been developed to approximate the rainfall erosivity estimated by hyetograph rainfall data xie et al 2016 ma et al 2014 yu and rosewell 1996 and detect the long term variation trends lai et al 2016 wang et al 2017 ma et al 2014 qin et al 2016 xin et al 2011 it is reasonable to assume that the sub daily rainfall with higher resolution can depict rainfall intensity more accurately compared with daily rainfall yin et al 2018 however whether there are discrepancies between long term trends derived from sub daily and daily rainfall data is unknown the yellow river huang he regarded as the mother river of china is the second largest river in china and one of the most important water supplies in northern china due to the geographic features including erodible loess soil steep slopes and human activities the environmental system of the yellow river basin is unique fragile and sensitive to climate change the main objectives of this research are to 1 detect long term trends in storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity related variables for all storms and storms with extreme erosivity greater than 90th percentile in the yellow river basin 2 evaluate the influence of data resolution on the determination of rainfall erosivity trends the findings may offer insights into the changing nature of storm extremes and contribute to informed decisions about regional soil conservation strategies and sediment control within the yellow river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the yellow river basin is located in north central china 95 53 e 1119 5 e 32 10 n 41 50 n fig 1 the total length of the river is 5 500 km and the river basin covers 752 000 km2 tang et al 2008 originating from the tibetan plateau it flows through the loess plateau and the eastern alluvial plain and finally enters the bohai sea the elevation of the catchment ranges from 5000 to 0 m from the western source region to the eastern river mouth the main basin is successively influenced by arid semiarid continental and monsoon climates the mean annual precipitation across the entire basin is approximately 443 mm the observed hourly precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma which provided basic quality control li et al 2011 the precipitation was recorded with self recording siphon rain gauges and the pluviograph self recording papers were digitized by the meteorological bureaus of each province since the siphon rain gauges did not operate in winter to avoid freezing failures only the data during the warm season may to september of the yellow river basin were available which included more than 87 of the annual total precipitation further quality control was conducted to select stations with continuous hourly series from 1971 to 2020 and the warm season may to september as follows 1 stations with any entire month of missing observations from may to september were excluded 2 stations with missing hourly observations for entire data series more than 5 were excluded 3 stations with any year with missing observations per year more than 25 were excluded after these criteria were applied 33 53 and 12 stations a total of 98 were selected from the upper reach middle reach and lower reach respectively hours with missing observations throughout the warm season for 98 stations were infilled with a linear interpolation method using the hourly precipitation before and after the missing hour 2 2 storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity indices precipitation data were analyzed at the event scale in this study the continuous observed data series were divided into individual storms by a minimum inter event dry time of 6 h wischmeier 1959 if a dry period between two rainy periods was shorter than 6 h the successive rainy periods were considered as one storm and if it was longer than 6 h two separate storms were obtained following this procedure hourly data of each station can be divided into separated event storms for a single storm with an observed interval δ t δ t 1 h in this study the following storm characteristics were calculated using eqs 1 3 as presented below 1 d n δ t 2 p m 1 n p m 3 i p d in eqs 1 3 d represented the storm duration h n was the number of observed intervals during a storm p m represented the precipitation in the m th interval mm p represented the event storm precipitation mm and i represented the average intensity during a storm the number of storms occurring in the warm season in one year was denoted as nws and the sum of p throughout the warm season of one year was denoted as pws the 30 min rainfall intensity index ei30 is commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity of a storm in the universal soil loss equation usle and its successors for soil loss prediction foster 2004 wischmeier 1959 renard et al 1997 ei30 was defined as the product of rainfall kinetic energy e and the maximum 30 min intensity of a storm i 30 the total energy e mj ha 1 for an event storm obtained was as presented below 4 e m 1 n e m p m where n is the number of uniform intensity periods for a storm e m mj mm 1 ha 1 was the unit rainfall kinetic energy of per unit area per unit rainfall depth in the m th uniform intensity period in which the rainfall intensity was considered uniform p m mm is the rainfall depth for the m th period the unit rainfall energy e m was calculated using equation 5 as presented in the rusle2 documentation foster 2004 5 e m 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 082 i m and i m was the rainfall intensity for the m th hour mm h 1 as the recorded points from pluviograph breakpoint rainfall data represent times of discernable changes of rainfall intensity e and i 30 calculated from the pluviograph breakpoint rainfall data are the most accurate due to the limited availability of the aforementioned data and the hourly rainfall data can provide partial details of intensity changes during a storm e and i 30 can be approximately estimated using hourly data by following the method developed by yin et al 2007 yin et al 2007 reported that the e h rainfall energy obtained directly from hourly data i 1h the maximum hourly intensity and ei30 h rainfall intensity index obtained directly from hourly data have a systematical underestimation compared with that derived from breakpoint rainfall data and can be adjusted by multiplying adjustment factors of 1 105 1 668 and 1 73 respectively therefore e i 30 and e i 30 of a storm can be approximated by 6 e 1 105 e h 7 i 30 1 668 i 1 h 8 e i 30 1 73 e h i 1 h following eq 6 eq 8 the average e i30 and ei30 throughout the warm season were calculated annually the summation of e i 30 throughout the warm season for all storms were denoted as r s ws with a unit of mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 to detect the influence of data temporal resolution on rainfall erosivity hourly rainfall was also aggregated into daily rainfall and used to estimate rainfall erosivity at a daily scale with the following equation xie et al 2016 9 r d 0 2686 1 0 5412 cos π 6 j 7 π 6 p d 1 7265 where r d represented the rainfall erosivity for a rainy day j represented the month from 1 january to 12 december and pd represented the daily rainfall mm rainfall erosivity throughout the warm season using daily rainfall was defined as the summation of r d and denoted as r d ws five rainfall characteristics p ws n ws p d i and five erosive indexes i 30 e ei30 r s ws and r d ws were calculated annually for each station meanwhile six extreme erosive indexes were defined and analyzed at both event storm and daily scale for each station the threshold of the 90th percentile of ei30 values can be determined at event scale and the threshold of the 90th percentile of r d can be determined at daily scale then storms or rainy days with rainfall erosivity greater than the corresponding threshold were defined as extreme erosive storms days the average e and i 30 for these extreme storms over the warm season were denoted as e90 and i 30 90 and the sum of extreme ei30 throughout the warm season was denoted as r s 90 the sum of extreme daily erosivity was denoted as r d 90 the number of extreme erosive storms and erosive days were denoted as n s 90 and n d 90 respectively all these 16 indexes were analyzed with trend and field significance tests as described in the following section 2 3 2 3 trend analysis we used a rank based mann kendall test mk test to estimate the observed monotonic trends and their corresponding significance levels mann 1945 kendall 1948 since the autocorrelation in the time series can influence the mk test results yue and wang 2002 the trend free pre whitening method was adopted to remove the serial correlations before applying the mk test chu et al 2010 von storch 1995 the two tailed test standardized statistic index z for a tested series was used to determine the temporal trend the null hypothesis was that there was no monotonic trend in the time series if z was larger than 1 645 1 96 or 2 576 the null hypothesis was rejected at the p 0 1 0 05 or 0 01 significance levels respectively z greater than 0 implied an increasing trend z 0 a decreasing trend z 0 no trend we also used the nonparametric theil sen estimator to calculate the slopes β of the trends sen 1968 theil 1992 xu et al 2003 positive and negative β values indicated upward and downward trends respectively we expressed the expected 10 year decadal change t with the fitted trend line as follows 10 t 10 β the relative tendency was also determined by comparing t during the study period 1971 2020 with the 30 year 1981 2010 standard normal of the tested indices wmo 2017 the standard normal was the average from 1981 to 2010 and was denoted as m in the following equation the relative tendency rt was defined as follows wang et al 2017 11 rt t 1971 2020 m 1981 2010 100 indices introduced in section 2 2 were calculated annually then the long term trends for each station were assessed we also applied a resampling based bootstrap procedure to assess the field significance of the mk test over the whole basin for all variables renard et al 2008 westra et al 2012 a bootstrap procedure was suggested by douglas et al 2000 to assess the field significance given the original data set denote as s0 consists of records from all stations for m years the following steps outline the bootstrap procedure 1 sample m years with replacement from the years used in the original data set s0 using the records from corresponding sampled years for all stations to form new data set s1 2 perform a statistical test on each station for data set s1 denote the number of stations with significant results as n 1 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 for m iterations to form new bootstrapped data sets s1 s2 sm so that n 1 n 2 n m are found 4 determine the field significance based on the sampled distribution n i i 1 m at given level α by calculating the critical value corresponding to 1 α quantile of n i i 1 m for a specific index there is a matric of 98 rows stations 50 columns years the rows denote the spatial location and columns denote the time series the magnitude of variation trends for the whole basin and three reaches was estimated by 1 interpolating the annual value of stations within the basin using an ordinary kriging method for each year 2 calculating the mean value of all pixels for the basin and three reaches and 3 calculating and testing long term trends using the mk test and theil sen estimator moreover a sequential mk test was also applied in this study to detect the turning point of the interpolated temporal series turning point was defined as the intersections of the sequential statistics of progressive uf and retrograde ub the backward series of uf series uf 1 645 or 1 96 represents the series is significant at p 0 1 or 0 05 level respectively and the turning point indicated the start of the changing phenomenon detailed procedure can be found in sneyers 1990 3 results 3 1 general statistics of storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity the average total seasonal precipitation during the warm season was 355 6 mm with a total of 41 5 storms on average for the 98 stations at an event scale the average storm precipitation p duration d and intensity i over 50 years across the 98 stations were 8 7 mm 8 h and 1 2 mm h 1 with a standard deviation of 2 6 mm 1 5 h and 0 3 mm h 1 respectively compared with the average and standard deviation of i i 30 was characterized with 4 6 times of the average and 6 3 times of the standard deviation the average seasonal rainfall erosivity over the 98 stations of the yellow river basin throughout the warm season was 1196 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 with a standard deviation of 984 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 this is approximately the median value 50th of the global erosivity reported by panagos et al 2017 storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity occurring in the warm season differed depending on the section of stream at the event scale the p i i 30 e ei30 of the lower reach were all the greatest among the three reaches fig 2 although the frequency of storms in the lower reach was the least among the three river sections this indicated that storms occurring in the lower reach were characterized by greater erosive potential indeed the total rainfall erosivity throughout the warm season in the lower reach was much greater than other areas over the basin with an average of 3592 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 while that in the upper reach and middle reach were 534 9 and 1066 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 respectively the differences in storm characteristics from the three basins may be explained by the climate type and sea land location the stations located in the lower reach are closer to the coast and are more deeply affected by the summer monsoon compared with inland areas and the supply of moisture is more abundant there than at inland stations 3 2 long term trends for storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity 3 2 1 trends for storm characteristics based on mk test the temporal series of interpolated seasonal precipitation pws over the yellow river basin showed a significant increasing trend during the study period p 0 1 at a rate of 10 43 mm decade 1 tables 1 and 2 stations with increasing trends accounted for 82 7 and were distributed over the whole basin while several stations with decreasing trends were concentrated in the southwestern part of the upper reach and in the western part of the lower reach fig 3 a among all 98 stations 15 3 stations were significant at p 0 1 level field significance test showed that the increasing trends of the whole basin the upper reach and the middle reach were significant at p 0 1 level fig 4 a table 2 as the number of storms nws occurring during the warm season showed no significant trend fig 4b the increasing trend of pws should be attributed to the change of event storm precipitation event storm precipitation p for the whole basin and its three reaches showed consistent significant increasing trends p 0 1 table 1 fig 2c for the whole basin p increased at a rate of 0 22 mm decade 1 compared with the mean value during 1981 2010 p changed at a relative trend rt of 2 80 decade 1 stations with positive trends distributed across three reaches and stations with significant increasing trends accounted for 19 4 p 0 1 fig 3c table 2 based on the analyzing of storm duration d and rainfall intensity i we found that the shift of p was closely related to the significant increase of d p 0 1 as i changed insignificantly there were 19 4 of stations showed significant increasing trends for d p 0 1 fig 4d and its spatial distribution was similar with that of p fig 3c d in combination with above trends for storms occurring within the basin it s clear to see that the storm characteristics were changing towards greater precipitation amount and longer duration during the past 50 years 3 2 2 trends for rainfall erosivity rainfall erosivity index of a storm ei30 of the yellow river basin showed a significantly increasing trend at a rate of 1 34 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 p 0 05 table 1 table 2 compared with the average value during the baseline period 1981 2010 the relative tendency rt was 5 46 decade 1 a turning point occurred from approximately 1990 and the trend became significant in approximately 1997 fig 5 f 22 4 of the stations had significant increasing trends p 0 1 which were mainly distributed in the upper and the middle reaches fig 3h based on the significance test the changing trends were found to be significant at these two reaches and increased at magnitudes of 1 10 p 0 05 and 1 23 mj mm ha 1h 1 decade 1 p 0 1 respectively table 1 based on the hourly data we can surmise that the combination of significant increasing trends of rainfall energy e and maximum 30 min intensity i 30 resulted in the increase in rainfall erosivity index at event scale for the whole basin the upper reach and the middle reach table 1 table 2 among all stations within the basin 83 7 and 80 6 of stations showed increasing trends and 23 5 and 19 4 of stations had significant trends at the p 0 1 level table 2 respectively for e and i 30 and the trends were also particularly significant in the upper reach where the significant ratios p 0 1 accounted for 27 3 and 27 3 for e and i 30 respectively storms within the yellow river basin were found to shift towards having greater rainfall energy and peak storm intensity as a result rainfall erosivity index ei30 at event scale became greater during the study period increasing trend for the summation of storm ei30 during the warm season r s ws was statistically significant during the study period table 2 this may be mainly related to the significant increasing trends for storm ei30 the trend for r s ws was 68 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 decade 1 compared with the baseline period r s ws increased by an rt of 6 86 decade 1 table 1 the turning point occurred around 1990 and the trend became significant in the approximate year as the storm ei30 fig 5g h the stations with increasing trends account for 85 7 of 98 stations and they were distributed across the upper reach and the western part of the middle reach and the eastern part of the lower reach fig 3i 21 4 of stations had significant trends at the p 0 1 level table 2 increasing trend of rainfall erosivity during the warm season detected using daily rainfall and the daily model was also significant while with a slightly lower rate tables 1 and 2 fig 4j the spatial pattern of the trend for r d ws was similar with that for r s ws fig 3i j 3 3 long term trends for extreme erosive index trend analysis showed that the seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity r s 90 which was the summation of ei30 that exceeded the 90th percentile threshold had increasing trend during the past 50 years with an increase of 48 97 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 and a relative rate of 6 05 decade 1 p 0 05 fig 7 table 3 field significance test revealed that the increasing trend of r s 90 was significant over the whole basin at p 0 05 table 4 stations with significant increasing trends for r s 90 account for 21 4 of the stations and they were distributed across the upper reach and the middle reach fig 6 a the increase of r s 90 was mainly attributed to storms with extreme rainfall erosivity shifting towards having greater frequency and stronger event rainfall energy p 0 05 fig 7 table 4 the increasing trends for n s 90 and e 90 were both significant at event scale at p 0 05 level table 4 moreover significant increasing trends were found for n s 90 and e 90 in the upper reach p 0 05 table 3 trends of total seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity exceeding the 90th percentile daily erosivity threshold r d 90 and its frequency n d 90 were also estimated and the trends were significant at p 0 05 and p 0 1 level respectively in general the spatial distribution of trends for r d 90 and n d 90 were similar with that for r s 90 and n s 90 fig 6a d table 4 based on daily precipitation aggregated from hourly data r d 90 and n d 90 over the whole basin increased at rates of 57 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 and 0 24 decade 1 respectively table 3 the pre whitened series based on the interpolated r s 90 r d 90 n s 90 n d 90 e 90 for the whole basin were plotted in fig 8 the 5 year moving average in red dots depicted the increasing trends during past five decades clearly for most variables the turning point occurred after 2000 and became significant in approximately 2015 in comparison the trend of e 90 is not obvious and the interpolated basin average fluctuated around the mean value this may be because 1 the increasing rate was 0 12 mj ha 1 decade 1 and the relative trend was 1 82 decade 1 which was statistically significant but very small in value 2 ratios of increasing stations and significant increasing stations were lower than that for other variables 4 discussion significant increasing trends were found for rainfall erosivity ei30 of the whole basin p 0 05 the upper p 0 05 and middle reaches p 0 1 by definition ei30 is a function of rainfall energy e and maximum 30 min intensity i 30 and e mainly depends on the unit rainfall intensity unit rainfall amount and storm duration during a storm wischmeier 1959 during the past 50 years storm duration d increased significantly and storm intensity i changed insignificantly which directly led to the increase of storm precipitation p and indirectly led to the increase of storm rainfall energy e meanwhile i 30 increased significantly p 0 05 as a result ei30 showed significant increasing trend at the study period significant increasing trend was also found for the total rainfall erosivity during the warm season r s ws r s ws is the sum of rainfall erosivity ei30 for storms that occur in the warm season in other words storm ei30 and number of storms nws are two main factors that may have influence on the variation of r s ws as the storm ei30 increasing nws showed no significant trend therefore the increase of rainfall erosivity at event scale was the main reason leading to the increase of seasonal rainfall erosivity it can be inferred that the combination of increasing trends for storm characteristics p d and e i 30 lead to the significant increasing trends of event ei30 and r s ws which drive the yellow river basin to higher potential risk of regional rainfall erosivity daily precipitation data can be used to estimate rainfall erosivity and its temporal trend when precipitation data in finer resolution is unavailable however the discrepancies between the validity of using sub daily rainfall and daily rainfall to detect the temporal trends is rarely discussed in previous studies in this study rainfall erosivity was estimated using both hourly data and daily data based on the storm based models of rusle2 and yin et al 2007 and the daily based model developed by xie et al 2016 the comparison of seasonal rainfall erosivity obtained using two resolutions of data was showed in figs 9 a b and 10 it can be seen from fig 9a that r s ws was generally larger than r d ws when seasonal r ws values greater than 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 but for the interpolated results the bias was reversed that most points were on the top of the 1 1 line fig 9b indicating that the interpolated r ws values were strongly smoothed by smaller values r s ws and r d ws showed similar spatial distribution patterns fig 10a b seasonal rainfall erosivity during the warm season decreased from the southeast to the northwest basin meanwhile r d ws values in the lower reach were systematically lower than r s ws whereas r d ws were systematically lager than r s ws in most areas of the middle and upper reaches this may be because only four stations located in the eastern area of the middle reach were involved in the development of the daily based model xie et al 2016 fig 9c d showed the temporal variation of the interpolated seasonal rainfall erosivity and extreme rainfall erosivity derived based on event scale r s ws and r s 90 and daily scale r d ws and r d 90 the magnitudes of trends estimated by theil sen estimator for r s ws and r s 90 were similar with those of r d ws and r d 90 tables 1 3 and the linear fitted lines showed this again field significance results showed that both trends of r s ws and r d ws over the yellow river basin were significant at p 0 05 level and the same to those of extreme rainfall erosivity variables r s 90 and r d 90 and n s 90 and n d 90 this indicated that daily precipitation data and the daily equation developed by xie et al 2016 can be applied to detect and describe the changing trend of seasonal and extreme rainfall erosivity in the absence of rainfall data with higher resolution if other soil erosion factors such as soil topography vegetation cover and conservation measures remain constant the increase in rainfall erosivity can contribute to an increase in the potential soil erosion risk and is expected to increase the sediment yield of the yellow river basin however a continuous and obvious decrease of sediment load of the yellow river has been observed since 1950s for example the annual sediment load discharged to the bohai sea observed at lijin gauging station the last hydrographic station before the river enters the sea decreased from 1 21 gt a 1 during 1952 1970 to 0 61 gt a 1 during 1971 2000 and 0 13 gt a 1 during 2001 2016 this is mainly because human activities have greater impact on the reduction of sediment load of the yellow river basin compared with the increasing rainfall erosivity yao et al 2016 human activities such as the construction of check dams and reservoirs soil and water conservation measures and large scale vegetation recovery projects have significantly improved the vegetation coverage of the midstream region and greatly reduced the soil erosion from the loess plateau sun et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in other words human activities have been the primary factors driving changes in the sediment load of the basin considering the significant increase in rainfall erosivity and extreme precipitation the soil and water conservation measures and vegetation recovery projects conducted within the basin should be continued and enhanced in the future 5 conclusions high resolution hourly precipitation data were collected from 98 stations dispersed throughout the yellow river basin to investigate the long term trends of storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity from 1971 to 2020 during the warm season may to september the main conclusions were as follows 1 for the yellow river basin rainfall erosivity at both event and seasonal scales became greater during the past five decades which may lead to increased potential risk of regional soil erosion the increase of rainfall erosivity resulted from the significant increasing trends of event storm precipitation p duration d rainfall energy e and maximum 1 h intensity i 1h compared with the average value during the baseline period 1981 2010 the seasonal average values of p d e and i 1h increased by relative rates of 2 80 1 77 3 40 and 2 64 decade 1 respectively approximate 20 of 98 stations had statistically significant increasing trends p 0 1 2 moreover storms with extreme rainfall erosivity tended to occur more frequently and intensively and total extreme rainfall erosivity occurring within the yellow river basin became increasingly greater significant upward trends were found for total seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity r s 90 frequency n s 90 and rainfall energy e90 for storms with rainfall erosivity exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of erosivity p 0 05 3 daily rainfall can be applied to detect interannual and long term variations of rainfall erosivity the changing magnitudes and significance level were similar to those estimated by hourly rainfall data based on this work soil and water conservation measures and vegetation projects for the yellow river basin should be maintained and enhanced to face the increasing soil erosion risk resulting from the change of rainfall

basin increased significantly p 0 05 with rates of 5 46 and 6 86 decade 1 respectively compared to the 1981 2010 average values approximate 80 of 98 stations showed increasing trends and 20 of stations had statistically significant trends p 0 1 the increase of rainfall erosivity resulted from the significant increasing trends of average storm precipitation p 0 1 duration p 0 1 rainfall energy p 0 05 and maximum 1 h intensity p 0 05 in addition the total extreme erosivity showed significant upward trends at a relative rate of 6 05 decade 1 p 0 05 extreme erosivity storms occurred more frequently and with higher rainfall energy during the study period p 0 05 trends for seasonal total and extreme erosivity were also estimated based on daily rainfall data and the changing magnitudes were similar to those based on hourly rainfall data which suggested daily rainfall can be applied to detect interannual and long term variations of rainfall erosivity in the absence of rainfall data with higher resolution it was suggested that soil and water conservation strategies and vegetation projects conducted within the yellow river basin should be continued and enhanced in the future keywords yellow river basin rainfall erosivity extreme precipitation sediment reduction climate change 1 introduction the increase in atmospheric temperatures caused by climate change induces a more intense global water cycle leading to greater evaporation rates and increased water vapor contents in the atmosphere the additional latent heating caused by the increased moisture convergence is resulting in the increase of heavy and extreme precipitation and the decrease of trace light and moderate precipitation gordon et al 1992 mason et al 1999 goswami et al 2006 qian et al 2007 shiu et al 2012 extreme rainfall is expected to change under warming with respect to its duration frequency and intensity goswami et al 2006 swain et al 2018 moreover the increasing temperature may also change precipitation s temporal and spatial patterns wasko sharma 2015 wasko et al 2016 it was reported that temporal patterns were less uniform and the peak precipitation was more intense as temperatures increase wasko and sharma 2015 visser et al 2021 and the spatial extent of storms had tended to decrease as well wasko et al 2016 previous studies have typically used daily rainfall data to detect long term trends in precipitation and extremes as daily rainfall data are readily available and usually have long temporal series goswami et al 2006 miao et al 2016 papalexiou and montanari 2019 however daily data have limitations for describing storm characteristics and inter storm structures yu et al 2010 daily data overestimate rainfall duration and underestimate rainfall intensity and do not depict the peak intensity well hourly observations allow the examination of sub daily storm characteristics and precipitation intensities li et al 2013 yin et al 2007 yin et al 2011 yu et al 2010 and reveal the behavior of the tails of the distribution of precipitation papalexiou et al 2018 yin et al 2011 used hourly data to detect the long term trend of precipitation in the haihe river basin although the rainfall hours and amounts during summer june to august decreased consistently over the basin the mean and peak intensities of short duration storms duration 6 h increased for most stations moreover the literature has shown that long term trends of rainfall intensity using hourly data may differ from those using daily data li et al 2008 yu et al 2010 zhai et al 2005 westra et al 2014 based on daily rainfall li et al 2008 reported that the daily rainfall intensity in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river valley showed a significant increase while the trend in north china was insignificant however based on hourly rainfall yu et al 2010 reported a negative rainfall intensity change for the yangtze river valley and a significant positive trend in north china high resolution precipitation data are also crucial in soil loss prediction foster 2004 rainfall is the main force that can detach and transport soil particles from the soil surface and lead to water induced soil erosion and rainfall erosivity describes the potential capacity of rainfall to cause soil loss the commonly used variables related to rainfall erosivity calculations in empirical soil loss prediction tools such as storm rainfall kinetic energy e and the maximum 30 min intensity i 30 are all event based variables that should be derived from the sub daily data foster 2004 renard et al 1997 wischmeier 1959 the increase in rainfall intensity and frequency of extreme events may enhance the likelihood of soil erosion ipcc 2021 long term high resolution sub daily precipitation data is one of primary choices that can be used to detect the variation in trends of rainfall erosivity fiener et al 2013 klik and konecny 2013 meusburger et al 2012 because of the limited availability of aforementioned data the statistical models related to more widely available daily rainfall data have been developed to approximate the rainfall erosivity estimated by hyetograph rainfall data xie et al 2016 ma et al 2014 yu and rosewell 1996 and detect the long term variation trends lai et al 2016 wang et al 2017 ma et al 2014 qin et al 2016 xin et al 2011 it is reasonable to assume that the sub daily rainfall with higher resolution can depict rainfall intensity more accurately compared with daily rainfall yin et al 2018 however whether there are discrepancies between long term trends derived from sub daily and daily rainfall data is unknown the yellow river huang he regarded as the mother river of china is the second largest river in china and one of the most important water supplies in northern china due to the geographic features including erodible loess soil steep slopes and human activities the environmental system of the yellow river basin is unique fragile and sensitive to climate change the main objectives of this research are to 1 detect long term trends in storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity related variables for all storms and storms with extreme erosivity greater than 90th percentile in the yellow river basin 2 evaluate the influence of data resolution on the determination of rainfall erosivity trends the findings may offer insights into the changing nature of storm extremes and contribute to informed decisions about regional soil conservation strategies and sediment control within the yellow river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the yellow river basin is located in north central china 95 53 e 1119 5 e 32 10 n 41 50 n fig 1 the total length of the river is 5 500 km and the river basin covers 752 000 km2 tang et al 2008 originating from the tibetan plateau it flows through the loess plateau and the eastern alluvial plain and finally enters the bohai sea the elevation of the catchment ranges from 5000 to 0 m from the western source region to the eastern river mouth the main basin is successively influenced by arid semiarid continental and monsoon climates the mean annual precipitation across the entire basin is approximately 443 mm the observed hourly precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma which provided basic quality control li et al 2011 the precipitation was recorded with self recording siphon rain gauges and the pluviograph self recording papers were digitized by the meteorological bureaus of each province since the siphon rain gauges did not operate in winter to avoid freezing failures only the data during the warm season may to september of the yellow river basin were available which included more than 87 of the annual total precipitation further quality control was conducted to select stations with continuous hourly series from 1971 to 2020 and the warm season may to september as follows 1 stations with any entire month of missing observations from may to september were excluded 2 stations with missing hourly observations for entire data series more than 5 were excluded 3 stations with any year with missing observations per year more than 25 were excluded after these criteria were applied 33 53 and 12 stations a total of 98 were selected from the upper reach middle reach and lower reach respectively hours with missing observations throughout the warm season for 98 stations were infilled with a linear interpolation method using the hourly precipitation before and after the missing hour 2 2 storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity indices precipitation data were analyzed at the event scale in this study the continuous observed data series were divided into individual storms by a minimum inter event dry time of 6 h wischmeier 1959 if a dry period between two rainy periods was shorter than 6 h the successive rainy periods were considered as one storm and if it was longer than 6 h two separate storms were obtained following this procedure hourly data of each station can be divided into separated event storms for a single storm with an observed interval δ t δ t 1 h in this study the following storm characteristics were calculated using eqs 1 3 as presented below 1 d n δ t 2 p m 1 n p m 3 i p d in eqs 1 3 d represented the storm duration h n was the number of observed intervals during a storm p m represented the precipitation in the m th interval mm p represented the event storm precipitation mm and i represented the average intensity during a storm the number of storms occurring in the warm season in one year was denoted as nws and the sum of p throughout the warm season of one year was denoted as pws the 30 min rainfall intensity index ei30 is commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity of a storm in the universal soil loss equation usle and its successors for soil loss prediction foster 2004 wischmeier 1959 renard et al 1997 ei30 was defined as the product of rainfall kinetic energy e and the maximum 30 min intensity of a storm i 30 the total energy e mj ha 1 for an event storm obtained was as presented below 4 e m 1 n e m p m where n is the number of uniform intensity periods for a storm e m mj mm 1 ha 1 was the unit rainfall kinetic energy of per unit area per unit rainfall depth in the m th uniform intensity period in which the rainfall intensity was considered uniform p m mm is the rainfall depth for the m th period the unit rainfall energy e m was calculated using equation 5 as presented in the rusle2 documentation foster 2004 5 e m 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 082 i m and i m was the rainfall intensity for the m th hour mm h 1 as the recorded points from pluviograph breakpoint rainfall data represent times of discernable changes of rainfall intensity e and i 30 calculated from the pluviograph breakpoint rainfall data are the most accurate due to the limited availability of the aforementioned data and the hourly rainfall data can provide partial details of intensity changes during a storm e and i 30 can be approximately estimated using hourly data by following the method developed by yin et al 2007 yin et al 2007 reported that the e h rainfall energy obtained directly from hourly data i 1h the maximum hourly intensity and ei30 h rainfall intensity index obtained directly from hourly data have a systematical underestimation compared with that derived from breakpoint rainfall data and can be adjusted by multiplying adjustment factors of 1 105 1 668 and 1 73 respectively therefore e i 30 and e i 30 of a storm can be approximated by 6 e 1 105 e h 7 i 30 1 668 i 1 h 8 e i 30 1 73 e h i 1 h following eq 6 eq 8 the average e i30 and ei30 throughout the warm season were calculated annually the summation of e i 30 throughout the warm season for all storms were denoted as r s ws with a unit of mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 to detect the influence of data temporal resolution on rainfall erosivity hourly rainfall was also aggregated into daily rainfall and used to estimate rainfall erosivity at a daily scale with the following equation xie et al 2016 9 r d 0 2686 1 0 5412 cos π 6 j 7 π 6 p d 1 7265 where r d represented the rainfall erosivity for a rainy day j represented the month from 1 january to 12 december and pd represented the daily rainfall mm rainfall erosivity throughout the warm season using daily rainfall was defined as the summation of r d and denoted as r d ws five rainfall characteristics p ws n ws p d i and five erosive indexes i 30 e ei30 r s ws and r d ws were calculated annually for each station meanwhile six extreme erosive indexes were defined and analyzed at both event storm and daily scale for each station the threshold of the 90th percentile of ei30 values can be determined at event scale and the threshold of the 90th percentile of r d can be determined at daily scale then storms or rainy days with rainfall erosivity greater than the corresponding threshold were defined as extreme erosive storms days the average e and i 30 for these extreme storms over the warm season were denoted as e90 and i 30 90 and the sum of extreme ei30 throughout the warm season was denoted as r s 90 the sum of extreme daily erosivity was denoted as r d 90 the number of extreme erosive storms and erosive days were denoted as n s 90 and n d 90 respectively all these 16 indexes were analyzed with trend and field significance tests as described in the following section 2 3 2 3 trend analysis we used a rank based mann kendall test mk test to estimate the observed monotonic trends and their corresponding significance levels mann 1945 kendall 1948 since the autocorrelation in the time series can influence the mk test results yue and wang 2002 the trend free pre whitening method was adopted to remove the serial correlations before applying the mk test chu et al 2010 von storch 1995 the two tailed test standardized statistic index z for a tested series was used to determine the temporal trend the null hypothesis was that there was no monotonic trend in the time series if z was larger than 1 645 1 96 or 2 576 the null hypothesis was rejected at the p 0 1 0 05 or 0 01 significance levels respectively z greater than 0 implied an increasing trend z 0 a decreasing trend z 0 no trend we also used the nonparametric theil sen estimator to calculate the slopes β of the trends sen 1968 theil 1992 xu et al 2003 positive and negative β values indicated upward and downward trends respectively we expressed the expected 10 year decadal change t with the fitted trend line as follows 10 t 10 β the relative tendency was also determined by comparing t during the study period 1971 2020 with the 30 year 1981 2010 standard normal of the tested indices wmo 2017 the standard normal was the average from 1981 to 2010 and was denoted as m in the following equation the relative tendency rt was defined as follows wang et al 2017 11 rt t 1971 2020 m 1981 2010 100 indices introduced in section 2 2 were calculated annually then the long term trends for each station were assessed we also applied a resampling based bootstrap procedure to assess the field significance of the mk test over the whole basin for all variables renard et al 2008 westra et al 2012 a bootstrap procedure was suggested by douglas et al 2000 to assess the field significance given the original data set denote as s0 consists of records from all stations for m years the following steps outline the bootstrap procedure 1 sample m years with replacement from the years used in the original data set s0 using the records from corresponding sampled years for all stations to form new data set s1 2 perform a statistical test on each station for data set s1 denote the number of stations with significant results as n 1 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 for m iterations to form new bootstrapped data sets s1 s2 sm so that n 1 n 2 n m are found 4 determine the field significance based on the sampled distribution n i i 1 m at given level α by calculating the critical value corresponding to 1 α quantile of n i i 1 m for a specific index there is a matric of 98 rows stations 50 columns years the rows denote the spatial location and columns denote the time series the magnitude of variation trends for the whole basin and three reaches was estimated by 1 interpolating the annual value of stations within the basin using an ordinary kriging method for each year 2 calculating the mean value of all pixels for the basin and three reaches and 3 calculating and testing long term trends using the mk test and theil sen estimator moreover a sequential mk test was also applied in this study to detect the turning point of the interpolated temporal series turning point was defined as the intersections of the sequential statistics of progressive uf and retrograde ub the backward series of uf series uf 1 645 or 1 96 represents the series is significant at p 0 1 or 0 05 level respectively and the turning point indicated the start of the changing phenomenon detailed procedure can be found in sneyers 1990 3 results 3 1 general statistics of storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity the average total seasonal precipitation during the warm season was 355 6 mm with a total of 41 5 storms on average for the 98 stations at an event scale the average storm precipitation p duration d and intensity i over 50 years across the 98 stations were 8 7 mm 8 h and 1 2 mm h 1 with a standard deviation of 2 6 mm 1 5 h and 0 3 mm h 1 respectively compared with the average and standard deviation of i i 30 was characterized with 4 6 times of the average and 6 3 times of the standard deviation the average seasonal rainfall erosivity over the 98 stations of the yellow river basin throughout the warm season was 1196 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 with a standard deviation of 984 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 this is approximately the median value 50th of the global erosivity reported by panagos et al 2017 storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity occurring in the warm season differed depending on the section of stream at the event scale the p i i 30 e ei30 of the lower reach were all the greatest among the three reaches fig 2 although the frequency of storms in the lower reach was the least among the three river sections this indicated that storms occurring in the lower reach were characterized by greater erosive potential indeed the total rainfall erosivity throughout the warm season in the lower reach was much greater than other areas over the basin with an average of 3592 9 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 while that in the upper reach and middle reach were 534 9 and 1066 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 respectively the differences in storm characteristics from the three basins may be explained by the climate type and sea land location the stations located in the lower reach are closer to the coast and are more deeply affected by the summer monsoon compared with inland areas and the supply of moisture is more abundant there than at inland stations 3 2 long term trends for storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity 3 2 1 trends for storm characteristics based on mk test the temporal series of interpolated seasonal precipitation pws over the yellow river basin showed a significant increasing trend during the study period p 0 1 at a rate of 10 43 mm decade 1 tables 1 and 2 stations with increasing trends accounted for 82 7 and were distributed over the whole basin while several stations with decreasing trends were concentrated in the southwestern part of the upper reach and in the western part of the lower reach fig 3 a among all 98 stations 15 3 stations were significant at p 0 1 level field significance test showed that the increasing trends of the whole basin the upper reach and the middle reach were significant at p 0 1 level fig 4 a table 2 as the number of storms nws occurring during the warm season showed no significant trend fig 4b the increasing trend of pws should be attributed to the change of event storm precipitation event storm precipitation p for the whole basin and its three reaches showed consistent significant increasing trends p 0 1 table 1 fig 2c for the whole basin p increased at a rate of 0 22 mm decade 1 compared with the mean value during 1981 2010 p changed at a relative trend rt of 2 80 decade 1 stations with positive trends distributed across three reaches and stations with significant increasing trends accounted for 19 4 p 0 1 fig 3c table 2 based on the analyzing of storm duration d and rainfall intensity i we found that the shift of p was closely related to the significant increase of d p 0 1 as i changed insignificantly there were 19 4 of stations showed significant increasing trends for d p 0 1 fig 4d and its spatial distribution was similar with that of p fig 3c d in combination with above trends for storms occurring within the basin it s clear to see that the storm characteristics were changing towards greater precipitation amount and longer duration during the past 50 years 3 2 2 trends for rainfall erosivity rainfall erosivity index of a storm ei30 of the yellow river basin showed a significantly increasing trend at a rate of 1 34 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 p 0 05 table 1 table 2 compared with the average value during the baseline period 1981 2010 the relative tendency rt was 5 46 decade 1 a turning point occurred from approximately 1990 and the trend became significant in approximately 1997 fig 5 f 22 4 of the stations had significant increasing trends p 0 1 which were mainly distributed in the upper and the middle reaches fig 3h based on the significance test the changing trends were found to be significant at these two reaches and increased at magnitudes of 1 10 p 0 05 and 1 23 mj mm ha 1h 1 decade 1 p 0 1 respectively table 1 based on the hourly data we can surmise that the combination of significant increasing trends of rainfall energy e and maximum 30 min intensity i 30 resulted in the increase in rainfall erosivity index at event scale for the whole basin the upper reach and the middle reach table 1 table 2 among all stations within the basin 83 7 and 80 6 of stations showed increasing trends and 23 5 and 19 4 of stations had significant trends at the p 0 1 level table 2 respectively for e and i 30 and the trends were also particularly significant in the upper reach where the significant ratios p 0 1 accounted for 27 3 and 27 3 for e and i 30 respectively storms within the yellow river basin were found to shift towards having greater rainfall energy and peak storm intensity as a result rainfall erosivity index ei30 at event scale became greater during the study period increasing trend for the summation of storm ei30 during the warm season r s ws was statistically significant during the study period table 2 this may be mainly related to the significant increasing trends for storm ei30 the trend for r s ws was 68 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 decade 1 compared with the baseline period r s ws increased by an rt of 6 86 decade 1 table 1 the turning point occurred around 1990 and the trend became significant in the approximate year as the storm ei30 fig 5g h the stations with increasing trends account for 85 7 of 98 stations and they were distributed across the upper reach and the western part of the middle reach and the eastern part of the lower reach fig 3i 21 4 of stations had significant trends at the p 0 1 level table 2 increasing trend of rainfall erosivity during the warm season detected using daily rainfall and the daily model was also significant while with a slightly lower rate tables 1 and 2 fig 4j the spatial pattern of the trend for r d ws was similar with that for r s ws fig 3i j 3 3 long term trends for extreme erosive index trend analysis showed that the seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity r s 90 which was the summation of ei30 that exceeded the 90th percentile threshold had increasing trend during the past 50 years with an increase of 48 97 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 and a relative rate of 6 05 decade 1 p 0 05 fig 7 table 3 field significance test revealed that the increasing trend of r s 90 was significant over the whole basin at p 0 05 table 4 stations with significant increasing trends for r s 90 account for 21 4 of the stations and they were distributed across the upper reach and the middle reach fig 6 a the increase of r s 90 was mainly attributed to storms with extreme rainfall erosivity shifting towards having greater frequency and stronger event rainfall energy p 0 05 fig 7 table 4 the increasing trends for n s 90 and e 90 were both significant at event scale at p 0 05 level table 4 moreover significant increasing trends were found for n s 90 and e 90 in the upper reach p 0 05 table 3 trends of total seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity exceeding the 90th percentile daily erosivity threshold r d 90 and its frequency n d 90 were also estimated and the trends were significant at p 0 05 and p 0 1 level respectively in general the spatial distribution of trends for r d 90 and n d 90 were similar with that for r s 90 and n s 90 fig 6a d table 4 based on daily precipitation aggregated from hourly data r d 90 and n d 90 over the whole basin increased at rates of 57 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade 1 and 0 24 decade 1 respectively table 3 the pre whitened series based on the interpolated r s 90 r d 90 n s 90 n d 90 e 90 for the whole basin were plotted in fig 8 the 5 year moving average in red dots depicted the increasing trends during past five decades clearly for most variables the turning point occurred after 2000 and became significant in approximately 2015 in comparison the trend of e 90 is not obvious and the interpolated basin average fluctuated around the mean value this may be because 1 the increasing rate was 0 12 mj ha 1 decade 1 and the relative trend was 1 82 decade 1 which was statistically significant but very small in value 2 ratios of increasing stations and significant increasing stations were lower than that for other variables 4 discussion significant increasing trends were found for rainfall erosivity ei30 of the whole basin p 0 05 the upper p 0 05 and middle reaches p 0 1 by definition ei30 is a function of rainfall energy e and maximum 30 min intensity i 30 and e mainly depends on the unit rainfall intensity unit rainfall amount and storm duration during a storm wischmeier 1959 during the past 50 years storm duration d increased significantly and storm intensity i changed insignificantly which directly led to the increase of storm precipitation p and indirectly led to the increase of storm rainfall energy e meanwhile i 30 increased significantly p 0 05 as a result ei30 showed significant increasing trend at the study period significant increasing trend was also found for the total rainfall erosivity during the warm season r s ws r s ws is the sum of rainfall erosivity ei30 for storms that occur in the warm season in other words storm ei30 and number of storms nws are two main factors that may have influence on the variation of r s ws as the storm ei30 increasing nws showed no significant trend therefore the increase of rainfall erosivity at event scale was the main reason leading to the increase of seasonal rainfall erosivity it can be inferred that the combination of increasing trends for storm characteristics p d and e i 30 lead to the significant increasing trends of event ei30 and r s ws which drive the yellow river basin to higher potential risk of regional rainfall erosivity daily precipitation data can be used to estimate rainfall erosivity and its temporal trend when precipitation data in finer resolution is unavailable however the discrepancies between the validity of using sub daily rainfall and daily rainfall to detect the temporal trends is rarely discussed in previous studies in this study rainfall erosivity was estimated using both hourly data and daily data based on the storm based models of rusle2 and yin et al 2007 and the daily based model developed by xie et al 2016 the comparison of seasonal rainfall erosivity obtained using two resolutions of data was showed in figs 9 a b and 10 it can be seen from fig 9a that r s ws was generally larger than r d ws when seasonal r ws values greater than 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 ws 1 but for the interpolated results the bias was reversed that most points were on the top of the 1 1 line fig 9b indicating that the interpolated r ws values were strongly smoothed by smaller values r s ws and r d ws showed similar spatial distribution patterns fig 10a b seasonal rainfall erosivity during the warm season decreased from the southeast to the northwest basin meanwhile r d ws values in the lower reach were systematically lower than r s ws whereas r d ws were systematically lager than r s ws in most areas of the middle and upper reaches this may be because only four stations located in the eastern area of the middle reach were involved in the development of the daily based model xie et al 2016 fig 9c d showed the temporal variation of the interpolated seasonal rainfall erosivity and extreme rainfall erosivity derived based on event scale r s ws and r s 90 and daily scale r d ws and r d 90 the magnitudes of trends estimated by theil sen estimator for r s ws and r s 90 were similar with those of r d ws and r d 90 tables 1 3 and the linear fitted lines showed this again field significance results showed that both trends of r s ws and r d ws over the yellow river basin were significant at p 0 05 level and the same to those of extreme rainfall erosivity variables r s 90 and r d 90 and n s 90 and n d 90 this indicated that daily precipitation data and the daily equation developed by xie et al 2016 can be applied to detect and describe the changing trend of seasonal and extreme rainfall erosivity in the absence of rainfall data with higher resolution if other soil erosion factors such as soil topography vegetation cover and conservation measures remain constant the increase in rainfall erosivity can contribute to an increase in the potential soil erosion risk and is expected to increase the sediment yield of the yellow river basin however a continuous and obvious decrease of sediment load of the yellow river has been observed since 1950s for example the annual sediment load discharged to the bohai sea observed at lijin gauging station the last hydrographic station before the river enters the sea decreased from 1 21 gt a 1 during 1952 1970 to 0 61 gt a 1 during 1971 2000 and 0 13 gt a 1 during 2001 2016 this is mainly because human activities have greater impact on the reduction of sediment load of the yellow river basin compared with the increasing rainfall erosivity yao et al 2016 human activities such as the construction of check dams and reservoirs soil and water conservation measures and large scale vegetation recovery projects have significantly improved the vegetation coverage of the midstream region and greatly reduced the soil erosion from the loess plateau sun et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in other words human activities have been the primary factors driving changes in the sediment load of the basin considering the significant increase in rainfall erosivity and extreme precipitation the soil and water conservation measures and vegetation recovery projects conducted within the basin should be continued and enhanced in the future 5 conclusions high resolution hourly precipitation data were collected from 98 stations dispersed throughout the yellow river basin to investigate the long term trends of storm characteristics and rainfall erosivity from 1971 to 2020 during the warm season may to september the main conclusions were as follows 1 for the yellow river basin rainfall erosivity at both event and seasonal scales became greater during the past five decades which may lead to increased potential risk of regional soil erosion the increase of rainfall erosivity resulted from the significant increasing trends of event storm precipitation p duration d rainfall energy e and maximum 1 h intensity i 1h compared with the average value during the baseline period 1981 2010 the seasonal average values of p d e and i 1h increased by relative rates of 2 80 1 77 3 40 and 2 64 decade 1 respectively approximate 20 of 98 stations had statistically significant increasing trends p 0 1 2 moreover storms with extreme rainfall erosivity tended to occur more frequently and intensively and total extreme rainfall erosivity occurring within the yellow river basin became increasingly greater significant upward trends were found for total seasonal extreme rainfall erosivity r s 90 frequency n s 90 and rainfall energy e90 for storms with rainfall erosivity exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of erosivity p 0 05 3 daily rainfall can be applied to detect interannual and long term variations of rainfall erosivity the changing magnitudes and significance level were similar to those estimated by hourly rainfall data based on this work soil and water conservation measures and vegetation projects for the yellow river basin should be maintained and enhanced to face the increasing soil erosion risk resulting from the change of rainfall

2041 2060 and 2061 2080 the future rainfall erosivity projections were obtained based on a gaussian process regression gpr approach relating rainfall depth to rainfall erosivity through a series of bio climatic covariates compared to the 2010 global rainfall erosivity baseline we estimate a potential average increase in global rainfall erosivity between 26 2 and 28 8 for 2050 and 27 34 3 for 2070 therefore climate change and the consequential increase in rainfall erosivity is the main driver of the projected 30 66 increase in soil erosion rates by 2070 our results were successfully compared with 20 regional studies addressing the rainfall erosivity projections we release the whole dataset of future rainfall erosivity projections composed of 102 simulation scenarios with the aim to support further research activities on soil erosion soil conservation and climate change communities we expect these datasets to address the needs of both the earth system modeling community and policy makers in addition we introduce a modeling approach to estimate future erosivity and make further assessments at global and continental scales keywords climate change agriculture soil health policy land use change r factor food security 1 introduction future climate projections give a pessimistic outlook on soil erosion and its associated impacts which include increased land degradation a loss of agricultural productivity and soil carbon losses borrelli et al 2020 moreover soil s ability to offset and buffer global warming in the future through carbon sequestration is reduced by soil erosion lugato et al 2018 a recent intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report highlights the anticipated acceleration of global land degradation due to increasing rates of soil erosion and losses of soil organic carbon shukla et al 2019 increasing temperatures combined with changing rainfall patterns and intensification of rainfall will likely be the main drivers of this process prein et al 2017 the interactions between rainfall and soil play a vital role in the ecological hydrological and biogeochemical cycles occurring on land grillakis et al 2020 climate change is expected to alter the attributes of rainfall due to the increase in atmospheric specific humidity in future warmer climate states trenberth 2011 and due to changes in seasonal precipitation konapala et al 2020 in a more energetic climatic state an intensification of the hydrological cycle and associated extreme precipitation and runoff will likely have important impacts on the surface processes governing the functionality and loss of soils myhre et al 2019 future climate change is expected to further influence rainfall intensity as well as the magnitude and frequency of rainfall events nearing et al 2004 studies have emphasized the nonlinear response of soil erosion to changing rainfall amount and intensity due to the importance of runoff in eroding soil pruski and nearing 2002 the impact of these

to buffer their effect in future climatic states li and fang 2016 among others several studies are found to address the impact of climate change on the erosive force of rainfall rainfall erosivity in central asia duulatov et al 2019 turkey kilic and gunal 2021 brazil almagro et al 2017 riquetti et al 2020 usa hoomehr et al 2016 parts of west africa amanambu et al 2019 east africa chapman et al 2021 europe panagos et al 2017a australian alpine areas zhu et al 2020 iran azari et al 2021 tibetian plateau teng et al 2018 china li et al 2021 and india maurya et al 2021 mondal et al 2016 almost all of these studies predict a notable increase in regional or continental scale rainfall erosivity in the next 30 50 years but they do not give a complete global picture of the changes in rainfall erosivity risk given the prevalence of such studies over the last 5 years table 1 there is a clear recognized need to predict the future impact of rainfall erosivity across large spatial scales in a systematic manor therefore this study proposes global scale projections of rainfall erosivity at the highest possible resolution using the latest state of the art in both input data and modelling techniques such projections will contribute to the scientific debate on the impact of climate change on land degradation and provide useful insights for policy makers in this study future climate conditions projected from 19 different general circulation models gcms under the coupled model inter comparison projects cmip5 for three different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios are used to estimate future rainfall erosivity these climatic projections were used as inputs to predict the global rainfall erosivity for two future climatic periods 2041 2060 reference 2050 and 2061 2080 reference 2070 respectively each of these scenarios are distinguished by their potential radiative forcing increases by the end of the current century rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 relative to pre industrial values these scenarios correspond roughly to a 2 c stabilization and a 3 5 c and 5 c global temperature increase respectively by the end of the century these cmip5 models are selected based on the common availability of precipitation temperature and bioclimatic variables for both historical and projected scenarios the objectives of this study are to a model the global spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity prevailing under different rcps for the 2050 and 2070 climatic periods b observe possible temporal trends in the magnitude of rainfall erosivity c evaluate the predictive capacity of the methodology used and d develop and make available the modelled 2050 and 2070 erosivity datasets 2 data and methods 2 1 global rainfall erosivity point data the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda is the largest point scale database of calculated long term r factor values currently available with 3 625 stations from 63 countries around the globe fig 1 panagos et al 2017a b the data collection of high temporal resolution hourly sub hourly rainfall records started in 2013 for the development of the european rainfall erosivity dataset panagos et al 2015 and then followed with a participatory network built in 2015 16 to expand the database to a global coverage we used the rainfall intensity summarization tool rist developed by the united states department of agriculture usda to generate event and aggregated annual and long term annual average erosivity indexes dabley and justice 2012 2 2 global rainfall erosivity map gloreda panagos et al 2017b is the main input dataset used to develop the global erosivity map at 1 km spatial resolution fig 1 this spatially interpolated global erosivity map has been produced using a gaussian process regression gpr model rasmussen and nickisch 2010 with covariate data layers from the worldclim database fick and hijmans 2017 hijmans et al 2005 the gpr model performed well r2 0 722 when cross validated using a subset of the global station data records this derived rainfall erosivity surface represents the current baseline for the year 2010 as the majority of measured r factor values are derived from stations covering the first decade of 21st century the dataset collection processing and validation are described in detail in the global rainfall erosivity assessment panagos et al 2017a b and in section 2 4 the gloreda rainfall erosivity surface forms the baseline reference dataset against which future predictions of rainfall erosivity can be compared the mean global rainfall erosivity is roughly 2 190 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 with a high variability sd 2 974 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 the tropics showed the highest mean value of 7 104 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 followed by temperate 3 793 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 arid average r factor 842 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and cold climatic areas average r factor 493 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 2 3 climate change scenarios and input data the climate change community has developed four representative concentration pathways rcps as a basis for short and long term climate modelling experiments van vuuren et al 2011 the rcps are the basis for the development of the climate change projections in the ipcc 5th assessment the rcps are based on the projections of radioactive forcing values e g rcp 2 6 includes a radioactive forcing at 2 6 w m2 approximately 450 ppm co2 equivalent in 2100 riahi et al 2017 the mean surface air temperature is expected to increase in 2046 65 compared to the mean 1986 2005 by a mean of 1 c range 0 4 1 6 c in rcp2 6 1 4 c range 0 9 2 c in rcp4 5 and 2 0 c range 1 4 2 6 c in rcp8 5 while thereafter the mean air temperature increase is stable for the period 2081 2100 under rcp2 6 the mean increase may be at least 2 0 c under rcp4 5 and 4 0 c under rcp8 5 by 2081 2100 nishina et al 2014 as in most studies almagro et al 2017 almazroui et al 2020 amanambu et al 2019 duulatov et al 2019 panagos et al 2017a to predict the rainfall erosivity in 2050 and 2070 we use three alternative representative concentration pathways rcps ranging from the most optimistic rcp2 6 to the most pessimistic rcp8 5 the future rainfall erosivity projections request climatic data monthly total precipitation monthly temperature and a set of bioclimatic variables which are available for two periods 2050 average for 2041 2060 and 2070 average for 2061 2080 in worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 for simplicity these two climatic periods are referred to by their median years of 2050 and 2070 respectively the worldclim database makes available the downscaled coupled model inter comparison projects cmip5 data at the highest available resolution of 30 arc seconds therefore the compatibility of the spatial scale and forecasted temporal periods of the future assessments were important factors in selecting the input datasets to optimize transparency and minimise possible biases we employed the maximum number of models 19 gcms the selection of 19 gcms among the total 35 mcsweeney et al 2015 is due to their consistent availability through the worldclim data platform the high spatial resolution 30 arc seconds and consistent methodological approach of worldclim makes the relevant variables monthly precipitation temperature and bioclimatic surfaces available for end user modelling applications and detailed analysis fick and hijmans 2017 these common features in the 19 gcms make them suitable for future erosivity simulations and comparison against a present day baseline amanambu et al 2019 the set of 19 gcms give different results depending on the assumed atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses rcp scenario τhe cmip6 projections are an updated set of projected climatic variables however with a much coarser resolution and therefore a lower suitability for rainfall erosivity projections compared with cmip5 at this time almazroui et al 2020 while the cmip5 projections were likewise simulated at a coarser native resolution the necessary downscaling was completed to meet the requests from various modelling communities navarro racines et al 2020 the procedure to downscale the worldclim projections is described in detail https www worldclim org data downscaling html 2 4 gaussian process regression and model aggregation rainfall erosivity estimation by convention requires long term precipitation data at the highest possible temporal frequency 1 h and spatial scale future projections of rainfall cannot simulate the spatially unique characteristics of storm magnitude intensity and duration at a dynamic timescale in a way that matches historical observations therefore we propose a regression approach that builds on the relationship between bio climatic variables and the magnitude of rainfall erosivity such regression approaches have been used in brazil riquetti et al 2020 and in europe panagos et al 2017a and offer a plausible solution for estimating rainfall erosivity in future climatic states rainfall erosivity has a strong correlation with annual rainfall precipitation but also with its seasonal dynamics and temperatures as in the estimation of the 2010 global rainfall erosivity baseline panagos et al 2017b the regression approach employed takes into account layers of 12 monthly average precipitation amounts 12 monthly average temperature minima 12 monthly average temperature maxima and 19 bioclimatic variables available in worldclim for the period 1960 1990 fick and hijmans 2017 the gaussian process regression gpr modelling process is structured in three components a the fitting module b the prediction module and c the evaluation module fig 1 in terms of fitting gpr can model non linear relationships between the target variable rainfall erosivity and the covariates as we have 3 625 point locations with measured rainfall erosivity we selected the corresponding covariates in those locations to model the non linear relationships between the target variable and covariates gpr is advantageous since it can a take a large number of covariates as inputs b develop non linear complex relationships and c exclude collinearity hofmann et al 2008 stein 2012 the selection of the covariates is performed with simulated annealing sa which optimizes the selection of the covariates by increasing the r2 and minimizing the root mean square error rmse ingber 1993 the sa routine performed 100 iterations to select the optimum 20 out of the total 55 covariates that best predict the rainfall erosivity baseline 2010 by minimising the rmse panagos et al 2017a the 20 selected covariates are ranked by their selection frequency as reported in table s1 supplementary material to predict future rainfall erosivity the gpr derived non linear relationships are spatially applied on future worldclim precipitation layers for each of the 3 rcp scenarios in the 19 cmip5 model endmembers over 2 the climatic periods represented by years 2050 and 2070 this totals 102 simulations as worldclim data is absent for 4 gcp models in rcp2 6 and 2 models in rcp8 5 implicit in this kind of modelling is the assumption of stationarity since this prediction module assumes that the current 2010 climate variables influencing rainfall erosivity will remain stable through time 2050 2070 for each of the rcp and climatic period combinations we produced a mean aggregation from the ensemble of available up to 19 gcm derived projections to obtain six projected rainfall erosivity surfaces for rcp2 6 2050 2070 rcp4 5 2050 2070 and rcp8 5 2050 2070 these six ensemble mean rainfall erosivity surfaces were then spatially aggregated per climatic zone and categorised into erosivity classes to produce simplified temporal trends figs 3 and 4 and show the spatial erosivity differences figs 5 and 6 between the studied periods 2010 2050 2050 2070 the variability in the gcm endmembers comprising the rcp scenario mean is discussed and contextualised in the discussion section 4 1 to give an overview of the model dependent uncertainty in each rcp scenario the evaluation module includes a testing the gpr forecasting capacity and b a comparison with regional studies as the combination and weighting of the determining factors regression coefficients predicting rainfall erosivity are unknown for future climatic scenarios the hypothesis of temporal stationarity was evaluated by testing gpr s forecasting capacity across 2 separate time domains in the past observational data to investigate the transposability of gpr model parameters across time we tested if the derived relationships are the same in pre 2000 and post 2000 periods by temporally splitting the gloreda dataset firstly a gpr model was fitted to the pre 2000 data to derive model coefficients secondly these model coefficients were employed to predict post 2000 rainfall erosivity values using the post 2000 worldclim bioclimatic data and the model performance was consequently evaluated we selected the year 2000 as the splitting point for the following reasons first this allows having a long enough time series for the post 2000 dataset thus reducing the effect of short term meteorological fluctuations on the prediction performance resulting in more robust performance metrics second this split produces two datasets having a similar rain gauge spatial distribution therefore reducing biases caused by uneven sampling in different areas of the globe in the pre and post datasets moreover year 2000 is marked as the year of increased awareness regarding climate change as a result of continuously increasing trend in global temperature fyfe et al 2016 the pre 2000 period includes erosivity values for 1 578 stations and the post 2000 values for 2 500 stations with 538 stations overlapping in both periods for validation process we made only a temporal data split for the portion of 538 stations with overlapping data in both time periods for the rest 3 002 stations both a spatial and temporal data split was made for validation since the station data records had distinct spatial locations and temporal coverage 3 results 3 1 rainfall erosivity projections the future climate projections induce an important source variability for the estimation of future rainfall erosivity depending on the rcp scenario and cmip5 model endmember selected as multi model climate projections can be a solution for adaptation strategies tebaldi et al 2021 we employed an ensemble approach by accounting for the outputs of all available endmember models fig 2 this approach predicts the average magnitude of change in a robust manner as well as allowing the uncertainty associated with model endmember dis agreement to be better accounted when predicting future rainfall erosivity for the climatic state in 2050 the mean estimation derived from the 19 model endmembers projects a global average rainfall erosivity value in the range of 2 765 2 822 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 the range of values is due to the dependency on the rcp scenario with rcp2 6 increasing erosivity by 26 2 rcp4 5 by 27 6 and rcp8 5 by 28 9 fig 2a compared to the 2010 baseline for 2070 the global average rainfall erosivity is predicted in the range of 2 782 2 942 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 an increase of 27 in the case of rcp2 6 30 for rcp4 5 and 34 3 for rcp8 5 compared with the 2010 baseline fig 2b the standard deviation a measure of the variability of global rainfall erosivity across the globe is also predicted to increase from 2 974 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in 2010 to 3 365 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in 2050 variability in the future projected rainfall erosivity was evident per rcp scenario as a result of the different cmip5 endmember simulations comparing global erosivity in 2050 to the 2010 baseline only one rcp2 6 model endmember estimates an increase of 22 while the majority predict an increase in the range of 25 29 in the most pessimistic scenario of rcp8 5 only two models predict an increase of 25 whereas seven models project an increase in the range of 30 36 for 2070 the ensemble of models predicts an increase in the range of 25 29 for rcp2 6 25 33 for rcp4 5 and 30 40 for rcp8 5 therefore the ensemble of model endmembers shows the magnitude of future rainfall erosivity to generally increase with the rcp scenario fig 2 3 2 erosivity projections per climate zone the mean global erosivity derived from the cmip5 ensemble mean shows a relative increase from the 2010 baseline in the range of 26 2 28 9 for 2050 and 27 34 3 for 2070 fig 2 the lower boundary is the rcp2 6 scenario and the upper boundary is the rcp8 5 scenario the highly increasing trends in the global mean are driven by changes in specific climatic zones mostly attributed to the elevated rainfall erosivity in arid 60 79 and cold zones 76 5 118 7 fig 3 these two zones occupy 68 of the earth surface peel et al 2007 and therefore drive a large percentage change in the global mean most evident in the northern hemisphere the proportion of semi arid land with large changes in rainfall is greater than for tropical land as a whole chadwick et al 2016 in particular the projections of increased rainfall erosivity in arid zones in 2050 is driven by increased rainfall in the sahel region arid parts of australia and the middle east in cold zones the climate dynamics in siberia shkolnik et al 2018 and the intensification of rainfall in north america swain and hayhoe 2015 will drive the increased erosivity the tropical and temperate climatic zones show a percentage increase in rainfall erosivity between 14 5 and 22 1 depending on the rcp scenario this represents a smaller relative percentage change compared to arid and cold climatic zones however the baseline magnitude of rainfall erosivity in these zones is considerably higher for tropical and polar zones the aggregated rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 are almost equal for 2050 but the rcp2 6 has slightly higher mean erosivity than rcp8 5 for 2070 however the spatial distribution is different as 52 of the tropical areas have higher erosivity for rcp8 5 compared to the 48 for rcp2 6 supplementary material fig s4 in addition in tropical zones the predictions for mean rainfall under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 are only marginally different polar zones are only marginal 0 7 of the study area rcp8 5 is higher than rcp2 6 in european polar zones while it is lower in tibetan plateau where there is a lack of gloreda stations supplementary material fig s4 we observe an increasing trend of rainfall erosivity in most of the global study area an increase in rainfall erosivity is predicted in 80 82 5 of global lands for 2050 depending on the rcp scenario and a decrease in the remaining 17 5 20 in 2070 this estimated spatial area and its associated uncertainty boundaries increase to 80 9 85 of the study area with a decrease in rainfall erosivity in the remaining 15 19 1 figs 5 6 aggregating the results at the continental level rainfall erosivity in europe will be strongly affected by climate change increasing by 60 4 8 4 12 7 in 2050 and 79 22 27 4 in 2070 the numbers in the parenthesis can be aggregated to the mean to derive the lower and upper uncertainty boundaries north america will likewise experience a large percentage increase in rainfall erosivity of 39 2 2 4 9 1 in 2050 and 46 8 8 7 10 7 in 2070 in all continents except south america the impact of climate change on rainfall erosivity progressively was predicted to increase through time with the 2070 having a higher associated rainfall erosivity than the 2050 in south america we project an erosivity increase of 12 9 1 2 0 2 in 2050 and a reduction to 11 5 2 2 1 in 2070 likewise in all continents except south america the magnitude of increase in rainfall erosivity scaled positively with the rcp scenario or magnitude of climatic forcing from greenhouse gasses contrastingly in south america the rcp8 5 scenario has a lower associated rainfall erosivity increase than the rcp2 6 scenario figs 5 6 fig s1 an overview of the change in rainfall erosivity under the rcp2 6 scenario for 2050 is presented at the country level in figs 1 notable increases in rainfall erosivity were simulated in a number of countries in absolute terms increases of 3 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 are estimated for malaysia singapore papua new guinea gabon colombia indonesia el salvador sri lanka and venezuela therefore high erosive areas in north pacific and south pacific will continue to suffer from extreme erosivity in relative terms arid areas such as north african countries egypt algeria and libya middle east saudi arabia jordan qatar etc and ex ussr parts russian federation kazakhstan belarus will experience significant increase of 100 in rainfall erosivity figs 5 6 fig s2 contrastingly a reduction in rainfall erosivity is simulated under the effects of climate change in some countries for example areas around the caspian sea turkmenistan azerbaijan and kyrgyzstan south west africa tanzania zimbabwe malawi mozambique and parts of argentina and caribbean are predicted to experience a 10 reduction in rainfall erosivity in the 2050 scenario rcp2 6 fig s2 3 3 erosivity class changes dividing the global area categorically based on the magnitude of rainfall erosivity allowed the visualization of the shifts in the global land percentage proportion occupying each category under each rcp scenario in 2050 the lowest class of erosivity 0 500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 includes 46 of the study area in the 2010 baseline and but shows an important decrease based on the rcp scenario corresponding to 25 in the most extreme rcp8 5 scenario in 2050 fig 4 the reduction of the global area in the lowest class is compensated by a major growth of the 500 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 class increasing from 12 of the study area in the 2010 baseline to between 21 3 and 22 8 in 2050 the medium classes 1 000 2 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and 2 000 3 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 covered 15 in the 2010 baseline but show an increase to between 24 6 and 25 2 of the study area in 2050 fig 4 3 4 geographic distribution of erosivity trends the change in rainfall erosivity induced by climate change varies strongly with decreasing latitude from north to south figs 5 and 6 in terms of erosivity the estimated effects of climate change will not be globally uniform but highly variable across regions figs 5 and 6 the northern hemisphere shows larger increases compared with the southern hemisphere for the period 2010 2050 the latter of which has relatively broader areas experiencing decreased rainfall erosivity fig 5a interestingly the red line representing the mean latitudinal change also has a higher variation in the northern compared with the southern hemisphere this is a manifestation of the increased spatial complexity of the changing precipitation patterns in the northern hemisphere the average change in rainfall erosivity in the northern hemisphere under the rcp2 6 scenario shows 2 distinct latitudinal peaks fig 5a these peaks occur between 59 and 65 n and 15 28 n representing the large percentage changes in rainfall erosivity in cold and arid climate zones the latitudinal zones between these peaks show a lower relative magnitude of change particularly the zone between 30 and 45 n where the magnitude of change is limited to roughly 25 in the southern hemisphere the variability in the change in rainfall erosivity with latitude is relatively lower the mean increase in rainfall erosivity across the upper part of the hemisphere 0 40 s is roughly 10 as central africa and north latin america have mixed trends fig 5a below 40 s there is a simulated reduction in the mean rainfall erosivity due to the dominance of negative trends in southern argentina fig 5b similar spatial trends are also reported for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 6 in the northern hemisphere eurasia north west europe north africa the erosivity increase is mostly progressively higher for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 fig 6 fig s1 contrastingly in south latin america we note a slight erosivity decrease in rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 fig 6 fig s1 between 2050 and 2070 the magnitude of change in rainfall erosivity is reduced compared to the period between 2010 and 2050 figs 5 and 6 showing mostly heterogeneous changes in rainfall erosivity with a small magnitude of change for all rcps in the 2050 2070 period the changes in erosivity are smoothened compared to 2010 2050 while the period between 2010 and 2050 is dominated by areas with increasing erosivity green blue in figs 5 and 6 with some expansive areas with a high increase blue or decrease brown in rainfall erosivity the period between 2050 and 2070 shows a more balanced and heterogeneous pattern of mostly low magnitude increases green and decreases yellow throughout southern hemisphere in figs 5 and 6 the mean erosivity change in the period between 2050 and 2070 in most latitudes is below 10 with some more significant increases decreases in localised regions in the northern hemisphere the smaller regions experiencing a significant continued change in erosivity during the period 2050 2070 can be found in the latitudinal zone between 20 and 45 n whereas northwards of 45 n is a more consistent trend of slightly increased rainfall erosivity with the exception of siberia in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 likewise in the southern hemisphere these patterns can be found southwards of 35 s with some significant increases and decreases in rainfall erosivity based on more localized climatic change in the southern tip of south america southern hemisphere in figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 model variability an ensemble approach using projections from 19 cmip5 model endmembers for the 3 rcp scenarios allows a more inclusive and representative estimate of future rainfall erosivity the results gained are therefore not heavily influenced by one singular model endmember instead they better account for the predictive error by building a consensus on the average change and spread from all 19 independent models this approach is most suitable for global scale modelling as it reduces the bias associated with gcm selection instead allowing us to capitalize on the multi model nature of cmip5 and focus on the major trends where the confidence in rainfall erosivity changes is maximized compared to the 2010 baseline the relevant changes to the mean global erosivity associated with each gcm model per rcp scenario and year 2050 2070 are shown in fig 2 in addition to the ensemble mean presented here we provide the rainfall erosivity layers from each gcm model in our public data release here we aim to summarize the directional agreement of the change in rainfall erosivity associated with each of the employed gcm models comprising the ensemble mean to give a spatially distributed measure of confidence in the future trends of rainfall erosivity we aggregated the trend positive negative of each model for the 2050 rcp4 5 at a 250 km2 resolution the trends of all models 1 in case of decrease 1 in case of increase are summed to give a final score representing the level of agreement therefore scores of 19 19 represent those areas where all the models fully agree on an increase decrease of erosivity fig 7 therefore the scoring fig 7 is an indicator of scenario convergence the convergence map fig 7 shows a dominance of strong colours red blue representing a strong agreement amongst the cmip5 endmembers on the future directional trend of rainfall erosivity the majority of the global land area shows a strong convergence towards an increasing trend in rainfall erosivity representing a high confidence in increased rainfall erosivity the global coverage of areas with a strong convergence towards decreasing rainfall erosivity is less spatially extensive typically being limited to the large global mountain belts in the case of lighter colours intermediate values represent some disagreement between the cmip5 models on the directional change of erosivity e g a value of 13 means that 16 scenarios show an increase whereas 3 scenarios show a decrease the values between 7 and 7 are graphically presented by lighter colours fig 7 and represent disagreement amongst model endmembers but represent predominantly an increase yellow light reds or decrease light blues in rainfall erosivity in the ensemble of models these regions of lower forecast confidence have a typically heterogeneous spatial distribution often found in continental interiors areas with topographic complexity and transition zones between large areas with a highly confident increasing dark red or decreasing trend dark blue in addition to the directional change in rainfall erosivity we evaluated the variability of the models in each of the three rcps for 2050 using the standard deviation of the 19 cmip5 models fig 8 we find the variability amongst the model endmembers a measure of the predictive uncertainty to scale positively with the rcp scenario with a mean global standard deviation value of 358 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp2 6 increasing to 383 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp4 5 and 411 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp8 5 high standard deviation values amongst the 19 model endmembers 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for all three rcps are found in areas with a high baseline erosivity north latin america caribbean central africa and south asia the dark colours red green and back represent the rcp with the dominant sd very low standard deviation values 50 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for all three rcps are represented with a white colour in the fig 8 typically becoming more predominant at higher latitudes in all areas with intermediate values of standard deviation 50 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in all rcp scenarios the rcp scenario with the highest standard deviation is instead given based on an associated colour red green blue broadly recognisable trends were identified in different climatic areas with distinguishable patterns based on the relative projected erosivity change from the 2010 baseline and the level of model directional and magnitudinal agreement between the gcm endmembers figs 7 8 tropical areas north latin america caribbean central africa south asia and indonesia having a very high baseline erosivity 7 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 panagos et al 2017b will experience a relatively small increase 16 but high in absolute terms 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 figs 3 and 5 within these regions the gcm derived rainfall erosivity projections show a high variability in terms of their standard deviation fig 8 and their spatial convergence fig 7 cold areas siberia canada scandinavia with a characteristically very low baseline erosivity 500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 will experience a relatively high increase 73 115 by 2070 but low in absolute terms max 550 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 these high latitude regions show very low variability in the gcm outputs fig 8 and typically display broad expanses of high model spatial convergence interrupted by lower agreement in some continental interiors fig 7 arid areas north africa south latin america central asia and australia possessing a relatively low baseline erosivity 850 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 will experience a relatively high increase 50 80 by 2070 with medium variability in all areas outside of cold climatic areas the increase of erosivity in the period 2050 2070 is smoothened compared to the increasing trend in 2010 2050 this is mainly driven by the climate change projections for the periods 2010 2050 and 2050 2070 which contain different magnitudes of change and also different time increments respectively regarding the above mentioned aggregated results we note locally different trends that are shown in our analysis and may differ from the generalised trend description figs 5 6 and 8 the small embedded graph fig 8 bottom left shows the density plot of the standard deviation in practice the share of pixels per class over the full statistical distribution probability density convertible to a by multiplying by 100 functions are continuous probability distributions constructed by summing a gaussian distribution over the target data series and normalizing it such that its integral equals 1 sharman et al 2018 in all three rcps the sd curves have a peak in the range of 100 150 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and a positively skewed tail the peak in the rcp2 6 is lower compared to the rcp8 5 showing that the higher rcp has a slightly increasing variability this is also proved by comparing the mean sd for the 3 rcps based on the density plot c a 50 of the area has standard deviation in the range of 0 250 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 this lower 50 of the curve area responds dynamically to an increase in the rcp scenario the upper 50 of the curve area comprising the positively skewed tail remains relatively static with increasing rcp scenarios in summary this suggests that the predictive uncertainty in erosivity from model endmembers remains constantly high in all rcp scenarios in areas with a high baseline erosivity low latitudes whereas outside of these areas higher latitudes the model variability scales positively with the rcp scenario 4 2 projections of extremes at the global scale the areas experiencing very high erosivity 5 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 show little change in the 2050 climatic scenarios compared to the 2010 baseline fig 4 however there is a small increase from 2 9 to 3 8 in areas experiencing the most extreme erosivity 10 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 between 2010 and 2050 fig 4 at the event timescale a small number of storms with a high rainfall volume and or intensity during a year tend to contribute disproportionately to the annual and long term rainfall erosivity of a climate state in a given area bezak et al 2021 the dominance of such events typically increases at lower latitudes however with unpredictable patterns through space and time as it is difficult to account for the changing frequency and magnitude characteristics of such extreme events contributing to the long term average precipitation in the future min et al 2011 there remains residual uncertainty beyond that captured by the cmip5 model ensemble principally in areas where localized extreme events dominate or will become more dominant tabari et al 2019 in practice due to the difficulty of accounting for extreme rainfall events in any of the rcps the cmip5 long term monthly average inputs into the gpr model tend to smoothen the erosivity projections in the areas with very high erosivity this reasoning likely explains the small positive and negative trends 2010 2050 in some areas with a high 2010 baseline erosivity such as parts of the tropical and temperate climatic zones figs 3 and 4 similarly the detectable spatial trend of decreasing rainfall erosivity covering the areas around major mountain belts e g the north american rockies the southern american andes the himalayas the east african rift valley and the european alps may relate to a decreasing volume of rainfall but could potentially be offset by a higher individual storm intensity or increased frequency of extreme storms as a proportion of the total precipitation therefore our erosivity projections in highly erosive areas are likely rather conservative particularly in areas with cmip5 endmember disagreement or where the assumption of model stationarity does not hold due to different precipitation characteristics 4 3 evaluation of the temporal transposability of erosivity projections a direct model validation is not possible for future predictions therefore we employed all available downscaled cmip5 models of future precipitation to give the most robust estimate of the future trend in rainfall because the future cmip5 predictions do not match the high temporal resolution 1h of past observational data this modelling approach builds on the generalized nonlinear relationships between long term bio climatic variables and rainfall erosivity with rainfall as the independent input variable changing through time therefore to gauge the uncertainty in the predictions associated with changes in the gpr model stationarity through time we investigated whether the bioclimatic indices included in the gpr model will have the same influence in the future as in the baseline period to test the validity of the assumption of a stationary relationship we split gloreda into two sub datasets pre 2000 and post 2000 explained in section 2 4 worldclim offers the option to have the historical data on monthly temperature rainfall and bioclimatic attributes for the past period 1970 2000 harris et al 2014 https www worldclim org data monthlywth html to test the gpr prediction capacity we fitted the pre 2000 data using the estimated erosivity derived from measured high temporal resolution rainfall data then the fitted gpr model was used to predict the post 2000 period using the same post 2000 period worldclim data those predictions were validated against the measured erosivity in the post 2000 period data splitting for validating models in different time periods is used also in other studies almagro et al 2017 if we consider the entirety of the dataset over all years the prediction capacity modelled vs observed r2 value is 0 81 fitting the gpr model to the pre 2000 gloreda data achieved an r2 of 0 85 dropping to 0 60 when the corresponding model was used to predict the post 2000 dataset the line of best fit dotted defines the linear relationship between gloreda observations and the gpr model output for both time domains fig 9 interestingly the gpr model tends to slightly overestimate rainfall erosivity in the pre 2000 period but underestimate it in the post 2000 period alongside an increase in the data spread in the post 2000 period this small systematic under prediction appears to be influenced by the occurrence of a higher number of outliers where the rainfall erosivity is significantly underestimated this underestimation and increased spread can attribute to 2 possible causes 1 the changing importance non stationarity of the predictive bio climatic variables across the 2 time periods or 2 the occurrence of rare extreme events in the data post 2000 data record that did not occur in the pre 2000 record 4 4 plausibility and comparison with regional studies a validation sensu stricto of the future projections of this global study with regional and local studies is not possible for many reasons a different studies employ different model applications and frameworks b studies use different input climatic data for historical and future periods c the time periods covered are variable between studies and d uncertainty in future climate trends makes the gcm selection and downscaling approach important however we reviewed existing studies that provide rainfall erosivity projections in the same period as our projections 2050 the comparison of our study with 20 regional studies is conducted based on the corresponding spatial extent scenarios if listed in the study and period table 1 this review highlights the good coverage of regional studies on all continents fig s3 with 17 out of the 20 reviewed studies published during the last 5 years suggesting an increasing scientific interest in the relationship between climate change and erosion in 18 out of the 20 study comparisons the erosivity change projected in this study between the 2010 baseline and 2050 climatic periods matched the trend or were in the same order of magnitude as the projected change in the corresponding regional study table 1 in the case of tanzania and tibetan plateau our study estimated either a decrease or a small increase in erosivity in 2050 while available regional studies chapman et al 2021 teng et al 2018 projected a net increase based on a more limited selection of gcms than applied in this study the difference can be explained by the high uncertainty of our results in these areas with notably high standard deviation in the gcm model outputs fig 8 and mixed directional trends in the gcm model fig 7 these findings give a strong importance to the choice of gcm in these regions in addition the low number of gloreda stations with measured erosivity in parts of africa and high mountain areas contributes to this uncertainty 5 limitations the global rainfall erosivity projections do not challenge any local or regional studies which have been developed with higher gauge station density and using higher temporal resolution rainfall fata the number of stations with measured erosivity is rather limited allowing us only to predict and interpret trends in the future global dynamics of rainfall erosivity rather than deterministically predict exact changes in magnitude in addition the confidence given to the spatial patterns of projected rainfall erosivity in this study should be interpreted based on the underlying rain gauge density in the gloreda database it remains difficult to find and collate high temporal resolution e g sub hourly rainfall data at a global scale with 3 625 stations in 63 countries gloreda represents the current best effort at compiling the high temporal resolution gauge data necessary for rainfall erosivity calculations the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda will become available with the stations values allowing the further inclusion of data from areas in which we lack baseline information to model future relationships e g africa additionally using gloreda as a data tool future work can help to overcome some of the problems related to spatial and temporal scale when using coarse gridded observations to predict rainfall erosivity which involves fine spatiotemporal characteristics the use of alternative methods to estimate erosivity such as the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph proved to smoothen areas with high erosivity kim et al 2020 showing that the better accountancy of extremes in continental to global scale modelling remains an important frontier to properly capture to the soil erosion risk associated with rainfall erosivity bezak et al 2022 the coupled model intercomparison projection cmip has now released the data for the phase 6 while here we have used the data in the phase 5 cmip5 since downscaling is a vital pre requisite for a study of this kind we only considered downscaled simulations due to the lack of a publicly available cmip6 dataset with downscaled projections at this time here we have used the data from the downscaled phase 5 cmip5 assessment an additional limitation comes from the use of worldclim as input data since the unequal time intervals 2010 2050 and 2070 doesn t give an optimal overview of the impact of evolution in the climatic state on rainfall erosivity in addition the available bio climatic layers represent time slices of 20 years for the 2050 2041 2060 and 2070 2061 2080 climatic periods compared to 30 years for the historical baseline period in climate change studies hirabayashi et al 2013 the 30 year time slice is most commonly used to represent the average climatic state however worldclim is the only available dataset with historical and future climatic projections that give harmonised covariate inputs matching the methodological approach of this study at a global scale in case there are no future open source data releases overcoming these outlined limitations future global scale studies may seek to implement their own gcm downscaling regimes to capture the climatic variability at suitable scales for erosion studies for regional and local assessments regional climate models rcms provide detailed estimates of meteorological parameters and fill the gap of coarse resolution gcm data tapiador et al 2020 5 1 climate change erosion and adaptation this study paves the way to consider the impact of global warming on the erosion risk associated with heavy rainfall in the late 2010 s modelling studies suggested that heavy rainfall events increase at a rate of roughly 7 per degree of warming trenberth 2011 by modelling rainfall erosivity a parameter derived from the most extreme fraction of rainfall here we show that an increase of 1 2 mean global temperature has important nonlinear consequences on rainfall erosivity in future climate scenarios this study shows the areas regions countries etc where the projected impacts of climate change will cause higher erosion and present a greater risk to soil health fig s1 therefore those areas can adapt to erosivity changes by adopting management practices and strategies to increase soil resilience and decrease their vulnerability soil and water conservation policy design must account for such climate change dynamics in relation to agriculture food security and sustainability to ensure soil longevity the future increasing trends of rainfall erosivity will likely produce sharp increases in soil erosion without mitigation strategies these simulated projections are alarming particularly as they cover global lowland areas producing global food stocks and highly susceptible semi arid regions with sparse vegetation cover major policy initiatives are necessary to combat the changes in erosive forces and secure soil resources as an example the major increases of erosivity in the sahel region necessitates the need to accelerate the initiatives such as the great green wall this african led movement has as an objective to plant 1 billion trees across 8 000 km in africa therefore reducing land degradation and increase climate resilience elagib et al 2021 in the european union the green deal has also put as an objective to plant more than three billion trees by 2030 to reduce land degradation montanarella and panagos 2021 5 2 data availability the rainfall erosivity projections for all scenarios and three rcps and both for years 2050 and 2070 will be available in the european soil data centre esdac https esdac jrc ec europa eu we will make available both the aggregated data presented in this manuscript and the 102 contributing simulations in a geotiff format with a 30 arc seconds spatial resolution since we make available the simulations for each of the 19 gcm the user of those data may select the most appropriate one according to each model performance mcsweeney et al 2015 these erosivity projections together with land use change estimations have been the main driver to estimate the rates of future global soil erosion by water for 2070 borrelli et al 2020 and the projections of soil loss by water erosion in europe by 2050 panagos et al 2021 these provided datasets can be of use both for biophysical modelers and social and economic studies who intend to investigate the future socioeconomic vulnerability in different global areas with a susceptibility to soil resource insecurity 6 conclusions we estimated the future global projections of rainfall erosivity for 2050 and 2070 climatic scenarios using the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda and an ensemble of 19 downscaled cmip5 general circulation models for three rcps for 2050 the mean global erosivity may increase in the range 26 2 28 9 scaling positively with the rcp scenario 2 6 4 5 8 5 in most global regions within the ensemble of 19 model endmembers for 2050 at least seven scenarios project an increase of 30 for 2070 the mean global erosivity may increase in the range 27 34 similarly scaling positively with the degree of anthropogenic forcing rcp scenario within this 2070 projection four scenarios project changes of 35 with no scenario projecting an increase below 25 the rainfall erosivity variability predicted from the cmip5 endmember ensemble was high generally increasing with the rcp scenario based on the ensemble mean 80 85 of the global land surface will display an increasing trend in the rainfall erosivity and the remaining 15 20 a decreasing trend in most of the globe the cmip5 models show a convergence in the directional trend of erosivity as most or all have the same positive or negative trend suggesting high confidence in the directional trend in general arid and cold climatic zones show a pronounced increasing trend in rainfall erosivity relative to a 2010 baseline this corresponds to large projected changes in the northern hemisphere due to the continental figuration tropical and temperate climate zones show a less pronounced increase or decrease in rainfall erosivity from their relatively higher 2010 baseline values corresponding to a lower susceptibility of rainfall erosivity to climate change in large parts of the southern hemisphere the inclusion of all 19 cmip5 climate change models originating from different institutes and countries around the globe into a modelling framework resulted in 102 simulations which will become available in the european soil data centre esdac this inclusive approach focuses on the consensus between climate models and minimizes possible biases errors associated with preferential model selection the validity of the gaussian process regression gpr model used to relate the cmip5 projections of future precipitation to rainfall erosivity has been evaluated by estimating the model stationarity across 2 time periods pre and post 2000 within the gloreda database the outputs will be part of the global soil erosion modelling glosem platform and can contribute to the running scenario analyses for future global soil erosion the data can also serve global policy

3306,the erosive force of rainfall rainfall erosivity is a major driver of soil nutrient losses worldwide and an important input for soil erosion assessments models here we present a comprehensive set of future erosivity projections at a 30 arc second 1 km2 spatial scale using 19 downscaled general circulation models gcms simulating three representative concentration pathways rcps for the periods 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 the future rainfall erosivity projections were obtained based on a gaussian process regression gpr approach relating rainfall depth to rainfall erosivity through a series of bio climatic covariates compared to the 2010 global rainfall erosivity baseline we estimate a potential average increase in global rainfall erosivity between 26 2 and 28 8 for 2050 and 27 34 3 for 2070 therefore climate change and the consequential increase in rainfall erosivity is the main driver of the projected 30 66 increase in soil erosion rates by 2070 our results were successfully compared with 20 regional studies addressing the rainfall erosivity projections we release the whole dataset of future rainfall erosivity projections composed of 102 simulation scenarios with the aim to support further research activities on soil erosion soil conservation and climate change communities we expect these datasets to address the needs of both the earth system modeling community and policy makers in addition we introduce a modeling approach to estimate future erosivity and make further assessments at global and continental scales keywords climate change agriculture soil health policy land use change r factor food security 1 introduction future climate projections give a pessimistic outlook on soil erosion and its associated impacts which include increased land degradation a loss of agricultural productivity and soil carbon losses borrelli et al 2020 moreover soil s ability to offset and buffer global warming in the future through carbon sequestration is reduced by soil erosion lugato et al 2018 a recent intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report highlights the anticipated acceleration of global land degradation due to increasing rates of soil erosion and losses of soil organic carbon shukla et al 2019 increasing temperatures combined with changing rainfall patterns and intensification of rainfall will likely be the main drivers of this process prein et al 2017 the interactions between rainfall and soil play a vital role in the ecological hydrological and biogeochemical cycles occurring on land grillakis et al 2020 climate change is expected to alter the attributes of rainfall due to the increase in atmospheric specific humidity in future warmer climate states trenberth 2011 and due to changes in seasonal precipitation konapala et al 2020 in a more energetic climatic state an intensification of the hydrological cycle and associated extreme precipitation and runoff will likely have important impacts on the surface processes governing the functionality and loss of soils myhre et al 2019 future climate change is expected to further influence rainfall intensity as well as the magnitude and frequency of rainfall events nearing et al 2004

to buffer their effect in future climatic states li and fang 2016 among others several studies are found to address the impact of climate change on the erosive force of rainfall rainfall erosivity in central asia duulatov et al 2019 turkey kilic and gunal 2021 brazil almagro et al 2017 riquetti et al 2020 usa hoomehr et al 2016 parts of west africa amanambu et al 2019 east africa chapman et al 2021 europe panagos et al 2017a australian alpine areas zhu et al 2020 iran azari et al 2021 tibetian plateau teng et al 2018 china li et al 2021 and india maurya et al 2021 mondal et al 2016 almost all of these studies predict a notable increase in regional or continental scale rainfall erosivity in the next 30 50 years but they do not give a complete global picture of the changes in rainfall erosivity risk given the prevalence of such studies over the last 5 years table 1 there is a clear recognized need to predict the future impact of rainfall erosivity across large spatial scales in a systematic manor therefore this study proposes global scale projections of rainfall erosivity at the highest possible resolution using the latest state of the art in both input data and modelling techniques such projections will contribute to the scientific debate on the impact of climate change on land degradation and provide useful insights for policy makers in this study future climate conditions projected from 19 different general circulation models gcms under the coupled model inter comparison projects cmip5 for three different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios are used to estimate future rainfall erosivity these climatic projections were used as inputs to predict the global rainfall erosivity for two future climatic periods 2041 2060 reference 2050 and 2061 2080 reference 2070 respectively each of these scenarios are distinguished by their potential radiative forcing increases by the end of the current century rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 relative to pre industrial values these scenarios correspond roughly to a 2 c stabilization and a 3 5 c and 5 c global temperature increase respectively by the end of the century these cmip5 models are selected based on the common availability of precipitation temperature and bioclimatic variables for both historical and projected scenarios the objectives of this study are to a model the global spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity prevailing under different rcps for the 2050 and 2070 climatic periods b observe possible temporal trends in the magnitude of rainfall erosivity c evaluate the predictive capacity of the methodology used and d develop and make available the modelled 2050 and 2070 erosivity datasets 2 data and methods 2 1 global rainfall erosivity point data the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda is the largest point scale database of calculated long term r factor values currently available with 3 625 stations from 63 countries around the globe fig 1 panagos et al 2017a b the data collection of high temporal resolution hourly sub hourly rainfall records started in 2013 for the development of the european rainfall erosivity dataset panagos et al 2015 and then followed with a participatory network built in 2015 16 to expand the database to a global coverage we used the rainfall intensity summarization tool rist developed by the united states department of agriculture usda to generate event and aggregated annual and long term annual average erosivity indexes dabley and justice 2012 2 2 global rainfall erosivity map gloreda panagos et al 2017b is the main input dataset used to develop the global erosivity map at 1 km spatial resolution fig 1 this spatially interpolated global erosivity map has been produced using a gaussian process regression gpr model rasmussen and nickisch 2010 with covariate data layers from the worldclim database fick and hijmans 2017 hijmans et al 2005 the gpr model performed well r2 0 722 when cross validated using a subset of the global station data records this derived rainfall erosivity surface represents the current baseline for the year 2010 as the majority of measured r factor values are derived from stations covering the first decade of 21st century the dataset collection processing and validation are described in detail in the global rainfall erosivity assessment panagos et al 2017a b and in section 2 4 the gloreda rainfall erosivity surface forms the baseline reference dataset against which future predictions of rainfall erosivity can be compared the mean global rainfall erosivity is roughly 2 190 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 with a high variability sd 2 974 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 the tropics showed the highest mean value of 7 104 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 followed by temperate 3 793 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 arid average r factor 842 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and cold climatic areas average r factor 493 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 2 3 climate change scenarios and input data the climate change community has developed four representative concentration pathways rcps as a basis for short and long term climate modelling experiments van vuuren et al 2011 the rcps are the basis for the development of the climate change projections in the ipcc 5th assessment the rcps are based on the projections of radioactive forcing values e g rcp 2 6 includes a radioactive forcing at 2 6 w m2 approximately 450 ppm co2 equivalent in 2100 riahi et al 2017 the mean surface air temperature is expected to increase in 2046 65 compared to the mean 1986 2005 by a mean of 1 c range 0 4 1 6 c in rcp2 6 1 4 c range 0 9 2 c in rcp4 5 and 2 0 c range 1 4 2 6 c in rcp8 5 while thereafter the mean air temperature increase is stable for the period 2081 2100 under rcp2 6 the mean increase may be at least 2 0 c under rcp4 5 and 4 0 c under rcp8 5 by 2081 2100 nishina et al 2014 as in most studies almagro et al 2017 almazroui et al 2020 amanambu et al 2019 duulatov et al 2019 panagos et al 2017a to predict the rainfall erosivity in 2050 and 2070 we use three alternative representative concentration pathways rcps ranging from the most optimistic rcp2 6 to the most pessimistic rcp8 5 the future rainfall erosivity projections request climatic data monthly total precipitation monthly temperature and a set of bioclimatic variables which are available for two periods 2050 average for 2041 2060 and 2070 average for 2061 2080 in worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 for simplicity these two climatic periods are referred to by their median years of 2050 and 2070 respectively the worldclim database makes available the downscaled coupled model inter comparison projects cmip5 data at the highest available resolution of 30 arc seconds therefore the compatibility of the spatial scale and forecasted temporal periods of the future assessments were important factors in selecting the input datasets to optimize transparency and minimise possible biases we employed the maximum number of models 19 gcms the selection of 19 gcms among the total 35 mcsweeney et al 2015 is due to their consistent availability through the worldclim data platform the high spatial resolution 30 arc seconds and consistent methodological approach of worldclim makes the relevant variables monthly precipitation temperature and bioclimatic surfaces available for end user modelling applications and detailed analysis fick and hijmans 2017 these common features in the 19 gcms make them suitable for future erosivity simulations and comparison against a present day baseline amanambu et al 2019 the set of 19 gcms give different results depending on the assumed atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses rcp scenario τhe cmip6 projections are an updated set of projected climatic variables however with a much coarser resolution and therefore a lower suitability for rainfall erosivity projections compared with cmip5 at this time almazroui et al 2020 while the cmip5 projections were likewise simulated at a coarser native resolution the necessary downscaling was completed to meet the requests from various modelling communities navarro racines et al 2020 the procedure to downscale the worldclim projections is described in detail https www worldclim org data downscaling html 2 4 gaussian process regression and model aggregation rainfall erosivity estimation by convention requires long term precipitation data at the highest possible temporal frequency 1 h and spatial scale future projections of rainfall cannot simulate the spatially unique characteristics of storm magnitude intensity and duration at a dynamic timescale in a way that matches historical observations therefore we propose a regression approach that builds on the relationship between bio climatic variables and the magnitude of rainfall erosivity such regression approaches have been used in brazil riquetti et al 2020 and in europe panagos et al 2017a and offer a plausible solution for estimating rainfall erosivity in future climatic states rainfall erosivity has a strong correlation with annual rainfall precipitation but also with its seasonal dynamics and temperatures as in the estimation of the 2010 global rainfall erosivity baseline panagos et al 2017b the regression approach employed takes into account layers of 12 monthly average precipitation amounts 12 monthly average temperature minima 12 monthly average temperature maxima and 19 bioclimatic variables available in worldclim for the period 1960 1990 fick and hijmans 2017 the gaussian process regression gpr modelling process is structured in three components a the fitting module b the prediction module and c the evaluation module fig 1 in terms of fitting gpr can model non linear relationships between the target variable rainfall erosivity and the covariates as we have 3 625 point locations with measured rainfall erosivity we selected the corresponding covariates in those locations to model the non linear relationships between the target variable and covariates gpr is advantageous since it can a take a large number of covariates as inputs b develop non linear complex relationships and c exclude collinearity hofmann et al 2008 stein 2012 the selection of the covariates is performed with simulated annealing sa which optimizes the selection of the covariates by increasing the r2 and minimizing the root mean square error rmse ingber 1993 the sa routine performed 100 iterations to select the optimum 20 out of the total 55 covariates that best predict the rainfall erosivity baseline 2010 by minimising the rmse panagos et al 2017a the 20 selected covariates are ranked by their selection frequency as reported in table s1 supplementary material to predict future rainfall erosivity the gpr derived non linear relationships are spatially applied on future worldclim precipitation layers for each of the 3 rcp scenarios in the 19 cmip5 model endmembers over 2 the climatic periods represented by years 2050 and 2070 this totals 102 simulations as worldclim data is absent for 4 gcp models in rcp2 6 and 2 models in rcp8 5 implicit in this kind of modelling is the assumption of stationarity since this prediction module assumes that the current 2010 climate variables influencing rainfall erosivity will remain stable through time 2050 2070 for each of the rcp and climatic period combinations we produced a mean aggregation from the ensemble of available up to 19 gcm derived projections to obtain six projected rainfall erosivity surfaces for rcp2 6 2050 2070 rcp4 5 2050 2070 and rcp8 5 2050 2070 these six ensemble mean rainfall erosivity surfaces were then spatially aggregated per climatic zone and categorised into erosivity classes to produce simplified temporal trends figs 3 and 4 and show the spatial erosivity differences figs 5 and 6 between the studied periods 2010 2050 2050 2070 the variability in the gcm endmembers comprising the rcp scenario mean is discussed and contextualised in the discussion section 4 1 to give an overview of the model dependent uncertainty in each rcp scenario the evaluation module includes a testing the gpr forecasting capacity and b a comparison with regional studies as the combination and weighting of the determining factors regression coefficients predicting rainfall erosivity are unknown for future climatic scenarios the hypothesis of temporal stationarity was evaluated by testing gpr s forecasting capacity across 2 separate time domains in the past observational data to investigate the transposability of gpr model parameters across time we tested if the derived relationships are the same in pre 2000 and post 2000 periods by temporally splitting the gloreda dataset firstly a gpr model was fitted to the pre 2000 data to derive model coefficients secondly these model coefficients were employed to predict post 2000 rainfall erosivity values using the post 2000 worldclim bioclimatic data and the model performance was consequently evaluated we selected the year 2000 as the splitting point for the following reasons first this allows having a long enough time series for the post 2000 dataset thus reducing the effect of short term meteorological fluctuations on the prediction performance resulting in more robust performance metrics second this split produces two datasets having a similar rain gauge spatial distribution therefore reducing biases caused by uneven sampling in different areas of the globe in the pre and post datasets moreover year 2000 is marked as the year of increased awareness regarding climate change as a result of continuously increasing trend in global temperature fyfe et al 2016 the pre 2000 period includes erosivity values for 1 578 stations and the post 2000 values for 2 500 stations with 538 stations overlapping in both periods for validation process we made only a temporal data split for the portion of 538 stations with overlapping data in both time periods for the rest 3 002 stations both a spatial and temporal data split was made for validation since the station data records had distinct spatial locations and temporal coverage 3 results 3 1 rainfall erosivity projections the future climate projections induce an important source variability for the estimation of future rainfall erosivity depending on the rcp scenario and cmip5 model endmember selected as multi model climate projections can be a solution for adaptation strategies tebaldi et al 2021 we employed an ensemble approach by accounting for the outputs of all available endmember models fig 2 this approach predicts the average magnitude of change in a robust manner as well as allowing the uncertainty associated with model endmember dis agreement to be better accounted when predicting future rainfall erosivity for the climatic state in 2050 the mean estimation derived from the 19 model endmembers projects a global average rainfall erosivity value in the range of 2 765 2 822 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 the range of values is due to the dependency on the rcp scenario with rcp2 6 increasing erosivity by 26 2 rcp4 5 by 27 6 and rcp8 5 by 28 9 fig 2a compared to the 2010 baseline for 2070 the global average rainfall erosivity is predicted in the range of 2 782 2 942 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 an increase of 27 in the case of rcp2 6 30 for rcp4 5 and 34 3 for rcp8 5 compared with the 2010 baseline fig 2b the standard deviation a measure of the variability of global rainfall erosivity across the globe is also predicted to increase from 2 974 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in 2010 to 3 365 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in 2050 variability in the future projected rainfall erosivity was evident per rcp scenario as a result of the different cmip5 endmember simulations comparing global erosivity in 2050 to the 2010 baseline only one rcp2 6 model endmember estimates an increase of 22 while the majority predict an increase in the range of 25 29 in the most pessimistic scenario of rcp8 5 only two models predict an increase of 25 whereas seven models project an increase in the range of 30 36 for 2070 the ensemble of models predicts an increase in the range of 25 29 for rcp2 6 25 33 for rcp4 5 and 30 40 for rcp8 5 therefore the ensemble of model endmembers shows the magnitude of future rainfall erosivity to generally increase with the rcp scenario fig 2 3 2 erosivity projections per climate zone the mean global erosivity derived from the cmip5 ensemble mean shows a relative increase from the 2010 baseline in the range of 26 2 28 9 for 2050 and 27 34 3 for 2070 fig 2 the lower boundary is the rcp2 6 scenario and the upper boundary is the rcp8 5 scenario the highly increasing trends in the global mean are driven by changes in specific climatic zones mostly attributed to the elevated rainfall erosivity in arid 60 79 and cold zones 76 5 118 7 fig 3 these two zones occupy 68 of the earth surface peel et al 2007 and therefore drive a large percentage change in the global mean most evident in the northern hemisphere the proportion of semi arid land with large changes in rainfall is greater than for tropical land as a whole chadwick et al 2016 in particular the projections of increased rainfall erosivity in arid zones in 2050 is driven by increased rainfall in the sahel region arid parts of australia and the middle east in cold zones the climate dynamics in siberia shkolnik et al 2018 and the intensification of rainfall in north america swain and hayhoe 2015 will drive the increased erosivity the tropical and temperate climatic zones show a percentage increase in rainfall erosivity between 14 5 and 22 1 depending on the rcp scenario this represents a smaller relative percentage change compared to arid and cold climatic zones however the baseline magnitude of rainfall erosivity in these zones is considerably higher for tropical and polar zones the aggregated rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 are almost equal for 2050 but the rcp2 6 has slightly higher mean erosivity than rcp8 5 for 2070 however the spatial distribution is different as 52 of the tropical areas have higher erosivity for rcp8 5 compared to the 48 for rcp2 6 supplementary material fig s4 in addition in tropical zones the predictions for mean rainfall under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 are only marginally different polar zones are only marginal 0 7 of the study area rcp8 5 is higher than rcp2 6 in european polar zones while it is lower in tibetan plateau where there is a lack of gloreda stations supplementary material fig s4 we observe an increasing trend of rainfall erosivity in most of the global study area an increase in rainfall erosivity is predicted in 80 82 5 of global lands for 2050 depending on the rcp scenario and a decrease in the remaining 17 5 20 in 2070 this estimated spatial area and its associated uncertainty boundaries increase to 80 9 85 of the study area with a decrease in rainfall erosivity in the remaining 15 19 1 figs 5 6 aggregating the results at the continental level rainfall erosivity in europe will be strongly affected by climate change increasing by 60 4 8 4 12 7 in 2050 and 79 22 27 4 in 2070 the numbers in the parenthesis can be aggregated to the mean to derive the lower and upper uncertainty boundaries north america will likewise experience a large percentage increase in rainfall erosivity of 39 2 2 4 9 1 in 2050 and 46 8 8 7 10 7 in 2070 in all continents except south america the impact of climate change on rainfall erosivity progressively was predicted to increase through time with the 2070 having a higher associated rainfall erosivity than the 2050 in south america we project an erosivity increase of 12 9 1 2 0 2 in 2050 and a reduction to 11 5 2 2 1 in 2070 likewise in all continents except south america the magnitude of increase in rainfall erosivity scaled positively with the rcp scenario or magnitude of climatic forcing from greenhouse gasses contrastingly in south america the rcp8 5 scenario has a lower associated rainfall erosivity increase than the rcp2 6 scenario figs 5 6 fig s1 an overview of the change in rainfall erosivity under the rcp2 6 scenario for 2050 is presented at the country level in figs 1 notable increases in rainfall erosivity were simulated in a number of countries in absolute terms increases of 3 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 are estimated for malaysia singapore papua new guinea gabon colombia indonesia el salvador sri lanka and venezuela therefore high erosive areas in north pacific and south pacific will continue to suffer from extreme erosivity in relative terms arid areas such as north african countries egypt algeria and libya middle east saudi arabia jordan qatar etc and ex ussr parts russian federation kazakhstan belarus will experience significant increase of 100 in rainfall erosivity figs 5 6 fig s2 contrastingly a reduction in rainfall erosivity is simulated under the effects of climate change in some countries for example areas around the caspian sea turkmenistan azerbaijan and kyrgyzstan south west africa tanzania zimbabwe malawi mozambique and parts of argentina and caribbean are predicted to experience a 10 reduction in rainfall erosivity in the 2050 scenario rcp2 6 fig s2 3 3 erosivity class changes dividing the global area categorically based on the magnitude of rainfall erosivity allowed the visualization of the shifts in the global land percentage proportion occupying each category under each rcp scenario in 2050 the lowest class of erosivity 0 500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 includes 46 of the study area in the 2010 baseline and but shows an important decrease based on the rcp scenario corresponding to 25 in the most extreme rcp8 5 scenario in 2050 fig 4 the reduction of the global area in the lowest class is compensated by a major growth of the 500 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 class increasing from 12 of the study area in the 2010 baseline to between 21 3 and 22 8 in 2050 the medium classes 1 000 2 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and 2 000 3 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 covered 15 in the 2010 baseline but show an increase to between 24 6 and 25 2 of the study area in 2050 fig 4 3 4 geographic distribution of erosivity trends the change in rainfall erosivity induced by climate change varies strongly with decreasing latitude from north to south figs 5 and 6 in terms of erosivity the estimated effects of climate change will not be globally uniform but highly variable across regions figs 5 and 6 the northern hemisphere shows larger increases compared with the southern hemisphere for the period 2010 2050 the latter of which has relatively broader areas experiencing decreased rainfall erosivity fig 5a interestingly the red line representing the mean latitudinal change also has a higher variation in the northern compared with the southern hemisphere this is a manifestation of the increased spatial complexity of the changing precipitation patterns in the northern hemisphere the average change in rainfall erosivity in the northern hemisphere under the rcp2 6 scenario shows 2 distinct latitudinal peaks fig 5a these peaks occur between 59 and 65 n and 15 28 n representing the large percentage changes in rainfall erosivity in cold and arid climate zones the latitudinal zones between these peaks show a lower relative magnitude of change particularly the zone between 30 and 45 n where the magnitude of change is limited to roughly 25 in the southern hemisphere the variability in the change in rainfall erosivity with latitude is relatively lower the mean increase in rainfall erosivity across the upper part of the hemisphere 0 40 s is roughly 10 as central africa and north latin america have mixed trends fig 5a below 40 s there is a simulated reduction in the mean rainfall erosivity due to the dominance of negative trends in southern argentina fig 5b similar spatial trends are also reported for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 6 in the northern hemisphere eurasia north west europe north africa the erosivity increase is mostly progressively higher for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 fig 6 fig s1 contrastingly in south latin america we note a slight erosivity decrease in rcp8 5 compared to rcp2 6 fig 6 fig s1 between 2050 and 2070 the magnitude of change in rainfall erosivity is reduced compared to the period between 2010 and 2050 figs 5 and 6 showing mostly heterogeneous changes in rainfall erosivity with a small magnitude of change for all rcps in the 2050 2070 period the changes in erosivity are smoothened compared to 2010 2050 while the period between 2010 and 2050 is dominated by areas with increasing erosivity green blue in figs 5 and 6 with some expansive areas with a high increase blue or decrease brown in rainfall erosivity the period between 2050 and 2070 shows a more balanced and heterogeneous pattern of mostly low magnitude increases green and decreases yellow throughout southern hemisphere in figs 5 and 6 the mean erosivity change in the period between 2050 and 2070 in most latitudes is below 10 with some more significant increases decreases in localised regions in the northern hemisphere the smaller regions experiencing a significant continued change in erosivity during the period 2050 2070 can be found in the latitudinal zone between 20 and 45 n whereas northwards of 45 n is a more consistent trend of slightly increased rainfall erosivity with the exception of siberia in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 likewise in the southern hemisphere these patterns can be found southwards of 35 s with some significant increases and decreases in rainfall erosivity based on more localized climatic change in the southern tip of south america southern hemisphere in figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 model variability an ensemble approach using projections from 19 cmip5 model endmembers for the 3 rcp scenarios allows a more inclusive and representative estimate of future rainfall erosivity the results gained are therefore not heavily influenced by one singular model endmember instead they better account for the predictive error by building a consensus on the average change and spread from all 19 independent models this approach is most suitable for global scale modelling as it reduces the bias associated with gcm selection instead allowing us to capitalize on the multi model nature of cmip5 and focus on the major trends where the confidence in rainfall erosivity changes is maximized compared to the 2010 baseline the relevant changes to the mean global erosivity associated with each gcm model per rcp scenario and year 2050 2070 are shown in fig 2 in addition to the ensemble mean presented here we provide the rainfall erosivity layers from each gcm model in our public data release here we aim to summarize the directional agreement of the change in rainfall erosivity associated with each of the employed gcm models comprising the ensemble mean to give a spatially distributed measure of confidence in the future trends of rainfall erosivity we aggregated the trend positive negative of each model for the 2050 rcp4 5 at a 250 km2 resolution the trends of all models 1 in case of decrease 1 in case of increase are summed to give a final score representing the level of agreement therefore scores of 19 19 represent those areas where all the models fully agree on an increase decrease of erosivity fig 7 therefore the scoring fig 7 is an indicator of scenario convergence the convergence map fig 7 shows a dominance of strong colours red blue representing a strong agreement amongst the cmip5 endmembers on the future directional trend of rainfall erosivity the majority of the global land area shows a strong convergence towards an increasing trend in rainfall erosivity representing a high confidence in increased rainfall erosivity the global coverage of areas with a strong convergence towards decreasing rainfall erosivity is less spatially extensive typically being limited to the large global mountain belts in the case of lighter colours intermediate values represent some disagreement between the cmip5 models on the directional change of erosivity e g a value of 13 means that 16 scenarios show an increase whereas 3 scenarios show a decrease the values between 7 and 7 are graphically presented by lighter colours fig 7 and represent disagreement amongst model endmembers but represent predominantly an increase yellow light reds or decrease light blues in rainfall erosivity in the ensemble of models these regions of lower forecast confidence have a typically heterogeneous spatial distribution often found in continental interiors areas with topographic complexity and transition zones between large areas with a highly confident increasing dark red or decreasing trend dark blue in addition to the directional change in rainfall erosivity we evaluated the variability of the models in each of the three rcps for 2050 using the standard deviation of the 19 cmip5 models fig 8 we find the variability amongst the model endmembers a measure of the predictive uncertainty to scale positively with the rcp scenario with a mean global standard deviation value of 358 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp2 6 increasing to 383 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp4 5 and 411 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for rcp8 5 high standard deviation values amongst the 19 model endmembers 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for all three rcps are found in areas with a high baseline erosivity north latin america caribbean central africa and south asia the dark colours red green and back represent the rcp with the dominant sd very low standard deviation values 50 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 for all three rcps are represented with a white colour in the fig 8 typically becoming more predominant at higher latitudes in all areas with intermediate values of standard deviation 50 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in all rcp scenarios the rcp scenario with the highest standard deviation is instead given based on an associated colour red green blue broadly recognisable trends were identified in different climatic areas with distinguishable patterns based on the relative projected erosivity change from the 2010 baseline and the level of model directional and magnitudinal agreement between the gcm endmembers figs 7 8 tropical areas north latin america caribbean central africa south asia and indonesia having a very high baseline erosivity 7 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 panagos et al 2017b will experience a relatively small increase 16 but high in absolute terms 1 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 figs 3 and 5 within these regions the gcm derived rainfall erosivity projections show a high variability in terms of their standard deviation fig 8 and their spatial convergence fig 7 cold areas siberia canada scandinavia with a characteristically very low baseline erosivity 500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 will experience a relatively high increase 73 115 by 2070 but low in absolute terms max 550 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 these high latitude regions show very low variability in the gcm outputs fig 8 and typically display broad expanses of high model spatial convergence interrupted by lower agreement in some continental interiors fig 7 arid areas north africa south latin america central asia and australia possessing a relatively low baseline erosivity 850 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 will experience a relatively high increase 50 80 by 2070 with medium variability in all areas outside of cold climatic areas the increase of erosivity in the period 2050 2070 is smoothened compared to the increasing trend in 2010 2050 this is mainly driven by the climate change projections for the periods 2010 2050 and 2050 2070 which contain different magnitudes of change and also different time increments respectively regarding the above mentioned aggregated results we note locally different trends that are shown in our analysis and may differ from the generalised trend description figs 5 6 and 8 the small embedded graph fig 8 bottom left shows the density plot of the standard deviation in practice the share of pixels per class over the full statistical distribution probability density convertible to a by multiplying by 100 functions are continuous probability distributions constructed by summing a gaussian distribution over the target data series and normalizing it such that its integral equals 1 sharman et al 2018 in all three rcps the sd curves have a peak in the range of 100 150 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and a positively skewed tail the peak in the rcp2 6 is lower compared to the rcp8 5 showing that the higher rcp has a slightly increasing variability this is also proved by comparing the mean sd for the 3 rcps based on the density plot c a 50 of the area has standard deviation in the range of 0 250 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 this lower 50 of the curve area responds dynamically to an increase in the rcp scenario the upper 50 of the curve area comprising the positively skewed tail remains relatively static with increasing rcp scenarios in summary this suggests that the predictive uncertainty in erosivity from model endmembers remains constantly high in all rcp scenarios in areas with a high baseline erosivity low latitudes whereas outside of these areas higher latitudes the model variability scales positively with the rcp scenario 4 2 projections of extremes at the global scale the areas experiencing very high erosivity 5 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 show little change in the 2050 climatic scenarios compared to the 2010 baseline fig 4 however there is a small increase from 2 9 to 3 8 in areas experiencing the most extreme erosivity 10 000 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 between 2010 and 2050 fig 4 at the event timescale a small number of storms with a high rainfall volume and or intensity during a year tend to contribute disproportionately to the annual and long term rainfall erosivity of a climate state in a given area bezak et al 2021 the dominance of such events typically increases at lower latitudes however with unpredictable patterns through space and time as it is difficult to account for the changing frequency and magnitude characteristics of such extreme events contributing to the long term average precipitation in the future min et al 2011 there remains residual uncertainty beyond that captured by the cmip5 model ensemble principally in areas where localized extreme events dominate or will become more dominant tabari et al 2019 in practice due to the difficulty of accounting for extreme rainfall events in any of the rcps the cmip5 long term monthly average inputs into the gpr model tend to smoothen the erosivity projections in the areas with very high erosivity this reasoning likely explains the small positive and negative trends 2010 2050 in some areas with a high 2010 baseline erosivity such as parts of the tropical and temperate climatic zones figs 3 and 4 similarly the detectable spatial trend of decreasing rainfall erosivity covering the areas around major mountain belts e g the north american rockies the southern american andes the himalayas the east african rift valley and the european alps may relate to a decreasing volume of rainfall but could potentially be offset by a higher individual storm intensity or increased frequency of extreme storms as a proportion of the total precipitation therefore our erosivity projections in highly erosive areas are likely rather conservative particularly in areas with cmip5 endmember disagreement or where the assumption of model stationarity does not hold due to different precipitation characteristics 4 3 evaluation of the temporal transposability of erosivity projections a direct model validation is not possible for future predictions therefore we employed all available downscaled cmip5 models of future precipitation to give the most robust estimate of the future trend in rainfall because the future cmip5 predictions do not match the high temporal resolution 1h of past observational data this modelling approach builds on the generalized nonlinear relationships between long term bio climatic variables and rainfall erosivity with rainfall as the independent input variable changing through time therefore to gauge the uncertainty in the predictions associated with changes in the gpr model stationarity through time we investigated whether the bioclimatic indices included in the gpr model will have the same influence in the future as in the baseline period to test the validity of the assumption of a stationary relationship we split gloreda into two sub datasets pre 2000 and post 2000 explained in section 2 4 worldclim offers the option to have the historical data on monthly temperature rainfall and bioclimatic attributes for the past period 1970 2000 harris et al 2014 https www worldclim org data monthlywth html to test the gpr prediction capacity we fitted the pre 2000 data using the estimated erosivity derived from measured high temporal resolution rainfall data then the fitted gpr model was used to predict the post 2000 period using the same post 2000 period worldclim data those predictions were validated against the measured erosivity in the post 2000 period data splitting for validating models in different time periods is used also in other studies almagro et al 2017 if we consider the entirety of the dataset over all years the prediction capacity modelled vs observed r2 value is 0 81 fitting the gpr model to the pre 2000 gloreda data achieved an r2 of 0 85 dropping to 0 60 when the corresponding model was used to predict the post 2000 dataset the line of best fit dotted defines the linear relationship between gloreda observations and the gpr model output for both time domains fig 9 interestingly the gpr model tends to slightly overestimate rainfall erosivity in the pre 2000 period but underestimate it in the post 2000 period alongside an increase in the data spread in the post 2000 period this small systematic under prediction appears to be influenced by the occurrence of a higher number of outliers where the rainfall erosivity is significantly underestimated this underestimation and increased spread can attribute to 2 possible causes 1 the changing importance non stationarity of the predictive bio climatic variables across the 2 time periods or 2 the occurrence of rare extreme events in the data post 2000 data record that did not occur in the pre 2000 record 4 4 plausibility and comparison with regional studies a validation sensu stricto of the future projections of this global study with regional and local studies is not possible for many reasons a different studies employ different model applications and frameworks b studies use different input climatic data for historical and future periods c the time periods covered are variable between studies and d uncertainty in future climate trends makes the gcm selection and downscaling approach important however we reviewed existing studies that provide rainfall erosivity projections in the same period as our projections 2050 the comparison of our study with 20 regional studies is conducted based on the corresponding spatial extent scenarios if listed in the study and period table 1 this review highlights the good coverage of regional studies on all continents fig s3 with 17 out of the 20 reviewed studies published during the last 5 years suggesting an increasing scientific interest in the relationship between climate change and erosion in 18 out of the 20 study comparisons the erosivity change projected in this study between the 2010 baseline and 2050 climatic periods matched the trend or were in the same order of magnitude as the projected change in the corresponding regional study table 1 in the case of tanzania and tibetan plateau our study estimated either a decrease or a small increase in erosivity in 2050 while available regional studies chapman et al 2021 teng et al 2018 projected a net increase based on a more limited selection of gcms than applied in this study the difference can be explained by the high uncertainty of our results in these areas with notably high standard deviation in the gcm model outputs fig 8 and mixed directional trends in the gcm model fig 7 these findings give a strong importance to the choice of gcm in these regions in addition the low number of gloreda stations with measured erosivity in parts of africa and high mountain areas contributes to this uncertainty 5 limitations the global rainfall erosivity projections do not challenge any local or regional studies which have been developed with higher gauge station density and using higher temporal resolution rainfall fata the number of stations with measured erosivity is rather limited allowing us only to predict and interpret trends in the future global dynamics of rainfall erosivity rather than deterministically predict exact changes in magnitude in addition the confidence given to the spatial patterns of projected rainfall erosivity in this study should be interpreted based on the underlying rain gauge density in the gloreda database it remains difficult to find and collate high temporal resolution e g sub hourly rainfall data at a global scale with 3 625 stations in 63 countries gloreda represents the current best effort at compiling the high temporal resolution gauge data necessary for rainfall erosivity calculations the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda will become available with the stations values allowing the further inclusion of data from areas in which we lack baseline information to model future relationships e g africa additionally using gloreda as a data tool future work can help to overcome some of the problems related to spatial and temporal scale when using coarse gridded observations to predict rainfall erosivity which involves fine spatiotemporal characteristics the use of alternative methods to estimate erosivity such as the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph proved to smoothen areas with high erosivity kim et al 2020 showing that the better accountancy of extremes in continental to global scale modelling remains an important frontier to properly capture to the soil erosion risk associated with rainfall erosivity bezak et al 2022 the coupled model intercomparison projection cmip has now released the data for the phase 6 while here we have used the data in the phase 5 cmip5 since downscaling is a vital pre requisite for a study of this kind we only considered downscaled simulations due to the lack of a publicly available cmip6 dataset with downscaled projections at this time here we have used the data from the downscaled phase 5 cmip5 assessment an additional limitation comes from the use of worldclim as input data since the unequal time intervals 2010 2050 and 2070 doesn t give an optimal overview of the impact of evolution in the climatic state on rainfall erosivity in addition the available bio climatic layers represent time slices of 20 years for the 2050 2041 2060 and 2070 2061 2080 climatic periods compared to 30 years for the historical baseline period in climate change studies hirabayashi et al 2013 the 30 year time slice is most commonly used to represent the average climatic state however worldclim is the only available dataset with historical and future climatic projections that give harmonised covariate inputs matching the methodological approach of this study at a global scale in case there are no future open source data releases overcoming these outlined limitations future global scale studies may seek to implement their own gcm downscaling regimes to capture the climatic variability at suitable scales for erosion studies for regional and local assessments regional climate models rcms provide detailed estimates of meteorological parameters and fill the gap of coarse resolution gcm data tapiador et al 2020 5 1 climate change erosion and adaptation this study paves the way to consider the impact of global warming on the erosion risk associated with heavy rainfall in the late 2010 s modelling studies suggested that heavy rainfall events increase at a rate of roughly 7 per degree of warming trenberth 2011 by modelling rainfall erosivity a parameter derived from the most extreme fraction of rainfall here we show that an increase of 1 2 mean global temperature has important nonlinear consequences on rainfall erosivity in future climate scenarios this study shows the areas regions countries etc where the projected impacts of climate change will cause higher erosion and present a greater risk to soil health fig s1 therefore those areas can adapt to erosivity changes by adopting management practices and strategies to increase soil resilience and decrease their vulnerability soil and water conservation policy design must account for such climate change dynamics in relation to agriculture food security and sustainability to ensure soil longevity the future increasing trends of rainfall erosivity will likely produce sharp increases in soil erosion without mitigation strategies these simulated projections are alarming particularly as they cover global lowland areas producing global food stocks and highly susceptible semi arid regions with sparse vegetation cover major policy initiatives are necessary to combat the changes in erosive forces and secure soil resources as an example the major increases of erosivity in the sahel region necessitates the need to accelerate the initiatives such as the great green wall this african led movement has as an objective to plant 1 billion trees across 8 000 km in africa therefore reducing land degradation and increase climate resilience elagib et al 2021 in the european union the green deal has also put as an objective to plant more than three billion trees by 2030 to reduce land degradation montanarella and panagos 2021 5 2 data availability the rainfall erosivity projections for all scenarios and three rcps and both for years 2050 and 2070 will be available in the european soil data centre esdac https esdac jrc ec europa eu we will make available both the aggregated data presented in this manuscript and the 102 contributing simulations in a geotiff format with a 30 arc seconds spatial resolution since we make available the simulations for each of the 19 gcm the user of those data may select the most appropriate one according to each model performance mcsweeney et al 2015 these erosivity projections together with land use change estimations have been the main driver to estimate the rates of future global soil erosion by water for 2070 borrelli et al 2020 and the projections of soil loss by water erosion in europe by 2050 panagos et al 2021 these provided datasets can be of use both for biophysical modelers and social and economic studies who intend to investigate the future socioeconomic vulnerability in different global areas with a susceptibility to soil resource insecurity 6 conclusions we estimated the future global projections of rainfall erosivity for 2050 and 2070 climatic scenarios using the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda and an ensemble of 19 downscaled cmip5 general circulation models for three rcps for 2050 the mean global erosivity may increase in the range 26 2 28 9 scaling positively with the rcp scenario 2 6 4 5 8 5 in most global regions within the ensemble of 19 model endmembers for 2050 at least seven scenarios project an increase of 30 for 2070 the mean global erosivity may increase in the range 27 34 similarly scaling positively with the degree of anthropogenic forcing rcp scenario within this 2070 projection four scenarios project changes of 35 with no scenario projecting an increase below 25 the rainfall erosivity variability predicted from the cmip5 endmember ensemble was high generally increasing with the rcp scenario based on the ensemble mean 80 85 of the global land surface will display an increasing trend in the rainfall erosivity and the remaining 15 20 a decreasing trend in most of the globe the cmip5 models show a convergence in the directional trend of erosivity as most or all have the same positive or negative trend suggesting high confidence in the directional trend in general arid and cold climatic zones show a pronounced increasing trend in rainfall erosivity relative to a 2010 baseline this corresponds to large projected changes in the northern hemisphere due to the continental figuration tropical and temperate climate zones show a less pronounced increase or decrease in rainfall erosivity from their relatively higher 2010 baseline values corresponding to a lower susceptibility of rainfall erosivity to climate change in large parts of the southern hemisphere the inclusion of all 19 cmip5 climate change models originating from different institutes and countries around the globe into a modelling framework resulted in 102 simulations which will become available in the european soil data centre esdac this inclusive approach

3307,microbial mediated redox reactions typically control the solute mobilization in groundwater systems in which the clay aquitard is usually a triggering factor of the release of the dissolved organic carbon ammonium and iron into the aquifer during pore water discharge and clay compaction however solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction is generally mistaken for a similar water rock interaction process in aquifers controlled by microbial mediated redox reactions through a simulation experiment on argillaceous sediment compaction we tested the currently accepted solute mobilization mechanism and determined that the variation in the mineral structure dominates it the variation in the mineral structure occurs in low symmetry minerals such as clay minerals and is controlled by the sediment moisture content the liquid plastic limit and the effective stress when the sediment moisture content decreases to below the plastic limit through pore water discharge and compaction sudden changes in the mineral structure occur releasing iron and capturing ammonium through variations in the relative position of the si o tetrahedrons and isomorphism of similar atoms without the participation of microbial mediated redox reactions these results suggest that the biochemical reactivities of organic carbon iron and ammonium are sometimes overestimated i e when the role of the physical processes is ignored in solute mobilization during clay compaction which warrants more attention and investigation keywords mineral structure solute mobilization clay compaction isomorphism ammonium iron 1 introduction the clay aquitard is typically considered to be an inactive or low activity component of groundwater systems hendry et al 2003 hendry and wassenaar 2005 pi et al 2015 shaw and hendry 1998 xie et al 2014 but it has been proven to cause several profound variations in aquifers including abnormal increases in arsenic ammonium halogen elements and rare earth elements johannesson and hendry 2000 fendorf et al 2010 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 pierre et al 2021 after several decades of research the reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides and microorganism activity have become widely accepted as the arsenic and ammonium releasing mechanisms in shallow aquifers mukherjee et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and the dissolved organic matter and other solutes released from the clay aquitard have become accepted as the triggering factors in this process erban et al 2013 wang et al 2013 ayers et al 2016 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 other processes such as the mobilization of rare earth elements in aquitard and aquifer systems have been found to be controlled by the carbonate concentration and absorption on clay minerals johannesson and hendry 2000 moreover the dehydration of smectite and the ion filtration of clay sediments lead to variations in the chloride isotopes and pore water freshening brown et al 2001 agrinier et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 however the solute mobilization mechanisms of the clay aquitard itself have received little attention compared to the subsequent influences of the released solutes especially the compaction effect furthermore due to the occurrence of arsenic ammonium and organic pollutants in contaminated shallow groundwater coupled with and a general lack of available unpolluted surface water sources the strong demand for safe deep groundwater has resulted in increasingly intensive clay compaction in the deep strata chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 previous studies have emphasized the outside risk to deep groundwater including infiltration and transport of contaminated shallow groundwater and reductive dissolution caused by the input of organic carbon from the clay aquitard erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 in contrast the compaction effect of the clay aquitard could be a potential internal threat such as the addition of iodine to groundwater resources which has attracted little attention xue et al 2019 in addition the solute mobilization mechanisms of this process are still unclear which could lead to misunderstanding of the factors controlling the quality of deep closed groundwater systems a previous study on solute mobilization during clay compaction accepted the viewpoints of the research on riverside aquifer systems and lakes and wetlands with seasonal water level variations xiao et al 2021 in which reductive dissolution microorganism activity and adsorption desorption were considered postma et al 2007 mladenov et al 2010 guo et al 2014 in addition the reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides has been observed in aquifers with abnormally high arsenic concentrations which also seems to support this point of view kocar and fendorf 2009 hartland et al 2015 richards et al 2017 schaefer et al 2017 smith et al 2017 malakar et al 2021 however the evidence of redox domination seems to be insufficient in deep confined aquifers that suffer from clay compaction and the sources of organic carbon and the sedimentary depth where reductive dissolution occurs has been debated mcarthur et al 2008 sengupta et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 thermodynamically the activity of organic carbon and fe oxides is quite low in deep clays and the reductive dissolution of iron oxides has been observed only when either more reactive exogenous forms of iron oxides or organic carbon are added mcmahon 2001 stuckey et al 2016 however based on isotopic data it has been determined that the element enrichment in an aquifer and the compaction of the clay aquitard in the deep stratum are related hendry et al 2000 mahara and kitaoaka 2009 mozumder et al 2020 but the solute mobilization mechanism is difficult to understand due to the complex sedimentary history jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 moreover the vertical variations in borehole sediments and pore water chemistry are sometimes ascribed to clay compaction during sedimentation ayers et al 2016 driese 2004 which ignores the different origins of the sediments at different depths banfield et al 1991 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b having carefully considered the circumstances of clay aquitards and the compaction effect we suggest that the following three prevalent hypotheses have led to misunderstandings concerning the solute mobilization mechanisms during clay compaction first the redox conditions of clay aquitards are stable and they rarely receive recharge with little extra dissolved oxygen and organic carbon from the aquifers due to their low permeability marty et al 2003 moreover the iron oxides and organic carbon in the deep clay are relatively inactive thermodynamically mcmahon 2001 stuckey et al 2016 so there is neither exogenous electron input nor sufficient endogenous electron release ruling out the occurrence of microbial mediated redox reactions under such stable closed and inactive circumstances fig 1 a lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 xiao et al 2021 second microbial mediated redox reactions and adsorption desorption do occur in riverside aquifer systems and lake and wetland sediments where redox reactions dominate the solute mobilization instead of clay compaction schaefer et al 2017 the seasonal water level variations saturated condition of the sediments temperature and oxygen content in the vadose zone are the decisive factors and the compaction of clay sediments is negligible beck et al 2008 the arsenic release caused by reductive dissolution has been observed in deep confined aquifers because the compaction of the clay aquitard releases reductants and carbon resources into the adjacent aquifers mihajlov et al 2020 moreover the sedimentary window may compromise the hydraulic integrity of clay aquitards leading to preferential flow during solute mobilization timms et al 2018 mozumder et al 2020 however this reductive dissolution occurs in the aquifers rather than the clay aquitard fig 1b third the variations in the concentrations of various solutes in sediments with borehole depth do not represent the compaction effect of sediments in the sedimentary history which is always ignored jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the origins of sediments at different depths are variable briefly borehole sediments at different depths do not represent different periods or compaction stages of a consistent sedimentary history on the contrary these sediments are the products of different origins in different periods or compaction stages which indicates that the variation patterns found in borehole sediments may have nothing to do with the compaction process of the clay aquitard fig 1c in conclusion the electron source of reductive dissolution and microorganism activity the reaction location and the theory of compaction are unclear and confusing these three possible scenarios fig 1 shake the foundation of previously proposed solute mobilization mechanisms during clay compaction which requires further investigation furthermore the eh ph diagrams of pore water in previous studies have shown that ferrihydrite is a stable form of fe indicating that the aqueous fe detected in the clay aquitard s pore water is unstable and the groundwater is supersaturated in ferrihydrite hodgkinson et al 2008 xiao et al 2021 similar results have been found for arsenic yan et al 2000 and other variable valence elements which indicates that the release of these solute is not a spontaneous reaction and is restricted by thermodynamics based on the gibbs free energy stuckey et al 2016 since microbial mediated redox reactions have been ruled out due to the occurrence of inappropriate reaction conditions reactivity and circumstances we suggest that the gradually increasing pressure could be a possibly key factor during the compaction of the clay aquitard the dissolution and water rock interactions in the clay aquitard may be influenced by the compaction pressure brown et al 2001 hupers and kopf 2012 agrinier et al 2019 priebe et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 in rock mechanism research pressure solution has been widely observed in sedimentary rocks that is calcite dolomite and quartz will dissolve in the high stress zone and reform in the low stress zone pucci 1998 williams et al 2001 maher et al 2006 the preferred orientation of illite has been observed in high pressure zones such as fault gouge and metamorphic rocks wenk et al 2010 moreover the isomorphism of nh4 and k in illite has been observed in deep strata and is significant in the formation of coal oil and gas compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 in addition the high pressure behaviors of mineral crystals have been thoroughly investigated in previous simulation experiments and the results indicate that the cell parameters and phases of the minerals vary regularly with pressure haines and cambon 2004 zanazzi et al 2007 comodi et al 2008 however nearly all previous borehole and experimental research focused on the tectonic zone and diagenetic stage in which strong stress leads to significant variations in the mineral structures zheng 2012 richards 2015 abd elmola et al 2020 yin et al 2020 on the contrary the stress in clay aquitard compaction is quite low usually such a low stress is unable to cause significant statistical variations in the mineral structures according to previous research comodi and zanazzi 1995 guidotti et al 2000 studies of the compaction of argillaceous sediments early diagenesis mud and mudstones all denied that there is a variation in the mineral structures during the clay aquitard compaction stage chilingarian et al 1995 potter et al 2005 schulz 2006 consequently a widely accepted viewpoint is that the hydrogeochemistry and microorganisms dominate the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards and variations in the mineral structures occur during early diagenesis middle diagenesis late diagenesis and epidiagenesis potter et al 2005 schulz 2006 du et al 2018 interestingly several fluid studies have reported variations in the pore water geochemistry caused by smectite dehydration under relatively low experimental effective stress conditions coltenbradley 1987 hupers and kopf 2012 which are generally supposed to occur in high stress zones such as convergent margins brown et al 2001 henry and bourlange 2004 agrinier et al 2019 in this study we challenge the three prevalent hypotheses regarding the solute mobilization mechanism during the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards fig 1 first the often ignored physical process involved in solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction could be the solution to the contradiction in the electron source since the physical process requires neither exogenous electron input nor sufficient endogenous electron release x ray diffraction analysis of borehole sediments was carried out to determine the contribution of the physical process and the silt and clay particles in the borehole sediments were extracted and analyzed since the inactive components such as sand particles may obscure the variations in the mineral structure second to reproduce the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards we developed a device for simulating the compaction in order to reproduce the conditions argillaceous sediments are subjected to during compaction the experimental samples were collected from natural argillaceous sediments and the mechanical stress was used as a substitute for the formation pressure in the argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments the hydrochemistry of the discharged pore water and the components of the released gases were continuously monitored to determine the dominant process finally the experimental samples were continuously collected without stress unloading during the simulation experiments to reproduce the continuous and consistent compaction history of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards the silt and clay particles in the experimental samples were extracted and subjected to x ray diffraction xrd analysis and rietveld refinements to determine the solute mobilization mechanism inside the aquitard governed by the physical process 2 samples and methods 2 1 collection of borehole samples we collected 114 borehole sediments from different depths in 10 boreholes in the jianghan plain china where the groundwater has been reported to be contaminated by arsenic ammonium and nitrate chen et al 2017 du et al 2017 xie et al 2018 yu et al 2018 du et al 2020 liu et al 2020c sun et al 2021 the compaction of the clay aquitard may be an ignored source of these pollutants which leads to contaminant release so we investigated the clay sediments at different depths another consideration that was taken into account is the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the jianghan plain the large thickness of the sediments indicates that the variation in the compaction degree of the clay sediments is continuous and slowly changes with depth from the flow state to the consolidation state which makes it easy to observe if there is a variation in the mineral structure the details of boreholes and borehole sediments are presented in tables 1 and 2 in the supplementary materials the borehole sediments were freeze dried and ground to 75 μm and then sent for xrd analysis 2 2 argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments based on the preliminary xrd data for the borehole sediments we selected fresh argillaceous sediment from chen lake in the jianghan plain china as the initial samples for the simulation experiments compared to the borehole sediments in the rest of the boreholes the borehole sediments in chen lake exhibited the largest variations in the ratio of the mineral peak intensities and had a relatively high clay mineral content research data 4 in addition in the permanently saturated sediments the redox conditions and the microbial community in the lacustrine sediments were relatively stable compared to those of the fluvial sediments from the other boreholes and they were more consistent with the conditions of the deep clay sediments the characteristics of the initial samples are presented in table 3 in the supplementary materials the simulation experiments were carried out using a device developed in this study to simulate compaction the details of the device are presented in section 2 and fig 1 in the supplementary materials briefly the device consists of a servo motor for stress loading a sealed sample cell several sampling outlets for solid and liquid samples a gas liquid separator an automatic sample collector and a workstation for stress and temperature control and data collection when the simulation experiment started the servo motor applied the stress according to the initialization program the workstation recorded the displacement temperature and stress data at the selected interval a solid sample was collected from the sampling outlets every 24 h and its moisture content was measured these samples were later subjected to xrd analysis simultaneously liquid samples were collected by an automatic sample collector and were divided into several portions for on site electrode analysis and spectrophotometry analysis as well as for later cation analysis anion analysis and dissolved organic carbon analysis subsequently the quantity of the gas released was determined if the volume of gas exceeded 20 ml then a 10 ml gas sample was collected and analyzed this experimental procedure was repeated every day until the set end time of the experiment using this procedure we carried out two argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments and the experimental conditions were as follows in the first experiment the stress load was increased from 0 00 mpa to 6 00 mpa at a rate of 0 02 mpa h and the temperature was maintained at 293 k forty three liquid samples 12 solid samples and 3 gas samples were collected during the experiment in the second experiment the stress load was increased from 0 00 mpa to 8 60 mpa at a rate of 0 02 mpa h and the temperature was maintained at 305 k sixty five liquid samples 18 solid samples and 3 gas samples were collected during the experiment the purpose of the higher temperature in the second experiment was to observe the variations in the activity of the microbial mediated redox reactions compared to the first experiment since there is no effective sterilization method for argillaceous sediments that does not damage the sample high pressure steam and irradiation sterilization significantly heat up the sediments and lead to hydrochemical changes in the pore water in addition the low permeability of argillaceous sediments rules out the use of an antibacterial agent generally the antibacterial agent cannot sufficiently infiltrate into the sediments to an effective concentration level thus the second experiment with a higher temperature was conducted in place of a sterilized group in order to determine the contribution of the microbial mediated redox reactions the stress load program was set according to the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the jianghan plain and the equation for calculating the formation pressure xiao et al 2021 which approximately corresponds to the formation pressure for 200 to 300 m sediments the rate of stress loading was set according to both the demands of the analysis and the monitoring frequency a high rate will lower the monitoring frequency while a low rate is unable to produce enough samples the purpose of extending the stress loading range and experiment time in the second experiment was to observe the subsequent variations from the first experiment in which the variations in some of the solutes did not reach equilibrium another purpose of carrying out the second experiment was to determine whether the argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiment was repeatable 2 3 extraction of silt and clay particles we believe that the variations in the mineral structure during argillaceous sediment compaction are obscured because the minerals cannot recrystallize and separate from each other under the low stress of compaction unlike relatively pure minerals collected from high stress areas such as diagenesis and tectonic zones like faults and convergent margins argillaceous sediments in the compaction stage of a clay aquitard are a mixture of various minerals some of the inactive components have stable mineral structures under low stress for example quartz and calcite which may obscure the structural variations in the unstable minerals that belong to the monoclinic and triclinic systems the purpose of extracting the silt and clay particles was to reduce the influence of the sand component which is mostly composed of quartz and to increase the relative contents of the clay minerals in order to allow the variations in the clay minerals to be large enough to detect on the xrd patterns to achieve this goal we used stokes law in the extraction of the silt and clay particles without using any dispersant except ultra pure water fig 3 in the supplementary materials in order to avoid uncontrollable chemical damage to the mineral structure salemi et al 2010 in detail approximately 2 g of solid sample and 40 ml of ultra pure water were added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then dispersed with ultrasonic assistance the dispersion of the sample was checked every 30 min and the temperature of the ultrasonic device was controlled at 298 k if the temperature of the ultrasonic device exceeded 298 k the medium was replaced with cold medium every 2 h the centrifuge tube was taken out of the ultrasonic device and shaken for 5 min this entire procedure was repeated 4 to 6 times until there were not visible large particles because no other chemical dispersant was used in the procedure the dispersion of the samples with a low moisture content was more difficult and required more repetition of these steps subsequently the sufficiently dispersed sample was transferred into a 1 l beaker for sedimentation separation according to stokes law the sedimentation times were calculated to be 4 min and 39 s and 7 h and 45 min for the silt 2 to 20 μm and clay 2 μm particles respectively in the preliminary extraction the sand particles were removed from the mixture after sedimentation separation of 4 min and 39 s the upper 10 cm of the suspension were syphoned into a new 1 l beaker for later separation during which the silt particles sank and the clay particles floated after sedimentation separation for 7 h and 45 min after each sedimentation separation stage the upper 10 cm of the suspension were syphoned into a new 1 l beaker for later separation and the preliminary beaker was replenished with ultra pure water for repeated sedimentation separation until the upper 10 cm were clear generally the procedure needed to be repeated more than three times but the exact number of repetitions depended on the silt and clay contents of the samples then the suspensions of silt and clay were centrifuged at 7000 rpm to remove the redundant solvent and the sediments were freeze dried slightly ground and sent for xrd analysis 2 4 method of rietveld refinement the extracted silt and clay particles were still composed of several types of minerals and the peak intensities and positions in the xrd patterns may represent the complex variations in the minerals and thus rietveld refinement of the xrd patterns was necessary to enable investigation of the mineral structures the rietveld refinement was performed using fullprof edpcr rodriguezcarvajal 1993 the borehole sediments without the extraction of silt and clay particles were not refined due to the poor resolution and low intensities of their xrd patterns nevertheless their peak positions intensities and mineral species were extracted from the xrd patterns for later analysis the silt and clay particles extracted from the solid samples collected during the two simulation experiments were refined using the rietveld method considering the source of the initial sample we selected sediments from g1 borehole in chen lake as the control group and the extracted silt and clay particles were refined using the same method a brief description of the rietveld method is provided below and additional details of the rietveld method are presented in section 4 of the supplementary material six types of minerals were identified in all of the xrd patterns and the initial structures of the minerals were obtained from the crystallography open database cod downs and hall wallace 2003 grazulis et al 2009 grazulis et al 2012 grazulis et al 2015 merkys et al 2016 quiros et al 2018 vaitkus et al 2021 table 1 we simplified the compositions of the minerals which included removing the isomorphic atoms with extremely low occupancies and replacing the chemical formula with the empirical formula and adjusting the temperature factors of all of the atoms to a default of 0 5 based on the simplified mineral structure and sensitivity analysis we identified the major factors that led to the variations in the xrd patterns the sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing each parameter with a 1 variation and calculating the subsequent variations in the peak intensities of the xrd patterns the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in section 5 of the supplementary material the diagram showing the differences in the observations and calculations as well as the prf file are presented in fig 4 7 in the supplementary material and research data 8 2 5 standards and methods of analysis the cation and anion standard solutions were obtained from the o2si co ltd south carolina usa the mixture of standard gases was obtained from the wuhan iron and steel group oxygen co ltd wuhan china the electrode standard solutions were obtained from thermofisher scientific co ltd massachusetts usa the hydrochloric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid nessler s reagent pdt disulfonate and potassium hydrogen phthalate were obtained from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the concentrations of the cations and anions were measured via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes pe avio 200 and ion chromatography ic thermofisher dionex aquion with gradient elution the gas compositions were measured via gas chromatography gc with a thermal conductivity detector tcd a flame ionization detector fid and a methane conversion furnace shimadzu 2014 fid tcd with porapak q and 13x molecular sieve columns the heating program was to hold the sample at 40 c for 15 min the current and temperature of the tcd detector were 75 ma and 150 c respectively the temperatures of the fid detector and the methane conversion furnace were 250 c and 350 c respectively the flow of the carrier gas and reference gas was 20 ml min and the carrier gas and reference gas were helium the concentration of the dissolved organic carbon was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer elementar vario toc analyzer the borehole samples without extraction were sent to the department of materials science and chemistry china university of geosciences wuhan for xrd analysis bruker d8 3 kw and 5 to 70 at 5 min

solid samples were measured using a halogen water determination meter the liquid plastic limits of the solid samples were measured using a liquid plastic limit combined determination meter the ph dissolved oxygen content conductivity and redox potential of the samples were measured using an advanced electrochemistry meter thermofisher orion versa star pro the image of the crystal structure was produced using vesta momma and izumi 2011 the details of the instruments parameters standard chromatogram and standard curve are presented in section 9 in the supplementary material 2 6 quality control and assurance all of the instruments were calibrated using standard solutions before each analysis a certain number of standards were inserted into the sample sequence during continuous analysis to ensure that the instruments remained stable enough to provide reliable results the standard recoveries of each type of cation ranged from 83 15 to 104 22 and the standard recovery of arsenic was the lowest due to the relatively inappropriate method of analysis i e icp oes the standard recoveries of carbon dioxide methane nitrogen and oxygen via gc analysis ranged from 96 3 to 103 2 the standard recovery of the dissolved organic carbon using the toc analyzer ranged from 100 58 to 110 34 the detection limits of the dissolved organic carbon gases cations and anions were 0 1 mg l 1 ppm and 0 01 0 01 mg l respectively the correlation coefficients of all of the standard curves are greater than 0 999 except for the correlation coefficients of the oxygen and nitrogen standard curves obtained via gc analysis which were 0 997 because the large standard range exceeded the linear intervals the relative standard deviation of the parameters in the rietveld refinement is below 10 and the λ2 of the rietveld refinements ranges from 1 34 to 6 81 in which the λ2 value of the borehole sediment sample is the highest because it contains the maximum number of mineral types the device developed to simulate compaction could also be a source of analytical error therefore several types of blank experiments were carried out to ensure that the device developed to simulate compaction did not absorb or release the solutes during the experiments research data 1 the results of the blank experiments confirmed that the device did not absorb or release the solutes under the highest temperature 305 k and highest stress 8 6 mpa conditions used in the simulation experiments in addition the loss of sample during the separation and delivery processes was taken into consideration the loss in the gas liquid separator ranged from 6 12 to 9 36 and the loss during delivery by the automatic sample collector ranged from 0 48 to 0 79 according to the analysis of the cations 3 results 3 1 mineral characteristic of borehole sediments four types of minerals were identified in the xrd patterns of the studied borehole sediments chlorite muscovite 2m1 albite and quartz we collected the peak intensity of the specific bragg positions for 114 raw borehole sediments and 18 extracted borehole sediments which correspond to the 001 and 002 peaks of chlorite 002 004 111 and 131 peaks of muscovite 2m1 1 1 1 and 200 peaks of albite and 100 and 101 peaks of quartz fig 2 a regular variations in the peak intensity ratio have not been found in raw borehole sediments the ratios of 002 to 004 002 to 111 and 002 to 131 in the muscovite 2m1 seem to decrease with depth in the boreholes but some boreholes exhibit complex and contradictory variations the same situation was observed for the chlorite and albite in the raw borehole sediments while the results for the extracted borehole sediments were much different for the extracted silt and clay particles the ratio of 001 to 002 for chlorite regularly decreases with depth in the boreholes and specifically the average decreases are from 1 33 to 0 38 and from 2 46 to 0 45 respectively fig 2b the variation in the peak intensity ratio with borehole depth before and after extraction indicates that the mineral structure probably changed during compaction but was obscured due to the complex character of particles in the raw sediments previous research usually ascribed the differences in the xrd patterns of the standards and samples to the preferred orientation of the crystals ho et al 1999 wenk et al 2010 but there are actually more complex factors that could lead to the variations in the peak intensity ratios of the minerals which will be discussed in detail later 3 2 pore water chemistry during argillaceous sediment compaction in the simulation experiments a total of 108 liquid samples and 6 gas samples were collected using an automatic sample and gas liquid separator collector in two simulation experiments the pore water was found to be ca hco3 type water it was slightly anoxic and alkaline and contained a certain amount of carbon dioxide and methane fig 3 shows the major variations in the pore water chemistry with increasing stress load in two simulation experiments the complete results are presented in the research data 5 3 2 1 redox conditions fig 3a presents the continuous monitoring data for the stress and the temperature and volume of the pore water released due to the heat loss through conduction the average temperature in the second experiment was approximately 300 k which was slightly lower than the set temperature of 305 k the temperature in the first experiment fluctuated between 293 k and 298 k which was slightly higher than the set temperature of 293 k due to the influence of the temperature of the room fig 3b indicates that ferrihydrite was the stable form of fe in the second experiment while part of the data for the first experiment is located in the ferrous iron region the eh and ph of the first experiment varied from 91 70 mv to 273 90 mv and from 7 025 to 8 031 respectively decreasing with increasing stress which seems to confirm the variation in the pore water conditions from oxidizing to reducing however when the temperature rose to 300 k in the second experiment the eh and ph fluctuated from 66 50 mv to 312 1 mv and from 7 333 to 7 964 respectively without an obvious trend furthermore the nitrate nitrite ammonium and sulfate did not respond to the variations in the eh and ph in either experiment denitrification and sulfate reduction processes rarely occurred in either experiment based on the stable concentrations of nitrate and sulfate yu et al 2018 the average concentrations of nitrate in experiments 1 and 2 were 5 15 1 98 mg l and 3 75 0 57 mg l and the average concentrations of sulfate were 5 32 1 23 mg l and 3 57 0 85 mg l respectively the concentrations of ammonium decreased from 6 45 mg l to 4 86 mg l and from 1 24 mg l to 0 71 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively which seems to contradict the variation in the pore water conditions from oxidizing to reducing du et al 2020 briefly there is a contradiction between the eh ph diagram and all of the redox sensitive ions except for ferrous iron and the correlation between ferrous iron and eh is weak r2 0 213 3 2 2 carbonate dissolution the pore water was ca hco3 type water in the two experiments fig 3c shows the milligram equivalent ratios of mg2 ca2 to hco3 the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were higher in the second experiment 6 to 10 meq l than in the first experiment 5 to 8 meq l which corresponds to the higher concentration of co2 fig 3f the part of the data shown in fig 3c plots near the 1 1 line which indicates ongoing carbonate dissolution in addition some of the data in fig 3c plot close to a horizontal line which indicates other sources of ca2 and mg2 in addition to carbonate dissolution huang et al 2017 carbonate dissolution is associated with carbon dioxide and the reactions that specifically produce co2 are as follows 1 c h 2 o o 2 h 2 o c o 2 2 2 c h 2 o c h 4 c o 2 then the carbon dioxide reacts with carbonate generally calcite and dolomite as follows 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a c o 3 c a 2 2 h c o 3 4 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o c a m g c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 4 h c o 3 the carbonate dissolution results in higher concentrations of mg2 ca2 and hco3 and there are other sources of extra hco3 such as reduction of ferrihydrite and sulfate postma et al 2007 the reactions are as follows 5 c h 2 o 4 f e oh 3 7 h 4 f e 2 h c o 3 10 h 2 o 6 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 h 2 s 2 h c o 3 fig 3c indicates that there are extra sources of ca2 and mg2 instead of hco3 meaning that additional so4 2 and no3 are required to compensate for this cation excess huang et al 2017 however the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate were stable during both experiments which indicates an apparent contradiction between the eh ph diagram carbonate dissolution and reductive dissolution there should be another unusual source of extra mg2 and ca2 3 2 3 cation exchange the chloride alkali indices cais are generally used to evaluate the strength of the cation exchange schoeller 1965 and cai 1 and cai 2 are calculated as follows 7 cai 1 γ c l γ n a γ k γ c l 8 cai 2 γ c l γ n a γ k γ s o 4 2 γ h c o 3 where γ m n is the milligram equivalent of m n cai 1 ranged from 0 35 to 0 23 and from 0 74 to 0 42 in the first and second experiments respectively and the corresponding cai 2 values ranged from 0 03 to 0 02 and from 0 08 to 0 07 fig 3d shows the variations in the chloride and the alkali metals in the released pore water the average concentrations of k were 5 88 0 35 mg l and 6 58 0 30 mg l and those of cl were 24 68 0 72 mg l and 24 04 1 24 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively the differences in the concentrations of k and cl between the first and second experiments were not statistically significant however there were obvious na peaks in both experiments but the corresponding stresses of the peaks were different interestingly the occurrence of the na peaks in fig 3d and the horizontal trends in ca2 and mg2 in fig 3c were synchronous in the two experiments which indicates that the increases in na ca2 and mg2 were not the result of cation exchange between these ions capuano and jones 2020 the relatively low cai 1 and cai 2 values indicate weak cation exchange in both experiments which contradicts the variations in fig 3c and d some researchers ascribe the increase in the cations to the dissolution of silicate by carbon dioxide li et al 2016 but the variation in hco3 does not support this hypothesis 3 2 4 iron ferrous iron lactate and dissolved organic carbon fig 3e shows the concentrations of several forms of iron and organic carbon generally the release of iron is associated with the dissolved organic carbon via microbial mediated redox reactions especially those of iron reducing bacteria suda and makino 2016 wang et al 2017 the average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were relatively high in experiments 1 and 2 13 7 2 9 mg l and 20 7 5 4 mg l respectively while the correlation coefficients of the iron and dissolved organic carbon were extremely low 0 1162 and 0 1733 respectively the shape and intensity of the iron peak were approximately the same in the first and second experiments fig 3e the variation in iron in the second experiment was an extension of that in the first experiment which suggests that the rising temperature and higher dissolved organic carbon content do not affect the release of iron in addition the maximum concentrations of iron were 10 25 mg l and 11 61 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively which contradicts the results of the slightly anoxic conditions and the relatively stable dissolved organic carbon content ferrous iron and lactate were not detected in the second experiment due to the relatively high eh 66 5 mv to 312 1 mv fig 3b while ferrous iron and lactate were synchronously detected in the first experiment but their concentrations were not related to each other the maximum concentrations of ferrous iron and lactate in the first experiment were 5 87 mg l and 2 74 mg l respectively the peak lactate concentration lagged behind the peak ferrous iron concentration which indicates that there was a reaction order between the iron and dissolved organic carbon the variations and forms of the released iron and dissolved organic carbon suggest that reductive dissolution was not the only iron release mechanism 3 2 5 released gases fig 3f shows the concentrations of oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide and methane gases released in the first and second experiments apparently all of these gases responded to the rising temperature and increasing dissolved organic carbon content which is demonstrated by the decrease in oxygen and increases in carbon dioxide and methane in the second experiment compared to the first the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane ranged from 674 53 ppm to 778 80 ppm and 1735 52 ppm to 4331 16 ppm in the first experiment and from 4143 31 ppm to 18536 81 ppm and 22610 92 ppm to 37702 73 ppm in the second experiment respectively in terms of the released gases the temperature and dissolved organic matter do have positive influences on the microorganism activity and reduction however the influences of microorganism activity and reduction seemed to gradually decrease rather than increase with increasing stress and progress of the experiment especially in the second experiment the concentration of the oxygen increased with decreasing carbon dioxide content i e from 20 77 to 22 21 in the first experiment and from 11 71 to 17 77 in the second experiment the release of oxygen from the sediments should have resulted in more reducing conditions in the sediments due to the decrease in the amount of oxidants while the variations in eh fig 3b and the released carbon dioxide and methane fig 3f indicate the slow cessation of microorganism activity and reducing reactions wersin et al 2011 3 3 sediment characteristics during argillaceous sediment compaction in the simulation experiments thirty sediment samples were collected without stress unloading in the two experiments and extraction of silt and clay particles were carried out to investigate the variations in the mineral structures in addition the total organic carbon contents of the sediment samples were determined to identify the source of the dissolved organic carbon in the released pore water fig 4 shows the moisture contents and total organic carbon contents of the sediment samples as well as some unusual variations around the liquid plastic limit 3 3 1 moisture content liquid plastic limit and total organic carbon fig 4a shows the moisture contents of each sediment sample from the two experiments the moisture contents of the sediments decrease with increasing stress due to the release of the pore water the moisture contents of the sediment ranged from 37 44 to 146 80 and from 24 29 to 121 54 in the first and second experiments respectively the liquid and plastic limits of the initial sediments were determined to be 77 34 and 40 23 in the two experiments the stresses of the liquid limit and plastic limit were 2 72 mpa and 3 64 mpa respectively in the first experiment and 1 86 mpa and 5 70 mpa in the second experiment compared to the second experiment the rate of pore water release was lower in the first experiment fig 3a while the slope of the moisture content of the sediments was higher fig 4a the difference between the bottom sediments and the entirety of the samples indicates that the compaction was more uneven in the first experiment the average total organic carbon contents of the sediments in the first experiment was 3 142 0 174 fig 4a shows that the degradation of organic carbon in the sediments was mild which is consistent with the relatively stable variations in the dissolved organic carbon content of the released pore water fig 3e the corresponding stresses of the liquid and plastic limit seem to be critical factors controlling some of the variations in the pore water chemistry fig 4b significant decreases in the nh4 concentration were observed near 3 64 mpa and 5 70 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively which correspond to the plastic limit of the sediments fig 4a simultaneously the synchronous increases in na and al3 at around 2 72 mpa and 1 86 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively interestingly correspond to the liquid limit of the sediments fig 4a the associations between the released pore water chemistry and the characteristics of sediments are obvious which indicates investigation of the released pore water chemistry should not be separated from that of the variations in the sediment characteristics during compaction of clay sediments 3 3 2 rietveld refinement of the extracted silt and clay particles fig 5 shows the major variations in the refined parameters and the results of the rietveld refinement of the silt and clay particles extracted during the two experiments the complete results are presented in research data 6 and the representative rietveld refinements of the extracted silt and clay are presented in fig 6 the variations in the mineral structures seem to be related to the plastic limit fig 5 which is the same as for the pore water chemistry fig 4b significant differences in the 002 and 004 peaks of muscovite 2m1 and the 001 and 002 peaks of chlorite were observed before and after the plastic limit fig 6a based on the rietveld refinements we ascribed the variations in the xrd patterns to the structural changes of the muscovite 2m1 and chlorite including the cell parameters and the occupancy of the atoms fig 5a and c the structural changes in the muscovite 2m1 in the silt were not completely the same in the first and second experiments specifically the cell parameters volume and a increased with increasing stress in the first experiment while cell parameters b and β decreased and increased respectively with increasing stress in the second experiment research data 6 the occupancy of nh4 tended to increase with increasing stress in the two experiments but the sudden change increase from approximately 0 15 to 0 35 was more obvious in the second experiment fig 5c the structural changes in the chlorite in the silt were approximately the same in the first and second experiments the cell parameters volume a c α and γ and the occupancy of fe decreased with increasing stress fig 5a and c in particular the variation in the occupancy of fe in the chlorite in the first experiment corresponded to the peak in the fe concentration of the released pore water fig 3e and the stress 2 72 mpa of the lowest occupancy of fe was the start of the fe peak in the diagram in fig 3e the sudden changes in the structure of the chlorite were obvious in the second experiment as well and these changes were similar to those of muscovite 2m1 fig 5 due to the decrease in the grain size the errors in the refined parameters of the rietveld refinement of the extracted clay particles became relatively larger research data 6 compared to the extracted silt particles fig 6a the rietveld refinement of the extracted clay particles fig 6b indicates that the structural differences in the muscovite 2m1 and chlorite in the clay particles before and after the plastic limit were not significant correspondingly the variations in the refined parameters of the extracted clay particles with increasing stress were less significant as well research data 6 indicating that the major variations in the mineral structures occurred in the silt particles there may be a larger concentration of stresses on the silt particles compared to the clay particles liu et al 2018 in the control group i e borehole g1 similar variations were found in the silt extracted from the borehole sediments in terms of the occupancies of nh4 and fe fig 7 a however the variations in the occupancies of the atoms with depth were relatively less significant compared to those in the simulated compaction experiments fig 5b due to the complex origins of the borehole sediments therefore the sediments from three boreholes g1 g3 and g4 in chen lake were sent for electric hot plate assisted digestion analysis with 68 nitric acid to further investigate the contribution of the structure changes of the clay minerals table 4 in the supplementary materials based on the digestion analysis results and the vertical profiles of the three boreholes the borehole sediments were divided into several groups according to their different characteristics and origins research data 2 in each group with similar characteristics and sedimentary environments the occupancies of fe and k in the mineral structures tended to gradually decrease with depth research data 2 correspondingly the occupancy of mg in the mineral structures slightly increased with depth in each group in the three boreholes this suggests that this isomorphism of atoms that is replacement of k by nh4 and replacement of fe by mg in the mineral structures probably occurs in naturally shallow aquitards as well fig 7b however the variations in the occupancies of the atoms in the mineral structures seem to be insufficient to completely explain the changes in the contents of the main elements in the borehole sediments for example the increase in mg only accounts for approximately one third of the decrease in fe which is most likely due to carbonate dissolution and reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides in shallow aquitards schaefer et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 compared to single crystal studies comodi and zanazzi 1995 comodi et al 2008 the errors in the refinement parameters for unconsolidated sediments are much larger however the increase in the error is predictable due to the complex components and low crystallinity of minerals in unconsolidated sediments even in a single crystal study the error in the refined parameters is larger at a stress of 0 1 mpa while it sharply decreases under stresses of greater than 0 25 gpa comodi et al 2008 due to the improved crystallization despite the relatively high errors the variations in the refined parameters are five times or more higher than the error research data 6 which ensures the accuracy of the analysis in addition the isomorphism of the atoms was simultaneous observed in both the natural sediments from the control borehole and the simulated compaction experiments which demonstrates the reliability of the results of the rietveld refinements 4 discussion based on the contradictions found in the pore water chemistry and the significant variations in the mineral structures through the rietveld refinement we suggest that traditional viewpoints such as microbial mediated redox reactions and adsorption are minor processes while the structural variations in the minerals predominantly control the solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction 4 1 variation patterns of mineral structure during clay compaction previous research suggests that the mineral structures are stable under low temperature and low stress conditions comodi and zanazzi 1995 comodi et al 2008 however our results indicate that this viewpoint is not applicable to clay minerals with low symmetry during clay compaction as the stress increases the variation in the structural parameters is regular in the extracted silt and can be summarized in three patterns fig 5 the overall variation patterns of the parameters specifically the variations in the cell parameters a b c and α β γ and volumes depend on the symmetry of the clay minerals fig 5a in this study muscovite 2m1 belongs to the monoclinic crystal system while chlorite belongs to the triclinic crystal system which indicates that the muscovite 2m1 possesses better symmetry than the chlorite therefore the overall parameters of muscovite 2m1 were relatively stable in the two experiments except for β representing a minor variation in the overall structure in contrast the overall parameters of chlorite including all of the cell parameters a b c and α β γ changed in the two experiments representing a major variation in the overall structure the variations in the overall parameters represent the sudden change that occurred at the plastic limit of the sediments the variation patterns of the atoms positions specifically the variations in the z of the two si o tetrahedrons were continuous in the muscovite 2m1 and were complex in the chlorite fig 5b there was an approximately linear variation between the stress and the relative positions of the si o tetrahedrons in the two experiments which indicates that the mineral structures gradually changed in order to adapt to the increase in stress the continuous variation patterns of the atoms positions were suddenly interrupted at the plastic limit of the sediments fig 5b the variation patterns of the occupancies of the atoms specifically the isomorphism of nh4 and k in muscovite 2m1 and mg and fe in chlorite fig 5c were similar to the variation patterns of the overall parameters fig 5a the difference was the occupied lattice sites specifically nh4 and k compete for one lattice site in muscovite 2m1 while mg and fe compete for three lattice sites in chlorite the larger number of lattice sites leads to the complex variation in the occupancies of fe and mg in chlorite which is dominated by neither stress nor the liquid plastic limit in contrast due to the competition for a single lattice site the variation in the occupancy of nh4 corresponds to the variation patterns of the overall parameters both of which occur at the plastic limit of the sediments these three variation patterns indicate that both continuous and sudden changes occur during clay compaction the continuous deformation of the mineral structures such as the relative displacements of the si o tetrahedrons occur to adapt to the gradual increase in stress when the moisture content drops below the plastic limit the sudden increase in the effective stress up to 0 77 mpa and 1 44 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively leads to sudden changes in the overall parameters and isomorphism of the atoms the corresponding variations were more obvious and accurate at the plastic limit of the sediments in the second experiment due to the higher effective stress research data 9 and the smoother moisture curve of the sediments fig 4a 4 2 variations in the pore water chemistry in response to the structural changes in the clay minerals as was previously shown in fig 3 the typical solute release mechanisms of microbial mediated redox reactions fail to explain the variations in the pore water chemistry the obvious contradictions between the redox conditions carbonate dissolution release of iron and increases in ca2 and mg2 indicate that the clay compaction does not conform to the mechanisms of microbial mediated redox reactions lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 wersin et al 2011 interestingly the structural changes in the clay minerals seem to be associated with the variations in the chemistry of the pore water fig 8 furthermore the structural changes in the clay minerals are physical and are not restricted by the redox conditions reductive dissolution or microorganism activity thus they are able to resolve the contradictions with the redox conditions and other factors apparently the decrease in the occupancy of fe in chlorite corresponds to the increase in the concentration of fe in the pore water so chlorite could be a source of the fe in the pore water peng et al 2014 ye et al 2020 similarly the increase in the occupancy of nh4 in the muscovite 2m1 corresponds to the decrease in the concentration of nh4 in the pore water so muscovite 2m1 could be a sink of the nh4 in the pore water compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 however due to the low symmetry of chlorite and the multiple lattice sites for iron the relevance is relatively weak compared to that of muscovite 2m1 including a lagged response and larger fluctuations fig 8b the structural variations in the clay minerals could also explain the cation exchange between the sediments and pore water fig 3d and 4b to some extent benedicto et al 2014 escamilla roa et al 2016 in addition to the corresponding variations in the nh4 and fe in the sediments and pore water fig 8 the replacement of k by nh4 in the lattice sites of muscovite 2m1 and the replacement of fe by mg in the lattice sites of chlorite would lead to the release of k and the absorption of mg2 rebalancing the cation exchange jacquat et al 2009 moreover the increase in al3 in the pore water fig 4b could be related to the continuous variation and sudden change in the positions of si o tetrahedrons in the muscovite 2m1 fig 5b lanson et al 2015 viennet et al 2016 the overall structural variations in the clay minerals could lead to changes in the cation exchange capacity thus becoming the extra source of ca2 and mg2 found in carbonate dissolution fig 3c tamura et al 2014 singla et al 2020 4 3 hypothesis regarding the origin of the variations in the mineral structures we suggest that the variations in the mineral structures are an adaptation of the clay minerals to the increase in the effective stress during clay compaction fitts and brown 1999 hupers and kopf 2012 the variations occur in low symmetry minerals such as muscovite and chlorite instead of high symmetry minerals such as quartz calcite and dolomite due to the different compressive strengths of their crystal structures comodi and zanazzi 1995 haines and cambon 2004 catalli and williams 2005 comodi et al 2008 the variations gradually accumulate and finally lead to the isomorphism of similar atoms fig 5 katti et al 2005 zhang et al 2019 the variations mainly occur in the silt particles which is probably due to the relatively high content of silt particles in the clay sediments and the concentration of the stress in the silt particles liu et al 2018 second the variations in the mineral structure seem to depend on the moisture content of the sediments rather than the loading stress which could be explained by the effective stress principle terzaghi 1943 at the beginning of compaction or consolidation in the field of engineering the loading of the stress leads to the production of excess pore water pressure which gradually decreases as the pore water is discharged subsequently the excess pore water stress decreasing is converted into effective stress increasing which causes deformation of the pores in the sediments biot and maurice 1941 when the moisture content of the sediments drops below the plastic limit which indicates the sediments are no longer plastic the ductile brittle transition occurs barnes 2013 the pore water and pores can no longer substitute for the sediment particles and carry the stress at which point sudden changes in the mineral structures of the sediment particles could occur under the increase in the effective stress fig 5 osullivan et al 1994 haigh et al 2014 wang and yin 2020 in muscovite 2m1 the process begins with the continuous variation in the relative z positions of the two si o tetrahedrons fig 5b and the spacing of the layers gradually changes fig 9 a then the β parameter suddenly increased for approximately 0 05 representing the variation in the overall structure fig 5a finally the k is partly replaced by nh4 in the lattice site resulting in corresponding variations in the chemistry of the pore water fig 5c and 8a in chlorite there is no specific starting point for the process and the continuously variation is the gradual decrease in the cell volume research data 6 due to the low symmetry of chlorite its structure can easily change which occurs for all of the parameters instead of single and specific parameters fig 9b wenk et al 2010 although there are three lattice sites for fe and mg the replacement of fe by mg mainly occurs in mgm3 which is a lattice site between the si o tetrahedron layers research data 6 the competing lattice sites are similar in muscovite 2m1 and chlorite which indicates that the lattice site between the si o tetrahedrons of the clay minerals is relatively unstable during compaction brown et al 2001 riebe et al 2005 hupers and kopf 2012 benedicto et al 2014 4 4 environmental effect of the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction through the above analysis we are trying to fill the gap in the understanding of the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction and proposed a conceptual model to explain the solute mobilization mechanism which is driven by a physical process fig 10 when the activities of the organic carbon and fe and or mn oxides are not strong enough to provide electrons for microbial mediated redox reactions lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 stuckey et al 2016 the structural variations in the clay minerals could become the major solute mobilization mechanism the structural variations in the clay minerals during clay compaction explain the solute mobilization without the need for the participation of redox and microorganism reactions in previous studies these abiotic and non chemical processes in sediments were usually considered to involve the adsorption or desorption of the bound forms of different minerals based on the sequential extraction results bertolo et al 2011 deng et al 2011 mehta 2017 shen et al 2018 however to be rigorous each bound form in the sequential extraction does not accurately correspond to a single and certain mineral and it does not even accurately correspond to a group of minerals nirel and morel 1990 tessier and campbell 1991 apparently the reactions between these extractants including acids alkalis and oxidants and the sediments cannot be completely selective which makes the concept and application of the sequential extraction obscure nirel and morel 1990 tessier and campbell 1991 the content variations of each bound form in the sequential extraction of the sediments can neither explain what occurs between the pore water and sediments nor point out where the reactant reacts and when the reaction begins which leads to great difficulty in estimating the environmental risk in contrast our study provides a clear answer to the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction including which types of minerals change where the reaction sites are what happens to the mineral structures when the continuous and sudden variations occur and the consequences of the clay compaction the results suggest a worrying fact i e that the variations in the mineral structures during clay compaction are dominated by the moisture content instead of stress which indicates that this process could probably occur in shallow aquitards under overexploitation of groundwater regardless of the formation pressure furthermore the instability of the interlayers between the si o tetrahedrons may be observed in other clay minerals other than muscovite and chlorite which indicates that similar variations may occur in the mineral structures of argillaceous sediments in other regions fortunately the influence of the variations in the mineral structures during clay compaction is both positive and negative for example the isomorphism of nh4 and k in muscovite 2m1 seems to be good for the mineralization and fixation of ammonium compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 which may reduce the risk of ammonium being released into the aquifer during clay compaction jiao et al 2010 sun et al 2021 in contrast the isomorphism of mg and fe in chlorite would release iron into the aquifer that may cause health and ecological risks homoncik et al 2010 erickson et al 2019 brindha et al 2020 we suggest the exploitation of groundwater should be conducted with more caution since the variations in the mineral structures are difficult to identify compared to the process of traditional reductive dissolution postma et al 2007 mladenov et al 2010 guo et al 2014 it is advised that the variations in the moisture contents of argillaceous sediments be regularly monitored or simulated in order to evaluate the state of compaction under exploitation of groundwater 5 broad applications this study has established the dynamic and interactivity of clay compaction which helps improve our understanding of the fate of deep and closed aquifers and improves the accuracy of numerical simulations of groundwater dynamics and reactive solute transport based on continuous compaction simulation experiments we established the link between the structural variations in clay minerals and the subsequent response of the pore water during clay compaction through the easily measurable moisture content and plastic limit we discuss the dynamic characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction and the interactions between the clay aquitard and the deep and closed aquifer during clay compaction which can be used to estimate the safety and resources of deep aquifers 5 1 dynamic characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction in the past two decades since holocene and pleistocene sand aquifers were found to be strongly polluted by iron ammonium and arsenic johannesson and hendry 2000 jiao et al 2010 erban et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2018 xue et al 2019 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020c sun et al 2021 the exploitation of groundwater has gradually shifted to deeper aquifers sarah et al 2014 hao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 su et al 2020 which has caused accelerated infiltration of the solutes in the upper layers fendorf et al 2010 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 and the strong compaction of deep clay aquitards chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 xiao et al 2021 therefore open aquifers influenced by the sedimentary intervals and the recharge windows are seriously threatened erban et al 2013 hoang and baumle 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 tarki et al 2020 by the accelerated infiltration and migration of the contaminants the upper layers driven by the increase in the hydraulic gradient mozumder et al 2020 however another uncertainty is the fate of the deep and closed aquifers surrounded by clay aquitards under such strong compaction apparently the pore water and solutes released from the compaction of the clay aquitards will be an important recharge source and potential threat to the deep and closed aquifers jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 the strong relevance of the exploitation intensity the rate of land subsidence and the proportion of clay facies to the quaternary sediments chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 as well as the similar isotopic compositions of the pore water of the aquifer and the clay aquitard jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 have demonstrated this previous research has found that over half of the iodine in the deep aquifer in the north china plain originated from clay compaction xue et al 2019 the arsenic released into the deep aquifer in the mekong delta vietnam is believed to be related to groundwater exploitation land subsidence and clay compaction erban et al 2013 in addition similar findings have been reported for fluoride chloride and ammonium jiao et al 2010 borzi et al 2015 jia et al 2018 pierre et al 2021 sun et al 2021 however previous studies only explained the present situation of the deep aquifers and the origin of these contaminants but they did not clearly determine if the differences in the contaminant concentrations at different depths in the same region are controlled by the clay compaction erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 assuming the contaminants with different concentrations all originated from clay compaction and subsequent solute mobilization this may indicate that the geochemical characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction are dynamic and vary with increasing formation pressure and groundwater exploitation xiao et al 2021 although previous studies have warned that the overexploitation of groundwater could cause clay compaction and the subsequent release of contaminants erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 mozumder et al 2020 the fate of the deep and closed aquifers surrounded by clay aquitards facing the increased formation pressure and groundwater exploitation is still not clear enough specifically a basis or threshold should be proposed cuthbert et al 2019 previous studies have generally regarded the release of pore water during clay compaction as a simple and physical process and they have ascribed the significant differences in the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the pore water at different depths in the same region to the different origins and heterogeneity of the sediments fendorf et al 2010 xue et al 2019 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020c however a previous experimental study reported that the release of arsenic during clay compaction is dynamic and stepwise xiao et al 2021 which indicates that solute mobilization during clay compaction is not only associated with the initial composition of the pore water and the sediments but also with the gradual and dynamic water rock interactions hupers and kopf 2012 tachi and yotsuji 2014 pierre et al 2021 this gradual and dynamic process is not fully discussed by previous studies because the short term variations are not large and long term monitoring is time consuming wersin et al 2011 xiao et al 2021 however the strong demand for clean water has significantly sped up clay compaction and the subsequent solute mobilization which suggests that the dynamic variations can no longer be ignored chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 xiao et al 2021 the results of this study suggest that the structural variations in clay minerals is the key factor that dominates the solute mobilization which is controlled by the moisture content and the plastic limit through identifying the structures of the minerals in a clay aquitard under ongoing compaction the fate of the adjacent and closed aquifer under sedimentation and groundwater exploitation can be determined specifically adjacent and closed aquifers can be divided into three main categories temporarily safe emergency and permanently safe fig 11 the process of identifying the structures of clay minerals involves time consuming extraction and refinement comodi et al 2008 salemi et al 2010 while our study provides a quite convenient basis i e the moisture content with the plastic limit serving as a clear threshold for evaluating the compaction state of a clay aquitard through discussion of the relevant mechanism fig 10 when the moisture content is higher than the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of minor compaction and the pore water released is only simple physical discharge schaefer et al 2017 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020c and continuous mild carbonate dissolution occurs schaefer et al 2017 thus the adjacent and closed aquifer is temporarily safe as the formation pressure and the exploitation intensity of the groundwater continuously increase the moisture content moves closer to the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of moderate compaction and the solute mobilization is dominated by the variations in the structures of the clay minerals at this time isomorphic replacement occurs in the triclinic minerals with a low symmetry and relative movement of the si o tetrahedrons occurs in the monoclinic minerals with slightly higher symmetry according to the types of triclinic minerals solutes of different types and concentrations will be discharged for example isomorphic replacement in chlorite releases iron into the adjacent aquifer thus the adjacent clean aquifer is in an emergency state because the strong variations in the structures of the minerals will cause intensive solute mobilization during the clay compaction when the moisture content is significantly lower than the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of major compaction and the adjacent aquifer may have been recharged by the solutes released in the previous stage and thus it may be contaminated by pollutants such as arsenic and iodine erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 however the results of this study indicate that the structures of the triclinic minerals become stable in this stage while the isomorphic replacement that occurs in the monoclinic minerals such as the replacement of k by nh4 improves the quality of the groundwater this indicates that if the adjacent aquifer is clean at this time it may remain permanently safe and if the adjacent aquifer is contaminated at this time then it may not undergo contaminant input again during future clay compaction therefore the permanently safe aquifer could be a reliable groundwater resource while the contaminated aquifer has the potential for restoration briefly once the contaminated aquifer is restored through measures such as pumping and treatment mccarty et al 1998 lee et al 2001 tse et al 2001 thornton et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 the clay compaction due to later groundwater exploitation and sedimentation will not cause secondary contamination the blocking and secondary release of the contaminants in the fine porous medium is the major point regarding the restoration of contaminated aquifers goltz and oxley 1991 broholm et al 2005 russold et al 2006 capiro et al 2007 the screening of reversible aquifers based on the state of compaction of their clay aquitards could be significant to the protection of groundwater resources interestingly our results coincide with those of previous studies in terms of the burial depths of the aquifers contaminated as a result of clay compaction these aquifers contaminated as a result of clay compaction are not located below the 20 60 m redox dominated zone or in the deepest part of the quaternary strata erban et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in fact they are mostly located in the middle section of the quaternary strata which could be because the compaction of the clay aquitard has resulted in a moisture content close to the plastic limit this suggests that the proposed method of using the moisture content with the plastic limit as a threshold could be widely applicable 5 2 interactions between the physical and chemical processes during clay compaction second although clay compaction has attracted some attention in the fields of both hydrology and hydrogeochemistry due to the severe land subsidence and groundwater contamination in recent years due to groundwater exploitation biot and maurice 1941 terzaghi 1943 hendry and wassenaar 2004 fox 2007a fox 2007b fox and lee 2008 jiao et al 2010 guo et al 2014 pu and fox 2016 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 ye et al 2020 chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 pierre et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 the discussion of clay compaction in previous studies is actually mutually exclusive specifically the physical process of the clay compaction and the chemical process of the solute mobilization during clay compaction are uncoupled and are discussed separately in previous studies fox 2007a fox 2007b fox and lee 2008 pu and fox 2016 the hydrogeologists have focused on the physical process itself and the secondary disasters such as land subsidence caused by it including the settlement stress hydraulic conductivity and pore pressure ortega guerrero et al 1999 fox 2007a fox 2007b ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 but the subsequent geochemical influence on the aquifer has often been ignored in the research conducted on large strain consolidation the solid unit of the clay aquitard has generally been assumed to be non reactive and has been considered to be uninvolved in the geochemical process of the clay compaction biot and maurice 1941 terzaghi 1943 ortega guerrero et al 1999 fox 2007a fox 2007b ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 or only the liquid unit was assumed to participate in the solute mobilization while the solid unit only controlled the adsorption or desorption fox and lee 2008 pu and fox 2016 in addition the simulations of the solute transport under coupled large strain consolidation and solute transport were actually simulations of infiltration instead of simulations of consolidation or compaction fox and lee 2008 zhan et al 2009 wang and zhan 2013 pu and fox 2016 correspondingly the hydrogeochemists noticed that the solute mobilization during clay compaction contaminated the adjacent aquifers but the focus of these studies was on the types concentrations ranges and boundaries of the contaminates fendorf et al 2010 erban et al 2013 wang et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 ye et al 2020 the clay aquitard has generally been regarded as a non point source for solutes which continuously release doc ammonium and other substances with a constant concentration at a constant rate during the geochemical processes this point of view ignores the dynamic changes in the pore water chemistry and the mixing effect of the settlement and the pore water discharge during the clay compaction on the aquifer mozumder et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 apparently there are some association barriers between the dynamic variations observed in groundwater numerical simulation and the constant concentration assumed for reactive solute transport which have particularly limited the coupled numerical simulation of aquifer aquitard systems unfortunately this is also widely true for other coupled physical and chemical processes warscheid and braams 2000 aufdenkampe et al 2011 dentz et al 2011 ringwelski and gabbert 2010 jia et al 2017 the crux of the matter is to establish the link between the physical process and the chemical process however the physical parameters in consolidation or compaction models such as the stress flow pore pressure and displacement seem to be entirely independent from the chemical parameters in solute transport models including the type concentration and duration of the solutes which results in a barrier in the coupled process in this study we focused on the clay minerals that both bear the stress and release the solutes during clay compaction thereby establishing the link between the physical process and the chemical process as was discussed in section 3 the variations in the structures of the clay minerals under physical stress and the response of the geochemical characteristics of the pore water to the structural variations are related the variations in the structures of the clay minerals rely on the decrease in the moisture content and the increase in the effective stress which are caused by the physical discharge while the variations in the structures of the clay minerals lead to relative movement of the si o tetrahedrons and isomorphic replacement of the interlayer atoms thereby dominating the solute mobilization that is the physical process and chemical process during clay compaction are related through the structures of the clay minerals fig 12 the solute mobilization mechanism identified in this study establishes a reliable link between groundwater numerical simulations and reactive solute transport specifically in aquifer aquitard systems which has never been considered in previous studies briefly the liquid limit and moisture content calculated in the groundwater numerical simulations can be used to determine the types and concentrations of the solutes released from the clay aquitard which acts as a dynamic non point source of solutes in the reactive solute transport process through this mechanism and mineral analysis by taking the clay aquitard which is a significant component of the quaternary strata into consideration future coupled numerical models can effectively improve the accuracy of reactive solute transport models and help to better predict the risk to deep aquifers under the influence of clay compaction 6 conclusions variations in the mineral structures do occur at low temperatures 305 k and under low stress 8 60 mpa conditions during clay compaction and they mainly occur in clay minerals with low symmetry compared to the clay particles the variations in the mineral structures are more obvious in the silt particles due to the possible concentration of the stress in these particles the variations in the mineral structures are controlled by the moisture content liquid plastic limit and effective stress rather than by microbial mediated redox reactions the sudden changes in the occupancies of atoms occur when the moisture content drops below the liquid plastic limit which corresponds to the ductile brittle transition in addition there are also several continuous variations in the relative positions of the si o tetrahedrons in the clay minerals during clay compaction which may cause cation exchange the variations in the mineral structures include the relative displacements of the si o tetrahedrons isomorphism of the atoms between the si o tetrahedrons and overall variations in the crystal structures a b c and α β γ there is an obvious boundary between the continuous variations and the sudden changes in the clay minerals with relatively high symmetry such as muscovite 2m1 while the transition from continuous variations to sudden changes is more unclear in the clay minerals with relatively low symmetry such as chlorite due to the complex isomorphism of the lattice sites the variations in the mineral structures dominate the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction which is driven by physical processes through this mechanism argillaceous sediments can release fe into the aquifer and integrate nh4 into their minerals during clay compaction without the participation of redox and microorganism reactions similar variations may be found in other clay minerals depending on their symmetry and the atoms in the interlayers between the si o tetrahedrons this study provides knowledge for the assessment of the safety of deep groundwater resources in two aspects first the solute mobilization mechanism identified in this study provides an easy way to evaluate the status of the clay compaction and an easily available analysis parameter i e the moisture content with the plastic limit of the clay aquitard as the threshold based on borehole analysis it is easy to determine which compaction status and solute mobilization stage a clay aquitard is currently in and to evaluate the potential for groundwater exploitation second in this study it was determined that the physical and chemical processes during clay compaction are through the variations in the structures of the clay minerals which couple the compaction and consolidation of the aquitard and the reactive solute transport in the aquifer this new understanding will improve the accuracy of reactive solute transport models and help to better predict the risk to deep aquifers under the influence of clay compaction credit authorship contribution statement wenkai qiu conceptualization

3307,microbial mediated redox reactions typically control the solute mobilization in groundwater systems in which the clay aquitard is usually a triggering factor of the release of the dissolved organic carbon ammonium and iron into the aquifer during pore water discharge and clay compaction however solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction is generally mistaken for a similar water rock interaction process in aquifers controlled by microbial mediated redox reactions through a simulation experiment on argillaceous sediment compaction we tested the currently accepted solute mobilization mechanism and determined that the variation in the mineral structure dominates it the variation in the mineral structure occurs in low symmetry minerals such as clay minerals and is controlled by the sediment moisture content the liquid plastic limit and the effective stress when the sediment moisture content decreases to below the plastic limit through pore water discharge and compaction sudden changes in the mineral structure occur releasing iron and capturing ammonium through variations in the relative position of the si o tetrahedrons and isomorphism of similar atoms without the participation of microbial mediated redox reactions these results suggest that the biochemical reactivities of organic carbon iron and ammonium are sometimes overestimated i e when the role of the physical processes is ignored in solute mobilization during clay compaction which warrants more attention and investigation keywords mineral structure solute mobilization clay compaction isomorphism ammonium iron 1 introduction the clay aquitard is typically considered to be an inactive or low activity component of groundwater systems hendry et al 2003 hendry and wassenaar 2005 pi et al 2015 shaw and hendry 1998 xie et al 2014 but it has been proven to cause several profound variations in aquifers including abnormal increases in arsenic ammonium halogen elements and rare earth elements johannesson and hendry 2000 fendorf et al 2010 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 pierre et al 2021 after several decades of research the reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides and microorganism activity have become widely accepted as the arsenic and ammonium releasing mechanisms in shallow aquifers mukherjee et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and the dissolved organic matter and other solutes released from the clay aquitard have become accepted as the triggering factors in this process erban et al 2013 wang et al 2013 ayers et al 2016 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 other processes such as the mobilization of rare earth elements in aquitard and aquifer systems have been found to be controlled by the carbonate concentration and absorption on clay minerals johannesson and hendry 2000 moreover the dehydration of smectite and the ion filtration of clay sediments lead to variations in the chloride isotopes and pore water freshening brown et al 2001 agrinier et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 however the solute mobilization mechanisms of the clay aquitard itself have received little attention compared to the subsequent influences of the released solutes especially the compaction effect furthermore due to the occurrence of arsenic ammonium and organic pollutants in contaminated shallow groundwater coupled with and a general lack of available unpolluted surface water sources the strong demand for safe deep groundwater has resulted in increasingly intensive clay compaction in the deep strata chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 previous studies have emphasized the outside risk to deep groundwater including infiltration and transport of contaminated shallow groundwater and reductive dissolution caused by the input of organic carbon from the clay aquitard erban et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 in contrast the compaction effect of the clay aquitard could be a potential internal threat such as the addition of iodine to groundwater resources which has attracted little attention xue et al 2019 in addition the solute mobilization mechanisms of this process are still unclear which could lead to misunderstanding of the factors controlling the quality of deep closed groundwater systems a previous study on solute mobilization during clay compaction accepted the viewpoints of the research on riverside aquifer systems and lakes and wetlands with seasonal water level variations xiao et al 2021 in which reductive dissolution microorganism activity and adsorption desorption were considered postma et al 2007 mladenov et al 2010 guo et al 2014 in addition the reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides has been observed in aquifers with abnormally high arsenic concentrations which also seems to support this point of view kocar and fendorf 2009 hartland et al 2015 richards et al 2017 schaefer et al 2017 smith et al 2017 malakar et al 2021 however the evidence of redox domination seems to be insufficient in deep confined aquifers that suffer from clay compaction and the sources of organic carbon and the sedimentary depth where reductive dissolution occurs has been debated mcarthur et al 2008 sengupta et al 2008 neumann et al 2010 thermodynamically the activity of organic carbon and fe oxides is quite low in deep clays and the reductive dissolution of iron oxides has been observed only when either more reactive exogenous forms of iron oxides or organic carbon are added mcmahon 2001 stuckey et al 2016 however based on isotopic data it has been determined that the element enrichment in an aquifer and the compaction of the clay aquitard in the deep stratum are related hendry et al 2000 mahara and kitaoaka 2009 mozumder et al 2020 but the solute mobilization mechanism is difficult to understand due to the complex sedimentary history jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 moreover the vertical variations in borehole sediments and pore water chemistry are sometimes ascribed to clay compaction during sedimentation ayers et al 2016 driese 2004 which ignores the different origins of the sediments at different depths banfield et al 1991 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b having carefully considered the circumstances of clay aquitards and the compaction effect we suggest that the following three prevalent hypotheses have led to misunderstandings concerning the solute mobilization mechanisms during clay compaction first the redox conditions of clay aquitards are stable and they rarely receive recharge with little extra dissolved oxygen and organic carbon from the aquifers due to their low permeability marty et al 2003 moreover the iron oxides and organic carbon in the deep clay are relatively inactive thermodynamically mcmahon 2001 stuckey et al 2016 so there is neither exogenous electron input nor sufficient endogenous electron release ruling out the occurrence of microbial mediated redox reactions under such stable closed and inactive circumstances fig 1 a lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 xiao et al 2021 second microbial mediated redox reactions and adsorption desorption do occur in riverside aquifer systems and lake and wetland sediments where redox reactions dominate the solute mobilization instead of clay compaction schaefer et al 2017 the seasonal water level variations saturated condition of the sediments temperature and oxygen content in the vadose zone are the decisive factors and the compaction of clay sediments is negligible beck et al 2008 the arsenic release caused by reductive dissolution has been observed in deep confined aquifers because the compaction of the clay aquitard releases reductants and carbon resources into the adjacent aquifers mihajlov et al 2020 moreover the sedimentary window may compromise the hydraulic integrity of clay aquitards leading to preferential flow during solute mobilization timms et al 2018 mozumder et al 2020 however this reductive dissolution occurs in the aquifers rather than the clay aquitard fig 1b third the variations in the concentrations of various solutes in sediments with borehole depth do not represent the compaction effect of sediments in the sedimentary history which is always ignored jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the origins of sediments at different depths are variable briefly borehole sediments at different depths do not represent different periods or compaction stages of a consistent sedimentary history on the contrary these sediments are the products of different origins in different periods or compaction stages which indicates that the variation patterns found in borehole sediments may have nothing to do with the compaction process of the clay aquitard fig 1c in conclusion the electron source of reductive dissolution and microorganism activity the reaction location and the theory of compaction are unclear and confusing these three possible scenarios fig 1 shake the foundation of previously proposed solute mobilization mechanisms during clay compaction which requires further investigation furthermore the eh ph diagrams of pore water in previous studies have shown that ferrihydrite is a stable form of fe indicating that the aqueous fe detected in the clay aquitard s pore water is unstable and the groundwater is supersaturated in ferrihydrite hodgkinson et al 2008 xiao et al 2021 similar results have been found for arsenic yan et al 2000 and other variable valence elements which indicates that the release of these solute is not a spontaneous reaction and is restricted by thermodynamics based on the gibbs free energy stuckey et al 2016 since microbial mediated redox reactions have been ruled out due to the occurrence of inappropriate reaction conditions reactivity and circumstances we suggest that the gradually increasing pressure could be a possibly key factor during the compaction of the clay aquitard the dissolution and water rock interactions in the clay aquitard may be influenced by the compaction pressure brown et al 2001 hupers and kopf 2012 agrinier et al 2019 priebe et al 2019 pierre et al 2021 in rock mechanism research pressure solution has been widely observed in sedimentary rocks that is calcite dolomite and quartz will dissolve in the high stress zone and reform in the low stress zone pucci 1998 williams et al 2001 maher et al 2006 the preferred orientation of illite has been observed in high pressure zones such as fault gouge and metamorphic rocks wenk et al 2010 moreover the isomorphism of nh4 and k in illite has been observed in deep strata and is significant in the formation of coal oil and gas compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 in addition the high pressure behaviors of mineral crystals have been thoroughly investigated in previous simulation experiments and the results indicate that the cell parameters and phases of the minerals vary regularly with pressure haines and cambon 2004 zanazzi et al 2007 comodi et al 2008 however nearly all previous borehole and experimental research focused on the tectonic zone and diagenetic stage in which strong stress leads to significant variations in the mineral structures zheng 2012 richards 2015 abd elmola et al 2020 yin et al 2020 on the contrary the stress in clay aquitard compaction is quite low usually such a low stress is unable to cause significant statistical variations in the mineral structures according to previous research comodi and zanazzi 1995 guidotti et al 2000 studies of the compaction of argillaceous sediments early diagenesis mud and mudstones all denied that there is a variation in the mineral structures during the clay aquitard compaction stage chilingarian et al 1995 potter et al 2005 schulz 2006 consequently a widely accepted viewpoint is that the hydrogeochemistry and microorganisms dominate the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards and variations in the mineral structures occur during early diagenesis middle diagenesis late diagenesis and epidiagenesis potter et al 2005 schulz 2006 du et al 2018 interestingly several fluid studies have reported variations in the pore water geochemistry caused by smectite dehydration under relatively low experimental effective stress conditions coltenbradley 1987 hupers and kopf 2012 which are generally supposed to occur in high stress zones such as convergent margins brown et al 2001 henry and bourlange 2004 agrinier et al 2019 in this study we challenge the three prevalent hypotheses regarding the solute mobilization mechanism during the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards fig 1 first the often ignored physical process involved in solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction could be the solution to the contradiction in the electron source since the physical process requires neither exogenous electron input nor sufficient endogenous electron release x ray diffraction analysis of borehole sediments was carried out to determine the contribution of the physical process and the silt and clay particles in the borehole sediments were extracted and analyzed since the inactive components such as sand particles may obscure the variations in the mineral structure second to reproduce the compaction of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards we developed a device for simulating the compaction in order to reproduce the conditions argillaceous sediments are subjected to during compaction the experimental samples were collected from natural argillaceous sediments and the mechanical stress was used as a substitute for the formation pressure in the argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments the hydrochemistry of the discharged pore water and the components of the released gases were continuously monitored to determine the dominant process finally the experimental samples were continuously collected without stress unloading during the simulation experiments to reproduce the continuous and consistent compaction history of argillaceous sediments in clay aquitards the silt and clay particles in the experimental samples were extracted and subjected to x ray diffraction xrd analysis and rietveld refinements to determine the solute mobilization mechanism inside the aquitard governed by the physical process 2 samples and methods 2 1 collection of borehole samples we collected 114 borehole sediments from different depths in 10 boreholes in the jianghan plain china where the groundwater has been reported to be contaminated by arsenic ammonium and nitrate chen et al 2017 du et al 2017 xie et al 2018 yu et al 2018 du et al 2020 liu et al 2020c sun et al 2021 the compaction of the clay aquitard may be an ignored source of these pollutants which leads to contaminant release so we investigated the clay sediments at different depths another consideration that was taken into account is the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the jianghan plain the large thickness of the sediments indicates that the variation in the compaction degree of the clay sediments is continuous and slowly changes with depth from the flow state to the consolidation state which makes it easy to observe if there is a variation in the mineral structure the details of boreholes and borehole sediments are presented in tables 1 and 2 in the supplementary materials the borehole sediments were freeze dried and ground to 75 μm and then sent for xrd analysis 2 2 argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments based on the preliminary xrd data for the borehole sediments we selected fresh argillaceous sediment from chen lake in the jianghan plain china as the initial samples for the simulation experiments compared to the borehole sediments in the rest of the boreholes the borehole sediments in chen lake exhibited the largest variations in the ratio of the mineral peak intensities and had a relatively high clay mineral content research data 4 in addition in the permanently saturated sediments the redox conditions and the microbial community in the lacustrine sediments were relatively stable compared to those of the fluvial sediments from the other boreholes and they were more consistent with the conditions of the deep clay sediments the characteristics of the initial samples are presented in table 3 in the supplementary materials the simulation experiments were carried out using a device developed in this study to simulate compaction the details of the device are presented in section 2 and fig 1 in the supplementary materials briefly the device consists of a servo motor for stress loading a sealed sample cell several sampling outlets for solid and liquid samples a gas liquid separator an automatic sample collector and a workstation for stress and temperature control and data collection when the simulation experiment started the servo motor applied the stress according to the initialization program the workstation recorded the displacement temperature and stress data at the selected interval a solid sample was collected from the sampling outlets every 24 h and its moisture content was measured these samples were later subjected to xrd analysis simultaneously liquid samples were collected by an automatic sample collector and were divided into several portions for on site electrode analysis and spectrophotometry analysis as well as for later cation analysis anion analysis and dissolved organic carbon analysis subsequently the quantity of the gas released was determined if the volume of gas exceeded 20 ml then a 10 ml gas sample was collected and analyzed this experimental procedure was repeated every day until the set end time of the experiment using this procedure we carried out two argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiments and the experimental conditions were as follows in the first experiment the stress load was increased from 0 00 mpa to 6 00 mpa at a rate of 0 02 mpa h and the temperature was maintained at 293 k forty three liquid samples 12 solid samples and 3 gas samples were collected during the experiment in the second experiment the stress load was increased from 0 00 mpa to 8 60 mpa at a rate of 0 02 mpa h and the temperature was maintained at 305 k sixty five liquid samples 18 solid samples and 3 gas samples were collected during the experiment the purpose of the higher temperature in the second experiment was to observe the variations in the activity of the microbial mediated redox reactions compared to the first experiment since there is no effective sterilization method for argillaceous sediments that does not damage the sample high pressure steam and irradiation sterilization significantly heat up the sediments and lead to hydrochemical changes in the pore water in addition the low permeability of argillaceous sediments rules out the use of an antibacterial agent generally the antibacterial agent cannot sufficiently infiltrate into the sediments to an effective concentration level thus the second experiment with a higher temperature was conducted in place of a sterilized group in order to determine the contribution of the microbial mediated redox reactions the stress load program was set according to the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the jianghan plain and the equation for calculating the formation pressure xiao et al 2021 which approximately corresponds to the formation pressure for 200 to 300 m sediments the rate of stress loading was set according to both the demands of the analysis and the monitoring frequency a high rate will lower the monitoring frequency while a low rate is unable to produce enough samples the purpose of extending the stress loading range and experiment time in the second experiment was to observe the subsequent variations from the first experiment in which the variations in some of the solutes did not reach equilibrium another purpose of carrying out the second experiment was to determine whether the argillaceous sediment compaction simulation experiment was repeatable 2 3 extraction of silt and clay particles we believe that the variations in the mineral structure during argillaceous sediment compaction are obscured because the minerals cannot recrystallize and separate from each other under the low stress of compaction unlike relatively pure minerals collected from high stress areas such as diagenesis and tectonic zones like faults and convergent margins argillaceous sediments in the compaction stage of a clay aquitard are a mixture of various minerals some of the inactive components have stable mineral structures under low stress for example quartz and calcite which may obscure the structural variations in the unstable minerals that belong to the monoclinic and triclinic systems the purpose of extracting the silt and clay particles was to reduce the influence of the sand component which is mostly composed of quartz and to increase the relative contents of the clay minerals in order to allow the variations in the clay minerals to be large enough to detect on the xrd patterns to achieve this goal we used stokes law in the extraction of the silt and clay particles without using any dispersant except ultra pure water fig 3 in the supplementary materials in order to avoid uncontrollable chemical damage to the mineral structure salemi et al 2010 in detail approximately 2 g of solid sample and 40 ml of ultra pure water were added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then dispersed with ultrasonic assistance the dispersion of the sample was checked every 30 min and the temperature of the ultrasonic device was controlled at 298 k if the temperature of the ultrasonic device exceeded 298 k the medium was replaced with cold medium every 2 h the centrifuge tube was taken out of the ultrasonic device and shaken for 5 min this entire procedure was repeated 4 to 6 times until there were not visible large particles because no other chemical dispersant was used in the procedure the dispersion of the samples with a low moisture content was more difficult and required more repetition of these steps subsequently the sufficiently dispersed sample was transferred into a 1 l beaker for sedimentation separation according to stokes law the sedimentation times were calculated to be 4 min and 39 s and 7 h and 45 min for the silt 2 to 20 μm and clay 2 μm particles respectively in the preliminary extraction the sand particles were removed from the mixture after sedimentation separation of 4 min and 39 s the upper 10 cm of the suspension were syphoned into a new 1 l beaker for later separation during which the silt particles sank and the clay particles floated after sedimentation separation for 7 h and 45 min after each sedimentation separation stage the upper 10 cm of the suspension were syphoned into a new 1 l beaker for later separation and the preliminary beaker was replenished with ultra pure water for repeated sedimentation separation until the upper 10 cm were clear generally the procedure needed to be repeated more than three times but the exact number of repetitions depended on the silt and clay contents of the samples then the suspensions of silt and clay were centrifuged at 7000 rpm to remove the redundant solvent and the sediments were freeze dried slightly ground and sent for xrd analysis 2 4 method of rietveld refinement the extracted silt and clay particles were still composed of several types of minerals and the peak intensities and positions in the xrd patterns may represent the complex variations in the minerals and thus rietveld refinement of the xrd patterns was necessary to enable investigation of the mineral structures the rietveld refinement was performed using fullprof edpcr rodriguezcarvajal 1993 the borehole sediments without the extraction of silt and clay particles were not refined due to the poor resolution and low intensities of their xrd patterns nevertheless their peak positions intensities and mineral species were extracted from the xrd patterns for later analysis the silt and clay particles extracted from the solid samples collected during the two simulation experiments were refined using the rietveld method considering the source of the initial sample we selected sediments from g1 borehole in chen lake as the control group and the extracted silt and clay particles were refined using the same method a brief description of the rietveld method is provided below and additional details of the rietveld method are presented in section 4 of the supplementary material six types of minerals were identified in all of the xrd patterns and the initial structures of the minerals were obtained from the crystallography open database cod downs and hall wallace 2003 grazulis et al 2009 grazulis et al 2012 grazulis et al 2015 merkys et al 2016 quiros et al 2018 vaitkus et al 2021 table 1 we simplified the compositions of the minerals which included removing the isomorphic atoms with extremely low occupancies and replacing the chemical formula with the empirical formula and adjusting the temperature factors of all of the atoms to a default of 0 5 based on the simplified mineral structure and sensitivity analysis we identified the major factors that led to the variations in the xrd patterns the sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing each parameter with a 1 variation and calculating the subsequent variations in the peak intensities of the xrd patterns the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in section 5 of the supplementary material the diagram showing the differences in the observations and calculations as well as the prf file are presented in fig 4 7 in the supplementary material and research data 8 2 5 standards and methods of analysis the cation and anion standard solutions were

2 the standard recovery of the dissolved organic carbon using the toc analyzer ranged from 100 58 to 110 34 the detection limits of the dissolved organic carbon gases cations and anions were 0 1 mg l 1 ppm and 0 01 0 01 mg l respectively the correlation coefficients of all of the standard curves are greater than 0 999 except for the correlation coefficients of the oxygen and nitrogen standard curves obtained via gc analysis which were 0 997 because the large standard range exceeded the linear intervals the relative standard deviation of the parameters in the rietveld refinement is below 10 and the λ2 of the rietveld refinements ranges from 1 34 to 6 81 in which the λ2 value of the borehole sediment sample is the highest because it contains the maximum number of mineral types the device developed to simulate compaction could also be a source of analytical error therefore several types of blank experiments were carried out to ensure that the device developed to simulate compaction did not absorb or release the solutes during the experiments research data 1 the results of the blank experiments confirmed that the device did not absorb or release the solutes under the highest temperature 305 k and highest stress 8 6 mpa conditions used in the simulation experiments in addition the loss of sample during the separation and delivery processes was taken into consideration the loss in the gas liquid separator ranged from 6 12 to 9 36 and the loss during delivery by the automatic sample collector ranged from 0 48 to 0 79 according to the analysis of the cations 3 results 3 1 mineral characteristic of borehole sediments four types of minerals were identified in the xrd patterns of the studied borehole sediments chlorite muscovite 2m1 albite and quartz we collected the peak intensity of the specific bragg positions for 114 raw borehole sediments and 18 extracted borehole sediments which correspond to the 001 and 002 peaks of chlorite 002 004 111 and 131 peaks of muscovite 2m1 1 1 1 and 200 peaks of albite and 100 and 101 peaks of quartz fig 2 a regular variations in the peak intensity ratio have not been found in raw borehole sediments the ratios of 002 to 004 002 to 111 and 002 to 131 in the muscovite 2m1 seem to decrease with depth in the boreholes but some boreholes exhibit complex and contradictory variations the same situation was observed for the chlorite and albite in the raw borehole sediments while the results for the extracted borehole sediments were much different for the extracted silt and clay particles the ratio of 001 to 002 for chlorite regularly decreases with depth in the boreholes and specifically the average decreases are from 1 33 to 0 38 and from 2 46 to 0 45 respectively fig 2b the variation in the peak intensity ratio with borehole depth before and after extraction indicates that the mineral structure probably changed during compaction but was obscured due to the complex character of particles in the raw sediments previous research usually ascribed the differences in the xrd patterns of the standards and samples to the preferred orientation of the crystals ho et al 1999 wenk et al 2010 but there are actually more complex factors that could lead to the variations in the peak intensity ratios of the minerals which will be discussed in detail later 3 2 pore water chemistry during argillaceous sediment compaction in the simulation experiments a total of 108 liquid samples and 6 gas samples were collected using an automatic sample and gas liquid separator collector in two simulation experiments the pore water was found to be ca hco3 type water it was slightly anoxic and alkaline and contained a certain amount of carbon dioxide and methane fig 3 shows the major variations in the pore water chemistry with increasing stress load in two simulation experiments the complete results are presented in the research data 5 3 2 1 redox conditions fig 3a presents the continuous monitoring data for the stress and the temperature and volume of the pore water released due to the heat loss through conduction the average temperature in the second experiment was approximately 300 k which was slightly lower than the set temperature of 305 k the temperature in the first experiment fluctuated between 293 k and 298 k which was slightly higher than the set temperature of 293 k due to the influence of the temperature of the room fig 3b indicates that ferrihydrite was the stable form of fe in the second experiment while part of the data for the first experiment is located in the ferrous iron region the eh and ph of the first experiment varied from 91 70 mv to 273 90 mv and from 7 025 to 8 031 respectively decreasing with increasing stress which seems to confirm the variation in the pore water conditions from oxidizing to reducing however when the temperature rose to 300 k in the second experiment the eh and ph fluctuated from 66 50 mv to 312 1 mv and from 7 333 to 7 964 respectively without an obvious trend furthermore the nitrate nitrite ammonium and sulfate did not respond to the variations in the eh and ph in either experiment denitrification and sulfate reduction processes rarely occurred in either experiment based on the stable concentrations of nitrate and sulfate yu et al 2018 the average concentrations of nitrate in experiments 1 and 2 were 5 15 1 98 mg l and 3 75 0 57 mg l and the average concentrations of sulfate were 5 32 1 23 mg l and 3 57 0 85 mg l respectively the concentrations of ammonium decreased from 6 45 mg l to 4 86 mg l and from 1 24 mg l to 0 71 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively which seems to contradict the variation in the pore water conditions from oxidizing to reducing du et al 2020 briefly there is a contradiction between the eh ph diagram and all of the redox sensitive ions except for ferrous iron and the correlation between ferrous iron and eh is weak r2 0 213 3 2 2 carbonate dissolution the pore water was ca hco3 type water in the two experiments fig 3c shows the milligram equivalent ratios of mg2 ca2 to hco3 the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were higher in the second experiment 6 to 10 meq l than in the first experiment 5 to 8 meq l which corresponds to the higher concentration of co2 fig 3f the part of the data shown in fig 3c plots near the 1 1 line which indicates ongoing carbonate dissolution in addition some of the data in fig 3c plot close to a horizontal line which indicates other sources of ca2 and mg2 in addition to carbonate dissolution huang et al 2017 carbonate dissolution is associated with carbon dioxide and the reactions that specifically produce co2 are as follows 1 c h 2 o o 2 h 2 o c o 2 2 2 c h 2 o c h 4 c o 2 then the carbon dioxide reacts with carbonate generally calcite and dolomite as follows 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a c o 3 c a 2 2 h c o 3 4 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o c a m g c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 4 h c o 3 the carbonate dissolution results in higher concentrations of mg2 ca2 and hco3 and there are other sources of extra hco3 such as reduction of ferrihydrite and sulfate postma et al 2007 the reactions are as follows 5 c h 2 o 4 f e oh 3 7 h 4 f e 2 h c o 3 10 h 2 o 6 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 h 2 s 2 h c o 3 fig 3c indicates that there are extra sources of ca2 and mg2 instead of hco3 meaning that additional so4 2 and no3 are required to compensate for this cation excess huang et al 2017 however the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate were stable during both experiments which indicates an apparent contradiction between the eh ph diagram carbonate dissolution and reductive dissolution there should be another unusual source of extra mg2 and ca2 3 2 3 cation exchange the chloride alkali indices cais are generally used to evaluate the strength of the cation exchange schoeller 1965 and cai 1 and cai 2 are calculated as follows 7 cai 1 γ c l γ n a γ k γ c l 8 cai 2 γ c l γ n a γ k γ s o 4 2 γ h c o 3 where γ m n is the milligram equivalent of m n cai 1 ranged from 0 35 to 0 23 and from 0 74 to 0 42 in the first and second experiments respectively and the corresponding cai 2 values ranged from 0 03 to 0 02 and from 0 08 to 0 07 fig 3d shows the variations in the chloride and the alkali metals in the released pore water the average concentrations of k were 5 88 0 35 mg l and 6 58 0 30 mg l and those of cl were 24 68 0 72 mg l and 24 04 1 24 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively the differences in the concentrations of k and cl between the first and second experiments were not statistically significant however there were obvious na peaks in both experiments but the corresponding stresses of the peaks were different interestingly the occurrence of the na peaks in fig 3d and the horizontal trends in ca2 and mg2 in fig 3c were synchronous in the two experiments which indicates that the increases in na ca2 and mg2 were not the result of cation exchange between these ions capuano and jones 2020 the relatively low cai 1 and cai 2 values indicate weak cation exchange in both experiments which contradicts the variations in fig 3c and d some researchers ascribe the increase in the cations to the dissolution of silicate by carbon dioxide li et al 2016 but the variation in hco3 does not support this hypothesis 3 2 4 iron ferrous iron lactate and dissolved organic carbon fig 3e shows the concentrations of several forms of iron and organic carbon generally the release of iron is associated with the dissolved organic carbon via microbial mediated redox reactions especially those of iron reducing bacteria suda and makino 2016 wang et al 2017 the average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were relatively high in experiments 1 and 2 13 7 2 9 mg l and 20 7 5 4 mg l respectively while the correlation coefficients of the iron and dissolved organic carbon were extremely low 0 1162 and 0 1733 respectively the shape and intensity of the iron peak were approximately the same in the first and second experiments fig 3e the variation in iron in the second experiment was an extension of that in the first experiment which suggests that the rising temperature and higher dissolved organic carbon content do not affect the release of iron in addition the maximum concentrations of iron were 10 25 mg l and 11 61 mg l in the first and second experiments respectively which contradicts the results of the slightly anoxic conditions and the relatively stable dissolved organic carbon content ferrous iron and lactate were not detected in the second experiment due to the relatively high eh 66 5 mv to 312 1 mv fig 3b while ferrous iron and lactate were synchronously detected in the first experiment but their concentrations were not related to each other the maximum concentrations of ferrous iron and lactate in the first experiment were 5 87 mg l and 2 74 mg l respectively the peak lactate concentration lagged behind the peak ferrous iron concentration which indicates that there was a reaction order between the iron and dissolved organic carbon the variations and forms of the released iron and dissolved organic carbon suggest that reductive dissolution was not the only iron release mechanism 3 2 5 released gases fig 3f shows the concentrations of oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide and methane gases released in the first and second experiments apparently all of these gases responded to the rising temperature and increasing dissolved organic carbon content which is demonstrated by the decrease in oxygen and increases in carbon dioxide and methane in the second experiment compared to the first the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane ranged from 674 53 ppm to 778 80 ppm and 1735 52 ppm to 4331 16 ppm in the first experiment and from 4143 31 ppm to 18536 81 ppm and 22610 92 ppm to 37702 73 ppm in the second experiment respectively in terms of the released gases the temperature and dissolved organic matter do have positive influences on the microorganism activity and reduction however the influences of microorganism activity and reduction seemed to gradually decrease rather than increase with increasing stress and progress of the experiment especially in the second experiment the concentration of the oxygen increased with decreasing carbon dioxide content i e from 20 77 to 22 21 in the first experiment and from 11 71 to 17 77 in the second experiment the release of oxygen from the sediments should have resulted in more reducing conditions in the sediments due to the decrease in the amount of oxidants while the variations in eh fig 3b and the released carbon dioxide and methane fig 3f indicate the slow cessation of microorganism activity and reducing reactions wersin et al 2011 3 3 sediment characteristics during argillaceous sediment compaction in the simulation experiments thirty sediment samples were collected without stress unloading in the two experiments and extraction of silt and clay particles were carried out to investigate the variations in the mineral structures in addition the total organic carbon contents of the sediment samples were determined to identify the source of the dissolved organic carbon in the released pore water fig 4 shows the moisture contents and total organic carbon contents of the sediment samples as well as some unusual variations around the liquid plastic limit 3 3 1 moisture content liquid plastic limit and total organic carbon fig 4a shows the moisture contents of each sediment sample from the two experiments the moisture contents of the sediments decrease with increasing stress due to the release of the pore water the moisture contents of the sediment ranged from 37 44 to 146 80 and from 24 29 to 121 54 in the first and second experiments respectively the liquid and plastic limits of the initial sediments were determined to be 77 34 and 40 23 in the two experiments the stresses of the liquid limit and plastic limit were 2 72 mpa and 3 64 mpa respectively in the first experiment and 1 86 mpa and 5 70 mpa in the second experiment compared to the second experiment the rate of pore water release was lower in the first experiment fig 3a while the slope of the moisture content of the sediments was higher fig 4a the difference between the bottom sediments and the entirety of the samples indicates that the compaction was more uneven in the first experiment the average total organic carbon contents of the sediments in the first experiment was 3 142 0 174 fig 4a shows that the degradation of organic carbon in the sediments was mild which is consistent with the relatively stable variations in the dissolved organic carbon content of the released pore water fig 3e the corresponding stresses of the liquid and plastic limit seem to be critical factors controlling some of the variations in the pore water chemistry fig 4b significant decreases in the nh4 concentration were observed near 3 64 mpa and 5 70 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively which correspond to the plastic limit of the sediments fig 4a simultaneously the synchronous increases in na and al3 at around 2 72 mpa and 1 86 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively interestingly correspond to the liquid limit of the sediments fig 4a the associations between the released pore water chemistry and the characteristics of sediments are obvious which indicates investigation of the released pore water chemistry should not be separated from that of the variations in the sediment characteristics during compaction of clay sediments 3 3 2 rietveld refinement of the extracted silt and clay particles fig 5 shows the major variations in the refined parameters and the results of the rietveld refinement of the silt and clay particles extracted during the two experiments the complete results are presented in research data 6 and the representative rietveld refinements of the extracted silt and clay are presented in fig 6 the variations in the mineral structures seem to be related to the plastic limit fig 5 which is the same as for the pore water chemistry fig 4b significant differences in the 002 and 004 peaks of muscovite 2m1 and the 001 and 002 peaks of chlorite were observed before and after the plastic limit fig 6a based on the rietveld refinements we ascribed the variations in the xrd patterns to the structural changes of the muscovite 2m1 and chlorite including the cell parameters and the occupancy of the atoms fig 5a and c the structural changes in the muscovite 2m1 in the silt were not completely the same in the first and second experiments specifically the cell parameters volume and a increased with increasing stress in the first experiment while cell parameters b and β decreased and increased respectively with increasing stress in the second experiment research data 6 the occupancy of nh4 tended to increase with increasing stress in the two experiments but the sudden change increase from approximately 0 15 to 0 35 was more obvious in the second experiment fig 5c the structural changes in the chlorite in the silt were approximately the same in the first and second experiments the cell parameters volume a c α and γ and the occupancy of fe decreased with increasing stress fig 5a and c in particular the variation in the occupancy of fe in the chlorite in the first experiment corresponded to the peak in the fe concentration of the released pore water fig 3e and the stress 2 72 mpa of the lowest occupancy of fe was the start of the fe peak in the diagram in fig 3e the sudden changes in the structure of the chlorite were obvious in the second experiment as well and these changes were similar to those of muscovite 2m1 fig 5 due to the decrease in the grain size the errors in the refined parameters of the rietveld refinement of the extracted clay particles became relatively larger research data 6 compared to the extracted silt particles fig 6a the rietveld refinement of the extracted clay particles fig 6b indicates that the structural differences in the muscovite 2m1 and chlorite in the clay particles before and after the plastic limit were not significant correspondingly the variations in the refined parameters of the extracted clay particles with increasing stress were less significant as well research data 6 indicating that the major variations in the mineral structures occurred in the silt particles there may be a larger concentration of stresses on the silt particles compared to the clay particles liu et al 2018 in the control group i e borehole g1 similar variations were found in the silt extracted from the borehole sediments in terms of the occupancies of nh4 and fe fig 7 a however the variations in the occupancies of the atoms with depth were relatively less significant compared to those in the simulated compaction experiments fig 5b due to the complex origins of the borehole sediments therefore the sediments from three boreholes g1 g3 and g4 in chen lake were sent for electric hot plate assisted digestion analysis with 68 nitric acid to further investigate the contribution of the structure changes of the clay minerals table 4 in the supplementary materials based on the digestion analysis results and the vertical profiles of the three boreholes the borehole sediments were divided into several groups according to their different characteristics and origins research data 2 in each group with similar characteristics and sedimentary environments the occupancies of fe and k in the mineral structures tended to gradually decrease with depth research data 2 correspondingly the occupancy of mg in the mineral structures slightly increased with depth in each group in the three boreholes this suggests that this isomorphism of atoms that is replacement of k by nh4 and replacement of fe by mg in the mineral structures probably occurs in naturally shallow aquitards as well fig 7b however the variations in the occupancies of the atoms in the mineral structures seem to be insufficient to completely explain the changes in the contents of the main elements in the borehole sediments for example the increase in mg only accounts for approximately one third of the decrease in fe which is most likely due to carbonate dissolution and reductive dissolution of fe oxides and or hydroxides in shallow aquitards schaefer et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 compared to single crystal studies comodi and zanazzi 1995 comodi et al 2008 the errors in the refinement parameters for unconsolidated sediments are much larger however the increase in the error is predictable due to the complex components and low crystallinity of minerals in unconsolidated sediments even in a single crystal study the error in the refined parameters is larger at a stress of 0 1 mpa while it sharply decreases under stresses of greater than 0 25 gpa comodi et al 2008 due to the improved crystallization despite the relatively high errors the variations in the refined parameters are five times or more higher than the error research data 6 which ensures the accuracy of the analysis in addition the isomorphism of the atoms was simultaneous observed in both the natural sediments from the control borehole and the simulated compaction experiments which demonstrates the reliability of the results of the rietveld refinements 4 discussion based on the contradictions found in the pore water chemistry and the significant variations in the mineral structures through the rietveld refinement we suggest that traditional viewpoints such as microbial mediated redox reactions and adsorption are minor processes while the structural variations in the minerals predominantly control the solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction 4 1 variation patterns of mineral structure during clay compaction previous research suggests that the mineral structures are stable under low temperature and low stress conditions comodi and zanazzi 1995 comodi et al 2008 however our results indicate that this viewpoint is not applicable to clay minerals with low symmetry during clay compaction as the stress increases the variation in the structural parameters is regular in the extracted silt and can be summarized in three patterns fig 5 the overall variation patterns of the parameters specifically the variations in the cell parameters a b c and α β γ and volumes depend on the symmetry of the clay minerals fig 5a in this study muscovite 2m1 belongs to the monoclinic crystal system while chlorite belongs to the triclinic crystal system which indicates that the muscovite 2m1 possesses better symmetry than the chlorite therefore the overall parameters of muscovite 2m1 were relatively stable in the two experiments except for β representing a minor variation in the overall structure in contrast the overall parameters of chlorite including all of the cell parameters a b c and α β γ changed in the two experiments representing a major variation in the overall structure the variations in the overall parameters represent the sudden change that occurred at the plastic limit of the sediments the variation patterns of the atoms positions specifically the variations in the z of the two si o tetrahedrons were continuous in the muscovite 2m1 and were complex in the chlorite fig 5b there was an approximately linear variation between the stress and the relative positions of the si o tetrahedrons in the two experiments which indicates that the mineral structures gradually changed in order to adapt to the increase in stress the continuous variation patterns of the atoms positions were suddenly interrupted at the plastic limit of the sediments fig 5b the variation patterns of the occupancies of the atoms specifically the isomorphism of nh4 and k in muscovite 2m1 and mg and fe in chlorite fig 5c were similar to the variation patterns of the overall parameters fig 5a the difference was the occupied lattice sites specifically nh4 and k compete for one lattice site in muscovite 2m1 while mg and fe compete for three lattice sites in chlorite the larger number of lattice sites leads to the complex variation in the occupancies of fe and mg in chlorite which is dominated by neither stress nor the liquid plastic limit in contrast due to the competition for a single lattice site the variation in the occupancy of nh4 corresponds to the variation patterns of the overall parameters both of which occur at the plastic limit of the sediments these three variation patterns indicate that both continuous and sudden changes occur during clay compaction the continuous deformation of the mineral structures such as the relative displacements of the si o tetrahedrons occur to adapt to the gradual increase in stress when the moisture content drops below the plastic limit the sudden increase in the effective stress up to 0 77 mpa and 1 44 mpa in the first and second experiments respectively leads to sudden changes in the overall parameters and isomorphism of the atoms the corresponding variations were more obvious and accurate at the plastic limit of the sediments in the second experiment due to the higher effective stress research data 9 and the smoother moisture curve of the sediments fig 4a 4 2 variations in the pore water chemistry in response to the structural changes in the clay minerals as was previously shown in fig 3 the typical solute release mechanisms of microbial mediated redox reactions fail to explain the variations in the pore water chemistry the obvious contradictions between the redox conditions carbonate dissolution release of iron and increases in ca2 and mg2 indicate that the clay compaction does not conform to the mechanisms of microbial mediated redox reactions lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 wersin et al 2011 interestingly the structural changes in the clay minerals seem to be associated with the variations in the chemistry of the pore water fig 8 furthermore the structural changes in the clay minerals are physical and are not restricted by the redox conditions reductive dissolution or microorganism activity thus they are able to resolve the contradictions with the redox conditions and other factors apparently the decrease in the occupancy of fe in chlorite corresponds to the increase in the concentration of fe in the pore water so chlorite could be a source of the fe in the pore water peng et al 2014 ye et al 2020 similarly the increase in the occupancy of nh4 in the muscovite 2m1 corresponds to the decrease in the concentration of nh4 in the pore water so muscovite 2m1 could be a sink of the nh4 in the pore water compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 however due to the low symmetry of chlorite and the multiple lattice sites for iron the relevance is relatively weak compared to that of muscovite 2m1 including a lagged response and larger fluctuations fig 8b the structural variations in the clay minerals could also explain the cation exchange between the sediments and pore water fig 3d and 4b to some extent benedicto et al 2014 escamilla roa et al 2016 in addition to the corresponding variations in the nh4 and fe in the sediments and pore water fig 8 the replacement of k by nh4 in the lattice sites of muscovite 2m1 and the replacement of fe by mg in the lattice sites of chlorite would lead to the release of k and the absorption of mg2 rebalancing the cation exchange jacquat et al 2009 moreover the increase in al3 in the pore water fig 4b could be related to the continuous variation and sudden change in the positions of si o tetrahedrons in the muscovite 2m1 fig 5b lanson et al 2015 viennet et al 2016 the overall structural variations in the clay minerals could lead to changes in the cation exchange capacity thus becoming the extra source of ca2 and mg2 found in carbonate dissolution fig 3c tamura et al 2014 singla et al 2020 4 3 hypothesis regarding the origin of the variations in the mineral structures we suggest that the variations in the mineral structures are an adaptation of the clay minerals to the increase in the effective stress during clay compaction fitts and brown 1999 hupers and kopf 2012 the variations occur in low symmetry minerals such as muscovite and chlorite instead of high symmetry minerals such as quartz calcite and dolomite due to the different compressive strengths of their crystal structures comodi and zanazzi 1995 haines and cambon 2004 catalli and williams 2005 comodi et al 2008 the variations gradually accumulate and finally lead to the isomorphism of similar atoms fig 5 katti et al 2005 zhang et al 2019 the variations mainly occur in the silt particles which is probably due to the relatively high content of silt particles in the clay sediments and the concentration of the stress in the silt particles liu et al 2018 second the variations in the mineral structure seem to depend on the moisture content of the sediments rather than the loading stress which could be explained by the effective stress principle terzaghi 1943 at the beginning of compaction or consolidation in the field of engineering the loading of the stress leads to the production of excess pore water pressure which gradually decreases as the pore water is discharged subsequently the excess pore water stress decreasing is converted into effective stress increasing which causes deformation of the pores in the sediments biot and maurice 1941 when the moisture content of the sediments drops below the plastic limit which indicates the sediments are no longer plastic the ductile brittle transition occurs barnes 2013 the pore water and pores can no longer substitute for the sediment particles and carry the stress at which point sudden changes in the mineral structures of the sediment particles could occur under the increase in the effective stress fig 5 osullivan et al 1994 haigh et al 2014 wang and yin 2020 in muscovite 2m1 the process begins with the continuous variation in the relative z positions of the two si o tetrahedrons fig 5b and the spacing of the layers gradually changes fig 9 a then the β parameter suddenly increased for approximately 0 05 representing the variation in the overall structure fig 5a finally the k is partly replaced by nh4 in the lattice site resulting in corresponding variations in the chemistry of the pore water fig 5c and 8a in chlorite there is no specific starting point for the process and the continuously variation is the gradual decrease in the cell volume research data 6 due to the low symmetry of chlorite its structure can easily change which occurs for all of the parameters instead of single and specific parameters fig 9b wenk et al 2010 although there are three lattice sites for fe and mg the replacement of fe by mg mainly occurs in mgm3 which is a lattice site between the si o tetrahedron layers research data 6 the competing lattice sites are similar in muscovite 2m1 and chlorite which indicates that the lattice site between the si o tetrahedrons of the clay minerals is relatively unstable during compaction brown et al 2001 riebe et al 2005 hupers and kopf 2012 benedicto et al 2014 4 4 environmental effect of the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction through the above analysis we are trying to fill the gap in the understanding of the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction and proposed a conceptual model to explain the solute mobilization mechanism which is driven by a physical process fig 10 when the activities of the organic carbon and fe and or mn oxides are not strong enough to provide electrons for microbial mediated redox reactions lawrence et al 2000 hendry and wassenaar 2004 stuckey et al 2016 the structural variations in the clay minerals could become the major solute mobilization mechanism the structural variations in the clay minerals during clay compaction explain the solute mobilization without the need for the participation of redox and microorganism reactions in previous studies these abiotic and non chemical processes in sediments were usually considered to involve the adsorption or desorption of the bound forms of different minerals based on the sequential extraction results bertolo et al 2011 deng et al 2011 mehta 2017 shen et al 2018 however to be rigorous each bound form in the sequential extraction does not accurately correspond to a single and certain mineral and it does not even accurately correspond to a group of minerals nirel and morel 1990 tessier and campbell 1991 apparently the reactions between these extractants including acids alkalis and oxidants and the sediments cannot be completely selective which makes the concept and application of the sequential extraction obscure nirel and morel 1990 tessier and campbell 1991 the content variations of each bound form in the sequential extraction of the sediments can neither explain what occurs between the pore water and sediments nor point out where the reactant reacts and when the reaction begins which leads to great difficulty in estimating the environmental risk in contrast our study provides a clear answer to the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction including which types of minerals change where the reaction sites are what happens to the mineral structures when the continuous and sudden variations occur and the consequences of the clay compaction the results suggest a worrying fact i e that the variations in the mineral structures during clay compaction are dominated by the moisture content instead of stress which indicates that this process could probably occur in shallow aquitards under overexploitation of groundwater regardless of the formation pressure furthermore the instability of the interlayers between the si o tetrahedrons may be observed in other clay minerals other than muscovite and chlorite which indicates that similar variations may occur in the mineral structures of argillaceous sediments in other regions fortunately the influence of the variations in the mineral structures during clay compaction is both positive and negative for example the isomorphism of nh4 and k in muscovite 2m1 seems to be good for the mineralization and fixation of ammonium compton et al 1992 williams et al 2013 which may reduce the risk of ammonium being released into the aquifer during clay compaction jiao et al 2010 sun et al 2021 in contrast the isomorphism of mg and fe in chlorite would release iron into the aquifer that may cause health and ecological risks homoncik et al 2010 erickson et al 2019 brindha et al 2020 we suggest the exploitation of groundwater should be conducted with more caution since the variations in the mineral structures are difficult to identify compared to the process of traditional reductive dissolution postma et al 2007 mladenov et al 2010 guo et al 2014 it is advised that the variations in the moisture contents of argillaceous sediments be regularly monitored or simulated in order to evaluate the state of compaction under exploitation of groundwater 5 broad applications this study has established the dynamic and interactivity of clay compaction which helps improve our understanding of the fate of deep and closed aquifers and improves the accuracy of numerical simulations of groundwater dynamics and reactive solute transport based on continuous compaction simulation experiments we established the link between the structural variations in clay minerals and the subsequent response of the pore water during clay compaction through the easily measurable moisture content and plastic limit we discuss the dynamic characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction and the interactions between the clay aquitard and the deep and closed aquifer during clay compaction which can be used to estimate the safety and resources of deep aquifers 5 1 dynamic characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction in the past two decades since holocene and pleistocene sand aquifers were found to be strongly polluted by iron ammonium and arsenic johannesson and hendry 2000 jiao et al 2010 erban et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2018 xue et al 2019 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020c sun et al 2021 the exploitation of groundwater has gradually shifted to deeper aquifers sarah et al 2014 hao et al 2018 wang et al 2018 gaye and tindimugaya 2019 su et al 2020 which has caused accelerated infiltration of the solutes in the upper layers fendorf et al 2010 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 and the strong compaction of deep clay aquitards chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 xiao et al 2021 therefore open aquifers influenced by the sedimentary intervals and the recharge windows are seriously threatened erban et al 2013 hoang and baumle 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 tarki et al 2020 by the accelerated infiltration and migration of the contaminants the upper layers driven by the increase in the hydraulic gradient mozumder et al 2020 however another uncertainty is the fate of the deep and closed aquifers surrounded by clay aquitards under such strong compaction apparently the pore water and solutes released from the compaction of the clay aquitards will be an important recharge source and potential threat to the deep and closed aquifers jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 the strong relevance of the exploitation intensity the rate of land subsidence and the proportion of clay facies to the quaternary sediments chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 as well as the similar isotopic compositions of the pore water of the aquifer and the clay aquitard jiao et al 2010 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 have demonstrated this previous research has found that over half of the iodine in the deep aquifer in the north china plain originated from clay compaction xue et al 2019 the arsenic released into the deep aquifer in the mekong delta vietnam is believed to be related to groundwater exploitation land subsidence and clay compaction erban et al 2013 in addition similar findings have been reported for fluoride chloride and ammonium jiao et al 2010 borzi et al 2015 jia et al 2018 pierre et al 2021 sun et al 2021 however previous studies only explained the present situation of the deep aquifers and the origin of these contaminants but they did not clearly determine if the differences in the contaminant concentrations at different depths in the same region are controlled by the clay compaction erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 assuming the contaminants with different concentrations all originated from clay compaction and subsequent solute mobilization this may indicate that the geochemical characteristics of solute mobilization during clay compaction are dynamic and vary with increasing formation pressure and groundwater exploitation xiao et al 2021 although previous studies have warned that the overexploitation of groundwater could cause clay compaction and the subsequent release of contaminants erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 mozumder et al 2020 the fate of the deep and closed aquifers surrounded by clay aquitards facing the increased formation pressure and groundwater exploitation is still not clear enough specifically a basis or threshold should be proposed cuthbert et al 2019 previous studies have generally regarded the release of pore water during clay compaction as a simple and physical process and they have ascribed the significant differences in the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the pore water at different depths in the same region to the different origins and heterogeneity of the sediments fendorf et al 2010 xue et al 2019 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020c however a previous experimental study reported that the release of arsenic during clay compaction is dynamic and stepwise xiao et al 2021 which indicates that solute mobilization during clay compaction is not only associated with the initial composition of the pore water and the sediments but also with the gradual and dynamic water rock interactions hupers and kopf 2012 tachi and yotsuji 2014 pierre et al 2021 this gradual and dynamic process is not fully discussed by previous studies because the short term variations are not large and long term monitoring is time consuming wersin et al 2011 xiao et al 2021 however the strong demand for clean water has significantly sped up clay compaction and the subsequent solute mobilization which suggests that the dynamic variations can no longer be ignored chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 xiao et al 2021 the results of this study suggest that the structural variations in clay minerals is the key factor that dominates the solute mobilization which is controlled by the moisture content and the plastic limit through identifying the structures of the minerals in a clay aquitard under ongoing compaction the fate of the adjacent and closed aquifer under sedimentation and groundwater exploitation can be determined specifically adjacent and closed aquifers can be divided into three main categories temporarily safe emergency and permanently safe fig 11 the process of identifying the structures of clay minerals involves time consuming extraction and refinement comodi et al 2008 salemi et al 2010 while our study provides a quite convenient basis i e the moisture content with the plastic limit serving as a clear threshold for evaluating the compaction state of a clay aquitard through discussion of the relevant mechanism fig 10 when the moisture content is higher than the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of minor compaction and the pore water released is only simple physical discharge schaefer et al 2017 liu et al 2020d liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020c and continuous mild carbonate dissolution occurs schaefer et al 2017 thus the adjacent and closed aquifer is temporarily safe as the formation pressure and the exploitation intensity of the groundwater continuously increase the moisture content moves closer to the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of moderate compaction and the solute mobilization is dominated by the variations in the structures of the clay minerals at this time isomorphic replacement occurs in the triclinic minerals with a low symmetry and relative movement of the si o tetrahedrons occurs in the monoclinic minerals with slightly higher symmetry according to the types of triclinic minerals solutes of different types and concentrations will be discharged for example isomorphic replacement in chlorite releases iron into the adjacent aquifer thus the adjacent clean aquifer is in an emergency state because the strong variations in the structures of the minerals will cause intensive solute mobilization during the clay compaction when the moisture content is significantly lower than the plastic limit the clay aquitard is in a state of major compaction and the adjacent aquifer may have been recharged by the solutes released in the previous stage and thus it may be contaminated by pollutants such as arsenic and iodine erban et al 2013 xue et al 2019 however the results of this study indicate that the structures of the triclinic minerals become stable in this stage while the isomorphic replacement that occurs in the monoclinic minerals such as the replacement of k by nh4 improves the quality of the groundwater this indicates that if the adjacent aquifer is clean at this time it may remain permanently safe and if the adjacent aquifer is contaminated at this time then it may not undergo contaminant input again during future clay compaction therefore the permanently safe aquifer could be a reliable groundwater resource while the contaminated aquifer has the potential for restoration briefly once the contaminated aquifer is restored through measures such as pumping and treatment mccarty et al 1998 lee et al 2001 tse et al 2001 thornton et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 the clay compaction due to later groundwater exploitation and sedimentation will not cause secondary contamination the blocking and secondary release of the contaminants in the fine porous medium is the major point regarding the restoration of contaminated aquifers goltz and oxley 1991 broholm et al 2005 russold et al 2006 capiro et al 2007 the screening of reversible aquifers based on the state of compaction of their clay aquitards could be significant to the protection of groundwater resources interestingly our results coincide with those of previous studies in terms of the burial depths of the aquifers contaminated as a result of clay compaction these aquifers contaminated as a result of clay compaction are not located below the 20 60 m redox dominated zone or in the deepest part of the quaternary strata erban et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in fact they are mostly located in the middle section of the quaternary strata which could be because the compaction of the clay aquitard has resulted in a moisture content close to the plastic limit this suggests that the proposed method of using the moisture content with the plastic limit as a threshold could be widely applicable 5 2 interactions between the physical and chemical processes during clay compaction second although clay compaction has attracted some attention in the fields of both hydrology and hydrogeochemistry due to the severe land subsidence and groundwater contamination in recent years due to groundwater exploitation biot and maurice 1941 terzaghi 1943 hendry and wassenaar 2004 fox 2007a fox 2007b fox and lee 2008 jiao et al 2010 guo et al 2014 pu and fox 2016 wang et al 2016 xue et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 ye et al 2020 chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 pierre et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 the discussion of clay compaction in previous studies is actually mutually exclusive specifically the physical process of the clay compaction and the chemical process of the solute mobilization during clay compaction are uncoupled and are discussed separately in previous studies fox 2007a fox 2007b fox and lee 2008 pu and fox 2016 the hydrogeologists have focused on the physical process itself and the secondary disasters such as land subsidence caused by it including the settlement stress hydraulic conductivity and pore pressure ortega guerrero et al 1999 fox 2007a fox 2007b ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 chaussard et al 2021 cigna and tapete 2021 but the subsequent geochemical influence on the aquifer has often been ignored in the research conducted on large strain consolidation the solid unit of the clay aquitard has generally been assumed to be non reactive and has been considered to be uninvolved in the geochemical process of the clay compaction biot and maurice 1941 terzaghi 1943 ortega guerrero et al 1999 fox 2007a fox 2007b ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 or only the liquid unit was assumed to participate in the solute mobilization while the solid unit only controlled the adsorption or desorption fox and lee 2008 pu and fox 2016 in addition the simulations of the solute transport under coupled large strain consolidation and solute transport were actually simulations of infiltration instead of simulations of consolidation or compaction fox and lee 2008 zhan et al 2009 wang and zhan 2013 pu and fox 2016 correspondingly the hydrogeochemists noticed that the solute mobilization during clay compaction contaminated the adjacent aquifers but the focus of these studies was on the types concentrations ranges and boundaries of the contaminates fendorf et al 2010 erban et al 2013 wang et al 2013 mihajlov et al 2020 ye et al 2020 the clay aquitard has generally been regarded as a non point source for solutes which continuously release doc ammonium and other substances with a constant concentration at a constant rate during the geochemical processes this point of view ignores the dynamic changes in the pore water chemistry and the mixing effect of the settlement and the pore water discharge during the clay compaction on the aquifer mozumder et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 apparently there are some association barriers between the dynamic variations observed in groundwater numerical simulation and the constant concentration assumed for reactive solute transport which have particularly limited the coupled numerical simulation of aquifer aquitard systems unfortunately this is also widely true for other coupled physical and chemical processes warscheid and braams 2000 aufdenkampe et al 2011 dentz et al 2011 ringwelski and gabbert 2010 jia et al 2017 the crux of the matter is to establish the link between the physical process and the chemical process however the physical parameters in consolidation or compaction models such as the stress flow pore pressure and displacement seem to be entirely independent from the chemical parameters in solute transport models including the type concentration and duration of the solutes which results in a barrier in the coupled process in this study we focused on the clay minerals that both bear the stress and release the solutes during clay compaction thereby establishing the link between the physical process and the chemical process as was discussed in section 3 the variations in the structures of the clay minerals under physical stress and the response of the geochemical characteristics of the pore water to the structural variations are related the variations in the structures of the clay minerals rely on the decrease in the moisture content and the increase in the effective stress which are caused by the physical discharge while the variations in the structures of the clay minerals lead to relative movement of the si o tetrahedrons and isomorphic replacement of the interlayer atoms thereby dominating the solute mobilization that is the physical process and chemical process during clay compaction are related through the structures of the clay minerals fig 12 the solute mobilization mechanism identified in this study establishes a reliable link between groundwater numerical simulations and reactive solute transport specifically in aquifer aquitard systems which has never been considered in previous studies briefly the liquid limit and moisture content calculated in the groundwater numerical simulations can be used to determine the types and concentrations of the solutes released from the clay aquitard which acts as a dynamic non point source of solutes in the reactive solute transport process through this mechanism and mineral analysis by taking the clay aquitard which is a significant component of the quaternary strata into consideration future coupled numerical models can effectively improve the accuracy of reactive solute transport models and help to better predict the risk to deep aquifers under the influence of clay compaction 6 conclusions variations in the mineral structures do occur at low temperatures 305 k and under low stress 8 60 mpa conditions during clay compaction and they mainly occur in clay minerals with low symmetry compared to the clay particles the variations in the mineral structures are more obvious in the silt particles due to the possible concentration of the stress in these particles the variations in the mineral structures are controlled by the moisture content liquid plastic limit and effective stress rather than by microbial mediated redox reactions the sudden changes in the occupancies of atoms occur when the moisture content drops below the liquid plastic limit which corresponds to the ductile brittle transition in addition there are also several continuous variations in the relative positions of the si o tetrahedrons in the clay minerals during clay compaction which may cause cation exchange the variations in the mineral structures include the relative displacements of the si o tetrahedrons isomorphism of the atoms between the si o tetrahedrons and overall variations in the crystal structures a b c and α β γ there is an obvious boundary between the continuous variations and the sudden changes in the clay minerals with relatively high symmetry such as muscovite 2m1 while the transition from continuous variations to sudden changes is more unclear in the clay minerals with relatively low symmetry such as chlorite due to the complex isomorphism of the lattice sites the variations in the mineral structures dominate the solute mobilization mechanism during clay compaction which is driven by physical processes through this mechanism argillaceous sediments can release fe into the aquifer and integrate nh4 into their minerals during clay compaction without the participation of redox and microorganism reactions similar variations may be found in other clay minerals depending on their symmetry and the atoms in the interlayers between the si o tetrahedrons this study provides knowledge for the assessment of the safety of deep groundwater resources in two aspects first the solute mobilization mechanism identified in this study provides an easy way to evaluate the status of the clay compaction and an easily available analysis parameter i e the moisture content with the plastic limit of the clay aquitard as the threshold based on borehole analysis it is easy to determine which compaction status and solute mobilization stage a clay aquitard is currently in and to evaluate the potential for groundwater exploitation second in this study it was determined that the physical and chemical processes during clay compaction are through the variations in the structures of the clay minerals which couple the compaction and consolidation of the aquitard and the reactive solute transport in the aquifer this new understanding will improve the accuracy of reactive solute transport models and help to better predict the risk to deep aquifers under the influence of clay compaction credit authorship contribution statement wenkai qiu conceptualization

3308,monitoring studies are necessary to better understand the hydrological processes affecting the isotopic signature of cave waters which are ultimately recorded in speleothems that are used as paleoclimate archives this research examines changes in the isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of precipitation as it infiltrates through the epikarst and into the jumandy cave located in the western amazon basin ecuador meteorological and hydrological parameters were monitored outside and inside the cave and isotope analyses were carried out in waters from rainfall an underground river and drip water at two sampling sites in the cave between april 2019 and february 2020 at monthly timescale the rainfall weighted isotopic composition monitored at our stations was strongly correlated with the mean precipitation amount however when considered at weekly time steps the correlation is only moderate this implies that the variation of the isotopic composition in the study area cannot be interpreted exclusively as an amount effect isotopic values and back trajectory modeling show that the isotopic signature was affected by the moisture source effect associated with upstream rainout the moisture flux is dominantly from an east to northeast direction and moisture mainly originates over the atlantic ocean passing through the amazon basin a significant fraction of moisture is associated with local sources within the amazon basin this aspect is confirmed by d excess values of rainfall and the local meteoric water lines lmwls that indicate an influence of the high evapotranspiration rate of the amazon region on the isotopic composition of local rainfall the infiltrated water resides for about three weeks in the epikarst and then precipitates forming speleothems residence time however this short residence time needs to be confirmed with a longer monitoring period despite the different magnitudes of the dripping rates the isotopic values at the two monitored sites are similar this suggests that the dripping discharge rate is affected by the karst structure but the isotopic signature reflects the mixing of individual rainfall events above the cave therefore ẟ18o in speleothems from these caves is mainly recording short term precipitation changes linked to regional and large scale atmospheric circulation keywords karst stable isotopes paleoclimatic reconstructions amazon amount effect 1 introduction solutes dissolved in percolated water such as calcium carbonate dripping in cave environments allow for the formation of speleothems that grow in layers over time as carbonate precipitates luo et al 2013 as they grow the speleothems retain the isotopic signature of the percolated rainwater within the carbonate layers clark 2015 thereby these structures provide high resolution records capable of retaining the isotope variability of the rainfall at interannual time scale allowing us to reconstruct past climatic variability fairchild et al 2006 fuller et al 2008 matthews et al 2000 rozanski et al 1997 wainer et al 2011 the rainfall isotopic variations in tropical regions result from the combined effect of altitude rainfall amount moisture source and rayleigh distillation gat and matsui 1991 grootes et al 1989 rozanski et al 1993 the altitude effect consists of progressive isotopic depletion due to orographic uplift and condensation of water vapor approximately 2 to 3 of δ18o km gonfiantini et al 2001 as the uplift leads to cooling condensation and preferential removal of the heavier isotopes thereby rendering the remaining water vapor increasingly more depleted in heavy isotopes at higher elevations hurley et al 2016 in tropical south america oxygen isotopic ratios in speleothems are mainly reflecting the degree of rainout upstream associated with rayleigh distillation during transport dansgaard 1964 hence they record changes in monsoon dynamics and convective activity over the amazon basin campos et al 2019 grootes et al 1989 vimeux et al 2005 vuille et al 2012 the amount of precipitation amount effect moquet et al 2016 and changes in moisture source source effect lee et al 2009 the amount effect is dominant in areas close to the moisture source such as in coastal areas craig and gordon 1965 lachniet 2009 in the peruvian amazon and the andes on the other hand the long range transport from source to sink lead to progressive loss of heavy isotopes along the moisture pathway and therefore a stronger imprint of the degree of rainout upstream reflecting large scale monsoon dynamics vimeux et al 2005 vuille et al 2003 vuille et al 2012 on the other hand the source effect dictates the origin and trajectory of an air mass linked to processes of evaporation relative humidity and degree of rainout upstream dru that influence the isotopic signature at the ultimate precipitation site ampuero et al 2020 kanner et al 2013 vimeux et al 2005 vuille and werner 2005 dru refers to the amount of precipitation upstream integrated along the trajectory of an air mass therefore far from the moisture source the isotopic composition of rainfall is not a straightforward function of the local rainout instead it reflects the history of the convective processes that occurred along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway this factor is relevant to the interpretation of isotope records in the andes the isotopic signature measured in the cave drip waters may differ from the one originally observed in rainfall due to multiple processes acting in the soil epikarst and fractures in the transmission zone constantin et al 2018 dhungana and aharon 2019 which have implications to the isotopic signature recorded in the speleothem carbonate dreybrodt and scholz 2011 fairchild et al 2006 cave drip waters reflect a long term weighted mean of the isotopic composition of precipitation chapman et al 1992 moquet et al 2016 williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 and paleoclimate reconstructions based upon speleothems require adequate calibration as the fractionation processes are site specific duan et al 2016 therefore ensuring a modern understanding of the processes that may alter the isotopic composition in a speleothem is key to calibrate the proxy archive for reconstructing past rainfall variability temperature changes or atmospheric circulation at various timescales cobb et al 2007 dhungana and aharon 2019 lambert and aharon 2010 polk et al 2012 in the amazon basin the study of climate controls on isotopic variability and how they related to hydroclimate and atmospheric circulation are limited the few existing studies indicate that over continental areas dru explains a significant fraction of the observed variance in the isotopic composition of rainfall on weekly to monthly timescales ampuero et al 2020 della libera et al 2022 kanner et al 2013 villacís et al 2008 vimeux et al 2005 vuille and werner 2005 in contrast the meaning of the speleothem isotope records from areas covered by amazon forest at the andes foothills is not fully understood cheng et al 2013 mosblech et al 2012 a more recent study has attributed the differences in δ18o variability across the basin to be a function of the relative contribution from local recycled moisture from evapotranspiration versus transported moisture from distal sources in the tropical atlantic where the first source dominates over areas in the western amazon wang et al 2017 mosblech et al 2012 performed a paleoclimate study over the last 100 kyrs using four stalagmites from santiago cave ecuadorian amazon and established that the past recorded history of rainfall in this part of the amazon was controlled by the north atlantic oscillation nao however since this study was not calibrated with local information does not account for the possible influence of other regional and local effects the present study seeks to analyze the relationship between isotopic variability in modern rainfall drip water and water from river drainages inside the jumandy cave located in the westernmost part of the amazon river basin the results of a weekly monitoring program are reported for the period from april 2019 to february 2020 and compared with meteorological variables and the transport history of air masses to determine the most relevant controls on the isotopic signature of rainfall this investigation allows for a more detailed understanding of the cave environment and provides a reference to calibrate paleoclimate studies in this region 2 study area two rainfall collecting sites were surveyed for isotopic analysis one at universidad regional amazónica ikiam represented as ikiam station 0 57 s 77 51 w 610 m and the other at the jumandy cave entrance referred to as jumandy station 0 52 s 77 47 w 650 m located in western amazon basin in the napo province ecuador fig 1 the cave lies in the napo formation which consists of cretaceous marine limestones interbedded with shales that were uplifted during the cenozoic estupiñan et al 2010 hoorn et al 2010 limestone formations cover about 5 10 of ecuador s surface area 283 560 km2 and their outcrops lead to the formation of karst aquifers mostly in the amazon basin constantin et al 2018 the jumandy cave was formed by the dissolution of the 70 90 million year old limestones that belong to the napo karst system sánchez et al 2017 the cave has a length of 2 km and has a narrow entrance of 2 m that connects to several branches and an underground river called lluya yaku that flows permanently inside the cave bauz and mena 2015 the monitoring took place at 550 and 1500 m distance from the cave entrance respectively fig 2 the average thickness of the epikarst is 8 6 m and the strata that constitute the vadose zone are unconsolidated material limestone rocks highly fractured limestone rocks and limestone bedrock rivera 2022 climatological information recorded at archidona station 0 55 s 77 49 w at 2 6 km distance from the study area from 2001 to 2014 indicates a mean annual precipitation and temperature of 4091 mm and 23 9 c respectively this region is close to the equator therefore it receives more of its precipitation associated with the annual march of convective activity over the site which occurs twice a year in march to may espinoza et al 2009 the percentage of annual precipitation recorded in austral winter june july august jja and spring september october november son was 27 and 23 respectively the lowest precipitation amount 20 fell in austral summer december january february djf with minimum of 233 mm month recorded in january and the highest precipitation 29 in autumn march april may mam the precipitation is quite equally distributed around the year as one would expect for a site located so close to the equator the mean annual cycle of air temperature in the amazon basin shows that highest temperatures are reached ahead of the rainy season once convective cloud cover builds up during the rainy season the surface receipt of solar radiation is reduced thereby lowering temperature at the surface garreaud et al 2009 3 methods due to the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 the study was interrupted from march to december 2020 and was resumed in january 2021 there is a four week gap included in the monitoring period due to bad weather conditions and a national protest in ecuador in october 2019 in the weeks where sampling did not occur the drip volume and the isotopic composition were accumulated for 15 days the weekly relative drip rate was then determined based on the drip volume and the monitoring time the drip water isotopic data were plotted on the local meteoric water line lmwl and global meteoric water line gmwl which indicated that there is no significant difference between the isotopic signature accumulated during 15 and 7 days no outliers were discarded as they were considered representing reasonable observations of an unusual climatic situation the statistical procedures applied were 1 spearman correlation ρ to detect significant relationships between the meteorologic and isotopic variables this coefficient was considered because it is range based and robust to the influence of outliers 2 simple linear regression to build the lmwls 3 anova to compare the regression lines lmwls and detect if there are significant differences between the intercepts and slopes 3 1 monitoring outside the cave rainwater samples were collected weekly 42 weeks for isotopic analyses employing two rain gauges located at ikiam and jumandy stations following the protocols of iaea wmo 2014 https www iaea org the rain gauges consisted of a funnel connected to a 4 l tank placed inside a reflective white box to avoid thermal changes that could lead to evaporation and isotopic fractionation during rainfall collection the water from the tank was mixed and stored in 60 ml air tight amber glass bottles avoiding air bubbles the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c prior to isotopic analysis the meteorological variables were recorded with an automatic meteorological station at the ikiam site https meteorologia ikiam edu ec and a data logging rain gauge rg3 m with a calibration accuracy of 1 0 0 2 mm measurement increments installed above the jumandy station the variables recorded were precipitation air temperature and relative humidity 3 2 cave monitoring the drip water gauges dw1 and dw2 were installed inside the jumandy cave following the methodology described by dhungana and aharon 2019 each gauge consists of a funnel of 0 1 m diameter connected directly to a 1 l hermetic plastic bag that stores the percolating water from an active stalactite water from cave drainage was collected at two locations as depicted in fig 2 wf1 and wf2 to compare the isotopic composition in the main drainage and its tributary the samples were collected weekly in amber glass bottles of 60 ml sealed without headspace and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis two onset hobo pro v2 data loggers accuracy 0 21 c from 0 to 50 c resolution 0 02 c at 25 c were installed at 300 and 1500 m distance from the entrance of the cave to measure the air temperature and relative humidity every 10 min to check the climate variability in the cave fig 2 these records were converted to weekly averages to match the temporal resolution of the isotopic water sampling to determine the dripping discharge rates for the speleothems and investigate the flow characteristics of the water that infiltrates in the epikarst the time it takes to fill a known volume was calculated weekly also the water level of the river inside the cave was measured to determine the water fluctuation in real time using the hobo u20l water level data logger resolution 0 014 kpa the water level h was used to calculate the flow or runoff q within the cave applying the q h curve on a daily time scale 3 3 stable isotope analysis the isotopic composition of 252 water samples was analyzed for hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o in rainfall n 84 drip water n 84 and cave drainage n 84 samples with solid debris were sifted with a 0 45 µm mesh diameter cellulose filter the analysis was conducted in the laboratorio nacional de referencia del agua lnra at the universidad regional amazónica ikiam using laser spectroscopy los gatos research lwia 45 ep water samples were processed according to iaea wmo 2014 protocols with standards obtained at different heights within ecuador the standards used in the study were validated by iaea and are listed in supplementary material table a 1 results are expressed in parts per mil relative to the international isotopic measurement standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow with an analytical precision of 0 1 for δ18o and 0 3 in the case of δ2h the monthly weighted average for precipitation and deuterium excess were also calculated supplementary material text a 2 3 4 back trajectory model seven day air parcel back trajectories were computed with the hysplit 5 1 model hybrid single parcel lagrangian integrated trajectory 5 1 rolph et al 2017 stein et al 2015 using era 5 data on pressure levels hersbach et al 2018a and at the surface hersbach et al 2018b in 0 75 x 0 75 resolution 80 km back trajectories were initiated at the ikiam station at the height of 1000 m above ground level 730 hpa within the lower atmospheric layer where the most significant moisture transport to the study site takes place they were simulated once a day over the monitoring period accounting only for the back trajectories that initiate on precipitation days at the ikiam station although this period is too short to describe the climatology we consider it appropriate to illustrate the source variability during the observation period for more details about the calculations see supplementary material text a 3 due to the proximity of the monitoring stations about 10 km back trajectory simulations are performed only at the ikiam station as computations at jumandy station would lead to very similar results to obtain the representative patterns of the back trajectories and assess their frequency and timing a cluster analysis was performed the hierarchical clustering analysis algorithm with squared euclidean distance from the hysplit was applied to further assess these results we compared the clusters with composites of the regional anomalies of precipitation and vertically integrated moisture flux 3 5 degree of rainout upstream dru precipitation along the moisture transport pathway often referred to as degree of rainout upstream dru is a major control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in continental locations where precipitation results from large scale moisture transport we estimated dru by pairing gpm daily precipitation with the calculated back trajectories and accumulated precipitation along the back trajectory up to the monitoring site only precipitation over the continent was considered to compare dru with the isotopic data we calculated weighted mean values using the local precipitation amount observed at the ikiam station thereby we account more accurately for the contribution of each precipitation event with a unique dru value to the monitored isotopic signature of precipitation 4 results and discussion 4 1 isotopic composition of rainfall the meteorological variables and isotopic composition of rainfall recorded at jumandy and ikiam stations indicate that they behave very similarly as they fluctuated mostly in phase on a weekly basis fig 3 the ẟ2h and ẟ18o of precipitation are closely correlated ρ 0 99 p value 0 01 at both stations the isotopic rainfall samples ranged from 16 9 to 1 0 for ẟ18o and from 124 1 to 17 8 for ẟ2h at jumandy station and from 16 5 to 0 3 for ẟ18o and from 122 8 to 10 8 for ẟ2h at the ikiam station the mean ẟ18o and ẟ2h values at jumandy station were 6 4 and 38 3 respectively whereas at ikiam station they were 5 8 and 34 2 fig 3c and d monthly values of ẟ18o at ikiam and jumandy stations were estimated through means weighted by the amount of rainfall the depleted monthly ẟ18o values at ikiam and jumandy stations coincide with the highest precipitation amounts fig 4 the ẟ18o timeseries at the study site were compared with two nearby sites in the amazon basin available in the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip database hosted within the iaea fig 4b and with data from two independent studies iaea stations included were manaus 3 70 s 60 10 w data from 1965 to 1999 and iquitos 3 49 s 73 22 w data from 2006 to 2012 located in brazil and peru respectively the other records were published as part of a study conducted by ampuero et al 2020 from 2012 to 2018 at the palestina station 5 92 s 77 35 w in the peruvian amazon and a stable isotopes study carried out by souza et al 2015 from 2008 to 2009 in the urucu oil province 4 52 s 65 18 w in the brazilian amazon the mean δ18o value from the palestina station 6 59 urucu 6 36 and iquitos gnip station 5 72 feature similar values as ikiam 5 7 and jumandy 6 3 stations on the other hand the most eastern station is characterized by less depleted values manaus 4 07 due to a shorter distance to the moisture source in the atlantic reduced rayleigh fractionation the most negative values are recorded in the periods of march june and october december fig 4b the anova results show that the means of the isotopic values were similar between all stations and the information reported in this study f 1 32 p value 0 269 this means that despite the difference in the monitoring time the seasonality of the monthly mean isotopic composition did not change for jumandy station the ẟ18o and ẟ2h values of rainfall display a moderate negative correlation with the weekly precipitation amount significant at the 95 level ρ 0 39 and ρ 0 38 respectively table 1 in comparison a higher correlation significant at 99 level is observed between ẟ18o and ẟ2h values with precipitation accumulation at ikiam station ρ 0 51 and ρ 0 50 respectively table 1 the rainfall amount effect is more strongly observed on monthly intra seasonal or interannual time scales than in weeks days or hours risi et al 2008 rozanski et al 1993 in the jumandy cave the correlation of rainfall amount and isotopic data taken at weekly timescales explained 15 of the variance however when the temporal weighting for the isotopes of precipitation shifted from weekly to monthly values the correlation increased ρ 0 65 p value 0 03 which means that 42 of the variance was explained in a study carried out at cajas in the southwest of ecuador a moderate correlation between ẟ18o and rainfall amount on a weekly scale r 0 37 p value 0 01 and a strong one a monthly scale r 0 60 p value 0 01 were found esquivel hernández et al 2019 this large unexplained variance in the short term variations is a consequence of processes that were omitted in the regression analysis such as convection cloud microphysics cloud types and humidity transport that affect the isotopic composition of rainfall aggarwal et al 2016 hastenrath 1997 these processes are included when calculating monthly means despite not being directly controlled by rainfall amount but by factors mentioned above hoffmann 2003 villacís et al 2008 vimeux et al 2005 therefore the weekly monitoring scale of this study allows for a better perspective of the physical convective processes that influence the isotopic signature compared to those accumulated over periods of months the parameters that control the rainfall isotopic composition in tropical areas have not been fully understood due to the limited spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the available data hoffmann 2003 vuille 2018 the amount effect is expected to be significant in places closer to the moisture source as long as no long range transport has occurred studies carried out in the tropics munksgaard et al 2019 especially those performed in south america gastmans et al 2017 salati et al 1979 souza et al 2015 vimeux et al 2005 including the amazon basin in ecuador windhorst et al 2013 show that isotopic variability is associated primarily with regional rather than local upstream convective activity consequently ẟ18o values in this study site are not solely controlled by the amount effect but by moisture source effects and the transport history condensation rainout and mixing with air masses that have undergone evapotranspiration of air masses wang et al 2017 the ẟ18o values did not increase when precipitation declined at the end of rainy season during the first and second week of june when the ẟ18o values remained very negative reaching values of 16 7 and 13 6 even though rainfall remained below 100 mm one explanation for these values is that at the end of the rainy season precipitation is fueled by moisture that is very depleted in 18o reflecting the end of intense convection upstream over the amazon basin this delayed effect was documented over the peruvian andes by hurley et al 2015 hence at the end of the rainy season highly depleted moisture produces lighter than expected ẟ18o values even for small accumulation events there is a weak negative correlation between the ẟ18o values of rainfall and air temperature t and relative humidity rh both at jumandy station t ρ 0 02 rh ρ 0 12 and ikiam station t ρ 0 05 rh ρ 0 04 none of these correlations are significant at the 95 level table 1 this indicates that the temperature effect does not influence the ẟ18o variations of the local rainfall on short timescales which is consistent with previous studies in the andes vuille et al 2003 hardy et al 2003 the study site experiences a mean annual temperature of 23 c that increases by 1 c in august and september therefore the lack of a significant temperature relationship is entirely consistent with its very low seasonal amplitude also there was no correlation significant at the 95 level between weekly d excess and temperature at jumandy station ρ 0 19 table 1 but there was a moderate correlation significant at the 99 level between d excess and temperature at ikiam station ρ 0 45 table 1 this means that the seasonal temperature variation in the study area is just too low to imprint any significant isotope effect in rainfall but it could leave an imprint in the d excess however the monitoring time is too short to draw any firm conclusions the monthly precipitation weighted isotopic values were used to construct the lmwls which were plotted together with the gmwl fig 5 the lmwl of jumandy and ikiam stations are ẟ2h 8 30 0 10 ẟ18o 14 64 0 33 n 42 and ẟ2h 8 33 0 20 ẟ18o 14 65 1 28 n 42 respectively the slopes of the lmwls from jumandy station 8 30 and the ikiam station 8 33 overlap and are consistent with the gmwl slope 8 0 the lmwls intersections of jumandy station 14 64 and the ikiam station 14 65 are higher than the global average value of 10 fig 5 in comparison the lmwls from other nearby places in the amazon basin were ẟ2h 8 40 ẟ18o 16 74 for palestina station ẟ2h 8 50 ẟ18o 13 65 for iquitos ẟ2h 7 96 ẟ18o 10 25 for urucu and ẟ2h 8 14 ẟ18o 12 96 for manaus station the intercept values from the lmwls d excess presented here are slightly above of the range of 9 80 to 14 60 proposed by salati et al 1979 as typical values in precipitation resulting from air masses that cross the amazon it can be attributed to the reduced recycling and to secondary processes of re evaporation and mixing of air masses that move across the amazon and precipitate in the local area dhungana and aharon 2019 rozanski et al 1993 a study conducted by staal et al 2018 established that 32 of rainfall over the amazon basin is produced by total evapotranspiration the amazon rainforest reintroduces heavy isotopes into the atmospheric vapor recycled moisture where ẟ18o values of these air masses are thereby enriched in heavy isotopes gat and matsui 1991 martinelli et al 1996 villacís et al 2008 d excess allows evaluating the extent of moisture recycling araguás araguás et al 2000 froehlich et al 2002 gat and matsui 1991 salati et al 1979 at jumandy station the monthly average values of d excess during the monitoring period was 12 7 the highest monthly values were measured from july to september 13 9 15 6 and 14 8 the lowest values were measured from april to may 10 7 and 11 0 and from december to january 9 8 and 10 9 4 2 stable isotopic composition of cave drip waters the ẟ18o drip water values ranged from 6 8 to 6 3 for dw1 and from 6 9 to 6 3 for dw2 the ẟ2h ranged from 41 9 to 40 3 for dw1 and from 42 6 to 40 6 for dw2 the average value of weekly ẟ18o drip water was 6 6 and 6 7 for the sites dw1 and dw2 respectively while the values of ẟ2h were 41 0 and 41 6 for dw1 and dw2 respectively this average difference of 0 1 for ẟ18o is on the order of the analytical precision while the ẟ2h is higher 0 5 this indicates that there were no strong local effects altering the ẟ18o signature between the two monitoring sites the reasonable variability of mean values together with the low amplitude of ẟ18o and ẟ2h values for drip water values eliminates the possibility of strong evaporation of meteoric water along with the percolation of the water inside the cave therefore it is likely that the o18 values of precipitation are well preserved in the drips that precipitate and form speleothems the discharge characteristics differ at the two monitoring dripping sites dw1 and dw2 within the same cave the dripping discharge rate ranged from 3 66 to 11 60 ml h for dw1 at dripping site 1 fig 6 and from 6 07 to 6 97 ml h for dw2 at dripping site 2 fig 7 and the average rate collected weekly was 7 71 and 6 56 ml h respectively at dw1 rainfall measurements recorded a peak in the last week of may fig 6a which is reflected three weeks later in the depleted ẟ18o drip water values fig 6b likewise in the first week of june precipitation decreases and three weeks later an increase of ẟ18o drip water values is observed fig 6c atdw2 the correspondence between the increase in precipitation during the last week of may and the depletion of ẟ18o in the first week of june is more clearly observed fig 7 the slightly inverse response three weeks after each event indicates a negative correlation between the two parameters the behavior of dripping water is related to the intensity of the events since after an intense event part of the water infiltrates and the rest contributes to runoff if these events are repetitive the water saturates the epikarst favoring infiltration this is what happens in the jumandy cave mainly at dw2 where the drip volume responds relatively quickly in a way that is typical of caves with a shallow epikarst the average epikarst is 8 6 m and the strata that constitute the vadose zone consist of unconsolidated material limestone rocks highly fractured limestone rocks and limestone bedrock rivera 2022 the cave is located in a tropical zone characterized by the presence of organic matter over the cave and high amounts of precipitation which means that there is a high dissolution of the carbonate rocks that favor the conduits and fractures exist that allow a fast flow of water in the karst hu et al 2015 maloszewski et al 2002 the discharge rates in both sites varied because after a precipitation event the hydraulic head increases within the karst where the drip volume is dampened and redistributed due to the complexity of the karstic system tooth and fairchild 2003 the ẟ18o and ẟ2h values for drip water compared to the rainfall signature figs 6 and 7 and drip water values plotted over the lmwls fig 5 confirms water and therefore isotopic mixing in the epikarst this result was expected because the drip water isotopic signature results from multiple precipitation events that supply water that is mixed within the epikarst bar matthews et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 caves with a shallow epikarst are generally ideal for high resolution paleoclimatic studies since the water infiltrated into the soil and vadose zone experiences shorter residence times cruz et al 2009 strikis et al 2011 the d excess is a useful parameter to check if evaporation is occurring as water percolates through a karst aquifer dansgaard 1964 the d excess of drip water ranged from 9 8 to 13 3 at dw1 and from 10 0 to 13 5 at dw2 the average values of d excess were 11 6 and 11 8 similar to the rainfall values of ikiam and jumandy stations fig 3e which indicates absence of evaporation during water seepage through the soil and epikarst evaporation within the cave associated with low relative humidity could also affect the d excess measured in the drip water however evaporation is negligible in jumandy cave where temperature fluctuations are minimal year round ranging from 22 46 to 22 82 c at site 1 and from 22 58 to 23 13 c at site 2 and relative humidity always remained at 100 it also indicates optimal conditions for paleoclimatic studies based on speleothem isotope records the isotope values from the river drainages at wf1 ranged from 7 2 to 6 1 for ẟ18o and 44 5 to 38 9 for ẟ2h at wf2 they ranged from 7 0 to 5 2 for ẟ18o and from 45 2 to 31 6 for ẟ2h the average ẟ18o values of water from river drainages were 6 6 at wf1 and 6 5 at wf2 the average ẟ2h values were 41 7 at wf1 and 40 1 at wf2 ẟ18o values from the cave waters covary between the two monitoring points considering the analytical uncertainties 0 1 the correlation between isotopic composition of rainfall and river drainages for wf1 is weak and non significant ρ 0 08 p value 0 62 whereas at wf2 the correlation is strong and significant ρ 0 53 p value 0 01 these results are consistent with the idea of higher transmissibility of water that percolates the main drainage of the cave wf2 that is more directly fed by rainfall by conduit porosity while its tributary receives a significant contribution from water from a fissured aquifer that accumulates in the vadose zone in fig 5 this is evident as wf2 values are dispersed in the lmwls susceptible to fractionation processes greater than stored water in the epikarst in response to the fast infiltration also there was a significant correlation at 99 between rainfall amount and the water level inside the cave as well as rainfall and water flow the weekly hydrograph depicted in fig 8 corroborates that the behavior of the flow inside the cave showed an instantaneous response following a precipitation event 4 3 variability of moisture sources in this section the dynamical aspects of moisture transport that characterize the precipitation ẟ18o signature areassessed through wind back trajectory analyses using the hysplit model e g ampuero et al 2020 fiorella et al 2015 in addition composite maps of vertically integrated moisture flux and rainfall anomalies are computed considering each cluster of the back trajectories overall ẟ18o of rainfall showed a stronger correlation with dru r 0 55 p 0 01 than with local precipitation r 0 41 p 0 01 during the monitoring period supplementary material table a 5 in the different seasons the isotopic signature of tropical rainfall is influenced by the origin of air masses moisture source effect villacís et al 2008 the results confirm that air masses that reach the study site represent a combination of large scale moisture transport and local sources fig 9 large scale atmospheric circulation transports moisture originating primarily over the atlantic ocean and passing through the amazon basin following mainly pathways from the northeast east and southeast local moisture sources are mainly associated with mesoscale convective complexes mcc fig 9 from december 2019 to february 2020 local sources associated with cluster 3 c3 are the most important for precipitation at the study site fig 10 d in fact this period was marked by a drought in southern brazil caused by a regional reduction of the moisture flux over the continent and other large scale processes gomes et al 2021 this is also evident in the composite analysis of precipitation which does not show large scale systems organizing convection in c3 and shows pervasive negative precipitation anomalies in the amazon in all clusters fig a 4 northeastern eastern and southeastern sources c1 c4 c5 and c6 also appear but their contributions to precipitation are small moreover dru shows low values throughout this period fig 10d consequently ẟ18o of precipitation during this season was the highest recorded 4 75 supplementary material table a 6 from april to may 2019 the main transport pathways are local represented by c1 and c3 and from the northeast represented by c4 fig 10a as this is a transition period it is expected that rainfall is largely related to mesoscale convective systems mcss moreover composites also show large scale moisture transport from east to west fig a 4 and there is a very high dru value associated with c4 fig 10a convection related to the intertropical convergence zone itcz landward extension and associated upstream rainout along the transport pathway villacís et al 2008 lead to the most negative ẟ18o of rainfall observed during the monitoring 11 73 supplementary material table a 6 from june to august 2019 the most frequent trajectories are local represented by c1 and c3 and from the southeast represented by c2 fig 10b large scale moisture transport from the southeast and east fig a 4 are characterized by a lower depth of the trade winds where the wind speeds decrease conversely dru values of the most important clusters are low hence ẟ18o values of rainfall at the study site are influenced by dru local moisture sources and evapotranspiration over the amazon basin consequently the ẟ18o mean is relatively low 6 12 supplementary material table a 6 the d excess of local rainfall is the highest during this period 14 65 coherent with the moisture flux pathways higher values of d excess 15 occur from july to september peaking in july and august when the frequency of moisture flux originating in the amazon basin is higher compared to the rest of the monitored time series this relationship supports the notion that d excess from the amazon reflects the relative contribution of large scale moisture recycling to precipitation at the study site ampuero et al 2020 finally from september to november 2019 the second transition season the most frequent back trajectories are related to local sources represented by c3 and northeastern sources represented by c4 fig 10b dru values remain low in all clusters under these conditions ẟ18o is relatively low 6 30 supplementary material table a 6 although there are few back trajectories originating in the pacific ocean c3 and c1 significant moisture contributions from the pacific to the study site are not likely under normal conditions as air masses from the pacific reach the andes the orographic lift leads to cooling condensation and rainout over the western slope of the andes once the air masses descend on the eastern side and reach the study site the moisture content is too low to contribute significantly to precipitation in order for water vapor to cross the andes from west to east favorable conditions with anomalously warm sea surface temperature sst in the pacific region linked to the weakening of the trade winds i e el niño events are necessary mayta et al 2018 hence it is unlikely that the pacific is a significant moisture source for the study site during the monitoring period although further monitoring should confirm this hypothesis rainfall during these periods is associated with moisture transport originating over the tropical atlantic mixing with evapotranspiration in the amazon and local moisture 5 conclusions the lmwls of rainfall at the jumandy and ikiam stations plot on top of the gmwl the isotopic composition of precipitation shows a seasonal cycle varying with the moisture transport patterns resulting from a combination of meso and large scale convective systems the isotopic values and the calculated back trajectories confirm that the water vapor precipitating over the cave site presents the lowest δ18o values in austral autumn which reflects the strong convection associated with upstream rainout along the transport pathway originating principally over the landward extension of itcz region the significant recycling of moisture that occurs over the amazon basin influences the isotopic composition of rainfall as indicated by the d excess with maximum values during austral winter these results are consistent with rainfall isotopic values reported by other studies in the region the two dripping sites inside the cave present different discharge characteristics however the isotopic signature of drip water in both sites is similar this means that the isotopic signature of the drip water is buffered within the karst system and the drip water represents a mixture of precipitation from multiple rainfall events it is suggested that the storage time of the water within the epikarst is three weeks typical of caves with shallow epikarst however confirming this hypothesis would require a longer monitoring period on the other hand isotopic values and hydrological response of water from river drainages allow us to conclude that the jumandy cave mainly site wf2 is fed directly by rainfall at a local scale thus the jumandy cave has fractures in the transmission zone that allow the continuous flow of water into the cave and small fissures where the water seeps into the subsoil and trickles into the epikarst uncited references

3308,monitoring studies are necessary to better understand the hydrological processes affecting the isotopic signature of cave waters which are ultimately recorded in speleothems that are used as paleoclimate archives this research examines changes in the isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of precipitation as it infiltrates through the epikarst and into the jumandy cave located in the western amazon basin ecuador meteorological and hydrological parameters were monitored outside and inside the cave and isotope analyses were carried out in waters from rainfall an underground river and drip water at two sampling sites in the cave between april 2019 and february 2020 at monthly timescale the rainfall weighted isotopic composition monitored at our stations was strongly correlated with the mean precipitation amount however when considered at weekly time steps the correlation is only moderate this implies that the variation of the isotopic composition in the study area cannot be interpreted exclusively as an amount effect isotopic values and back trajectory modeling show that the isotopic signature was affected by the moisture source effect associated with upstream rainout the moisture flux is dominantly from an east to northeast direction and moisture mainly originates over the atlantic ocean passing through the amazon basin a significant fraction of moisture is associated with local sources within the amazon basin this aspect is confirmed by d excess values of rainfall and the local meteoric water lines lmwls that indicate an influence of the high evapotranspiration rate of the amazon region on the isotopic composition of local rainfall the infiltrated water resides for about three weeks in the epikarst and then precipitates forming speleothems residence time however this short residence time needs to be confirmed with a longer monitoring period despite the different magnitudes of the dripping rates the isotopic values at the two monitored sites are similar this suggests that the dripping discharge rate is affected by the karst structure but the isotopic signature reflects the mixing of individual rainfall events above the cave therefore ẟ18o in speleothems from these caves is mainly recording short term precipitation changes linked to regional and large scale atmospheric circulation keywords karst stable isotopes paleoclimatic reconstructions amazon amount effect 1 introduction solutes dissolved in percolated water such as calcium carbonate dripping in cave environments allow for the formation of speleothems that grow in layers over time as carbonate precipitates luo et al 2013 as they grow the speleothems retain the isotopic signature of the percolated rainwater within the carbonate layers clark 2015 thereby these structures provide high resolution records capable of retaining the isotope variability of the rainfall at interannual time scale allowing us to reconstruct past climatic variability fairchild et al 2006 fuller et al 2008 matthews et al 2000 rozanski et al 1997 wainer et al 2011 the rainfall isotopic variations in tropical regions result from the combined effect of altitude rainfall amount moisture source and rayleigh distillation gat and matsui 1991 grootes et al 1989 rozanski et al 1993 the altitude effect consists of progressive isotopic depletion due to orographic uplift and condensation of water vapor approximately 2 to 3 of δ18o km gonfiantini et al 2001 as the uplift leads to cooling condensation and preferential removal of the heavier isotopes thereby rendering the remaining water vapor increasingly more depleted in heavy isotopes at higher elevations hurley et al 2016 in tropical south america oxygen isotopic ratios in speleothems are mainly reflecting the degree of rainout upstream associated with rayleigh distillation during transport dansgaard 1964 hence they record changes in monsoon dynamics and convective activity over the amazon basin campos et al 2019 grootes et al 1989 vimeux et al 2005 vuille et al 2012 the amount of precipitation amount effect moquet et al 2016 and changes in moisture source source effect lee et al 2009 the amount effect is dominant in areas close to the moisture source such as in coastal areas craig and gordon 1965 lachniet 2009 in the peruvian amazon and the andes on the other hand the long range transport from source to sink lead to progressive loss of heavy isotopes along the moisture pathway and therefore a stronger imprint of the degree of rainout upstream reflecting large scale monsoon dynamics vimeux et al 2005 vuille et al 2003 vuille et al 2012 on the other hand the source effect dictates the origin and trajectory of an air mass linked to processes of evaporation relative humidity and degree of rainout upstream dru that influence the isotopic signature at the ultimate precipitation site ampuero et al 2020 kanner et al 2013 vimeux et al 2005 vuille and werner 2005 dru refers to the amount of precipitation upstream integrated along the trajectory of an air mass therefore far from the moisture source the isotopic composition of rainfall is not a straightforward function of the local rainout instead it reflects the history of the convective processes that occurred along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway this factor is relevant to the interpretation of isotope records in the andes the isotopic signature measured in the cave drip waters may differ from the one originally observed in rainfall due to multiple processes acting in the soil epikarst and fractures in the transmission zone constantin et al 2018 dhungana and aharon 2019 which have implications to the isotopic signature recorded in the speleothem carbonate dreybrodt and scholz 2011 fairchild et al 2006 cave drip waters reflect a long term weighted mean of the isotopic composition of precipitation chapman et al 1992 moquet et al 2016 williams and fowler 2002 yonge et al 1985 and paleoclimate reconstructions based upon speleothems require adequate calibration as the fractionation processes are site specific duan et al 2016 therefore ensuring a modern understanding of the processes that may alter the isotopic composition in a speleothem is key to calibrate the proxy archive for reconstructing past rainfall variability temperature changes or atmospheric circulation at various timescales cobb et al 2007 dhungana and aharon 2019 lambert and aharon 2010 polk et al 2012 in the amazon basin the study of climate controls on isotopic variability and how they related to hydroclimate and atmospheric circulation are limited the few existing studies indicate that over continental areas dru explains a significant fraction of the observed variance in the isotopic composition of rainfall on weekly to monthly timescales ampuero et al 2020 della libera et al 2022 kanner et al 2013 villacís et al 2008 vimeux et al 2005 vuille and werner 2005 in contrast the meaning of the speleothem isotope records from areas covered by amazon forest at the andes foothills is not fully understood cheng et al 2013 mosblech et al 2012 a more recent study has attributed the differences in δ18o variability across the basin to be a function of the relative contribution from local recycled moisture from evapotranspiration versus transported moisture from distal sources in the tropical atlantic where the first source dominates over areas in the western amazon wang et al 2017 mosblech et al 2012 performed a paleoclimate study over the last 100 kyrs using four stalagmites from santiago cave ecuadorian amazon and established that the past recorded history of rainfall in this part of the amazon was controlled by the north atlantic oscillation nao however since this study was not calibrated with local information does not account for the possible influence of other regional and local effects the present study seeks to analyze the relationship between isotopic variability in modern rainfall drip water and water from river drainages inside the jumandy cave located in the westernmost part of the amazon river basin the results of a weekly monitoring program are reported for the period from april 2019 to february 2020 and compared with meteorological variables and the transport history of air masses to determine the most relevant controls on the isotopic signature of rainfall this investigation allows for a more detailed understanding of the cave environment and provides a reference to calibrate paleoclimate studies in this region 2 study area two rainfall collecting sites were surveyed for isotopic analysis one at universidad regional amazónica ikiam represented as ikiam station 0 57 s 77 51 w 610 m and the other at the jumandy cave entrance referred to as jumandy station 0 52 s 77 47 w 650 m located in western amazon basin in the napo province ecuador fig 1 the cave lies in the napo formation which consists of cretaceous marine limestones interbedded with shales that were uplifted during the cenozoic estupiñan et al 2010 hoorn et al 2010 limestone formations cover about 5 10 of ecuador s surface area 283 560 km2 and their outcrops lead to the formation of karst aquifers mostly in the amazon basin constantin et al 2018 the jumandy cave was formed by the dissolution of the 70 90 million year old limestones that belong to the napo karst system sánchez et al 2017 the cave has a length of 2 km and has a narrow entrance of 2 m that connects to several branches and an underground river called lluya yaku that flows permanently inside the cave bauz and mena 2015 the monitoring took place at 550 and 1500 m distance from the cave entrance respectively fig 2 the average thickness of the epikarst is 8 6 m and the strata that constitute the vadose zone are unconsolidated material limestone rocks highly fractured limestone rocks and limestone bedrock rivera 2022 climatological information recorded at archidona station 0 55 s 77 49 w at 2 6 km distance from the study area from 2001 to 2014 indicates a mean annual precipitation and temperature of 4091 mm and 23 9 c respectively this region is close to the equator therefore it receives more of its precipitation associated with the annual march of convective activity over the site which occurs twice a year in march to may espinoza et al 2009 the percentage of annual precipitation recorded in austral winter june july august jja and spring september october november son was 27 and 23 respectively the lowest precipitation amount 20 fell in austral summer december january february djf with minimum of 233 mm month recorded in january and the highest precipitation 29 in autumn march april may mam the precipitation is quite equally distributed around the year as one would expect for a site located so close to the equator the mean annual cycle of air temperature in the amazon basin shows that highest temperatures are reached ahead of the rainy season once convective cloud cover builds up during the rainy season the surface receipt of solar radiation is reduced thereby lowering temperature at the surface garreaud et al 2009 3 methods due to the coronavirus pandemic covid 19 the study was interrupted from march to december 2020 and was resumed in january 2021 there is a four week gap included in the monitoring period due to bad weather conditions and a national protest in ecuador in october 2019 in the weeks where sampling did not occur the drip volume and the isotopic composition were accumulated for 15 days the weekly relative drip rate was then determined based on the drip volume and the monitoring time the drip water isotopic data were plotted on the local meteoric water line lmwl and global meteoric water line gmwl which indicated that there is no significant difference between the isotopic signature accumulated during 15 and 7 days no outliers were discarded as they were considered representing reasonable observations of an unusual climatic situation the statistical procedures applied were 1 spearman correlation ρ to detect significant relationships between the meteorologic and isotopic variables this coefficient was considered because it is range based and robust to the influence of outliers 2 simple linear regression to build the lmwls 3 anova to compare the regression lines lmwls and detect if there are significant differences between the intercepts and slopes 3 1 monitoring outside the cave rainwater samples were collected weekly 42 weeks for isotopic analyses employing two rain gauges located at ikiam and jumandy stations following the protocols of iaea wmo 2014 https www iaea org the rain gauges consisted of a funnel connected to a 4 l tank placed inside a reflective white box to avoid thermal changes that could lead to evaporation and isotopic fractionation during rainfall collection the water from the tank was mixed and stored in 60 ml air tight amber glass bottles avoiding air bubbles the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c prior to isotopic analysis the meteorological variables were recorded with an automatic meteorological station at the ikiam site https meteorologia ikiam edu ec and a data logging rain gauge rg3 m with a calibration accuracy of 1 0 0 2 mm measurement increments installed above the jumandy station the variables recorded were precipitation air temperature and relative humidity 3 2 cave monitoring the drip water gauges dw1 and dw2 were installed inside the jumandy cave following the methodology described by dhungana and aharon 2019 each gauge consists of a funnel of 0 1 m diameter connected directly to a 1 l hermetic plastic bag that stores the percolating water from an active stalactite water from cave drainage was collected at two locations as depicted in fig 2 wf1 and wf2 to compare the isotopic composition in the main drainage and its tributary the samples were collected weekly in amber glass bottles of 60 ml sealed without headspace and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis two onset hobo pro v2 data loggers accuracy 0 21 c from 0 to 50 c resolution 0 02 c at 25 c were installed at 300 and 1500 m distance from the entrance of the cave to measure the air temperature and relative humidity every 10 min to check the climate variability in the cave fig 2 these records were converted to weekly averages to match the temporal resolution of the isotopic water sampling to determine the dripping discharge rates for the speleothems and investigate the flow characteristics of the water that infiltrates in the epikarst the time it takes to fill a known volume was calculated weekly also the water level of the river inside the cave was measured to determine the water fluctuation in real time using the hobo u20l water level data logger resolution 0 014 kpa the water level h was used to calculate the flow or runoff q within the cave applying the q h curve on a daily time scale 3 3 stable isotope analysis the isotopic composition of 252 water samples was analyzed for hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o in rainfall n 84 drip water n 84 and cave drainage n 84 samples with solid debris were sifted with a 0 45 µm mesh diameter cellulose filter the analysis was conducted in the laboratorio nacional de referencia del agua lnra at the universidad regional amazónica ikiam using laser spectroscopy los gatos research lwia 45 ep water samples were processed according to iaea wmo 2014 protocols with standards obtained at different heights within ecuador the standards used in the study were validated by iaea and are listed in supplementary material table a 1 results are expressed in parts per mil relative to the international isotopic measurement standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow with an analytical precision of 0 1 for δ18o and 0 3 in the case of δ2h the monthly weighted average for precipitation and deuterium excess were also calculated supplementary material text a 2 3 4 back trajectory model seven day air parcel back trajectories were computed with the hysplit 5 1 model hybrid single parcel lagrangian integrated trajectory 5 1 rolph et al 2017 stein et al 2015 using era 5 data on pressure levels hersbach et al 2018a and at the surface hersbach et al 2018b in 0 75 x 0 75 resolution 80 km back trajectories were initiated at the ikiam station at the height of 1000 m above ground level 730 hpa within the lower atmospheric layer where the most significant moisture transport to the study site takes place they were simulated once a day over the monitoring period accounting only for the back trajectories that initiate on precipitation days at the ikiam station although this period is too short to describe the climatology we consider it appropriate to illustrate the source variability during the observation period for more details about the calculations see supplementary material text a 3 due to the proximity of the monitoring stations about 10 km back trajectory simulations are performed only at the ikiam station as computations at jumandy station would lead to very similar results to obtain the representative patterns of the back trajectories and assess their frequency and timing a cluster analysis was performed the hierarchical clustering analysis algorithm with squared euclidean distance from the hysplit was applied to further assess these results we compared the clusters with composites of the regional anomalies of precipitation and vertically integrated moisture flux 3 5 degree of rainout upstream dru precipitation along the moisture transport pathway often referred to as degree of rainout upstream dru is a major control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in continental locations where precipitation results from large scale moisture transport we estimated dru by pairing gpm daily precipitation with the calculated back trajectories and accumulated precipitation along the back trajectory up to the monitoring site only precipitation over the continent was considered to compare dru with the isotopic data we calculated weighted mean values using the local precipitation amount observed at the ikiam station thereby we account more accurately for the contribution of each precipitation event with a unique dru value to the monitored isotopic signature of precipitation 4 results and discussion 4 1 isotopic composition of rainfall the meteorological variables and isotopic composition of rainfall recorded at jumandy and ikiam stations indicate that they behave very similarly as they fluctuated mostly in phase on a weekly basis fig 3 the ẟ2h and ẟ18o of precipitation are closely correlated ρ 0 99 p value 0 01 at both stations the isotopic rainfall samples ranged from 16 9 to 1 0 for ẟ18o and from 124 1 to 17 8 for ẟ2h at jumandy station and from 16 5 to 0 3 for ẟ18o and from 122 8 to 10 8 for ẟ2h at the ikiam station the mean ẟ18o and ẟ2h values at jumandy station were 6 4 and 38 3 respectively whereas at ikiam station they were 5 8 and 34 2 fig 3c and d monthly values of ẟ18o at ikiam and jumandy stations were estimated through means weighted by the amount of rainfall the depleted monthly ẟ18o values at ikiam and jumandy stations coincide with the highest precipitation amounts fig 4 the ẟ18o timeseries at the study site were compared with two nearby sites in the amazon basin available in the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip database hosted within the iaea fig 4b and with data from two independent studies iaea stations included were manaus 3 70 s 60 10 w data from 1965 to 1999 and iquitos 3 49 s 73 22 w data from 2006 to 2012 located in brazil and peru respectively the other records were published as part of a study conducted by ampuero et al 2020 from 2012 to 2018 at the palestina station 5 92 s 77 35 w in the peruvian amazon and a stable isotopes study carried out by souza et al 2015 from 2008 to 2009 in the urucu oil province 4 52 s 65 18 w in the brazilian amazon the mean δ18o value from the palestina station 6 59 urucu 6 36 and iquitos gnip station 5 72 feature similar values as ikiam 5 7 and jumandy 6 3 stations on the other hand the most eastern station is characterized by less depleted values manaus 4 07 due to a shorter distance to the moisture source in the atlantic reduced rayleigh fractionation the most negative values are recorded in the periods of march june and october december fig 4b the anova results show that the means of the isotopic values were similar between all stations and the information reported in this study f 1 32 p value 0 269 this means that despite the difference in the monitoring time the seasonality of the monthly mean isotopic composition did not change for jumandy station the ẟ18o and ẟ2h values of rainfall display a moderate negative correlation with the weekly precipitation amount significant at the 95 level ρ 0 39 and ρ 0 38 respectively table 1 in comparison a higher correlation significant at 99 level is observed between ẟ18o and ẟ2h values with precipitation accumulation at ikiam station ρ 0 51 and ρ 0 50 respectively table 1 the rainfall amount effect is more strongly observed on monthly intra seasonal or interannual time scales than in weeks days or hours risi et al 2008 rozanski et al 1993 in the jumandy cave the correlation of rainfall amount and isotopic data taken at weekly timescales explained 15 of the variance however when the temporal weighting for the isotopes of precipitation shifted from weekly to monthly values the correlation increased ρ 0 65 p value 0 03 which means that 42 of the variance was explained in a study carried out at cajas in the southwest of ecuador a moderate correlation between ẟ18o and rainfall amount on a weekly scale r 0 37 p value 0 01 and a strong one a monthly scale r 0 60 p value 0 01 were found esquivel hernández et al 2019 this large unexplained variance in the short term variations is a consequence of processes that were omitted in the regression analysis such as convection cloud microphysics cloud types and humidity transport that affect the isotopic composition of rainfall aggarwal et al 2016 hastenrath 1997 these processes are included when calculating monthly means despite not being directly controlled by rainfall amount but by factors mentioned above hoffmann 2003 villacís et al 2008 vimeux et al 2005 therefore the weekly monitoring scale of this study allows for a better perspective of the physical convective processes that influence the isotopic signature compared to those accumulated over periods of months the parameters that control the rainfall isotopic composition in tropical areas have not been fully understood due to the limited spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the available data hoffmann 2003 vuille 2018 the amount effect is expected to be significant in places closer to the moisture source as long as no long range transport has occurred studies carried out in the tropics munksgaard et al 2019 especially those performed in south america gastmans et al 2017 salati et al 1979 souza et al 2015 vimeux et al 2005 including the amazon basin in ecuador windhorst et al 2013 show that isotopic variability is associated primarily with regional rather than local upstream convective activity consequently ẟ18o values in this study site are not solely controlled by the amount effect but by moisture source effects and the transport history condensation rainout and mixing with air masses that have undergone evapotranspiration of air masses wang et al 2017 the ẟ18o values did not increase when precipitation declined at the end of rainy season during the first and second week of june when the ẟ18o values remained very negative reaching values of 16 7 and 13 6 even though rainfall remained below 100 mm one explanation for these values is that at the end of the rainy season precipitation is fueled by moisture that is very depleted in 18o reflecting the end of intense convection upstream over the amazon basin this delayed effect was documented over the peruvian andes by hurley et al 2015 hence at the end of the rainy season highly depleted moisture produces lighter than expected ẟ18o values even for small accumulation events there is a weak negative correlation between the ẟ18o values of rainfall and air temperature t and relative humidity rh both at jumandy station t ρ 0 02 rh ρ 0 12 and ikiam station t ρ 0 05 rh ρ 0 04 none of these correlations are significant at the 95 level table 1 this indicates that the temperature effect does not influence the ẟ18o variations of the local rainfall on short timescales which is consistent with previous studies in the andes vuille et al 2003 hardy et al 2003 the study site experiences a mean annual temperature of 23 c that increases by 1 c in august and september therefore the lack of a significant temperature relationship is entirely consistent with its very low seasonal amplitude also there was no correlation significant at the 95 level between weekly d excess and temperature at jumandy station ρ 0 19 table 1 but there was a moderate correlation significant at the 99 level between d excess and temperature at ikiam station ρ 0 45 table 1 this means that the seasonal temperature variation in the study area is just too low to imprint any significant isotope effect in rainfall but it could leave an imprint in the d excess however the monitoring time is too short to draw any firm conclusions the monthly precipitation weighted isotopic values were used to construct the lmwls which were plotted together with the gmwl fig 5 the lmwl of jumandy and ikiam stations are ẟ2h 8 30 0 10 ẟ18o 14 64 0 33 n 42 and ẟ2h 8 33 0 20 ẟ18o 14 65 1 28 n 42 respectively the slopes of the lmwls from jumandy station 8 30 and the ikiam station 8 33 overlap and are consistent with the gmwl slope 8 0 the lmwls intersections of jumandy station 14 64 and the ikiam station 14 65 are higher than the global average value of 10 fig 5 in comparison the lmwls from other nearby places in the amazon basin were ẟ2h 8 40 ẟ18o 16 74 for palestina station ẟ2h 8 50 ẟ18o 13 65 for iquitos ẟ2h 7 96 ẟ18o 10 25 for urucu and ẟ2h 8 14 ẟ18o 12 96 for manaus station the intercept values from the lmwls d excess presented here are slightly above of the range of 9 80 to 14 60 proposed by salati et al 1979 as typical values in precipitation resulting from air masses that cross the amazon it can be attributed to the reduced recycling and to secondary processes of re evaporation and mixing of air masses that move across the amazon and precipitate in the local area dhungana and aharon 2019 rozanski et al 1993 a study conducted by staal et al 2018 established that 32 of rainfall over the amazon basin is produced by total evapotranspiration the amazon rainforest reintroduces heavy isotopes into the atmospheric vapor recycled moisture where ẟ18o values of these air masses are thereby enriched in heavy isotopes gat and matsui 1991 martinelli et al 1996 villacís et al 2008 d excess allows evaluating the extent of moisture recycling araguás araguás et al 2000 froehlich et al 2002 gat and matsui 1991 salati et al 1979 at jumandy station the monthly average values of d excess during the monitoring period was 12 7 the highest monthly values were measured from july to september 13 9 15 6 and 14 8 the lowest values were measured from april to may 10 7 and 11 0 and from december to january 9 8 and 10 9 4 2 stable isotopic composition of cave drip waters the ẟ18o drip water values ranged from 6 8 to 6 3 for dw1 and from 6 9 to 6 3 for dw2 the ẟ2h ranged from 41 9 to 40 3 for dw1 and from 42 6 to 40 6 for dw2 the average value of weekly ẟ18o drip water was 6 6 and 6 7 for the sites dw1 and dw2 respectively while the values of ẟ2h were 41 0 and 41 6 for dw1 and dw2 respectively this average difference of 0 1 for ẟ18o is on the order of the analytical precision while the ẟ2h is higher 0 5 this indicates that there were no strong local effects altering the ẟ18o signature between the two monitoring sites the reasonable variability of mean values together with the low amplitude of ẟ18o and ẟ2h values for drip water values eliminates the possibility of strong evaporation of meteoric water along with the percolation of the water inside the cave therefore it is likely that the o18 values of precipitation are well preserved in the drips that precipitate and form speleothems the discharge characteristics differ at the two monitoring dripping sites dw1 and dw2 within the same cave the dripping discharge rate ranged from 3 66 to 11 60 ml h for dw1 at dripping site 1 fig 6 and from 6 07 to 6 97 ml h for dw2 at dripping site 2 fig 7 and the average rate collected weekly was 7 71 and 6 56 ml h respectively at dw1 rainfall measurements recorded a peak in the last week of may fig 6a which is reflected three weeks later in the depleted ẟ18o drip water values fig 6b likewise in the first week of june precipitation decreases and three weeks later an increase of ẟ18o drip water values is observed fig 6c atdw2 the correspondence between the increase in precipitation during the last week of may and the depletion of ẟ18o in the first week of june is more clearly observed fig 7 the slightly inverse response three weeks after each event indicates a negative correlation between the two parameters the behavior of dripping water is related to the intensity of the events since after an intense event part of the water infiltrates and the rest contributes to runoff if these events are repetitive the water saturates the epikarst favoring infiltration this is what happens in the jumandy cave mainly at dw2 where the drip volume responds relatively quickly in a way that is typical of caves with a shallow epikarst the average epikarst is 8 6 m and the strata that constitute the vadose zone consist of unconsolidated material limestone rocks highly fractured limestone rocks and limestone bedrock rivera 2022 the cave is located in a tropical zone characterized by the presence of organic matter over the cave and high amounts of precipitation which means that there is a high dissolution of the carbonate rocks that favor the conduits and fractures exist that allow a fast flow of water in the karst hu et al 2015 maloszewski et al 2002 the discharge rates in both sites varied because after a precipitation event the hydraulic head increases within the karst where the drip volume is dampened and redistributed due to the complexity of the karstic system tooth and fairchild 2003 the ẟ18o and ẟ2h values for drip water compared to the rainfall signature figs 6 and 7 and drip water values plotted over the lmwls fig 5 confirms water and therefore isotopic mixing in the epikarst this result was expected because the drip water isotopic signature results from multiple precipitation events that supply water that is mixed within the epikarst bar matthews et al 1996 cruz et al 2005 caves with a shallow epikarst are generally ideal for high resolution paleoclimatic studies since the water infiltrated into the soil and vadose zone experiences shorter residence times cruz et al 2009 strikis et al 2011 the d excess is a useful parameter to check if evaporation is occurring as water percolates through a karst aquifer dansgaard 1964 the d excess of drip water ranged from 9 8 to 13 3 at dw1 and from 10 0 to 13 5 at dw2 the average values of d excess were 11 6 and 11 8 similar to the rainfall values of ikiam and jumandy stations fig 3e which indicates absence of evaporation during water seepage through the soil and epikarst evaporation within the cave associated with low relative humidity could also affect the d excess measured in the drip water however evaporation is negligible in jumandy cave where temperature fluctuations are minimal year round ranging from 22 46 to 22 82 c at site 1 and from 22 58 to 23 13 c at site 2 and relative humidity always remained at 100 it also indicates optimal conditions for paleoclimatic studies based on speleothem isotope records the isotope values from the river drainages at wf1 ranged from 7 2 to 6 1 for ẟ18o and 44 5 to 38 9 for ẟ2h at wf2 they ranged from 7 0 to 5 2 for ẟ18o and from 45 2 to 31 6 for ẟ2h the average ẟ18o values of water from river drainages were 6 6 at wf1 and 6 5 at wf2 the average ẟ2h values were 41 7 at wf1 and 40 1 at wf2 ẟ18o values from the cave waters covary between the two monitoring points considering the analytical uncertainties 0 1 the correlation between isotopic composition of rainfall and river drainages for wf1 is weak and non significant ρ 0 08 p value 0 62 whereas at wf2 the correlation is strong and significant ρ 0 53 p value 0 01 these results are consistent with the idea of higher transmissibility of water that percolates the main drainage of the cave wf2 that is more directly fed by rainfall by conduit porosity while its tributary receives a significant contribution from water from a fissured aquifer that accumulates in the vadose zone in fig 5 this is evident as wf2 values are dispersed in the lmwls susceptible to fractionation processes greater than stored water in the epikarst in response to the fast infiltration also there was a significant correlation at 99 between rainfall amount and the water level inside the cave as well as rainfall and water flow the weekly hydrograph depicted in fig 8 corroborates that the behavior of the flow inside the cave showed an instantaneous response following a precipitation event 4 3 variability of moisture sources in this section the dynamical aspects of moisture transport that characterize the precipitation ẟ18o signature areassessed through wind back trajectory analyses using the hysplit model e g ampuero et al 2020 fiorella et al 2015 in addition composite maps of vertically integrated moisture flux and rainfall anomalies are computed considering each cluster of the back trajectories overall ẟ18o of rainfall showed a stronger correlation with dru r 0 55 p 0 01 than with local precipitation r 0 41 p 0 01 during the monitoring period supplementary material table a 5 in the different seasons the isotopic signature of tropical rainfall is influenced by the origin of air masses moisture source effect villacís et al 2008 the results confirm that air masses that reach the study site represent a combination of large scale moisture transport and local sources fig 9 large scale atmospheric circulation transports moisture originating primarily over the atlantic ocean and passing through the amazon basin following mainly pathways from the northeast east and southeast local moisture sources are mainly associated with mesoscale convective complexes mcc fig 9 from december 2019 to february 2020 local sources associated with cluster 3 c3 are the most important for precipitation at the study site fig 10 d in fact this period was marked by a drought in southern brazil caused by a regional reduction of the moisture flux over the continent and other large scale processes gomes et al 2021 this is also evident in the composite analysis of precipitation which does not show large scale systems organizing convection in c3 and shows pervasive negative precipitation anomalies in the amazon in all clusters fig a 4 northeastern eastern and southeastern sources c1 c4 c5 and c6 also appear but their contributions to precipitation are small moreover dru shows low values throughout this period fig 10d consequently ẟ18o of precipitation during this season was the highest recorded 4 75 supplementary material table a 6 from april to may 2019 the main transport pathways are local represented by c1 and c3 and from the northeast represented by c4 fig 10a as this is a transition period it is expected that rainfall is largely related to mesoscale convective systems mcss moreover composites also show large scale moisture transport from east to west fig a 4 and there is a very high dru value associated with c4 fig 10a convection related to the intertropical convergence zone itcz landward extension and associated upstream rainout along the transport pathway villacís et al 2008 lead to the most negative ẟ18o of rainfall observed during the monitoring 11 73 supplementary material table a 6 from june to august 2019 the most frequent trajectories are local represented by c1 and c3 and from the southeast represented by c2 fig 10b large scale moisture transport from the southeast and east fig a 4 are characterized by a lower depth of the trade winds where the wind speeds decrease conversely dru values of the most important clusters are low hence ẟ18o values of rainfall at the study site are influenced by dru local moisture sources and evapotranspiration over the amazon basin consequently the ẟ18o mean is relatively low 6 12 supplementary material table a 6 the d excess of local rainfall is the highest during this period 14 65 coherent with the moisture flux pathways higher values of d excess 15 occur from july to september peaking in july and august when the frequency of moisture flux originating in the amazon basin is higher compared to the rest of the monitored time series this relationship supports the notion that d excess from the amazon reflects the relative contribution of large scale moisture recycling to precipitation at the study site ampuero et al 2020 finally from september to november 2019 the second transition season the most frequent back trajectories are related to local sources represented by c3 and northeastern sources represented by c4 fig 10b dru values remain low in all clusters under these conditions ẟ18o is relatively low 6 30 supplementary material table a 6 although there are few back trajectories originating in the pacific ocean c3 and c1 significant moisture contributions from the pacific to the study site are not likely under normal conditions as air masses from the pacific reach the andes the orographic lift leads to cooling condensation and rainout over the western slope of the andes once the air masses descend on the eastern side and reach the study site the moisture content is too low to contribute significantly to precipitation in order for water vapor to cross the andes from west to east favorable conditions with anomalously warm sea surface temperature sst in the pacific region linked to the weakening of the trade winds i e el niño events are necessary mayta et al 2018 hence it is unlikely that the pacific is a significant moisture source for the study site during the monitoring period although further monitoring should confirm this hypothesis rainfall during these periods is associated with moisture transport originating over the tropical atlantic mixing with evapotranspiration in the amazon and local moisture 5 conclusions the lmwls of rainfall at the jumandy and ikiam stations plot on top of the gmwl the isotopic composition of precipitation shows a seasonal cycle varying with the moisture transport patterns resulting from a combination of meso and large scale convective systems the isotopic values and the calculated back trajectories confirm that the water vapor precipitating over the cave site presents the lowest δ18o values in austral autumn which reflects the strong convection associated with upstream rainout along the transport pathway originating principally over the landward extension of itcz region the significant recycling of moisture that occurs over the amazon basin influences the isotopic composition of rainfall as indicated by the d excess with maximum values during austral winter these results are consistent with rainfall isotopic values reported by other studies in the region the two dripping sites inside the cave present different discharge characteristics however the isotopic signature of drip water in both sites is similar this means that the isotopic signature of the drip water is buffered within the karst system and the drip water represents a mixture of precipitation from multiple rainfall events it is suggested that the storage time of the water within the epikarst is three weeks typical of caves with shallow epikarst however confirming this hypothesis would require a longer monitoring period on the other hand isotopic values and hydrological response of water from river drainages allow us to conclude that the jumandy cave mainly site wf2 is fed directly by rainfall at a local scale thus the jumandy cave has fractures in the transmission zone that allow the continuous flow of water into the cave and small fissures where the water seeps into the subsoil and trickles into the epikarst uncited references

3309,for areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river system the allocation pattern of water interchange between the groundwater and the lakes and rivers as well as its temporal variations under year scale climate changes are important issues in regard to water resources and ecology environment but are rarely revealed this study presented a numerical groundwater modeling of the poyang lake area to reveal the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and to assess the potential effects of year scale climate on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges into rivers and lake it is found that the monthly groundwater discharge into surface water exhibits significant temporal variability which reveals an inverse correlation between monthly groundwater discharge and lake water levels and precipitation amounts rainy months can lead to groundwater recharge from the poyang lake our simulated results reveal that in the dry year of 2018 the variable monthly groundwater discharge into poyang lake and the monthly groundwater recharge from poyang lake were 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month and 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month respectively additionally the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the poyang lake was 9 44 108 m3 year and the annual net groundwater discharge into poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year however the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the five rivers only features groundwater discharge into rivers with variable monthly groundwater discharge into the five rivers of 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and an annual total groundwater discharge amount of 5 32 108 m3 year in 2018 additionally our water interchange results of the rainy year of 2010 indicate that the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the poyang lake was 22 74 108 m3 year the annual net groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 1 26 108 m3 year and the annual groundwater discharge into the five rivers was 8 10 108 m3 year these comparisons between the results of the rainy year of 2010 and dry year of 2018 can reveal the effects of the year scale climate on water exchange between groundwater and surface water and imply that a rainy year can increase the total water interchange amount but decrease the total net groundwater discharge into surface water and that groundwater is more likely to discharge into rivers during a rainy year furthermore it is found that a rainy year can significantly alter the spatial distribution of the water interchange between groundwater and lake water and that the backward particle tracking simulation could be helpful in regard to identifying the spatial distribution of water exchange between groundwater and regional scale lake these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on the spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water in regional floodplain lake areas and provide useful information for the evaluation of local water resources and the estimation of pollutant transportation keywords regional great lake groundwater surface water interchange numerical modeling temporal variability flow path poyang lake 1 introduction water interchange between groundwater and surface water occurs almost everywhere particularly in riparian regions lacustrine areas wetlands estuaries coastal zones etc along with this water interchange anthropogenic pollutants are also transported between groundwater and surface waters and these can pollute water resources thus affecting the health of the near shore ecological environment and making it impossible to use water resources directly for drinking water and industrial applications panagopoulos 2021a 2021b 2022 pontér et al 2021 robinson 2015 stoliker et al 2016 thus water interchange between groundwater and surface water is always an important issue in regard to water recharge discharge water quality and the ecological environment of a natural system brunner et al 2017 guevara ochoa et al 2020b jolly et al 2008 kalbus et al 2006 schwerdtfeger et al 2016 sophocleous 2002 identifying the water interchange patterns such as the dominant controlling factors interchange flux and its temporal variation and flow path is essential for the reasonable management of water resources and protection of the water environment numerous methods have been investigated to identify the water interchange between groundwater and surface water direct measurements by using seepage meters can quantify the water exchange flux at specific sites cherkauer and carlson 1997 debnath and mukherjee 2016 duque et al 2020 the approach of temperature monitoring such as distributed fiber optic temperature sensors that is based on the temperature difference between groundwater and surface water can identify the occurring area and flow direction of the water interchange hare et al 2015 mccobb et al 2018 mwakanyamale et al 2012 darcy s law can also be applied to assess the direction and flux rate of water interchange based on the water level and hydraulic conductivity bouchez et al 2021 the water balance method is an essential approach for quantifying the water exchange in a regional watershed system langston et al 2013 li et al 2020 additionally tracers including conservative tracers such as cl stable isotopes such as 18o and 2h and radioactive isotopes such as rn and ra are key tools for understanding groundwater and surface water interactions at different scales jafari et al 2021a yang et al 2021 compared to the above methods numerical modeling has been regarded as an appealing tool for systematically interpreting and quantifying the water interchange and its spatial temporal variability at a regional scale certain integrated modelling approaches that include completely coupled models such as hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and loosely coupled models such as gsflow markstrom et al 2008 and swat modflow bailey et al 2016 have been developed to facilitate modeling of water interaction between groundwater and surface water however it is difficult to apply the integrated model to a regional scale area due to the limited available data regarding soil properties and land use barthel and banzhaf 2016 guevara ochoa et al 2020b as a modularized model modflow has been extended into more than just a groundwater flow model harbaugh 2005 brunner et al 2010 examined the accuracy of simulating surface water groundwater interactions using stream package of modflow and provided some guidance regarding its application modflow has been previously applied to water interaction studies fan et al 2007 karki et al 2021 matusiak et al 2021 pulido velazquez et al 2012 rahimi et al 2015 shope et al 2012 wöhling et al 2018 the majority of the previous studies about spatial temporal variations of groundwater surface water interactions have primarily focused on aquifer river water interactions dibaj et al 2021 guevara ochoa et al 2020a jafari et al 2021b kurylyk et al 2014 saha et al 2017 schilling et al 2021 scibek et al 2007 sterte et al 2018 tian et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and aquifer lake water interactions elsawwaf et al 2014 kim et al 2020 smerdon et al 2007 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 xu et al 2021 yihdego et al 2016 however for watershed scale areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lake and complex river system previous studies about groundwater surface water interaction are less and generally take the water interchanges of groundwater with lake and river as a whole without considering the difference of the temporal variation pattern of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and without considering the allocation pattern of groundwater discharges into rivers and lakes ala aho et al 2013 li et al 2019 nixdorf 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 additionally knowledge regarding how climate affects the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into rivers and lakes remains unrevealed these temporal spatial variations of water interchange and net groundwater discharge as well as its allocations in riparian and lacustrine areas could determine the changes in water resources and chemicals transportation in such regional lake river aquifer systems the poyang lake area is a typical watershed scale area possessing both regional scale floodplain lake the poyang lake and complex river systems five rivers including the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers fig 1 a the poyang lake features dramatic variations in water level and area and is the confluence terminal of these five rivers and it plays a key role in floodwater storage and is an internationally recognized habitat for wintering migratory birds it has been reported that the poyang lake area has suffered serious ecological and environmental problems such as drought wetland degradation and water eutrophication jiang et al 2020 liao et al 2018 mao et al 2021a 2021b qi et al 2017 soldatova et al 2017 ye et al 2011 it is traditionally believed that the lake water amount and its variation are primarily controlled by recharge from the five rivers and by discharge into the yangtze river hu et al 2007 li et al 2017 li and zhang 2018 shankman et al 2006 however the groundwater flux still accounts for a certain proportion of the poyang lake water amount li et al 2020 additionally an investigation revealed that the shallow groundwater of the poyang lake area was characterized by a high concentration of nitrogen compounds soldatova et al 2017 that could potentially affect lake water quality neglecting the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the surface water including poyang lake and the five rivers could lead to errors in the lake water balance calculation and underestimate chemicals transportation between the aquifer and lake thus quantifying the water interchange and its temporal dynamics is vital according to our literature research studies including numerical modeling water balance calculations and stable or radioactive isotope investigations have been conducted to quantificationally investigate the water interaction between groundwater and the poyang lake for instance by using numerical groundwater flow modeling lan 2016 simulated the groundwater flow of ganjiang river delta in the western poyang lake and derived the discharge rate from aquifer to the poyang lake with an annual averaged value of 1 42 m3 s between the years of 2003 2010 yang et al 2019 also conducted a three dimensional 3d numerical groundwater flow model of the ganjiang river delta and noted that groundwater was primarily discharged into surface water in nearshore areas but did not derive the results of the discharge flux and its temporal dynamics for the poyang lake region that includes the lake area and its five main tributary rivers nixdorf 2019 simulated the total amount of groundwater discharges into the poyang lake as 85 69 m3 s during high lake level period september 2000 with a median groundwater velocity of 0 51 m d and 38 76 m3 s during low lake level period december 1999 with a median groundwater velocity of 0 23 m d using the darcy s law li et al 2019 investigated the hydraulic interactions between wetland groundwater and seasonal variable surface water in a local small area in the downstream region of the xiushui river and they derived the groundwater discharge rates into xiushui river and banghu lake i e an isolated lake nearby the poyang lake with darcy velocities of less than 0 4 m d and less than 0 1 m d respectively using the water balance method li et al 2020 analyzed the lake groundwater exchange fluxes for year of 2014 in addition to modeling and water balance methods isotope tracers such as 2h 18o radon and radium isotopes are also increasingly popular tools for identifying the occurrence area of water interaction and quantifying the hydraulic interaction amount for this regional scale lake zhan et al 2016 conducted an isotopic study and illustrated that the poyang lake was primarily recharged by the five rivers and that the water exchange between groundwater and lake water primarily occurred at the narrow northern end of the poyang lake using the radium and stable isotopes 2h and 18o liao et al 2020a 2020b identified the dominant groundwater discharge sources and estimated the groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake as 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d at the dry season november 2016 this estimated groundwater discharge flux was more than 9 fold greater than the estimating results of nixdorf 2019 i e 38 76 m3 s in december 1999 these results regarding the water interchange rates between groundwater and the poyang lake indicate that the water interchange in such a regional scale aquifer lake system is characterized by temporal or spatial variability however these qualitative and quantitative studies did not reveal the differences in spatial temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and there is still little knowledge regarding the effects of inter year climate change on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into the river and into poyang lake taking the poyang lake area as an example this study conducts a numerical groundwater flow model to simulate the temporal variations of the water interaction between groundwater and rivers and lake the specific objectives of this modeling work are to reveal the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and to assess the potential effects of the year scale climate on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges into rivers and lake the results of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of climate conditions on the spatial temporal variability of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water in regional floodplain lake areas and will also provide useful information for the evaluation of local water resources and the estimation of pollutant transportation 2 description of the study area the poyang lake is located in the northern portion of jiangxi province southeastern china this lake possesses a catchment area of 162200 km2 and is typically recharged from five tributaries that generally flow from south to north and maintain an obvious hydraulic connection with the yangtze river in the north fig 1a the lake area and water amount of the poyang lake markedly change during a hydrologic year due to the monthly variations in the streamflow fluxes from the five tributaries due to effects resulting from the dramatic temporal changes in streamflow it has been reported that the largest historical lake area and water volume were approximately 4070 km2 and 34 billion m3 respectively during the highest lake water level period with a level value of 22 59 m july 31 1998 at the hukou hydrology station during the lowest lake water level period with a level value of 5 9 m february 6 1963 at the hukou hydrology station the lake area and water volume were only approximately 146 km2 and 450 million m3 and represented only a narrow meandering waterway in the poyang lake qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2016 in our study the low lying alluvial lacustrine plain with a total area of 13023 km2 including the lake region and its five tributaries that is featured with quaternary unconsolidated sediments was selected as our study area fig 1a the topography of our study area varies from upstream hills to downstream alluvial lacustrine plain surrounding the lake at elevations of less than 15 m the climate of the poyang lake region is featured with subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation and evaporation of 1400 2400 mm and 800 1200 mm respectively mao et al 2021a wang et al 2014 additionally the annual precipitation exhibits clearly wet and dry seasons with approximately greater than half of the total annual precipitation concentrating between march and august mao et al 2021a qi et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 in this study we focused on the quaternary unconsolidated sediment aquifer the principal geological units include the holocene upper pleistocene unit and the middle lower pleistocene unit and they primarily feature alluvial fluvial and lacustrine facies these quaternary sedimentary deposits form the porous groundwater aquifer system of the study area and there are two distinct aquifer layers in the study area fig 1b the upper aquifer layer with a thickness of 5 3 28 2 m is primarily constituted by sandy clay sandy loam and fine sand distributing in the surface of the study area the underlying lower aquifer layer with a thickness of 8 9 34 4 m is featured with coarse sand and gravel comprising the principal aquifer with single well pumping yield of greater than 1000 40000 m3 d underlaid by tertiary and cretaceous clastic rock sandstone and siltstone that formed the low permeability base layer of the two layer porous aquifer system mao et al 2021a yang et al 2019 the aquifer thickness is approximately 20 60 m and generally increases from upstream to downstream mao et al 2021a yang et al 2019 the groundwater generally flows from hills to plain areas and then into the poyang lake mao et al 2021a 3 methodology the adopted methodological approach to quantificationally study the water interchanges between groundwater and surface water including lake and rivers in the poyang lake area is a transient state three dimensional 3d groundwater flow numerical modeling in which the hydrological features of surface water were considered 3 1 data sources for groundwater numerical modeling the surface elevation of the model area was determined by the digital elevation data with an accuracy of 30 m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem lithological logs sourced from the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 and geocloud of china geological survey https zk cgsi cn were used to determine the upper and lower aquifer geometries monthly rainfall data and the coefficient of precipitation infiltration α which were used to estimate the groundwater recharge from rainfall infiltration were sourced from

jiangxi geology bureau 1982 respectively the groundwater pumping data were sourced from reports of jiangxi water resources bulletins the potential evapotranspiration was sourced from the results published by bian et al 2019 hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity specific yield and porosity that were used to define the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifers were sourced from the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 groundwater level data were obtained from our field observation of 217 wells for the period of january 2018 and official monitoring data of 74 wells for period between january 2018 and september 2019 additionally data of the monthly water level that used to depict the water level fluctuations of the poyang lake the five streams and the yangtze river were sourced from the hydrologic monitoring centre of jiangxi province and from scientific literature such as guo et al 2020 the monthly surface area of the poyang lake was extracted from the landsat remote sensing images download from a publicly available website https earthexplorer usgs gov 3 2 groundwater numerical modeling as described in the introduction it has been demonstrated that modflow enables modeling of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water with modflow packages of river riv lake lak merritt and konikow 2000 and streamflow routing sfr prudic et al 2004 in this study to characterize the groundwater discharge flux and its spatial and temporal variability in the nearshore area of the poyang lake a three dimensional groundwater flow model was conducted by using the widely used modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 as its widespread acceptance and ability to solve extensive hydrologic problems in the modflow the three dimensional movement of groundwater of constant density through porous media is described by a partial differential equation as follows 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water with w less than 0 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w greater than 0 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss represents the storage properties of the porous media and is the volume of water that an aquifer releases from or takes into storage for each unit of surface area of aquifer for each unit of change in hydraulic head l 1 and t is time t harbaugh 2005 in modflow the flow flux between model cells of the surface water and the aquifer is computed using darcy s law and assuming uniform flow between surface water and aquifer this interchange flow flux is computed as 2 q k v l w m h h where q is the flow between the surface water and the aquifer taken as positive if it is directed into the aquifer l3t 1 kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of riverbed streambed sediments lt 1 l is the length of river stream reach through a cell l w is the width of the river stream in the cell l m is the distance between cells of river and aquifer l h is the water level stage of the river stream l and h is the potentiometric head at the cell underlying the river stream and was calculated in modflow model l harbaugh 2005 prudic et al 2004 additionally in this study backward particle tracking modeling was conducted to illustrate the spatial characteristics of groundwater flow paths and to then analyze the indication of flow paths to the spatial variability of the water interchange between groundwater and the surface water thus modpath pollock 2016 that is a particle tracking post processing program designed to work with modflow was used modpath calculates the particle tracking processes based on the groundwater velocity distribution that is derived from the flow rate output of modflow pollock 2016 this calculating process of particle tracking is described by the equation as follows 3 x t x 1 1 a x v x t 1 e a x t t 1 v x 1 y t y 1 1 a y v y t 1 e a y t t 1 v y 1 z t z 1 1 a z v z t

when it flows into the model cell t1 and t are time details of the eq 3 can be found in pollock 2016 3 2 1 model domain and discretization the model domain covers the low lying alluvial lacustrine plain including the lake region and its five tributaries that features a two layer aquifer system of quaternary sediments fig 1 the active model domain is 13023 km2 and is approximately 150 km long i e from west to east 190 km wide i e from south to north and 70 m deep the top surface of the model was set using digital elevation data acquired from aster gdem the bottom elevations of the two model aquifer layers were set using borehole data collected from the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report and from geocloud of china geological survey thus the structure of the two layer aquifer system was established fig 2 a the model domain was discretized with a cell size of 500 m 500 m with refine cells in the lake region the modeling time frame is from january 2018 to september 2019 at a monthly stress period 3 2 2 model boundary the poyang lake and its five tributaries were the main boundaries of our model domain in our model to characterize the dramatic variations in water level and area of the poyang lake in a hydrological year head dependent flux boundary conditions were assigned at the lake areas of different periods by using the modflow package of river riv that can simulate the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and surface water bodies including rivers streams lakes and swamps and is more convenient for realizing the variable areas and water level of the surface water body by assigning the active state of the model cells of the river boundary in contrast in modflow 2005 the lake package is generally used to simulate the effect of stationary surface water bodies on groundwater and cannot be flexible for defining the variations of the area and water level of the surface water body for the five rivers head dependent flux boundary conditions were also assigned to river areas in the model domain by using the modflow package of streamflow routing sfr eighteen river reaches called segment in modflow were set mainly according to the geometry of the river reaches fig 2b for the yangtze river at the northern boundary of the model domain a time varied specific head boundary was assigned the bottom of the model was assigned as a no flow boundary due to the low permeability base clastic rock for these head dependent flux boundaries and specific head boundaries the monthly water level data of the poyang lake five rivers and the yangtze river are required the monthly water level data of the duchang hydrology station fig 1a were used to depict the water level fluctuations of the poyang lake the monthly water level values of the five rivers and yangtze river were determined based on the monitored data sourced from hydrologic monitoring centre of jiangxi province and scientific literature of guo et al 2020 other required input data for these head dependent flux boundaries for calculating the flow flux between the model cells of the surface water and the aquifer by using eq 2 are displayed in table 1 3 2 3 groundwater observations and model initial flow conditions the initial flow condition was determined by the observed groundwater level data during january 2018 there are 217 wells for monitoring the groundwater level at january 2018 and 74 available official wells for monitoring the monthly groundwater level fluctuations from january 2018 to september 2019 fig 3 a in our modelling study a steady state simulation for january 2018 was first calculated then the calibrated groundwater level results from this steady model were selected as the initial flow condition for the transient simulation of a period between february 2018 and september 2019 3 2 4 hydraulic parameters from the results of the historical pumping test recorded in the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report table 2 the spatial distribution patterns of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were concluded and described as follows the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the upper aquifer in ganjiang river and fuhe river delta are 4 7 37 1 m d and 0 19 respectively and those parameters in xinjiang river and raohe river areas are 0 63 7 8 m d and 0 16 respectively the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the lower aquifer in ganjiang river and fuhe river delta are 9 42 67 3 m d and 0 16 0 248 respectively and those parameters in xinjiang river and raohe river areas are 7 4 55 8 m d and 0 18 respectively for the modflow model hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity porosity specific yield and specific storage are required the hydraulic parameter zonation that is the basis for distributing hydraulic properties to the model cells woolfenden et al 2022 was based on recorded data table 2 and geological map fig 1a eleven hydraulic parameter zones were assigned in our model and displayed in fig 3c the initial values of these hydraulic parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific yield in each zone were assigned with the recorded parameter values in table 2 prior information about the parameter of specific storage for our model area was limited only one record value of 1 2 10 5 m 1 for the lower aquifer layer in our modeling the initial specific storage was set with this recorded value for the two aquifer layers the initial parameter values will be adjusted during model calibration the anisotropy ratio kz kx vertical versus horizontal hydraulic conductivity in our model was assigned as 0 1 3 2 5 recharge and discharge according to the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 in this model area the groundwater is primarily recharged from precipitation infiltration and discharged through evaporation pumping and flow into the poyang lake and the five rivers the precipitation infiltration pe was estimated according to the commonly used calculation formula i e p e α f p where α is the coefficient of precipitation infiltration f is the precipitation infiltration area which is influenced by the variation of the poyang lake area and p is the monthly precipitation according to the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 the α values were 0 05 0 2 the monthly precipitation data were sourced from jiangxi water resources bulletins of 2018 and 2019 water resources department of jiangxi 2019 2020 and according to the spatial distribution of groundwater bearing lithology porous media and clastic fractures in our model domain six rainfall infiltration zones were assigned fig 3d and table 3 using the above mentioned calculation formula the estimated monthly infiltration recharge per unit area of each rainfall infiltration zone was estimated finally the estimated monthly infiltration recharge values expressed as the amount of recharge per unit area were input into the upper simulated layer of the numerical model then the numerical model will finish the calculation of the monthly groundwater recharge of the entire model domain meanwhile according to the jiangxi water resources bulletin of 2018 and 2019 water resources department of jiangxi 2019 2020 the annual groundwater pumping amounts of 2018 and 2019 were both 1 53 108 m3 a and the value of annual potential evapotranspiration 860 5 mm a was determined from the results of bian et al 2019 the groundwater evaporation is calculated by the model with the modflow package of evapotranspiration evt in this package the evapotranspiration and extinction depth were assigned as 860 5 mm a and 3 m respectively 3 2 6 model calibration process model calibration is to obtain reasonable results matching the observed groundwater level data by adjusting the hydraulic parameters to scientifically characterize the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer system in our study the calibration was conducted by using the nonlinear inverse modeling package pest doherty et al 2010 after assigning the initial values and reasonable range of hydraulic parameters i e hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage in the pest package then executed the pest and derived the calibrated values of hydraulic parameters of our numerical model to assess the goodness of the model fit except plots comparing calculated groundwater levels to observed groundwater levels statistical indicators of the simulated results are also used hussain et al 2022 sterte et al 2018 usman et al 2020 vaquero et al 2021 in our study seven statistical indices including mean error me eq 4 correlation coefficient r eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 root mean square error rmse eq 7 normalized rmse nmrse eq 8 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 9 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 10 were used in this study me and rmse express average model prediction error in units of the groundwater level nmrse is calculated by dividing the rmse by the range of measured groundwater levels and is expressed as a percentage woolfenden et al 2022 r ranges in value from 1 to 1 and determines whether two ranges of data the calculated and observed groundwater levels move together i e whether large values of one data set are associated with large values of the other data set positive correlation whether small values of one data set are associated with large values of the other data set negative correlation or whether values in both sets are unrelated correlation near zero r2 ranging from 0 to 1 also show the correlation between calculated and observed groundwater levels and can indicate the degree of fit between the calculated and observed values hussain et al 2022 vaquero et al 2021 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus calculated data fits the 1 1 line kge offers a diagnostic insight into the model performance because of the decomposition into correlation bias term and variability term hussain et al 2022 kling et al 2012 if the calculated groundwater levels perfectly match the observed ones the me 0 rmse 0 nmrse 0 r 1 r2

the number of observed data h calc and h obs are the average calculated and average observed groundwater levels respectively h obs max and h obs min are the maximum and the minimum values of the observed groundwater levels respectively h calcs and h obss are the standard deviations of the calculated and observed groundwater levels respectively 4 results 4 1 model calibration results for calibration of the steady model a total of 291 groundwater level observed data i e 217 self monitoring wells and 74 available official wells of january 2018 were used the calibration results of groundwater level of the steady model were shown in fig 4 a and table 4 as indicated in fig 4a there was a good fit between the observed and calculated groundwater level data and as presented in table 4 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 were both larger than 0 9 and the nse and kge were also higher than 0 9 implying high correlation and good fit between the calculated and observed groundwater levels in addition the nmrse was 4 4 previous studies have indicated that the nmrse should be less than 10 percent for a reasonable model ely and kahle 2012 woolfenden et al 2022 thus the nmrse of our model results indicated reasonable steady flow simulated results for this regional scale groundwater flow system meanwhile the me was 0 53 m which showed that the deviation of simulated groundwater levels from average observed groundwater levels i e 17 14 m was only 3 09 by comparing with similar study usman et al 2020 the me is acceptable for our model furthermore the calibrated hydraulic conductivity k was derived after the calibration for the steady model table 5 the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k is generally higher on the west of poyang lake i e ganjiang river and fuhe river delta area zone p1 p2 p3 p4 and p11 with k 10 5 46 m d for upper aquifer and k 26 7 72 m d for lower aquifer and are lower in the east area of poyang lake with k 4 4 10 3 m d for upper aquifer and k 9 4 46 m d for lower aquifer the model was subsequently calibrated for the transient conditions using a total of 1480 observed groundwater level data of 74 available official observing wells as shown in table 4 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 were both larger than 0 9 and nse and kge were also higher than 0 87 by comparing with similar study hussain et al 2022 saha et al 2017 these statistical indicators are acceptable for our transient model and the nmrse was 5 2 less than 10 indicating a reasonable transient flow simulated results meanwhile me was 0 94 m which showed that the deviation of simulated groundwater levels from average observed groundwater levels i e 17 56 m is 5 35 an acceptable result for transient model furthermore as shown in fig 4c the simulated groundwater level fluctuations were generally consistent with the observed ones and the calibrated specific yield was 0 10 0 19 for upper aquifer and 0 10 0 25 for lower aquifer and the calibrated specific storage was 1 20 10 6 2 03 10 5 for the upper aquifer and 1 10 10 6 7 87 10 5 for the lower aquifer table 5 4 2 groundwater flow regime as presented in fig 5 a and fig 5b the groundwater level was high in the hill areas of the west south and east and was low in the nearshore region showing the characteristic of flowing towards into the poyang lake and the five rivers due to the remarkable variations in monthly rainfall and poyang lake water levels the groundwater flow regime changes monthly the monitoring groundwater level fluctuations fig 4c and the simulated results fig 4c and fig 5c showed this change of groundwater flow regimes from january to july influenced by the increasing of water level of the poyang lake and rivers the groundwater level in areas surrounding the poyang lake and rivers exhibited a marked increase by values of approximately 0 4 m fig 5c and the groundwater level in floodplain areas under the expansive lake experienced a similar increase as the lake water level which has been certified by the monitored data of groundwater level in downstream of the xiushui river conducted by chen et al 2021 and li et al 2019 in addition during the period of dry months i e the lowest lake water level season the groundwater flow velocities were less than 0 638 m d with a median flow velocity of 0 065 m d and generally showing high velocity in hill areas and low velocity in nearshore areas during the wet periods i e the highest lake water level season the groundwater flow velocities were less than 0 6 m d with a median flow velocity of 0 048 m d this indicated that the groundwater flow velocity in wet months was typically lower than it was in the in dry months and this is related to the gentler hydraulic gradients induced by the large rise of groundwater level in the nearshore area and the small rise of groundwater level in the near border area fig 5c this result is consistent with our previous study of response of regional scale groundwater flow to the climate change zhou et al 2020 which found that wetting climate could induce a decrease in flow velocity especially for groundwater flow in discharge areas 4 3 water interchange between groundwater and surface water and its intra year temporal variation based on the simulated groundwater budget of the study area the simulated monthly water flux between cells along the lake river shorelines and cells of surface water were calculated to represent the water interchange between groundwater and surface water the results of water interchange were plotted in fig 6 in which the error bars represent one standard deviation among monthly water interchange amounts of three different lake river water level conditions i e the maximum water level of each month the mean water level of each month and the minimum water level of each month of 2018 4 3 1 water interchange between groundwater and the poyang lake as shown in the fig 6a and 6b for the year 2018 the flux values of water interchange between groundwater and lake fluctuated between positive and negative meaning groundwater recharge from the poyang lake i e negative exchange rate with monthly recharge flux of 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month and groundwater discharge into the poyang lake i e positive exchange rate with monthly recharge flux of 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month for the entire year of 2018 the simulated net water discharge flux between groundwater and the poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year positive indicating that the poyang lake gained water recharge from groundwater in this year with this water amount generally our simulated results showed that the groundwater discharge into lake mainly occurs during period between september and january of the following year this is consistent with conclusion of previous researches liao et al 2020a 2020b lan 2016 meanwhile the groundwater was recharged by lake water during period between february and august this conclusion can be supported by our observed water level data fig 7 which showed generally higher lake water level than the near shore groundwater level e g representative wells such as o 16 and o 44 at downstream area of ganjiang river during period between may and august from the fig 6a and 6b it can be concluded that the temporal variation pattern of water interchange between groundwater and the poyang lake is primarily affected by the combined effects of rainfall and lake water level during the period between february and july as the rainfall and lake water levels increase the groundwater is mainly recharged from the poyang lake from july to august in response to sharply decreasing rainfall and the drawdown of lake water levels the relation of water exchange between groundwater and the lake changed to groundwater discharge into the poyang lake from september to december although rainfall exhibited a slightly increase trend there was still groundwater discharge into the poyang lake due to the decreasing trend of the lake water level 4 3 2 water interchange between groundwater and five rivers as shown in fig 6c the simulated water exchange between groundwater and the five rivers was characterized by a pattern of only groundwater discharge into rivers in the entire year of 2018 the simulated monthly groundwater discharge rate was 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and the annual total groundwater discharge amount was 5 32 108 m3 year moreover the monthly groundwater discharge rate also exhibits temporal variability that is inversely correlated with the monthly precipitation this inverse correlation between groundwater discharge and precipitation is related to the higher rising rate of river water level compared to that of the groundwater level which can reduce the hydraulic gradient from aquifer to river in conclusion our study not only quantitatively estimated the monthly water interchange amounts and their temporal variations but also identified the difference of variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange revealing the pattern of water exchange occurring between aquifer and lake and the pattern of only groundwater discharge occurring between aquifer and rivers 4 4 groundwater flow paths and its indication for spatial variability of water interchange based on the calibrated groundwater flow model two modeling scenarios of backward particle tracking which can determine the recharge area were conducted by placing the particles along the poyang lake shoreline in january and july to analyze the flow paths of nearshore groundwater during these two representative months if the flow path direction from particle location to the recharge point is lakeward this indicates that lake water discharges into nearshore groundwater otherwise the landward flow path direction can be indication of nearshore groundwater discharge into the lake as shown in fig 8 a the flow paths of january that represent the low lake level period reveal that all the groundwater flow paths were with directions from upstream landward thus indicating that the nearshore groundwater and poyang lake water were recharged by the upstream groundwater during this low lake level period however as shown in fig 8b the directions of flow paths of july that represent the high lake level period exhibit spatial variability the flow paths in the northwest area area north of the xiushui river are long and with direction from landward upstream implying that the nearshore groundwater in these areas were generally recharged from west upstream the flow paths in the west areas areas between xiushui and fuhe rivers are short and with direction from lake area indicating that the nearshore groundwater in these areas was mainly recharged by lake water in july the flow paths in the south areas areas between junshan lake and xinjiang river are with direction from upstream of groundwater implying that these nearshore groundwater were generally recharged from south upstream most flow paths in the east areas are short and with direction from upstream implying the groundwater discharge into lake accompanying with groundwater recharge from lake in few areas fig 8b and most flow paths in the north east areas are long and with direction from upstream implying that the groundwater discharge into lake also accompanying with groundwater recharge from lake in few areas fig 8b in addition our monitored nearshore water level data fig 7 can also reveal the spatial variability of water interchange for instance the changes in relative height between lake water level and observation groundwater level wells of o 16 and o 44 fig 7 can imply that the groundwater in nearshore areas between xiushui and fuhe rivers can discharge into lake during dry period while be recharged from lake during wet period however always higher groundwater level of downstream area of xinjiang river for example e g representative well of o 50 than lake level can indicate that the local groundwater always discharge into the poyang lake for the whole year of 2018 these results indicated by nearshore water level data are consistent with our results of groundwater flow path fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 inter year climate effects on water interchange as the results in sections 4 3 and 4 4 our study revealed the intra year spatial temporal variability of water interchange it is possible that the temporal change patterns and spatial variability of water interchange are affected by inter year climate conditions in this section we will discuss the effects of the year scale climate or inter year climate on the spatial temporal variability of the water exchange between groundwater and surface water by contrastively analyzing the simulated results of a representative rainy year i e 2010 and a representative dry year i e 2018 as shown in fig 9 a during the rainy year the temporal dynamics of water exchange between groundwater and the poyang lake were influenced by the lake water level fluctuations exhibiting lake water recharging groundwater during the period of rising lake water february august and groundwater discharge into the lake during the period of lake water decline september december january it should be noted that as shown by the error bar in fig 9a groundwater could possibly discharge into lake in april due to the lower lake water level than march fig 9a as presented in fig 9b the groundwater always discharges into the five rivers throughout year the rainy year 2010 and the discharge rate of groundwater into the five rivers was also influenced by the precipitation showing an inverse correlation between discharge rate and precipitation amount these temporal variation patterns of the water exchange in the rainy year were similar to those in the dry year fig 6 a number of previous studies also found the depletion of groundwater discharge to streams during the rainy period huntington and niswonger 2012 higher monthly groundwater discharges in period between winter and spring and lower discharges in period between summer and autumn guevara ochoa et al 2020b or the reported inverse correlations between water exchange flux and stream stage in watersheds rahimi et al 2015 these studies can support our conclusion regarding the temporal patterns of monthly water exchange rates between groundwater and surface water in general it can be concluded that in both dry and rainy years the monthly water exchanges show the same pattern of seasonal variability however the year scale climate conditions i e rainy or dry year can alter the annual total water exchange amount fig 9c 9d 9e as shown in fig 9e the annual amounts of total groundwater discharge into the poyang lake i e 24 00 108 m3 year and the total annual groundwater recharge from the poyang lake i e 22 74 108 m3 year in the representative rainy year are notably greater than those total annual water amounts in the representative dry year and the total water interchange amounts between groundwater and the poyang lake in the representative rainy and dry years are 22 74 108 m3 year and 9 44 108 m3 year respectively fig 9e these simulated results of water interchange amounts were close to the data i e repetition water resource amounts reported in jiangxi water resources bulletin of 2010 and 2018 water resources department of jiangxi 2011 2019 with reported values of 25 39 108 m3 year and 13 97 108 m3 year respectively meanwhile as shown in fig 9d and fig 9e the annual total amounts of groundwater discharge into the five rivers in the representative rainy and dry years are 8 10 108 m3 year and 5 32 108 m3 year respectively also showing a positive correlation between year scale rainy climate condition and groundwater discharge into rivers thus it can be concluded that a year scale rainy climate condition can enhance the total annual water interchange amounts between groundwater and surface water in addition as shown in fig 9e during a rainy year the annual amount of net groundwater discharge into the five rivers i e 8 10 108 m3 year is significantly greater than that into the poyang lake i e 1 26 108 m3 year which is obtained by subtracting 22 74 108 m3 year from 24 00 108 m3 year fig 9e with a total annual amount of net groundwater discharge into all surface water bodies including lake and rivers of 9 36 108 m3 year however during a dry year the annual amount of net groundwater discharge into the five rivers i e 5 32 108 m3 year is less than the that into the poyang lake i e 6 76 108 m3 year which is obtained by subtracting 9 44 108 m3 year from 16 20 108 m3 year fig 9e with a total annual amount of net groundwater discharge into all surface water bodies including lake and rivers of 12 08 108 m3 year thus our results clearly revealed that a year scale rainy climate can decrease the total annual amount of net groundwater discharge and that the year scale climate can affect the spatial allocations of net groundwater discharge in a regional scale watershed this means that groundwater is more likely to discharge into rivers during rainy years however is more possible to discharge into regional great lakes during dry years according to our literature research this is the first time to reveal the potential effects of year scale climate on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges in areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river systems meanwhile compared to the backward particle tracking results of the dry year fig 8b the results of backward particle tracking under a rainy year climate showed that more nearshore groundwater around the poyang lake was recharged from the poyang lake in this rainy year fig 10 this is consistent with the conclusion of the lower net groundwater discharge into poyang lake in rainy year i e 1 26 108 m3 year than that in dry year i e 6 76 108 m3 year in conclusion our backward particle tracking results imply that a year scale climate can change the spatial distribution features of water interchange between groundwater and a regional scale floodplain lake in conclusion our results quantificationally revealed the effects of inter year climate or year scale climate on spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water including lake and rivers particularly the potential effects of year scale climate on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake were revealed these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on the spatial temporal variability of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water in regional scale floodplain areas in addition the results of temporal varying water interchange amounts are important information for the evaluation of local water resources furthermore because groundwater surface water interactions can be the important delivery pathway of chemicals based on the end member hydrochemistry data of groundwater or surface water our results of varying water interchange amounts can be used to estimate the mass flux of anthropogenic pollutants such as nutrient and heavy metals transported between aquifer and surface water bodies lake and river in different seasons or years meanwhile the conclusion of larger water interchange amount induced by the rainy year can be used to explain reported phenomenon that nearshore water pollution is more serious under rainy climate chen 2012 deng et al 2014 rozemeijer et al 2021 6 limitations as shown in our results and those of previous studies guevara ochoa et al 2020b jolly et al 2008 the lake water level is a key controlling factor for water interchange between groundwater and surface water in a regional scale lake aquifer system in reality the water level of the poyang lake should be characterized by spatial variability showing a high water level in the southern area and a low water level in the northern area particularly in dry months however due to the difficulties in obtaining enough observed lake level data and in depicting the spatial distribution of the water level in such a large lake water level fluctuations of one hydrology station were assigned for the entire lake region in our model this simplification may affect the simulation of the water level distribution in the lake domain our modeling study primarily quantified the water interchange between groundwater and surface water and concluded the temporal patterns of the water exchange however the lack of sufficient data regarding nearshore groundwater level limits the discussion of the spatial variability of water exchange between groundwater and surface water in the future observations will be conducted in the nearshore areas despite these limitations our present study clearly revealed the climate effects on the spatial temporal variability patterns of the water interchange between groundwater and surface water in areas possessing regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river systems 7 conclusions using a numerical groundwater modeling approach in a typical large floodplain lake the poyang lake china the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange were revealed meanwhile effects of the year scale climate on the water interchange and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake were gained the results revealed that the monthly water exchange between the groundwater and surface water exhibited significant temporal variability the water exchanges between groundwater and the poyang lake exhibit an inverse correlation with lake level and precipitation groundwater discharge into lake occurs during decline period of lake level and groundwater recharge from lake during rising period of lake level likewise the monthly water exchanges between groundwater and the five rivers also shows seasonal variability and an inverse correlation with precipitation however in one year the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the five rivers only features groundwater discharge into rivers for 2018 the simulated monthly groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month the simulated monthly groundwater recharge from the poyang lake was 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month the annual net groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year and the annual water interchange amounts between groundwater and the poyang lake is 9 44 108 m3 year the simulated monthly groundwater discharge into the five rivers was 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and the annual total groundwater discharge into rivers was 5 32 108 m3 year these results of the variable water interchange flux between groundwater and surface water in the poyang lake region can provide water quantity data for the local water resource evaluation meanwhile combined with end member hydrochemistry data of groundwater or surface water the results of the variable water interchange flux can be used to estimate the mass flux of anthropogenic pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals transported between aquifers and surface water bodies lake and river meanwhile our results reveal the effects of year scale climate on water interchange between groundwater and surface water and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake generally as the larger rainfall recharge for the study area in a rainy year a rainy year increases the total water interchange amount between groundwater and surface water however the rainy year can reduce the total net annual groundwater discharge into surface water in addition the allocations of net groundwater discharges into river and lake can be altered by the year scale climate change which show that groundwater is more likely to be discharged into rivers during the rainy year and is into regional scale lakes during the dry year these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water in regional lake areas additionally the conclusion of a larger water interchange amount induced by the rainy year can be used to explain reported phenomenon that nearshore water pollution is more serious during rainy climate furthermore backward particle tracking simulation was able to identify the spatial distribution of water interchange between groundwater and regional scale lakes for the poyang lake area in a typical dry year the nearshore groundwater in the entire region is always discharged into the lake during the dry months while some nearshore groundwater e g groundwater in downstream areas of the ganjiang river gains recharge from the lake water during the rainy months rainy years can significantly alter the spatial distribution of the water interchange between groundwater and lake water thus leading to more nearshore groundwater being recharged by lake water during the rainy month in our future modeling study for water interchange between groundwater and surface water the spatial variability of the regional lake water level will be considered to further reveal the spatial variability of the water interchange in large floodplain lake areas in addition as the climate change has potential to alter the water interactions the future climate change projections under the general circulation models of coupled model intercomparison project phase six cmip6 will be applied in our future modeling study to discuss the long term temporal variability of water interchange in the poyang lake area credit

3309,for areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river system the allocation pattern of water interchange between the groundwater and the lakes and rivers as well as its temporal variations under year scale climate changes are important issues in regard to water resources and ecology environment but are rarely revealed this study presented a numerical groundwater modeling of the poyang lake area to reveal the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and to assess the potential effects of year scale climate on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges into rivers and lake it is found that the monthly groundwater discharge into surface water exhibits significant temporal variability which reveals an inverse correlation between monthly groundwater discharge and lake water levels and precipitation amounts rainy months can lead to groundwater recharge from the poyang lake our simulated results reveal that in the dry year of 2018 the variable monthly groundwater discharge into poyang lake and the monthly groundwater recharge from poyang lake were 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month and 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month respectively additionally the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the poyang lake was 9 44 108 m3 year and the annual net groundwater discharge into poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year however the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the five rivers only features groundwater discharge into rivers with variable monthly groundwater discharge into the five rivers of 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and an annual total groundwater discharge amount of 5 32 108 m3 year in 2018 additionally our water interchange results of the rainy year of 2010 indicate that the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the poyang lake was 22 74 108 m3 year the annual net groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 1 26 108 m3 year and the annual groundwater discharge into the five rivers was 8 10 108 m3 year these comparisons between the results of the rainy year of 2010 and dry year of 2018 can reveal the effects of the year scale climate on water exchange between groundwater and surface water and imply that a rainy year can increase the total water interchange amount but decrease the total net groundwater discharge into surface water and that groundwater is more likely to discharge into rivers during a rainy year furthermore it is found that a rainy year can significantly alter the spatial distribution of the water interchange between groundwater and lake water and that the backward particle tracking simulation could be helpful in regard to identifying the spatial distribution of water exchange between groundwater and regional scale lake these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on the spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water in regional floodplain lake areas and provide useful information for the evaluation of local water resources and the estimation of pollutant transportation keywords regional great lake groundwater surface water interchange numerical modeling temporal variability flow path poyang lake 1 introduction water interchange between groundwater and surface water occurs almost everywhere particularly in riparian regions lacustrine areas wetlands estuaries coastal zones etc along with this water interchange anthropogenic pollutants are also transported between groundwater and surface waters and these can pollute water resources thus affecting the health of the near shore ecological environment and making it impossible to use water resources directly for drinking water and industrial applications panagopoulos 2021a 2021b 2022 pontér et al 2021 robinson 2015 stoliker et al 2016 thus water interchange between groundwater and surface water is always an important issue in regard to water recharge discharge water quality and the ecological environment of a natural system brunner et al 2017 guevara ochoa et al 2020b jolly et al 2008 kalbus et al 2006 schwerdtfeger et al 2016 sophocleous 2002 identifying the water interchange patterns such as the dominant controlling factors interchange flux and its temporal variation and flow path is essential for the reasonable management of water resources and protection of the water environment numerous methods have been investigated to identify the water interchange between groundwater and surface water direct measurements by using seepage meters can quantify the water exchange flux at specific sites cherkauer and carlson 1997 debnath and mukherjee 2016 duque et al 2020 the approach of temperature monitoring such as distributed fiber optic temperature sensors that is based on the temperature difference between groundwater and surface water can identify the occurring area and flow direction of the water interchange hare et al 2015 mccobb et al 2018 mwakanyamale et al 2012 darcy s law can also be applied to assess the direction and flux rate of water interchange based on the water level and hydraulic conductivity bouchez et al 2021 the water balance method is an essential approach for quantifying the water exchange in a regional watershed system langston et al 2013 li et al 2020 additionally tracers including conservative tracers such as cl stable isotopes such as 18o and 2h and radioactive isotopes such as rn and ra are key tools for understanding groundwater and surface water interactions at different scales jafari et al 2021a yang et al 2021 compared to the above methods numerical modeling has been regarded as an appealing tool for systematically interpreting and quantifying the water interchange and its spatial temporal variability at a regional scale certain integrated modelling approaches that include completely coupled models such as hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and loosely coupled models such as gsflow markstrom et al 2008 and swat modflow bailey et al 2016 have been developed to facilitate modeling of water interaction between groundwater and surface water however it is difficult to apply the integrated model to a regional scale area due to the limited available data regarding soil properties and land use barthel and banzhaf 2016 guevara ochoa et al 2020b as a modularized model modflow has been extended into more than just a groundwater flow model harbaugh 2005 brunner et al 2010 examined the accuracy of simulating surface water groundwater interactions using stream package of modflow and provided some guidance regarding its application modflow has been previously applied to water interaction studies fan et al 2007 karki et al 2021 matusiak et al 2021 pulido velazquez et al 2012 rahimi et al 2015 shope et al 2012 wöhling et al 2018 the majority of the previous studies about spatial temporal variations of groundwater surface water interactions have primarily focused on aquifer river water interactions dibaj et al 2021 guevara ochoa et al 2020a jafari et al 2021b kurylyk et al 2014 saha et al 2017 schilling et al 2021 scibek et al 2007 sterte et al 2018 tian et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and aquifer lake water interactions elsawwaf et al 2014 kim et al 2020 smerdon et al 2007 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 xu et al 2021 yihdego et al 2016 however for watershed scale areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lake and complex river system previous studies about groundwater surface water interaction are less and generally take the water interchanges of groundwater with lake and river as a whole without considering the difference of the temporal variation pattern of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and without considering the allocation pattern of groundwater discharges into rivers and lakes ala aho et al 2013 li et al 2019 nixdorf 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 additionally knowledge regarding how climate affects the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into rivers and lakes remains unrevealed these temporal spatial variations of water interchange and net groundwater discharge as well as its allocations in riparian and lacustrine areas could determine the changes in water resources and chemicals transportation in such regional lake river aquifer systems the poyang lake area is a typical watershed scale area possessing both regional scale floodplain lake the poyang lake and complex river systems five rivers including the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers fig 1 a the poyang lake features dramatic variations in water level and area and is the confluence terminal of these five rivers and it plays a key role in floodwater storage and is an internationally recognized habitat for wintering migratory birds it has been reported that the poyang lake area has suffered serious ecological and environmental problems such as drought wetland degradation and water eutrophication jiang et al 2020 liao et al 2018 mao et al 2021a 2021b qi et al 2017 soldatova et al 2017 ye et al 2011 it is traditionally believed that the lake water amount and its variation are primarily controlled by recharge from the five rivers and by discharge into the yangtze river hu et al 2007 li et al 2017 li and zhang 2018 shankman et al 2006 however the groundwater flux still accounts for a certain proportion of the poyang lake water amount li et al 2020 additionally an investigation revealed that the shallow groundwater of the poyang lake area was characterized by a high concentration of nitrogen compounds soldatova et al 2017 that could potentially affect lake water quality neglecting the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the surface water including poyang lake and the five rivers could lead to errors in the lake water balance calculation and underestimate chemicals transportation between the aquifer and lake thus quantifying the water interchange and its temporal dynamics is vital according to our literature research studies including numerical modeling water balance calculations and stable or radioactive isotope investigations have been conducted to quantificationally investigate the water interaction between groundwater and the poyang lake for instance by using numerical groundwater flow modeling lan 2016 simulated the groundwater flow of ganjiang river delta in the western poyang lake and derived the discharge rate from aquifer to the poyang lake with an annual averaged value of 1 42 m3 s between the years of 2003 2010 yang et al 2019 also conducted a three dimensional 3d numerical groundwater flow model of the ganjiang river delta and noted that groundwater was primarily discharged into surface water in nearshore areas but did not derive the results of the discharge flux and its temporal dynamics for the poyang lake region that includes the lake area and its five main tributary rivers nixdorf 2019 simulated the total amount of groundwater discharges into the poyang lake as 85 69 m3 s during high lake level period september 2000 with a median groundwater velocity of 0 51 m d and 38 76 m3 s during low lake level period december 1999 with a median groundwater velocity of 0 23 m d using the darcy s law li et al 2019 investigated the hydraulic interactions between wetland groundwater and seasonal variable surface water in a local small area in the downstream region of the xiushui river and they derived the groundwater discharge rates into xiushui river and banghu lake i e an isolated lake nearby the poyang lake with darcy velocities of less than 0 4 m d and less than 0 1 m d respectively using the water balance method li et al 2020 analyzed the lake groundwater exchange fluxes for year of 2014 in addition to modeling and water balance methods isotope tracers such as 2h 18o radon and radium isotopes are also increasingly popular tools for identifying the occurrence area of water interaction and quantifying the hydraulic interaction amount for this regional scale lake zhan et al 2016 conducted an isotopic study and illustrated that the poyang lake was primarily recharged by the five rivers and that the water exchange between groundwater and lake water primarily occurred at the narrow northern end of the poyang lake using the radium and stable isotopes 2h and 18o liao et al 2020a 2020b identified the dominant groundwater discharge sources and estimated the groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake as 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d at the dry season november 2016 this estimated groundwater discharge flux was more than 9 fold greater than the estimating results of nixdorf 2019 i e 38 76 m3 s in december 1999 these results regarding the water interchange rates between groundwater and the poyang lake indicate that the water interchange in such a regional scale aquifer lake system is characterized by temporal or spatial variability however these qualitative and quantitative studies did not reveal the differences in spatial temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and there is still little knowledge regarding the effects of inter year climate change on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into the river and into poyang lake taking the poyang lake area as an example this study conducts a numerical groundwater flow model to simulate the temporal variations of the water interaction between groundwater and rivers and lake the specific objectives of this modeling work are to reveal the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange and to assess the potential effects of the year scale climate on the temporal spatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges into rivers and lake the results of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of climate conditions on the spatial temporal variability of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water in regional floodplain lake areas and will also provide useful information for the evaluation of local water resources and the estimation of pollutant transportation 2 description of the study area the poyang lake is located in the northern portion of jiangxi province southeastern china this lake possesses a catchment area of 162200 km2 and is typically recharged from five tributaries that generally flow from south to north and maintain an obvious hydraulic connection with the yangtze river in the north fig 1a the lake area and water amount of the poyang lake markedly change during a hydrologic year due to the monthly variations in the streamflow fluxes from the five tributaries due to effects resulting from the dramatic temporal changes in streamflow it has been reported that the largest historical lake area and water volume were approximately 4070 km2 and 34 billion m3 respectively during the highest lake water level period with a level value of 22 59 m july 31 1998 at the hukou hydrology station during the lowest lake water level period with a level value of 5 9 m february 6 1963 at the hukou hydrology station the lake area and water volume were only approximately 146 km2 and 450 million m3 and represented only a narrow meandering waterway in the poyang lake qi et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2016 in our study the low lying alluvial lacustrine plain with a total area of 13023 km2 including the lake region and its five tributaries that is featured with quaternary unconsolidated sediments was selected as our study area fig 1a the topography of our study area varies from upstream hills to downstream alluvial lacustrine plain surrounding the lake at elevations of less than 15 m the climate of the poyang lake region is featured with subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation and evaporation of 1400 2400 mm and 800 1200 mm respectively mao et al 2021a wang et al 2014 additionally the annual precipitation exhibits clearly wet and dry seasons with approximately greater than half of the total annual precipitation concentrating between march and august mao et al 2021a qi et al 2017 zhang and werner 2015 in this study we focused on the quaternary unconsolidated sediment aquifer the principal geological units include the holocene upper pleistocene unit and the middle lower pleistocene unit and they primarily feature alluvial fluvial and lacustrine facies these quaternary sedimentary deposits form the porous groundwater aquifer system of the study area and there are two distinct aquifer layers in the study area fig 1b the upper aquifer layer with a thickness of 5 3 28 2 m is primarily constituted by sandy clay sandy loam and fine sand distributing in the surface of the study area the underlying lower aquifer layer with a thickness of 8 9 34 4 m is featured with coarse sand and gravel comprising the principal aquifer with single well pumping yield of greater than 1000 40000 m3 d underlaid by tertiary and cretaceous clastic rock sandstone and siltstone that formed the low permeability base layer of the two layer porous aquifer system mao et al 2021a yang et al 2019 the aquifer thickness is approximately 20 60 m and generally increases from upstream to downstream mao et al 2021a yang et al 2019 the groundwater generally flows from hills to plain areas and then into the poyang lake mao et al 2021a 3 methodology the adopted methodological approach to quantificationally study the water interchanges between groundwater and surface water including lake and rivers in the poyang lake area is a transient state three dimensional 3d groundwater flow numerical modeling in which the hydrological features of surface water were considered 3 1 data sources for groundwater numerical modeling the surface elevation of the model area was

lower aquifer geometries monthly rainfall data and the coefficient of precipitation infiltration α which were used to estimate the groundwater recharge from rainfall infiltration were sourced from reports of jiangxi water resources bulletins of 2010 2018 and 2019 water resources department of jiangxi 2011 2019 2020 and the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 respectively the groundwater pumping data were sourced from reports of jiangxi water resources bulletins the potential evapotranspiration was sourced from the results

described in the introduction it has been demonstrated that modflow enables modeling of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water with modflow packages of river riv lake lak merritt and konikow 2000 and streamflow routing sfr prudic et al 2004 in this study to characterize the groundwater discharge flux and its spatial and temporal variability in the nearshore area of the poyang lake a three dimensional groundwater flow model was conducted by using the widely used modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 as its widespread acceptance and ability to solve extensive hydrologic problems in the modflow the three dimensional movement of groundwater of constant density through porous media is described by a partial differential equation as follows 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water with w less than 0 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w greater than 0 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss represents the storage properties of the porous media and is the volume of water that an aquifer releases from or takes into storage for each unit of surface area of aquifer for each unit of change in hydraulic head l 1 and t is time t harbaugh 2005 in modflow the flow flux between model cells of the surface water and the aquifer is computed using darcy s law and assuming uniform flow between surface water and aquifer this interchange flow flux is computed as 2 q k v l w m h h where q is the flow between the surface water and the aquifer taken as positive if it is directed into the aquifer l3t 1 kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of riverbed streambed sediments lt 1 l is the length of river stream reach through a cell l w is the width of the river stream in the cell l m is the distance between cells of river and aquifer l h is the water level stage of the river stream l and h is the potentiometric head at the cell underlying the river stream and was calculated in modflow model l harbaugh 2005 prudic et al 2004 additionally in this study backward particle tracking modeling was conducted to illustrate the spatial characteristics of groundwater flow paths and to then analyze the indication of flow paths to the spatial variability of the water interchange between groundwater and the surface water thus modpath pollock 2016 that is a particle tracking post processing program designed to work with modflow was used modpath calculates the particle tracking processes based on the groundwater velocity distribution that is derived from the flow rate output of modflow pollock 2016 this calculating process of particle tracking is described by the equation as follows 3 x t x 1 1 a x v x t 1 e a x t t 1 v x 1 y t y 1 1 a y v y t 1 e a y t t 1 v y 1 z t z 1 1 a z v z t

components of the groundwater velocity gradient in a model cell vx t1 vy t1 and vz t1 are the velocity components of a particle at any time t1 vx1 vy1 and vz1 are the velocity components of a particle when it flows into the model cell t1 and t are time details of the eq 3 can be found in pollock 2016 3 2 1 model domain and discretization the model domain covers the low lying alluvial lacustrine plain including the lake region and its five tributaries that features a two layer aquifer system of quaternary sediments fig 1 the active model domain is 13023 km2 and is approximately 150 km long i e from west to east 190 km wide i e from south to north and 70 m deep the top surface of the model was set using digital elevation data acquired from aster gdem the bottom elevations of the two model aquifer layers were set using borehole data collected from the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report and from geocloud of china geological survey thus the structure of the two layer aquifer system was established fig 2 a the model domain was discretized with a cell size of 500 m 500 m with refine cells in the lake region the modeling time frame is from january 2018 to september 2019 at a monthly stress period 3 2 2 model boundary the poyang lake and its five tributaries were the main boundaries of our model domain in our model to characterize the dramatic variations in water level and area of the poyang lake in a hydrological year head dependent flux boundary conditions were assigned at the lake areas of different periods by using the modflow package of river riv that can simulate the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and surface water bodies including rivers streams lakes and swamps and is more convenient for realizing the variable areas and water level of the surface water body by assigning the active state of the model cells of the river boundary in contrast in modflow 2005 the lake package is generally used to simulate the effect of stationary surface water bodies on groundwater and cannot be flexible for defining the variations of the area and water level of the surface water body for the five rivers head dependent flux boundary conditions were also assigned to river areas in the model domain by using the modflow package of streamflow routing sfr eighteen river reaches called segment in modflow were set mainly according to the geometry of the river reaches fig 2b for the yangtze river at the northern boundary of the model domain a time varied specific head boundary was assigned the bottom of the model was assigned as a no flow boundary due to the low permeability base clastic rock for these head dependent flux boundaries and specific head boundaries the monthly water level data of the poyang lake five rivers and the yangtze river are required the monthly water level data of the duchang hydrology station fig 1a were used to depict the water level fluctuations of the poyang lake the monthly water level values of the five rivers and yangtze river were determined based on the monitored data sourced from hydrologic monitoring centre of jiangxi province and scientific literature of guo et al 2020 other required input data for these head dependent flux boundaries for calculating the flow flux between the model cells of the surface water and the aquifer by using eq 2 are displayed in table 1 3 2 3 groundwater observations and model initial flow conditions the initial flow condition was determined by the observed groundwater level data during january 2018 there are 217 wells for monitoring the groundwater level at january 2018 and 74 available official wells for monitoring the monthly groundwater level fluctuations from january 2018 to september 2019 fig 3 a in our modelling study a steady state simulation for january 2018 was first calculated then the calibrated groundwater level results from this steady model were selected as the initial flow condition for the transient simulation of a period between february 2018 and september 2019 3 2 4 hydraulic parameters from the results of the historical pumping test recorded in the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report table 2 the spatial distribution patterns of hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were concluded and described as follows the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the upper aquifer in ganjiang river and fuhe river delta are 4 7 37 1 m d and 0 19 respectively and those parameters in xinjiang river and raohe river areas are 0 63 7 8 m d and 0 16 respectively the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the lower aquifer in ganjiang river and fuhe river delta are 9 42 67 3 m d and 0 16 0 248 respectively and those parameters in xinjiang river and raohe river areas are 7 4 55 8 m d and 0 18 respectively for the modflow model hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity porosity specific yield and specific storage are required the hydraulic parameter zonation that is the basis for distributing hydraulic properties to the model cells woolfenden et al 2022 was based on recorded data table 2 and geological map fig 1a eleven hydraulic parameter zones were assigned in our model and displayed in fig 3c the initial values of these hydraulic parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific yield in each zone were assigned with the recorded parameter values in table 2 prior information about the parameter of specific storage for our model area was limited only one record value of 1 2 10 5 m 1 for the lower aquifer layer in our modeling the initial specific storage was set with this recorded value for the two aquifer layers the initial parameter values will be adjusted during model calibration the anisotropy ratio kz kx vertical versus horizontal hydraulic conductivity in our model was assigned as 0 1 3 2 5 recharge and discharge according to the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 in this model area the groundwater is primarily recharged from precipitation infiltration and discharged through evaporation pumping and flow into the poyang lake and the five rivers the precipitation infiltration pe was estimated according to the commonly used calculation formula i e p e α f p where α is the coefficient of precipitation infiltration f is the precipitation infiltration area which is influenced by the variation of the poyang lake area and p is the monthly precipitation according to the poyang regional hydrogeological survey report hydrogeological team of jiangxi geology bureau 1982 the α values were 0 05 0 2 the monthly precipitation data were sourced from jiangxi water resources bulletins of 2018 and 2019 water resources department of jiangxi 2019 2020 and according to the spatial distribution of groundwater bearing lithology porous media and clastic fractures in our model domain six rainfall infiltration zones were assigned fig 3d and table 3 using the above mentioned calculation formula the estimated monthly infiltration recharge per unit area of each rainfall infiltration zone was estimated finally the estimated monthly infiltration recharge values expressed as the amount of recharge per unit area were input into the upper simulated layer of the numerical model then the numerical model will finish the calculation of the monthly groundwater recharge of the entire model domain meanwhile according to the jiangxi water resources bulletin of 2018 and 2019 water resources department of jiangxi 2019 2020 the annual groundwater pumping amounts of 2018 and 2019 were both 1 53 108 m3 a and the value of annual potential evapotranspiration 860 5 mm a was determined from the results of bian et al 2019 the groundwater evaporation is calculated by the model with the modflow package of evapotranspiration evt in this package the evapotranspiration and extinction depth were assigned as 860 5 mm a and 3 m respectively 3 2 6 model calibration process model calibration is to obtain reasonable results matching the observed groundwater level data by adjusting the hydraulic parameters to scientifically characterize the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer system in our study the calibration was conducted by using the nonlinear inverse modeling package pest doherty et al 2010 after assigning the initial values and reasonable range of hydraulic parameters i e hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage in the pest package then executed the pest and derived the calibrated values of hydraulic parameters of our numerical model to assess the goodness of the model fit except plots comparing calculated groundwater levels to observed groundwater levels statistical indicators of the simulated results are also used hussain et al 2022 sterte et al 2018 usman et al 2020 vaquero et al 2021 in our study seven statistical indices including mean error me eq 4 correlation coefficient r eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 eq 6 root mean square error rmse eq 7 normalized rmse nmrse eq 8 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 9 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 10 were used in this study me and rmse express average model prediction error in units of the groundwater level nmrse is calculated by dividing the rmse by the range of measured groundwater levels and is expressed as a percentage woolfenden et al 2022 r ranges in value from 1 to 1 and determines whether two ranges of data the calculated and observed groundwater levels move together i e whether large values of one data set are associated with large values of the other data set positive correlation whether small values of one data set are associated with large values of the other data set negative correlation or whether values in both sets are unrelated correlation near zero r2 ranging from 0 to 1 also show the correlation between calculated and observed groundwater levels and can indicate the degree of fit between the calculated and observed values hussain et al 2022 vaquero et al 2021 nse indicates how well the plot of observed versus calculated data fits the 1 1 line kge offers a diagnostic insight into the model performance because of the decomposition into correlation bias term and variability term hussain et al 2022 kling et al 2012 if the calculated groundwater levels perfectly match the observed ones the me 0 rmse 0 nmrse 0 r 1 r2

the number of observed data h calc and h obs are the average calculated and average observed groundwater levels respectively h obs max and h obs min are the maximum and the minimum values of the observed groundwater levels respectively h calcs and h obss are the standard deviations of the calculated and observed groundwater levels respectively 4 results 4 1 model calibration results for calibration of the steady model a total of 291 groundwater level observed data i e 217 self monitoring wells and 74 available official wells of january 2018 were used the calibration results of groundwater level of the steady model were shown in fig 4 a and table 4 as indicated in fig 4a there was a good fit between the observed and calculated groundwater level data and as presented in table 4 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 were both larger than 0 9 and the nse and kge were also higher than 0 9 implying high correlation and good fit between the calculated and observed groundwater levels in addition the nmrse was 4 4 previous studies have indicated that the nmrse should be less than 10 percent for a reasonable model ely and kahle 2012 woolfenden et al 2022 thus the nmrse of our model results indicated reasonable steady flow simulated results for this regional scale groundwater flow system meanwhile the me was 0 53 m which showed that the deviation of simulated groundwater levels from average observed groundwater levels i e 17 14 m was only 3 09 by comparing with similar study usman et al 2020 the me is acceptable for our model furthermore the calibrated hydraulic conductivity k was derived after the calibration for the steady model table 5 the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k is generally higher on the west of poyang lake i e ganjiang river and fuhe river delta area zone p1 p2 p3 p4 and p11 with k 10 5 46 m d for upper aquifer and k 26 7 72 m d for lower aquifer and are lower in the east area of poyang lake with k 4 4 10 3 m d for upper aquifer and k 9 4 46 m d for lower aquifer the model was subsequently calibrated for the transient conditions using a total of 1480 observed groundwater level data of 74 available official observing wells as shown in table 4 the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 were both larger than 0 9 and nse and kge were also higher than 0 87 by comparing with similar study hussain et al 2022 saha et al 2017 these statistical indicators are acceptable for our transient model and the nmrse was 5 2 less than 10 indicating a reasonable transient flow simulated results meanwhile me was 0 94 m which showed that the deviation of simulated groundwater levels from average observed groundwater levels i e 17 56 m is 5 35 an acceptable result for transient model furthermore as shown in fig 4c the simulated groundwater level fluctuations were generally consistent with the observed ones and the calibrated specific yield was 0 10 0 19 for upper aquifer and 0 10 0 25 for lower aquifer and the calibrated specific storage was 1 20 10 6 2 03 10 5 for the upper aquifer and 1 10 10 6 7 87 10 5 for the lower aquifer table 5 4 2 groundwater flow regime as presented in fig 5 a and fig 5b the groundwater level was high in the hill areas of the west south and east and was low in the nearshore region showing the characteristic of flowing towards into the poyang lake and the five rivers due to the remarkable variations in monthly rainfall and poyang lake water levels the groundwater flow regime changes monthly the monitoring groundwater level fluctuations fig 4c and the simulated results fig 4c and fig 5c showed this change of groundwater flow regimes from january to july influenced by the increasing of water level of the poyang lake and rivers the groundwater level in areas surrounding the poyang lake and rivers exhibited a marked increase by values of approximately 0 4 m fig 5c and the groundwater level in floodplain areas under the expansive lake experienced a similar increase as the lake water level which has been certified by the monitored data of groundwater level in downstream of the xiushui river conducted by chen et al 2021 and li et al 2019 in addition during the period of dry months i e the lowest lake water level season the groundwater flow velocities were less than 0 638 m d with a median flow velocity of 0 065 m d and generally showing high velocity in hill areas and low velocity in nearshore areas during the wet periods i e the highest lake water level season the groundwater flow velocities were less than 0 6 m d with a median flow velocity of 0 048 m d this indicated that the groundwater flow velocity in wet months was typically lower than it was in the in dry months and this is related to the gentler hydraulic gradients induced by the large rise of groundwater level in the nearshore area and the small rise of groundwater level in the near border area fig 5c this result is consistent with our previous study of response of regional scale groundwater flow to the climate change zhou et al 2020 which found that wetting climate could induce a decrease in flow velocity especially for groundwater flow in discharge areas 4 3 water interchange between groundwater and surface water and its intra year temporal variation based on the simulated groundwater budget of the study area the simulated monthly water flux between cells along the lake river shorelines and cells of surface water were calculated to represent the water interchange between groundwater and surface water the results of water interchange were plotted in fig 6 in which the error bars represent one standard deviation among monthly water interchange amounts of three different lake river water level conditions i e the maximum water level of each month the mean water level of each month and the minimum water level of each month of 2018 4 3 1 water interchange between groundwater and the poyang lake as shown in the fig 6a and 6b for the year 2018 the flux values of water interchange between groundwater and lake fluctuated between positive and negative meaning groundwater recharge from the poyang lake i e negative exchange rate with monthly recharge flux of 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month and groundwater discharge into the poyang lake i e positive exchange rate with monthly recharge flux of 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month for the entire year of 2018 the simulated net water discharge flux between groundwater and the poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year positive indicating that the poyang lake gained water recharge from groundwater in this year with this water amount generally our simulated results showed that the groundwater discharge into lake mainly occurs during period between september and january of the following year this is consistent with conclusion of previous researches liao et al 2020a 2020b lan 2016 meanwhile the groundwater was recharged by lake water during period between february and august this conclusion can be supported by our observed water level data fig 7 which showed generally higher lake water level than the near shore groundwater level e g representative wells such as o 16 and o 44 at downstream area of ganjiang river during period between may and august from the fig 6a and 6b it can be concluded that the temporal variation pattern of water interchange between groundwater and the poyang lake is primarily affected by the combined effects of rainfall and lake water level during the period between february and july as the rainfall and lake water levels increase the groundwater is mainly recharged from the poyang lake from july to august in response to sharply decreasing rainfall and the drawdown of lake water levels the relation of water exchange between groundwater and the lake changed to groundwater discharge into the poyang lake from september to december although rainfall exhibited a slightly increase trend there was still groundwater discharge into the poyang lake due to the decreasing trend of the lake water level 4 3 2 water interchange between groundwater and five rivers as shown in fig 6c the simulated water exchange between groundwater and the five rivers was characterized by a pattern of only groundwater discharge into rivers in the entire year of 2018 the simulated monthly groundwater discharge rate was 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and the annual total groundwater discharge amount was 5 32 108 m3 year moreover the monthly groundwater discharge rate also exhibits temporal variability that is inversely correlated with the monthly precipitation this inverse correlation between groundwater discharge and precipitation is related to the higher rising rate of river water level compared to that of the groundwater level which can reduce the hydraulic gradient from aquifer to river in conclusion our study not only quantitatively estimated the monthly water interchange amounts and their temporal variations but also identified the difference of variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange revealing the pattern of water exchange occurring between aquifer and lake and the pattern of only groundwater discharge occurring between aquifer and rivers 4 4 groundwater flow paths and its indication for spatial variability of water interchange based on the calibrated groundwater flow model two modeling scenarios of backward particle tracking which can determine the recharge area were conducted by placing the particles along the poyang lake shoreline in january and july to analyze the flow paths of nearshore groundwater during these two representative months if the flow path direction from particle location to the recharge point is lakeward this indicates that lake water discharges into nearshore groundwater otherwise the landward flow path direction can be indication of nearshore groundwater discharge into the lake as shown in fig 8 a the flow paths of january that represent the low lake level period reveal that all the groundwater flow paths were with directions from upstream landward thus indicating that the nearshore groundwater and poyang lake water were recharged by the upstream groundwater during this low lake level period however as shown in fig 8b the directions of flow paths of july that represent the high lake level period exhibit spatial variability the flow paths in the northwest area area north of the xiushui river are long and with direction from landward upstream implying that the nearshore groundwater in these areas were generally recharged from west upstream the flow paths in the west areas areas between xiushui and fuhe rivers are short and with direction from lake area indicating that the nearshore groundwater in these areas was mainly recharged by lake water in july the flow paths in the south areas areas between junshan lake and xinjiang river are with direction from upstream of groundwater implying that these nearshore groundwater were generally recharged from south upstream most flow paths in the east areas are short and with direction from upstream implying the groundwater discharge into lake accompanying with groundwater recharge from lake in few areas fig 8b and most flow paths in the north east areas are long and with direction from upstream implying that the groundwater discharge into lake also accompanying with groundwater recharge from lake in few areas fig 8b in addition our monitored nearshore water level data fig 7 can also reveal the spatial variability of water interchange for instance the changes in relative height between lake water level and observation groundwater level wells of o 16 and o 44 fig 7 can imply that the groundwater in nearshore areas between xiushui and fuhe rivers can discharge into lake during dry period while be recharged from lake during wet period however always higher groundwater level of downstream area of xinjiang river for example e g representative well of o 50 than lake level can indicate that the local groundwater always discharge into the poyang lake for the whole year of 2018 these results indicated by nearshore water level data are consistent with our results of groundwater flow path fig 8 5 discussion 5 1 inter year climate effects on water interchange as the results in sections 4 3 and 4 4 our study revealed the intra year spatial temporal variability of water interchange it is possible that the temporal change patterns and spatial variability of water interchange are affected by inter year climate conditions in this section we will discuss the effects of the year scale climate or inter year climate on the spatial temporal variability of the water exchange between groundwater and surface water by contrastively analyzing the simulated results of a representative rainy year i e 2010 and a representative dry year i e 2018 as shown in fig 9 a during the rainy year the temporal dynamics of water exchange between groundwater and the poyang lake were influenced by the lake water level fluctuations exhibiting lake water recharging groundwater during the period of rising lake water february august and groundwater discharge into the lake during the period of lake water decline september december january it should be noted that as shown by the error bar in fig 9a groundwater could possibly discharge into lake in april due to the lower lake water level than march fig 9a as presented in fig 9b the groundwater always discharges into the five rivers throughout year the rainy year 2010 and the discharge rate of groundwater into the five rivers was also influenced by the precipitation showing an inverse correlation between discharge rate and precipitation amount these temporal variation patterns of the water exchange in the rainy year were similar to those in the dry year fig 6 a number of previous studies also found the depletion of groundwater discharge to streams during the rainy period huntington and niswonger 2012 higher monthly groundwater discharges in period between winter and spring and lower discharges in period between summer and autumn guevara ochoa et al 2020b or the reported inverse correlations between water exchange flux and stream stage in watersheds rahimi et al 2015 these studies can support our conclusion regarding the temporal patterns of monthly water exchange rates between groundwater and surface water in general it can be concluded that in both dry and rainy years the monthly water exchanges show the same pattern of seasonal variability however the year scale climate conditions i e rainy or dry year can alter the annual total water exchange amount fig 9c 9d 9e as shown in fig 9e the annual amounts of total groundwater discharge into the poyang lake i e 24 00 108 m3 year and the total annual groundwater recharge from the poyang lake i e 22 74 108 m3 year in the representative rainy year are notably greater than those total annual water amounts in the representative dry year and the total water interchange amounts between groundwater and the poyang lake in the representative rainy and dry years are 22 74 108 m3 year and 9 44 108 m3 year respectively fig 9e these simulated results of water interchange amounts were close to the data i e repetition water resource amounts reported in jiangxi water resources bulletin of 2010 and 2018 water resources department of jiangxi 2011 2019 with reported values of 25 39 108 m3 year and 13 97 108 m3 year respectively meanwhile as shown in fig 9d and fig 9e the annual total amounts of groundwater discharge into the five rivers in the representative rainy and dry years are 8 10 108 m3 year and 5 32 108 m3 year respectively also showing a positive correlation between year scale rainy climate condition and groundwater discharge into rivers thus it can be concluded that a year scale rainy climate condition can enhance the total annual water interchange amounts between groundwater and surface water in addition as shown in fig 9e during a rainy year the annual amount of net groundwater discharge into the five rivers i e 8 10 108 m3 year is significantly greater than that into the poyang lake i e 1 26 108 m3 year which is obtained by subtracting 22 74 108 m3 year from 24 00 108 m3 year fig 9e with a total annual amount of net groundwater discharge into all surface water bodies including lake and rivers of 9 36 108 m3 year however during a dry year the annual amount of net groundwater discharge into the five rivers i e 5 32 108 m3 year is less than the that into the poyang lake i e 6 76 108 m3 year which is obtained by subtracting 9 44 108 m3 year from 16 20 108 m3 year fig 9e with a total annual amount of net groundwater discharge into all surface water bodies including lake and rivers of 12 08 108 m3 year thus our results clearly revealed that a year scale rainy climate can decrease the total annual amount of net groundwater discharge and that the year scale climate can affect the spatial allocations of net groundwater discharge in a regional scale watershed this means that groundwater is more likely to discharge into rivers during rainy years however is more possible to discharge into regional great lakes during dry years according to our literature research this is the first time to reveal the potential effects of year scale climate on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges in areas possessing both regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river systems meanwhile compared to the backward particle tracking results of the dry year fig 8b the results of backward particle tracking under a rainy year climate showed that more nearshore groundwater around the poyang lake was recharged from the poyang lake in this rainy year fig 10 this is consistent with the conclusion of the lower net groundwater discharge into poyang lake in rainy year i e 1 26 108 m3 year than that in dry year i e 6 76 108 m3 year in conclusion our backward particle tracking results imply that a year scale climate can change the spatial distribution features of water interchange between groundwater and a regional scale floodplain lake in conclusion our results quantificationally revealed the effects of inter year climate or year scale climate on spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water including lake and rivers particularly the potential effects of year scale climate on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake were revealed these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on the spatial temporal variability of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and surface water in regional scale floodplain areas in addition the results of temporal varying water interchange amounts are important information for the evaluation of local water resources furthermore because groundwater surface water interactions can be the important delivery pathway of chemicals based on the end member hydrochemistry data of groundwater or surface water our results of varying water interchange amounts can be used to estimate the mass flux of anthropogenic pollutants such as nutrient and heavy metals transported between aquifer and surface water bodies lake and river in different seasons or years meanwhile the conclusion of larger water interchange amount induced by the rainy year can be used to explain reported phenomenon that nearshore water pollution is more serious under rainy climate chen 2012 deng et al 2014 rozemeijer et al 2021 6 limitations as shown in our results and those of previous studies guevara ochoa et al 2020b jolly et al 2008 the lake water level is a key controlling factor for water interchange between groundwater and surface water in a regional scale lake aquifer system in reality the water level of the poyang lake should be characterized by spatial variability showing a high water level in the southern area and a low water level in the northern area particularly in dry months however due to the difficulties in obtaining enough observed lake level data and in depicting the spatial distribution of the water level in such a large lake water level fluctuations of one hydrology station were assigned for the entire lake region in our model this simplification may affect the simulation of the water level distribution in the lake domain our modeling study primarily quantified the water interchange between groundwater and surface water and concluded the temporal patterns of the water exchange however the lack of sufficient data regarding nearshore groundwater level limits the discussion of the spatial variability of water exchange between groundwater and surface water in the future observations will be conducted in the nearshore areas despite these limitations our present study clearly revealed the climate effects on the spatial temporal variability patterns of the water interchange between groundwater and surface water in areas possessing regional scale floodplain lakes and complex river systems 7 conclusions using a numerical groundwater modeling approach in a typical large floodplain lake the poyang lake china the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater lake water interchange and that of the groundwater river water interchange were revealed meanwhile effects of the year scale climate on the water interchange and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake were gained the results revealed that the monthly water exchange between the groundwater and surface water exhibited significant temporal variability the water exchanges between groundwater and the poyang lake exhibit an inverse correlation with lake level and precipitation groundwater discharge into lake occurs during decline period of lake level and groundwater recharge from lake during rising period of lake level likewise the monthly water exchanges between groundwater and the five rivers also shows seasonal variability and an inverse correlation with precipitation however in one year the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the five rivers only features groundwater discharge into rivers for 2018 the simulated monthly groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 0 97 9 67 108 m3 month the simulated monthly groundwater recharge from the poyang lake was 0 07 2 54 108 m3 month the annual net groundwater discharge into the poyang lake was 6 76 108 m3 year and the annual water interchange amounts between groundwater and the poyang lake is 9 44 108 m3 year the simulated monthly groundwater discharge into the five rivers was 0 20 0 72 108 m3 month and the annual total groundwater discharge into rivers was 5 32 108 m3 year these results of the variable water interchange flux between groundwater and surface water in the poyang lake region can provide water quantity data for the local water resource evaluation meanwhile combined with end member hydrochemistry data of groundwater or surface water the results of the variable water interchange flux can be used to estimate the mass flux of anthropogenic pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals transported between aquifers and surface water bodies lake and river meanwhile our results reveal the effects of year scale climate on water interchange between groundwater and surface water and on the allocation pattern of net groundwater discharges into river and lake generally as the larger rainfall recharge for the study area in a rainy year a rainy year increases the total water interchange amount between groundwater and surface water however the rainy year can reduce the total net annual groundwater discharge into surface water in addition the allocations of net groundwater discharges into river and lake can be altered by the year scale climate change which show that groundwater is more likely to be discharged into rivers during the rainy year and is into regional scale lakes during the dry year these findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on spatial temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water in regional lake areas additionally the conclusion of a larger water interchange amount induced by the rainy year can be used to explain reported phenomenon that nearshore water pollution is more serious during rainy climate furthermore backward particle tracking simulation was able to identify the spatial distribution of water interchange between groundwater and regional scale lakes for the poyang lake area in a typical dry year the nearshore groundwater in the entire region is always discharged into the lake during the dry months while some nearshore groundwater e g groundwater in downstream areas of the ganjiang river gains recharge from the lake water during the rainy months rainy years can significantly alter the spatial distribution of the water interchange between groundwater and lake water thus leading to more nearshore groundwater being recharged by lake water during the rainy month in our future modeling study for water interchange between groundwater and surface water the spatial variability of the regional lake water level will be considered to further reveal the spatial variability of the water interchange in large floodplain lake areas in addition as the climate change has potential to alter the water interactions the future climate change projections under the general circulation models of coupled model intercomparison project phase six cmip6 will be applied in our future modeling study to discuss the long term temporal variability of water interchange in the poyang lake area credit
