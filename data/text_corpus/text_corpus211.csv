1055,the purpose of this article is to present the hydrographic and hydrochemical properties of the waters of old adits which drained excavations after exploitation of iron ores for this research both the natural springs and control object have been identified these are located in the cieszyn foothills it has been shown that adit water has a higher average electrolytic conductivity 600 µs cm than natural spring water 300 µs cm the increase in conductivity is undoubtedly influenced by the air supply to the excavations which accelerates the rock weathering process however the increase in water mineralisation has no effect on the hydrochemical type of water adit waters and spring waters represent the same bicarbonate calcium hco3 ca2 hydrochemical type adit waters show a small variation in water temperature in the annual cycle cv 8 compared to a natural spring cv 18 changes in the water temperature in the adits and the spring show high synchronism r 0 7 keywords springs mine water water adit hydrochemistry iron ore 1 introduction the main effect of underground mining is the creation of various excavations one of them can be adits according to sztelak 1998 an adit is a horizontal pavement with a gradient of 1 to 5 towards the outflow leading to the surface adits can perform various functions they are mostly used for gravitational drainage of excavations so they are water adits this type of objects are only built on a varied terrain when all mining works are performed above the level of an adit water adits usually end with canals which drain water to the nearest waterway despite the abandonment of mining works many of the adits are still an active element of drain formation these objects still have a gravitational outflow of mine waters currently research on this type of objects is not common that is why it is important to recognize their functioning mainly it refers to the shaping of physicochemical properties of their waters 2 study site the research describes the hydrographic and hydrochemical characteristics of two old and active adits associated with the exploitation of iron ores the adits are about 100 years old the exploitation of iron ore in this area was carried out until the 1940s these are adit szczurek and adit wąwóz located at the border of the silesian foothills and the silesian beskid s the iron ore was associated with flysch formation sandstone and slate in addition the physical and chemical properties of the spring waters from flysch have been analyzed the natural springs przykopa near przykopa stream is the control object which also poses a hydrochemical background for the adits outflows the aquifer of the spring is also associated with flysch sandstone and slate the research outflows are located in the cieszyn foothills fig

region consists of cieszyńska series with shales and cieszyn limestone kondracki 1998 3 methods hydrographic mapping help to assess the water conditions in the adits area it has been performed according to the gutry korycka and werner więckowska guidelines 1996 the measurement of ph temperature redox potential and electrolytic conductivity ec have been performed directly in the field using multiline p4 meters from wtw or professional plus ysi field measurements and samplings have been prepared in the zone of outflow from the adit or spring to the surface of this area for the chemical analysis water samples were collected directly into polyethylene bottles the bottles were then transported into the laboratory at the temperature of 4 c before the analysis the samples were filtered on a 0 45 µm filter millipore the laboratory analysis included marking of main cations and anions in the water ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 no3 po4 3 the chemical analysis of water was performed in accordance with polish standards pn 1971 2002 and standard methods recommendations twelve series of measurements were conducted for each sample from april 2016 to march 2017 the number of measurements which were included in the synthetic box charts was the same and was equal to n 12 the hydrochemical type of water was established based on the classification of szczukariew prikłoński macioszczyk 1983 the efficiency q l s of the tested outflows was measured using the volumetric method and the eijkelkamp flow valve rbc flume the collected data were subject to statistical analysis based on the methodology included in studies by runge 2006 and griffiths 2010 the significance level of statistical tests in the entire study was the p type one error which is less than 0 05 the data were presented with graphs box and whiskers plots fig 2 whenever the differences in the median significance of respective variables such as physical or chemical water parameters between the objects were compared they have been marked with the corresponding small letters a b c placed at the top of the figure different letters mean that the values differ significantly at p 0 05 4 results and discussion both the adits and the spring are located in a valley they are located on the slopes of the drainage basins of the mała czantoria massif water outflows are under the influence of gravity so they are descending outflows the efficiency of outflow adit szczurek varies from 0 3 to 0 5 l s on the other hand outflows wąwóz and przykopa have definitely less capacity 0 05 to 0 1 l s as is clear from the above the efficiency of outflows is very small but they are stable and exist throughout the year in accordance with the classification of szczukariew prikłoński the waters from all the studied outflows represent two ions bicarbonate calcium type hco3 ca2 the average chemical composition of water is shown in table 1 the most spectacular feature of water outflows from the adits is the process of precipitation of iron hydroxides iron ocher from their waters this is a consequence of a large concentration of iron compounds which in the adit s water szczurek equals to 0 2 mg l the process of precipitation of ocher carbonic can also be found in water outflows from other water diggings mainly coal mining molenda 2014a b adit s water can be characterized by shows an elevated manganese levels of 0 15 mg l the average value of the electrolytic conductivity of flow szczurek is 827 µs cm fig 3 it is medium mineralized water 0 5 g l high electrolytic conductivity values were also found in the flow wąwóz 700 µs cm a high level of this parameter in outflows szczurek and wąwóz is caused by their circulation in the spaces of old excavations the air supply to rock formation interior promotes the processes of rocks leaching migaszewski gałuszka 2016 it has a direct effect on the increase of water mineralization the smaller value of electrolytic conductivity was found in the spring przykopa 260 µs cm the aquifer layer consists of sandstones in the saturation zone the sandstones are poorly susceptible to the leaching process therefore low mineralization of water has occurred the electrolytic conductivity values from spring s water przykopa are comparable with those found in most springs from the flysch the area of underground drainage catchment drainage zones of both of the adits and the natural spring has the same geological structure shales predominates with the small proportion of sandstone szczegółowa 2012 both shales and sandstones can be limy there are also siderites in these deposits thus the geological structure which has a significant impact on the chemical composition of water should not affect the physicochemical properties of the adit waters and spring differentially therefore statistically significant differences between individual physicochemical parameters of the adit waters and spring mainly mineralization are a consequence of anthropogenic water drainage this is identified mainly with a violation of the structure of the rock mass and air supply to the underground excavation the higher electrolytic conductivity values can be observed only in the waters of the springs which drain formation with a large admixture of carbonates in such springs the electrolytic conductivity can exceed 400 µs cm krause et al 2015 molenda nejfeld 2016 the elevated values of the electrolytic conductivity of the adits waters with regards to natural springs are consistent with the molenda s conclusion 2014a b describing natural and anthropogenic groundwater outflows one distinctive feature of adit s water is also the occurrence of small variations in the mineralization of water on an annual basis the value of the coefficient variation was normally usually between 1 8 and 6 6 and in the natural spring it could reach up to 42 high variability can be explained by the fissured nature of the outflow this promotes rapid infiltration of rainwater which is not without impact on the large variability of electrolytic conductivity the ph of the test water was close to neutral and median value was from ph 6 8 in outflow szczurek up to ph 7 6 in spring przykopa fig 4 a very small water ph variation has been found in the studied outflows the variation did not exceed 4 the distinctive feature of the test adits was small variability of water temperature during the test fig 4 the coefficient temperature variations of anthropogenic outflows were equal to 8 and in case of natural spring 18 figure 5 very small temperature fluctuations have also been found by molenda 2011 2014a b with regards to other anthropogenic outflows even more interesting relations have been found by analysing the synchronicity of water temperature changes between the adit s outflows and the natural spring table 2 as shown in table 2 there is a significant rxy 0 6 and high rxy 0 8 degree of dependence between the temperature changes in natural and anthropogenic outflows this indicates that anthropogenic outflows react in a similar way to atmospheric changes just as natural springs do high synchronicity of temperature changes in natural and anthropogenic outflows was also found by molenda 2007 2014a 5 conclusions the conclusion of this study is that a result of mining excavations the mineralization of groundwater increases this is the consequence of air supplies to the excavation which accelerates the process of rock weathering however the increase of mineralization does not affect the change of the type of hydrochemical water large synchronicity of water temperature changes between anthropogenic outflows and natural springs proves that anthropogenic outflows respond in a similar way to meteorological

1056,the paper summarises the results of floristic studies of the largest springs in the border zone between the western roztocze highlands and lublin upland with particular emphasis on the proper crenophytes in the vegetation season 2015 the investigations were conducted in 25 separate niches of 18 springs for each object habitat characteristics of the spring niche including ecosystem stressors and spring flora features were analysed the assessment of the naturalness of the spring was based on the values of the coefficients of flora crenophytisation and neophytisation the flora of the analysed objects comprised 170 species with 146 vascular plants and 24 bryophytes which included 3 archeophytes old comers and 7 kenophytes new comers the values of crenophytisation coefficients both in terms of species richness and species coverage were higher than the values of neophytisation coefficients generally the flora of the spring niches is influenced by habitat factors such as light and trophy which are modified by disturbances flooding increases the number and abundance of proper crenophytes and enhances habitat trophy anthropogenic stressors associated with the character of the niche surroundings and the degree of transformation thereof improve the light conditions thereby enhancing the species richness of proper crenophytes keywords crenophytes coefficient of crenophytisation neophytisation transformations of spring niches anthropogenic disturbances 1 introduction springs are forms of natural groundwater discharges to the ground surface creating a visible flow pazdro 1983 kresic 2010 given the specificity of their place in the water cycle springs are unique links between the underground and aboveground as well as inanimate and animate world called water pearls at the border between terra and hades jokiel 2007 springs are crucial interfaces within the earth s critical zone connecting geomorphological pedolological and hydrological processes e g precipitation evapotranspiration deposition surface runoff groundwater runoff vertical and lateral water exchange etc lin et al 2006 richter and mobley 2009 lin 2010 reiss and chifflard 2017 due to

ecosystems cantonati et al 2012 also the springs of the roztocze region south east poland are well explored in terms of hydrology and hydrochemistry but the knowledge of the vegetation cover in these objects is still incomplete and fragmentary e g janiec 1984 1997 michalczyk 2001 czarnecka and janiec 2002 2007 czarnecka 2009a czarnecka 2009b springs are unique habitats that contribute to local and regional biodiversity species biocoenosis and ecosystem diversity they are small but highly diverse and productive ecosystems insular hotspots harbouring specialists as well as aquatic and hydrophilous generalists stevens and springer 2004 cantonati et al 2012 reiss and chifflard 2017 due to the close terrestrial aquatic linkage spring ecosystems tend to be very sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances regarding impacts from their surrounding catchments in headwater regions reiss and chifflard 2017 stevens and springer 2004 described different kinds of anthropogenic stressors that can affect spring variables for instance anthropogenic climate change can reduce precipitation infiltration and aquifer dynamics urbanisation leads to an increase in impervious surface area over an aquifer mining can involve ground and surface water abstraction and pollution of waters can reduce the quality of spring ecosystems the authors pointed also to such interferences to spring niches as large ungulate foraging and trampling stronger effects are caused by human activity economic utilisation of springs damming up spring waters recreational use trampling trodding etc all of which lead to devastation of spring niches removing vegetation cover altering plant and animal assemblages through invasion by alien non native species increasing erosion and contaminating surface water stevens and springer 2004 and literature cited therein despite the importance for biodiversity and water quality springs are insufficiently covered by protective legislation often resulting in the destruction of their natural habitat stevens and springer 2004 cantonati et al 2012 many examples of human exploitation and interference within spring niches were also reported earlier for some objects of the roztocze region it has been showed rather low ecological awareness among spring users and low effectiveness of spring protection as nature monuments czarnecka 2009b chabudziński and czarnecka 2015 the aim of the study was 1 to determine the floristic diversity of the largest springs in the border zone between the western roztocze and lublin upland in relation to the basic features of their regime and selected morphometric characteristics of spring niches 2 to assess the degree of naturalness or anthropogenisation of the spring complexes depending on the location of the objects and 3 to indicate major anthropogenic stressors and their consequences to transformation of the spring flora 2 study area according to the physico geographical division of poland developed by solon et al 2018 the study area is located at the border between two mesoregions fig 1 urzędowskie heights lublin upland macroregion and western roztocze roztocze macroregion this zone combines elements characteristic for the hydrogeology of the two regions the bedrock is composed of late cretaceous and miocene formations most frequently these are solid carbonate rocks with locally emerging sand and clay formations the late cretaceous and miocene formations are covered by quaternary rocks wągrowski 1992 1996 in the study area there is a primary groundwater reservoir drained by springs recharged by three aquifers cretaceous neogene and quaternary malinowski 1974 michalczyk 2001 the mean annual air temperature in the area is approx 7 5 c july with a mean temperature of 18 3 c is the hottest month and january with the mean temperature of 3 0 c is the coldest kaszewski et al 2015 the vegetation period begins in the first decade of april and ends at the end of october its average length is 218 days zinkiewicz and zinkiewicz 1975 springs are usually located in areas where the terrain surface is incised by an aquifer typically these areas are characterised by high denivelation values varied lithology and a dense network of fractures in hard formations such as carbonate rocks the roztocze macroregion which is distinguished by its number of springs and their discharge yield the greatest discharge values from the range 100 300 dm3 s 1 fulfils these criteria and is one of the most valuable crenological regions in poland chełmicki et al 2011 the western roztocze and lublin upland border zone has been well explored in terms of hydrology and hydrogeology but no detailed hydrobiological investigations of this region have been conducted this border zone between the two macroregions is characterised by the presence of high discharge springs recharged with waters circulating in the late cretaceous and neogene carbonate rocks janiec 1984 1997 michalczyk 2001 depending on the geological conditions springs function as single objects with large discharge or form zones with an area of several tens of meters of many outflows with low discharge michalczyk 2001 chabudziński 2009 3 material and methods the study involved 18 easily accessible previously investigated springs characterised by varied recharge and drainage conditions table 1 they include springs with single fissure outflows situated in one spring niche or objects with outflows located at different distances from each other and forming distinct niches the latter type is referred to as a spring complex pazdro 1983 however given the current nomenclature in regional literature e g malinowski 1974 janiec 1984 1997 michalczyk 2001 we use the notion spring in this paper depending on the location of the outflows within one spring 1 to 5 niches were distinguished and regarded as separate study objects we understand the niche as a concavity on the slope or at its foot in a form of a funnel or a small cavern resulting from the erosive and suffosive activity of spring waters moniewski 2007 after matthess and ubell 1983 this definition also applies to springs located on the valley bottom as they form cavities likewise the springs mentioned above although they are much less visible see appendix a phot 3 consequently 25 separate niches were distinguished in 18 springs table 1 the analysed springs are located in 13 river catchments of different orders and at different altitudes from 196 m a s l olb spring to 248 m a s l mal and gor depending on the location the springs drain the late cretaceous and or neogenic rocks springs with descending and descending ascending water outflows dominate table 1 for each niche we analysed some morphometric features water table surface in the bottom of the niche aspect denivelation solar radiation reaching the bottom of the niche characteristics of the spring regime mean discharge discharge coefficient of variation conductivity temperature ph susceptibility to flooding the degree of anthropogenisation of the niche and plant species composition tables 2 3 the aspect and denivelation were calculated with the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 m which was generated based on data provided by light detection and ranging lidar with the aspect and zonal statistic tools the solar radiation srad was calculated for the vegetation season april october with the solar radiation tool which calculates insolation across a landscape or for specific locations based on methods from the hemispherical viewshed algorithm cf czarnecka and chabudziński 2014 the calculations were performed using arcgis 10 3 1 software the selected regime traits were determined based on monthly observations of spring discharge carried out between november 2008 and october 2014 after ł chabudziński unpubl data the measurements were performed using an ott nautilus c 2000 electromagnetic flow sensor based on the mean discharge the springs were classified into meinzer classes 1923 after pazdro 1983 and the coefficient of variation cv was used for assessment of the discharge variability in july 2015 water temperature ph and specific electrolytic conductivity sec were measured with an elmetron cp 461 multi parameter sensor the measurements were made in each visible outflow in the spring niche which in total yielded 80 measurements of each measured parameter a 4 grade scale was used to determine the susceptibility to flooding flood associated with the inflow of alien waters into the niche due to local floods or snowmelt and after intense spring and summer rainfalls this scale was developed based on own observations ł chabudziński unpubl data and the morphological location of the springs tables 2 3 in terms of the condition each niche was assigned a natural or anthropogenic antr character this trait was assessed using a 3 grade scale the characteristics of springs are also determined by the mode of their use therefore a 3 grade scale of the anthropogenic transformation of spring niches trans was adopted tables 2 3 appendix a in the full vegetation season 2015 the 1st and 2nd decades of july lists of taxa of vascular plants and bryophytes of 25 spring niches were compiled but supplementary data on spring flora were collected in all the season april october the nomenclature followed mirek et al 2002 and ochyra et al 2003 the share of vascular plants and bryophytes in the bottom of the niche with a ca 1 m slope band i e within the niche flooding range was determined with the use of a simplified 4 grade combined assessment scale czarnecka 2009b for details see table 3 the entire flora was regarded as spring vegetation in accordance with the hydrobiological definition of a spring as a specific spring phytocomplex e g matuszkiewicz j m 1978 wołejko 1991 additionally the number of geographical and historical elements in the vascular flora was determined after tokarska guzik et al 2012 and in bryophytes after ochyra 1983 plant species were identified and classified into 4 categories of crenophytes kucharski 2007 sołtys lelek et al 2014 supplemented by b czarnecka unpubl data 1 obligatory crenophytes ocs 2 facultative crenophytes fcs 3 indifferent crenophytes ics 4 accidental crenophytes acs the first two categories ocs fcs were joined into one category of proper crenophytes pcs and recognised as aquatic and hydrophilous specialists the other ones can be considered generalists sensu brown 1984 novotný 1991 van tienderen 1991 the assessment of the naturalness of the spring niches was based on the values of the coefficient of flora crenophytisation cc and neophytisation cn the coefficients are transformed coefficients of flora synanthropisation olaczek 1974 łaska 2001 and were calculated for both the entire flora and each spring niche see table 3 ecological requirements were determined for the spring flora based on the ecological indicator values zarzycki et al 2002 berg 2011 three indicators were considered light l trophy tr and water soil reaction r in the absence of an indicator in zarzycki s list ellenberg numbers ellenberg et al 1991 were used and transformed according to the key proposed by roo zielińska 2012 for each spring niche the weighted average wa of the aforementioned ecological indicators was calculated with a formula proposed by czarnecka and chabudziński 2014 w a i 1 n a 2 i i 1 n a 2 i where wa is the weighted average ai is the abundance of cover of the i th species in a given niche ii is the ecological indicator value for the i th species and n is the number of species in the niche the entire flora of the studied niches was analysed in terms of the species cover using the detrended correspondence analysis dca with a data gradient of 3 6 sd the other data gradient 1 8 sd were standardised and used for the principal component analysis pca the share of pcs expressed by the coefficients of crenophytisation were regarded as dependent variables the other spring niche traits were independent explanatory variables they constituted three complementary groups the first one comprised the habitat characteristics of the spring niche and its surroundings the age of the rocks rock denivelation den niche exposure exp solar radiation srad niche surface area area the degree of anthropogenisation of the surroundings antr the degree of niche transformation trans and susceptibility to flooding flood the last three variables were recognised ecosystem stressors influencing the spring flora diversity the second group consisted of the physico chemical properties of water ph temperature t and conductivity sec and the third group was composed of the mean spring discharge values q and its coefficient of variation cv additionally the analysis included wa of the ecological indicators l tr r in order to assess the flora requirements of the spring complexes the assessment of the effect of the aforementioned factors on the abundance and coverage of proper crenophytes in the niche was based on ordination methods employed with the use of the mvsp 3 21 package kovach 1999 4 results 4 1 spring characters in terms of the mean discharge values the analysed springs represent discharge classes iv and iii the highest discharge values were noted for the abr gor and mal springs whereas the lowest value was found for the god spring the discharge coefficient of variation cv was in the range of 8 7 43 5 the most stable discharge was reported for the dąb spring while its

connecting water and its related matter and energy at different scales from the microscopic to the macroscopic level however the advancement of hydrobiological investigations of springs still differs from the level achieved by hydrological and hydrochemical research e g baścik and chełmicki 2004 2006 jokiel et al 2007 chełmicki et al 2011 cantonati et al 2012 reiss and chifflard 2017 although regional studies of the characteristics of spring flora in poland have recently been carried out only few of them describe areas with a similar geological character age of aquifer rocks or location absolute altitude of outflows nevertheless some examples from other physico geographical regions are worth mentioning to illustrate the richness of the flora of the study springs located in the border zone between the western roztocze and lublin upland in total 126 species with 111 vascular plants and 15 bryophytes were found in the bottoms of 23 springs of the escarpment zone of the łódzkie

and siliceous substrata in comparison with all aforementioned data the species richness of the 170 species recorded in the 25 active spring niches in the western roztocze escarpment zone at a very narrow absolute altitude range should be considered high especially since the investigations were limited to the niche bottoms with a ca 1 meter band according to the classification of crenophytes adopted in this study after kucharski 2007 sołtys lelek et al 2014 and b czarnecka unpubl data the flora of spring niches of the onp sołtys lelek et al 2014 was characterised by a higher mean share of pcs i e 26 species 20 3 of total flora including 5 ocs 3 9 and 21 fcs 16 4 than that reported in this study however in 16 niches analysed in the present study the share of pcs exceeded 20 even up to 52 94 the coefficient of crenophytisation ccr of the onp springs was higher for bryoflora 37 5 vs 17 86 for vascular flora as in the springs of the northern escarpment zone of the roztocze the springs of the veronica beccabunga glyceria plicata berula erecta type in the escarpment zone of the łódzkie heights janiak 2004 similar to the springs of the study area in terms of the floristic composition and physiognomy exhibited 4 ocs and 20 fcs i e in total 24 pcs ccr 19 for the entire flora however the coefficient of crenophytisation for vascular flora ccr 19 82 was substantially higher than that for bryoflora ccr 13 33 as in the area investigated in the present study the level of crenophytisation of the individual springs is highly varied for instance in the rosanów spring which is the

occurred in small forest springs of the southern escarpment zone of the roztocze czarnecka 2009b springs of the escarpment zone of the łódzkie heights janiak 2004 and in the onp sołtys lelek et al 2014 in comparison with the spring objects from upland areas the flora of mountain regions is less similar to the flora of the springs analysed in our study mainly due to the differences in the vertical distribution of species at higher altitudes in montane forest and upper zones particularly in the subalpine and alpine belts where siliceous habitats are more common than calcareous ones the share of bryophytes in the spring flora is increased zechmeister and mucina 1994 matuszkiewicz w 2008 in the western part of the western beskidy mts krause and wika 2009 only 19 of 260 species

regions of europe zechmeister and mucina 1994 mogna et al 2015 and therefore it can be considered a specialist of specialists on a regional scale the crenophytisation coefficient for the entire flora inhabiting the springs in the polish tatra mts smieja 2014 was 9 62 and higher values were recorded for bryoflora ccr 12 61 than for vascular flora ccr 7 03 c amara was the only crenophile species oc

1994 matuszkiewicz w 2008 krause and wika 2009 smieja 2014 mogna et al 2015 as shown by the ordination analyses the light and trophy indicators turned out to be the key ecological factors determining the number of pcs in the study springs this result suggests the presence of two groups of species with different light requirements in the flora a species preferring semi shade with l 3 and b species preferring moderate light intensity with l 4 ellenberg et al 1991 zarzycki et al 2002 berg 2011 the increasing l values are clearly associated with the higher degree of anthropogenisation antr and transformation trans of the spring niche forest niches surrounded by compact tree stands have the lowest l values such species were called oligophotic zechmeister and mucina 1994 in the case of niches associated with open meadow habitats non forest niches and those located in open and built up areas anthropogenic niches the l indicator has moderate or maximum values good light conditions promote the occurrence of pcs the great importance of light conditions for the spring water chemistry and spring flora has been confirmed by results reported by other authors audorff et al 2011 sołtys lelek et al 2014 gawenda kempczyńska 2016 kosmowska et al 2016 jasik et al 2017 in terms of trophic requirements the flora of the study niches is characterised by greater uniformity the tr values indicate moderately and highly eutrophic habitats the habitat richness gradient is associated with the susceptibility to flooding flood non flooded or sporadically flooded niches exhibit the lowest tr values regular flooding once or twice a year promotes the occurrence of pcs very frequent flooding leads to excessive eutrophication of the habitat and a small number and coverage of pcs in terms of acidity the analysed flora represents habitats with neutral reaction values ellenberg et al 1991 zarzycki et al 2002 the acidity gradient does not exert a direct impact on the spring flora but improves nutrient availability wheeler and proctor 2000 audorff et al 2011 generally the flora of the spring niches in the study area is influenced by habitat factors such as light and trophy which are modified by disturbances flooding increases the number and abundance of pcs and enhances habitat trophy anthropogenic disturbances associated with the character of the niche surroundings antr and the degree of transformation thereof trans improve the light conditions thereby enhancing the species richness of pcs concurrently they facilitate encroachment of alien species stevens and springer 2004 which can be competitive and contribute to loss of the most valuable flora elements the springs of the studied zone exhibit signs of neophytisation of the flora e g the increasing share of

1056,the paper summarises the results of floristic studies of the largest springs in the border zone between the western roztocze highlands and lublin upland with particular emphasis on the proper crenophytes in the vegetation season 2015 the investigations were conducted in 25 separate niches of 18 springs for each object habitat characteristics of the spring niche including ecosystem stressors and spring flora features were analysed the assessment of the naturalness of the spring was based on the values of the coefficients of flora crenophytisation and neophytisation the flora of the analysed objects comprised 170 species with 146 vascular plants and 24 bryophytes which included 3 archeophytes old comers and 7 kenophytes new comers the values of crenophytisation coefficients both in terms of species richness and species coverage were higher than the values of neophytisation coefficients generally the flora of the spring niches is influenced by habitat factors such as

hydrophilous generalists stevens and springer 2004 cantonati et al 2012 reiss and chifflard 2017 due to the close terrestrial aquatic linkage spring ecosystems tend to be very sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances regarding impacts from their surrounding catchments in headwater regions reiss and chifflard 2017 stevens and springer 2004 described different kinds of anthropogenic stressors that can affect spring variables for instance anthropogenic climate change can reduce precipitation infiltration and aquifer dynamics urbanisation leads to an increase in impervious surface area over an aquifer mining can involve ground and surface water abstraction and pollution of waters can reduce the quality of spring ecosystems the authors pointed also to such interferences to spring niches as large ungulate foraging and trampling stronger effects are caused by human activity economic utilisation of springs damming up spring waters recreational use trampling trodding etc all of which lead to devastation of spring niches removing vegetation cover altering plant and animal assemblages through invasion by alien non native species increasing erosion and contaminating surface water stevens and springer 2004 and literature cited therein despite the importance for biodiversity and water quality springs are insufficiently covered by protective legislation often resulting in the destruction of their natural habitat stevens and springer 2004 cantonati et al 2012 many examples of human exploitation and interference within spring niches were also reported earlier for some objects of the roztocze region it has been showed rather low ecological awareness among spring users and low effectiveness of spring protection as nature monuments czarnecka 2009b chabudziński and czarnecka 2015 the aim of the study was 1 to determine the floristic diversity of the largest springs in the border zone between the western roztocze and lublin upland in relation to the basic features of their regime and selected morphometric characteristics of spring niches 2 to assess the degree of naturalness or anthropogenisation of the spring complexes depending on the location of the objects and 3 to indicate major anthropogenic stressors and their consequences to transformation of the spring flora 2 study area according to the physico geographical division of poland developed by solon et al 2018 the study area is located at the border between two mesoregions fig 1 urzędowskie heights lublin upland macroregion and western roztocze roztocze macroregion this zone combines elements characteristic for the hydrogeology of the two regions the bedrock is composed of late cretaceous and miocene formations most frequently these are solid carbonate rocks with locally emerging sand and clay formations the late cretaceous and miocene formations are covered by quaternary rocks wągrowski 1992 1996 in the study area there is a primary groundwater reservoir drained by springs recharged by three aquifers cretaceous neogene and quaternary malinowski 1974 michalczyk 2001 the mean annual air temperature in the area is approx 7 5 c july with a mean temperature of 18 3 c is the hottest month and january with the mean temperature of 3 0 c is the coldest kaszewski et al 2015 the vegetation period begins in the first decade of april and ends at the end of october its average length is 218 days zinkiewicz and zinkiewicz 1975 springs are usually located in areas where the terrain surface is incised by an aquifer typically these areas are characterised by high denivelation values varied lithology and a dense network of fractures in hard formations such as carbonate rocks the roztocze macroregion which is distinguished by its number of springs and their discharge yield the greatest discharge values from the range 100 300 dm3 s 1 fulfils these criteria and is one of the most valuable crenological regions in poland chełmicki et al 2011 the western roztocze and lublin upland border zone has been well explored in terms of hydrology and hydrogeology but no detailed hydrobiological investigations of this region have been conducted this border zone between the two macroregions is characterised by the presence of high discharge springs recharged with waters circulating in the late cretaceous and neogene carbonate rocks janiec 1984 1997 michalczyk 2001 depending on the geological conditions springs function as single objects with large discharge or form zones with an area of several tens of meters of many outflows with low discharge michalczyk 2001 chabudziński 2009 3 material and methods the study involved 18 easily accessible previously investigated springs characterised by varied recharge and drainage conditions table 1 they include springs with single fissure outflows situated in one spring niche or objects with outflows located at different distances from each other and forming distinct niches the latter type is referred to as a spring complex pazdro 1983 however given the current nomenclature in regional literature e g malinowski 1974 janiec 1984 1997 michalczyk 2001 we use the notion spring in this paper depending on the location of the outflows within one spring 1 to 5 niches were distinguished and regarded as separate study objects we understand the niche as a concavity on the slope or at its foot in a form of a funnel or a small cavern resulting from the erosive and suffosive activity of spring waters moniewski 2007 after matthess and ubell 1983 this definition also applies to springs located on the valley bottom as they form cavities likewise the springs mentioned above although they are much less visible see appendix a phot 3 consequently 25 separate niches were distinguished in 18 springs table 1 the analysed springs are located in 13 river catchments of different orders and at different altitudes from 196 m a s l olb spring to 248 m a s l mal and gor depending on the

july 2015 water temperature ph and specific electrolytic conductivity sec were measured with an elmetron cp 461 multi parameter sensor the measurements were made in each visible outflow in the spring niche which in total yielded 80 measurements of each measured parameter a 4 grade scale was used to determine the susceptibility to flooding flood associated with the inflow of alien waters into the niche due to local floods or snowmelt and after intense spring and summer rainfalls this scale was developed based on own observations ł chabudziński unpubl data and the morphological location of the springs tables 2 3 in terms of the condition each niche was assigned a natural or anthropogenic antr character this trait was assessed using a 3 grade scale the characteristics of springs are also determined by the mode of their use therefore a 3 grade scale of the anthropogenic transformation of spring niches trans was adopted tables 2 3 appendix a in the full vegetation season 2015 the 1st and 2nd decades of july lists of taxa of vascular plants and bryophytes of 25 spring niches were compiled but supplementary data on spring flora were collected in all the season april october the nomenclature followed mirek et al 2002 and ochyra et al 2003 the share of vascular plants and bryophytes in the bottom of the niche with a ca 1 m slope band i e within the niche flooding range was determined with the use of a simplified 4 grade combined assessment scale czarnecka 2009b for details see table 3 the entire flora was regarded as spring vegetation in accordance with the hydrobiological definition of a spring as a specific spring phytocomplex e g matuszkiewicz j m 1978 wołejko 1991 additionally the number of geographical and historical elements in the vascular flora was determined after tokarska guzik et al 2012 and in bryophytes after ochyra 1983 plant species were identified and classified into 4 categories of crenophytes kucharski 2007 sołtys lelek et al 2014 supplemented by b czarnecka unpubl data 1 obligatory crenophytes ocs 2 facultative crenophytes fcs 3 indifferent crenophytes ics 4 accidental crenophytes acs the first two categories ocs fcs were joined into one category of proper crenophytes pcs and recognised as aquatic and hydrophilous specialists the other ones can be considered generalists sensu brown 1984 novotný 1991 van tienderen 1991 the assessment of the naturalness of the spring niches was based on the values of the coefficient of flora crenophytisation cc and neophytisation cn the coefficients are transformed coefficients of flora synanthropisation olaczek 1974 łaska 2001 and were calculated for both the entire flora and each spring niche see table 3 ecological requirements were determined for the spring flora based on the ecological indicator values zarzycki et al 2002 berg 2011 three indicators were considered light l trophy tr and water soil reaction r in the absence of an indicator in zarzycki s list ellenberg numbers ellenberg et al 1991 were used and transformed according to the key proposed by roo zielińska 2012 for each spring niche the weighted average wa of the aforementioned ecological indicators was calculated with a formula proposed by czarnecka and chabudziński 2014 w a i 1 n a 2 i i 1 n a 2 i where wa is the weighted average ai is the abundance of cover of the i th species in a given niche ii is the ecological indicator value for the i th species and n is the number of species in the niche the entire flora of the studied niches was analysed in terms of the species cover using the detrended correspondence analysis dca with a data gradient of 3 6 sd the other data gradient 1 8 sd were standardised and used for the principal component analysis pca the share of pcs expressed by the coefficients of crenophytisation were regarded as dependent variables the other spring niche traits were independent explanatory variables they constituted three complementary groups the first one comprised the habitat characteristics of the spring niche and its surroundings the age of the rocks rock denivelation den niche exposure exp solar radiation srad niche surface area area the degree of anthropogenisation of the surroundings antr the degree of niche transformation trans and susceptibility to flooding flood the last three variables were recognised ecosystem stressors influencing the spring flora diversity the second group consisted of the physico chemical properties of water ph temperature t and conductivity sec and the third group was composed of the mean spring discharge values q and its coefficient of variation cv additionally the analysis included wa of the ecological indicators l tr r in order to assess the flora requirements of the spring complexes the assessment of the effect of the aforementioned factors on the abundance and coverage of proper crenophytes in the niche was based on ordination methods employed with the use of the mvsp 3 21 package kovach 1999 4

connecting water and its related matter and energy at different scales from the microscopic to the macroscopic level however the advancement of hydrobiological investigations of springs still differs from the level achieved by hydrological and hydrochemical research e g baścik and chełmicki 2004 2006 jokiel et al 2007 chełmicki et al 2011 cantonati et al 2012 reiss and chifflard 2017 although regional studies of the characteristics of spring flora in poland have recently been carried out only few of them describe areas with a similar geological character age of aquifer rocks or location absolute altitude of outflows nevertheless some examples from other physico geographical regions are worth mentioning to illustrate the richness of the flora of the study springs located in the border zone between the western roztocze and lublin upland in total 126 species with 111 vascular plants and 15 bryophytes were found in the bottoms of 23 springs of the escarpment zone of the łódzkie

physiognomy to our study objects in the ojców national park onp the silesia cracow upland sołtys lelek et al 2014 recorded similar species richness i e in total 128 species including 112 vascular plants and 16 bryophytes within 49 active niche zones of the late jurassic springs altitudes 285 481 m a s l in turn krause and wika 2009 found 260 species 179 vascular plants and 81 bryophytes in 278 phytosociological relevés taken in spring niches of the western part of the western beskidy mts western carpathians at a high altitude range 400 1475 m a s l studies of the flora and vegetation of 179 springs in the polish tatra mts were conducted at an even higher altitude i e 900 1960 m a s l smieja 2014 the author identified 239 plant taxa 128 vascular plants 111 bryophytes both on calcareous and siliceous substrata in comparison with all aforementioned data the species richness of the 170 species recorded in the 25 active spring niches in the western roztocze escarpment zone at a very narrow absolute altitude range should be considered high especially since the investigations were limited to the niche bottoms with a ca 1 meter band according to the classification of crenophytes adopted in this study after kucharski 2007 sołtys lelek et al 2014 and b czarnecka unpubl data the flora of spring niches of the onp sołtys lelek et al 2014 was characterised by a higher mean share of pcs i e 26 species 20 3 of total flora including 5 ocs 3 9 and 21 fcs 16 4 than that reported in this study however in 16 niches analysed in the present study the share of pcs exceeded 20 even up to 52 94 the coefficient of crenophytisation ccr of the onp springs was higher for bryoflora 37 5 vs 17 86 for vascular flora as in the springs of the northern escarpment zone of the roztocze the springs of the veronica beccabunga glyceria plicata berula erecta type in the escarpment zone of the łódzkie heights janiak 2004 similar to the springs of the study area in terms of the floristic composition and physiognomy exhibited 4 ocs and 20 fcs i e in total 24 pcs ccr 19 for the entire flora however the coefficient of crenophytisation for vascular flora ccr 19 82 was substantially higher than that for bryoflora ccr 13 33 as in the area investigated in the present study the level of crenophytisation of the individual springs is highly varied for instance in the rosanów spring which is the largest in this escarpment zone q 41 dm3 s 1 ph 7 3 t 9 2 c there were 13 pcs ccr 44 83 with two ocs among vascular plants berula erecta and veronica beccabunga janiak and moniewski 2001 janiak 2004

common among frequent and abundant fcs e g cardamine amara chrysosplenium alternifolium epilobium hirsutum e parviflorum e roseum glyceria notata mentha longifolia myosotis palustris scirpus

central european highlands zechmeister and mucina 1994 of the three bryophyte among the ocs noted in the study area cratoneuron filicinium pellia epiphylla and palustriella decipiens the first two occurred in small forest springs of the southern escarpment zone of the roztocze czarnecka 2009b springs of the escarpment zone of the łódzkie heights janiak 2004 and in the onp sołtys lelek et al 2014 in comparison with the spring objects from upland areas the flora of mountain regions is less similar to the flora of the springs analysed in our study mainly due to the differences in the vertical distribution of species at higher altitudes in montane forest and upper zones particularly in the subalpine and alpine belts where siliceous habitats are more common than calcareous ones the share of bryophytes in the spring flora is increased zechmeister and mucina 1994 matuszkiewicz w 2008 in the western part of the western beskidy mts krause and wika 2009 only 19 of 260 species

s l the two latter mosses were more common and frequent in various types of european spring communities zechmeister and mucina 1994 the vascular fcs were more frequent in spring phytocomplexes of lower mountain areas of the western beskidy mts primarily at 600 1000 m a s l chrysosplenium alternifolium less frequently up to 1270 m a s l and cardamine amara exceptionally to 1315 m a s l these two species are also characteristic for the springs of the other european mountains e g vosges or the slovakian and romanian carpathians zechmeister and mucina 1994 in turn the oc v beccabunga was recorded much less frequently 700 830 m a s l and b erecta was not found in the spring complexes of the western beskidy krause and wika 2009 the latter oc was also absent in springs of the other regions of europe zechmeister and mucina 1994 mogna et al 2015 and therefore it can be considered a specialist of specialists on a regional scale the crenophytisation coefficient for the entire flora inhabiting the springs in the polish tatra mts smieja 2014 was 9 62 and higher values were recorded for bryoflora ccr 12 61 than for vascular flora ccr 7 03 c amara was the only crenophile species oc common for the tatra springs and the zone analysed in this study and there were several common species classified as fcs ch alternifolium ics impatiens noli tangere ranunculus repens urtica dioica and

in turn the other crenophytes of the genera cratoneuron e g c commutatum c falcatum c decipiens and palustriella p commutata p falcata were absent in the highland region studied they were widely distributed even on ample elevation gradients in the alps and carpathians particularly on non limestone bedrocks as well as in calcareous springs in norway sweden and scotland zechmeister and mucina 1994 matuszkiewicz w 2008 krause and wika 2009 smieja 2014 mogna et al 2015 as shown by the ordination analyses the light and trophy indicators turned out to be the key ecological factors determining the number of pcs in the study springs this result suggests the presence of two groups of species with different light requirements in the flora a species preferring semi shade with l 3 and b species preferring moderate light intensity with l 4 ellenberg et al 1991 zarzycki et al 2002 berg 2011 the increasing l values are clearly associated with the higher degree of anthropogenisation antr and transformation trans of the spring niche forest niches surrounded by compact tree stands have the lowest l values such species were called oligophotic zechmeister and mucina 1994 in the case of niches associated with open meadow habitats non forest niches and those located in open and built up areas anthropogenic niches the l indicator has moderate or maximum values good light conditions promote the occurrence of pcs the great importance of light conditions for the spring water chemistry and spring flora has been confirmed by results reported by other authors audorff et al 2011 sołtys lelek et al 2014 gawenda kempczyńska 2016 kosmowska et al 2016 jasik et al 2017 in terms of trophic requirements the flora of the study niches is characterised by greater uniformity the tr values indicate moderately and highly eutrophic habitats the habitat richness gradient is associated with the susceptibility to flooding flood non flooded or sporadically flooded niches exhibit the lowest tr values regular flooding once or twice a year promotes the occurrence of pcs very frequent flooding leads to excessive eutrophication of the habitat and a small number and coverage of pcs in terms of acidity the analysed flora represents habitats with neutral reaction values ellenberg et al 1991 zarzycki et al 2002 the acidity gradient does not exert a direct impact on the spring flora but improves nutrient availability wheeler and proctor 2000 audorff et al 2011 generally the flora of the spring niches in the study area is influenced by habitat factors such as light and trophy which are modified by disturbances flooding increases the number and abundance of pcs and enhances habitat trophy anthropogenic disturbances associated with the character of the niche surroundings antr and the degree of transformation thereof trans improve the light conditions thereby enhancing the species richness of pcs concurrently they facilitate encroachment of alien species stevens and springer 2004 which can be competitive and contribute to loss of the most valuable flora elements the springs of the studied zone exhibit signs of neophytisation of the flora e g the increasing share of

spring flora is the presence of alien species the impacts of anthropopressure in the roztocze region drainage of spring catchments damming up spring waters in the so called small retention objects economic utilisation of springs penetration and pollution of niches trodding grazing etc lead to neophytisation and ruderalisation of the spring vegetation czarnecka 2009b chabudziński and czarnecka

efficiencies of the ecotechnologies in context we compared them with those of common agri environmental mitigation measures bmps in the three countries as reported by arheimer et al 2004 piniewski et al 2014 and puustinen et al 2019 2 material methods 2 1 case study catchments 2 1 1 vantaanjoki the vantaanjoki catchment 1688 km2 in southern finland belongs to the cold boreal region the 101 km long vantaanjoki river drains the watershed into the gulf of finland of the baltic sea fig 1 the average annual precipitation is 660 mm a 1 the mean surface gradient is 1 7 m km 1 the land elevation ranges between 0 and 150 m a s l the highest altitudes being in the northern parts of the catchment reliefs and moraines are present in the north mostly covered by forest agricultural land is predominant in the central parts of the catchment with flat or slightly hilly terrain and clayey soils agricultural areas 24 and forests 56 including peatlands 0 5 are dominant land use classes due to low lake percentage 2 the concentrations and transports of organic matter and nutrients in the river are not largely influenced by lake retention mattsson et al 2015 seventeen percent of the catchment is under urban land use the soils in the vantaanjoki catchment are largely clayey 40 and moraine sandy 40 at the vantaanjoki river outlet the average 2000 2016 flow is 15 6 m3 s 1 and it ranges between 1 and 176 m3 s 1 the vantaanjoki river flows through the helsinki metropolitan area with 1 2 million people thus the river has significant recreational value within the catchment there are four major wastewater treatment plants wwtps with emissions into the river these wwtps serve the municipalities of riihimäki 30 000 inhabitants hyvinkää 47 000 inhabitants and nurmijärvi 43 000 inhabitants in all these point sources account for 4 of tp and 12 of tn loading from the vantaanjoki catchment into the gulf of finland vemala model huttunen et al 2016 within the catchment there are 35 000 people living in properties not connected to the sewer networks i e with onsite wastewater treatment 2 1 2 fyrisån the fyrisån catchment 1982 km2 is located in the south eastern part of sweden the fyrisån river discharges into the lake mälaren which has its outlet through stockholm into the baltic sea fig 1 climate and vegetation are characteristic of the boreal zone as in vantaanjoki catchment the average annual precipitation is 700 mm a 1 the land use in the catchment is distributed among forests 60 agriculture 32 wetlands 4 lakes 2 and urban areas 2 soils in the catchment are mostly glacial tills in the forest lands whereas agricultural lands are predominantly on clay soils altitudes range from 1 m a s l to 117 m a s l and mean water flow of the fyrisån river is approx 13 m3 s 1 ranging between 1 and 140 m3 s 1 the urban area is dominated by the city of uppsala population approx 170 000 through which the fyrisån river flows just before reaching lake mälaren the purified wastewaters from the wwtp in uppsala are discharged into the river johannesdottir et al 2019 the municipal wastewaters constitute 4 of tp and 34 of tn loading into the lake mälaren persson et al 2012 connected to the baltic sea 2 1 3 słupia the słupia catchment 1623 km2 in northern poland is a coastal river basin belonging to warm temperate region the słupia river is 138 km long and drains the catchment into the southern baltic sea fig 1 the average annual precipitation is 850 mm a 1 the catchment was shaped during the last vistulian glaciation of the quaternary period therefore its relief is diverse and characterized by several morainic uplands and sandy outwash plains cut by network of tunnel and eroding valleys the altitude ranges between 0 and 267 m a s l and the highest parts of the basin are in the south east the middle part of the catchment is mostly covered by forest while agricultural land is predominant in the southern and northern parts agricultural land and forest represent 54 and 42 of the catchment respectively urban areas constitute ca 3 of which the largest portion is taken by the city of słupsk with 95 000 inhabitants and two smaller towns bytów and ustka sands and loamy sand are the most typical soil types at the outlet of the catchment the average 2000 2016 flow is 17 m3 s 1 and ranges between 8 4 and 53 m3 s 1 within the catchment there is only one major wwtp city of słupsk and several smaller ones in the słupia catchment point sources comprise approximately 11 of both tp and tn loading into the baltic sea dr m piniewski pers comm 2 2 selection of the ecotechnologies for the case study catchments the most relevant sectors in terms of carbon and nutrient recovery and recycling are agriculture and wastewater treatment in the agricultural sector typical resources include manure grass and plant residues whilst in the wastewater sector it is the sludge from wastewater treatment the management of these resources may include various ecotechnologies for each case study catchment three ecotechnology alternatives were chosen by a bonus return project group on the base of pre selected list compiled from systematic literature reviews macura et al 2019a and 2019b as a part of the project sustainability analysis approach with mca was used to assess the three ecotechnology alternatives in each of the three case study catchments and to choose the most sustainable one for each case johannesdottir et al 2019 here the mca work included several criteria related to environment economics socio culture health and hygiene as well as technical functionality local stakeholders participated in a weighting process in order to integrate the performance of each alternative over all criteria detailed descriptions of the selected ecotechnologies and the process of their choice can be found in johannesdottir et al 2019 2 2 1 vantaanjoki in vantaanjoki the focus was on agriculture and onsite wastewater sectors the ecotechnology alternatives were i anaerobic digestion ii pyrolysis and iii composting of these system alternatives anaerobic digestion biogas production in a centralized facility received the highest sustainability score in mca from weighing of the criteria in the stakeholder workshop held in helsinki in march 2019 as for the feedstocks for the proposed facility agricultural residues set aside green fertilizing and buffer zone grasses threshing residues and straw horse manure and hygienized blackwater from closed tanks of scattered settlements produced annually in the vantaanjoki catchment area were used the amounts of these feedstocks were obtained from the finnish biomass atlas www luke fi biomassa atlas en 2 2 2 fyrisån the ecotechnologies for fyrisån addressed wastewater treatment in the catchment s biggest point source i e kungsänsverket wwtp treating the wastewaters of over 200 000 people of the city of uppsala and its surroundings the system alternatives were i incineration ii nutrient extraction and iii source separation from a workshop in uppsala in march 2019 stakeholders weighted all three alternatives as performing better than the baseline wastewater treatment the alternative iii source separation of wastewaters received the highest sustainability score and was thus selected for further evaluation in this study it was estimated that the time needed for implementation of this ecotechnology would be seven years one of the factors taken into account in sustainability assessment was eutrophication potential i e a possible reduction of nutrient emissions from wwtp thanks to application of a given alternative 2 2 3 słupia like in fyrisån the ecotechnology alternatives in słupia addressed wastewater treatment the alternatives for the słupsk wwtp were i ammonia stripping of reject water ii nutrient extraction and iii source separation the stakeholder workshop in slupsk in march 2019 resulted in alternative ii nutrient extraction which received the highest sustainability score and was chosen to be dealt with in this study as in fyrisån it was estimated that the time needed for implementation of this ecotechnology would be seven years and reduction of nutrient emissions was one of the sustainability criteria 2 3 swat model swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based semi distributed continuous time model that simulates the movement of water sediment n and p compounds within a catchment with a daily time step swat requires specific input information on weather soil topography vegetation and land management and based on that computes the processes associated with water and sediment movement plant growth nutrient cycling etc swat uses basic spatial units called hrus hydrological response units which are combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin both the land phase water balance components land erosion and nutrient fluxes are computed separately for each hru aggregated at the sub basin level and then routed through the river network to the main outlet the swat model was set up calibrated and validated in the three case study catchments for total suspended sediment tss total p tp and total n tn table 1 detailed description of the swat model setup for the case vantaanjoki can be found in piniewski et al 2019 similar approach and procedures as in vantaanjoki were applied with the fyrisån and słupia case study catchments as well the calibrated model setups were then run for each catchment to constitute the so called baseline scenarios in vantaanjoki fyrisån and słupia the selected modelling periods were 2003 2016 2001 2015 and 2001 2017 respectively i e the longest contemporary available data for each catchment 2 4 inputs from the ecotechnologies for the swat simulations the simulated scenarios were based on the selected ecotechnologies see section 2 2 the goal was to assess what would be their effectiveness in terms of reduction of n and p loadings to surface water in the future 15 20 years assuming no changes in other factors such as climate or land use in the vantaanjoki catchment the extra oc applied onto the agricultural soils would consist of the digestate originating from large scale centralized biogas production based on feedstocks from agriculture and onsite wastewater treatment table 2 the effects of oc increments were simulated by adjusting the model parameters describing the oc content and physical properties of soil based on experiences found in literature we assumed that the soil oc increments could induce changes in soil characteristics that could in turn reduce nutrient losses frøseth et al 2014 muukkonen et al 2009 tebrügge düring 1999 for example frøseth et al 2014 reported that digestate contributed to higher soil aggregate stability increased n recovery and reduced the risk of n losses the amounts of oc and nutrients in the digestate produced by the chosen ecotechnology to be applied into the agricultural soils in the case vantaanjoki are presented in table 2 in swat the amount of oc in soil parameter sol cbn is given for each soil landuse combination as percent of dry weight of soil in vantaanjoki an oc estimate for the cropland soils in southern finland presented by heikkinen et al 2013 i e 3 3 was used as the initial value i e in the zero scenario with no extra oc applied onto the agricultural soil according to our calculations the oc addition produced by the chosen ecotechnology brings about small increase in the sol cbn parameter when the oc is applied evenly to the topsoil 230 mm layer of all cropland fields ca 28 500 ha of the vantaanjoki catchment from 3 30 to 3 35 as an average of the oc accumulated during the modeling period moreover a part of the feedstocks would have been used in agriculture anyway without being used in biogas process soil physical parameters bulk density available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity moist soil albedo and the erodibility factor table 3 were changed according to suggestions found in literature rawls et al 2004 wuest et al 2005 and by personal communication with a finnish soil science expert dr tapio salo of luke natural resources institute finland in the swedish and polish catchments fyrisån and słupia the effects of the selected ecotechnologies on nutrient loading were assessed by reducing the swat point source nutrient emissions kg day 1 from the subbasins where uppsala and słupsk wwtps are located the reductions were derived from the estimated improvements in wastewater treatment according to johannesdottir pers comm source separation of wastewaters would reduce n emissions by 29 and p emissions by 23 from the kungsänsverket wwtp into the fyrisån river in the source separation system a fraction of all households 37 of the total amount of sewage waters has separation of blackwater containing feces and urine and greywater from sinks washing machines and bathtubs in the słupia case nutrient extraction would correspondingly reduce 44 of the n emissions and 30 of the p emissions in this ecotechnology wastewater is treated anaerobically and simultaneously biogas is produced after which nutrients are captured and extracted by struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping johannesdottir et al 2019 2 5 scenario development for the vantaanjoki case three scenarios of the changes in soil properties due to soil oc increments were made in addition to zero scenario no soc increments or other modifications to the baseline model setup as follows ocs1 1 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 1 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor ocs2 2 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 2 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor ocs3 5 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 5 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor given the low increase in soc by the digestate increment and both the expert s suggestion that the physical changes should be rather moderate and the equations of rawls et al 2004 the ocs1 is the most realistic of the three scenarios meanwhile ocs2 and ocs3 describe the potential of larger oc inputs from wider variety of sources of organic material than that produced by the ecotechnology selected for the vantaanjoki case in these simplified scenarios we assumed that the soil nutrient status remained unchanged i e that the increased soil nutrients with the digestate increments would be compensated by decreased mineral fertilization results were examined as tp and tn load reductions as compared with the zero scenario for the entire catchment and in a 31 km2 subcatchment which drains to the lake tuusulanjärvi in the middle of the entire vantaanjoki catchment in the baseline scenarios bls of fyrisån and słupia cases annual time series of tp and tn loadings had a steep downward trend in both uppsala and słupsk wwtps fig 2 for the quasi future scenarios wws1 and wws2 for the first seven years data from 2016 were repeated whereas starting from 2025 estimated reduction rates from the 2016 loading values were applied the results were analysed in two variants wws1 for the period 2018 2034 that included the wastewater ecotechnology development period wws2 for the period 2025 2041 for which a full potential of the developed ecotechnology could be achieved 3 results and discussion 3 1 changed soil properties by oc increments in case vantaanjoki the results of vantaanjoki indicate that the tp loading from the entire catchment would reduce by less than 1 in ocs1 and ocs2 and 3 3 in ocs3 fig 3 in the tuusulanjärvi subcatchment reductions were somewhat higher than in the entire vantaanjoki catchment fig 3 as for tn reductions were generally lower than those for tp and like for tp higher in the tuusulanjärvi subcatchment than in the entire vantaanjoki catchment in all scenarios fig 3 it is obvious that the low increase in soc by the digestate increment ocs1 in the vantaanjoki case cannot lead to high nutrient load reductions however the changes in soil properties have desired decreasing effect to nutrient loading and with larger increments ocs3 it is possible to achieve more visible results with use of digestates as soil oc increments more immediate positive effects than those related to water quality improvement can be anticipated in crop yields according to koppelmäki et al 2019 the digestate from biogas production has 10 28 better fertilizer value in terms of crop response than the same biomass used as green manure moreover risberg et al 2017 found out that digestates generally induce higher potential ammonium oxidation activity while e g pig slurry and cattle manure induce considerably higher respiration activity this pattern suggests that digestates may be better fertilizers for heavier soils with high clay content like those in the vantaanjoki catchment when looking at the oc scenarios it is good to bear in mind that the factors behind the historical changes in nutrient loading to the surface waters are slow long term processes like e g shifts in soil p content of finland s agricultural soils induced by first increased until late 1980s and then decreased since late 1980s fertilization ylivainio et al 2014 moreover in a finnish study it was found out that if half of the grassland in the northern savonia province would be fertilized by fractionated n and p from livestock manure instead of raw manure the leaching of total phosphorus would be after 20 years 3 8 lower than in year 1 puustinen et al 2019 similarly when soil structure and water management in agriculture are improved instead of quick and dramatic reductions in nutrient loading long term slow trend towards the better is to be expected 3 2 improvements in wastewater treatment in cases fyrisån and słupia according to the swat simulations the ecotechnology selected for the fyrisån case i e source separation of wastewaters would in wws1 reduce the overall annual tp and tn loading from the entire fyrisån catchment into the lake mälaren on average by 1 0 and 2 8 respectively in wws2 the reductions were naturally higher 1 6 for tp and 5 2 for tn the moderate tp load reductions are partly explained by the already low share of wastewaters 4 of the overall tp loading via the river fyrisån the reductions of the loading from the subbasin where the uppsala wwtp is located upstream area 61 of the entire fyrisån catchment were relatively higher in wws2 scenario 3 4 for tp and 8 2 for tn than those from the entire fyrisån catchment in fyrisån reductions were higher in dry than in wet years with lower nutrient loading from the catchment in the year with the lowest annual flow the tn load was ca 7 and that of p almost 4 lower with the ecotechnology source separation than with baseline wastewater treatment fig 4 meanwhile when annual average flow is high also the nutrient loading from the catchment is high and consequently the role of wastewater treatment in overall loading into the lake is less significant the swat simulations for słupia showed that the chosen ecotechnology nutrient extraction would in wws1 reduce tp loading by 5 1 and tn loading by 3 6 in wws2 the reductions were 6 8 for tp and 6 4 for tn in słupia similar dependence between hydrological years and load reductions as in fyrisån fig 4 was not detected this could be explained by lower inter annual variation of flow in the polish than in the swedish case we also simulated the relative reductions in annual mean tp and tn concentrations mg l 1 at the outlets of rivers fyrisån and słupia in the wws scenarios table 4 except for wws2 in słupia reductions in the annual mean concentrations were higher than those in the loads in summer data from june august only relative reductions were higher than those on annual basis table 4 most probably due to the higher share of wastewaters in river runoff in summer when diffuse loading from agriculture is at its lowest this suggests that the effectiveness of the selected ecotechnologies are at their highest during the summer periods when the risk of algal blooms in the recipient waterbodies are also at their highest willén et al 2000 3 3 comparison with traditional agri environmental best management practices the mean annual nutrient load reductions achieved by the selected ecotechnologies ranged from 1 ocs1 in vantaanjoki to ca 7 wws2 in słupia it has been reported in finnish swedish and polish studies puustinen et al 2019 arheimer et al 2004 piniewski et al 2014 that with agri environmental best management practices bmps similar or higher catchment scale reductions can be achieved typical bmps are constructed wetlands buffer zones reduced tillage and winter time vegetation cover puustinen et al 2019 estimated that if the bmps of the river basin management plan of the eu water framework directive wfd would be implemented in the paimionjoki catchment 1088 km2 in southern finland the tp loading to the archipelago sea would decrease by 8 and that of tn by 28 arheimer et al 2004 reported that constructed wetlands could potentially reduce up to 6 and a combination of on field bmps some 30 of the tn transport from coastal genevadsån catchment 224 km2 in southern sweden with their swat simulations in a 482 km2 agriculture dominated reda catchment in northern poland piniewski et al 2014 found that combination of four on and off field bmps reduced no3 n loading up to 17 and po4 p loading up to 38 extensive use of some of these bmps requires however large areas of land which may mean that their cost effectiveness may be questionable if land acquisition costs are high strand weisner 2013 this is typically the case in the most fertile arable areas of southern finland constructed wetlands for example are also often expensive to implement hyvönen et al 2020 moreover the ecotechnologies dealt with here have in addition to nutrient load reduction many co benefits murcia lópez 2019 that all of the bmps do not have for example by utilizing the carbon and nutrient rich remnant from a biogas mill producing valuable renewable energy and organic fertilizers the cost effectiveness may despite of high investment costs improve in the long run this applies also to the wastewater ecotechnologies indeed the products of source separation chosen for the case fyrisån include electricity heat and biofuel from biogas organic fertilizer from blackwater sludge and fertilizer in the forms of struvite ammonium sulphate and calcium phosphate the fertilizer products generated by nutrient extraction ecotechnology chosen for the case słupia are composted sludge ammonium sulphate and struvite in addition biogas which is generated at both wwtps can be used for heat and electricity production johannesdottir et al 2019 4 conclusions the amounts of oc that could be incremented into the agricultural soil by the ecotechnology implementation simulated for the case vantaanjoki are so low that the effects to the nutrient load reductions remain minor at the level of an entire river basin discharging into a sea area like e g the gulf of finland however the percent reductions are higher in smaller subbasin level this is in line with the common finding that quicker visible results in water protection are more readily achieved for smaller water bodies like lakes see e g www epa gov nps success stories about restoring water bodies impaired nonpoint source pollution than for sea areas helcom fi wp content uploads 2019 08 total phosphorous helcom core indicator 2018 pdf moreover if the oc increments are concentrated in smaller areas than an entire river basin as in our case the effect may be locally significant an exemplar of a local agricultural system efficiently recycling nutrients and carbon is presented by koppelmäki et al 2019 indeed propagation of such agroecological systems into common use in rural areas would improve the soil properties of arable land and as a consequent gradually reduce nutrient loading into the nearby waterbodies and eventually to the sea areas according to our simulations wastewater ecotechnologies tested in cases fyrisån and słupia proved to be more effective in nutrient load reduction than the soc increments applied in vantaanjoki they also possess valuable additional benefits like energy and useful fertilizer products like struvite our comparisons between the selected ecotechnologies and the commonly used agri environmental bmps revealed that when used as combinations the bmps reduce nutrient loading into the baltic sea more than individual bmps or the ecotechnologies of this study indeed no single mitigation measure or ecotechnology should be seen as a silver bullet for water protection instead numbers of all kinds of well tried measures both traditional bmps and carbon and nutrient recycling ecotechnologies should be increased with determined and targeted manner where and whenever appropriate conflict of interest we assure that there are no conflicts of interest related

draining to the baltic sea vantaanjoki finland fyrisån sweden and słupia poland sustainability analysis with multi criteria analysis was applied in the stakeholder workshops in the case study areas to assess different ecotechnology alternatives the following ecotechnologies received the highest sustainability scores in vantaanjoki anaerobic digestion based on mostly agricultural residues in fyrisån source separation of wastewaters in słupia nutrient extraction within the wastewater treatment process the effect of application of digestate on agricultural soils in the vantaanjoki catchment was simulated by adjusting the model parameters describing the organic carbon content and physical properties of soil the results showed small reductions of nutrient loads to the gulf of finland larger reductions of nutrient loads to lake mälaren in sweden and the baltic sea in poland were achieved as a result of the wastewater treatment upgrades in the fyrisån catchment higher relative reductions were simulated for tn than tp and in dry years than in wet years although the studied ecotechnologies did not show as high effectiveness in nutrient load reduction as combinations of traditional best management practices reported in literature they do have other multiple benefits including crop yield increase electricity heat and bio based fertilizer production keywords ecotechnology soil carbon

and buffer zone grasses threshing residues and straw horse manure and hygienized blackwater from closed tanks of scattered settlements produced annually in the vantaanjoki catchment area were used the amounts of these feedstocks were obtained from the finnish biomass atlas www luke fi biomassa atlas en 2 2 2 fyrisån the ecotechnologies for fyrisån addressed wastewater treatment in the catchment s biggest point source i e kungsänsverket wwtp treating the wastewaters of over 200 000 people of the city of uppsala and its surroundings the system alternatives were i incineration ii nutrient extraction and iii source separation from a workshop in uppsala in march 2019 stakeholders weighted all three alternatives as performing better than the baseline wastewater treatment the alternative iii source separation of wastewaters received the highest sustainability score and was thus selected for further evaluation in this study it was estimated that the time needed for implementation of this ecotechnology would be seven years one of the factors taken into account in sustainability assessment was eutrophication potential i e a possible reduction of nutrient emissions from wwtp thanks to application of a given alternative 2 2 3 słupia like in fyrisån the ecotechnology alternatives in słupia addressed wastewater treatment the alternatives for the słupsk wwtp were i ammonia stripping of reject water ii nutrient extraction and iii source separation the stakeholder workshop in slupsk in march 2019 resulted in alternative ii nutrient extraction which received the highest sustainability score and was chosen to be dealt with in this study as in fyrisån it was estimated that the time needed for implementation of this ecotechnology would be seven years and reduction of nutrient emissions was one of the sustainability criteria 2 3 swat model swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based semi distributed continuous time model that simulates the movement of water sediment n and p compounds within a catchment with a daily time step swat requires specific input information on weather soil topography vegetation and land management and based on that computes the processes associated with water and sediment movement plant growth nutrient cycling etc swat uses basic spatial units called hrus hydrological response units which are combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin both the land phase water balance components land erosion and nutrient fluxes are computed separately for each hru aggregated at the sub basin level and then routed through the river network to the main outlet the swat model was set up calibrated and validated in the three case study catchments for total suspended sediment tss total p tp and total n tn table 1 detailed description of the swat model setup for the case vantaanjoki can be found in piniewski et al 2019 similar approach and procedures as in vantaanjoki were applied with the fyrisån and słupia case study catchments as well the calibrated model setups were then run for each catchment to constitute the so called baseline scenarios in vantaanjoki fyrisån and słupia the selected modelling periods were 2003 2016 2001 2015 and 2001 2017 respectively i e the longest contemporary available data for each catchment 2 4 inputs from the ecotechnologies for the swat simulations the simulated scenarios were based on the selected ecotechnologies see section 2 2 the goal was to assess what would be their effectiveness in terms of reduction of n and p loadings to surface water in the future 15 20 years assuming no changes in other factors such as climate or land use in the vantaanjoki catchment the extra oc applied onto the agricultural soils would consist of the digestate originating from large scale centralized biogas production based on feedstocks from agriculture and onsite wastewater treatment table 2 the effects of oc increments were simulated by adjusting the model parameters describing the oc content and physical properties of soil based on experiences found in literature we assumed that the soil oc increments could induce changes in soil characteristics that could in turn reduce nutrient losses frøseth et al 2014 muukkonen et al 2009 tebrügge düring 1999 for example frøseth et al 2014 reported that digestate contributed to higher soil aggregate stability increased n recovery and reduced the risk of n losses the amounts of oc and nutrients in the digestate produced by the chosen ecotechnology to be applied into the agricultural soils in the case vantaanjoki are presented in table 2 in swat the amount of oc in soil parameter sol cbn is given for each soil landuse combination as percent of dry weight of soil in vantaanjoki an oc estimate for the cropland soils in southern finland presented by heikkinen et al 2013 i e 3 3 was used as the initial value i e in the zero scenario with no extra oc applied onto the agricultural soil according to our calculations the oc addition produced by the chosen ecotechnology brings about small increase in the sol cbn parameter when the oc is applied evenly to the topsoil 230 mm layer of all cropland fields ca 28 500 ha of the vantaanjoki catchment from 3 30 to 3 35 as an average of the oc accumulated during the modeling period moreover a part of the feedstocks would have been used in agriculture anyway without being used in biogas process soil physical parameters bulk density available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity moist soil albedo and the erodibility factor table 3 were changed according to suggestions found in literature rawls et al 2004 wuest et al 2005 and by personal communication with a finnish soil science expert dr tapio salo of luke natural resources institute finland in the swedish and polish catchments fyrisån and słupia the effects of the selected ecotechnologies on nutrient loading were assessed by reducing the swat point source nutrient emissions kg day 1 from the subbasins where uppsala and słupsk wwtps are located the reductions were derived from the estimated improvements in wastewater treatment according to johannesdottir pers comm source separation of wastewaters would reduce n emissions by 29 and p emissions by 23 from the kungsänsverket wwtp into the fyrisån river in the source separation system a fraction of all households 37 of the total amount of sewage waters has separation of blackwater containing feces and urine and greywater from sinks washing machines and bathtubs in the słupia case nutrient extraction would correspondingly reduce 44 of the n emissions and 30 of the p emissions in this ecotechnology wastewater is treated anaerobically and simultaneously biogas is produced after which nutrients are captured and extracted by struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping johannesdottir et al 2019 2 5 scenario development for the vantaanjoki case three scenarios of the changes in soil properties due to soil oc increments were made in addition to zero scenario no soc increments or other modifications to the baseline model setup as follows ocs1 1 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 1 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor ocs2 2 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 2 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor ocs3 5 increases to available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and moist soil albedo and 5 decreases to bulk density and erodibility factor given the low increase in soc by the digestate increment and both the expert s suggestion that the physical changes should be rather moderate and the equations of rawls et al 2004 the ocs1 is the most realistic of the three scenarios meanwhile ocs2 and ocs3 describe the potential of larger oc inputs from wider variety of sources of organic material than that produced by the ecotechnology selected for the vantaanjoki case in these simplified scenarios we assumed that the soil nutrient status remained unchanged i e that the increased soil nutrients with the digestate increments would be compensated by decreased mineral fertilization results were examined as tp and tn load reductions as compared with the zero scenario for the entire catchment and in a 31 km2 subcatchment which drains to the lake tuusulanjärvi in the middle of the entire vantaanjoki catchment in the baseline scenarios bls of fyrisån and słupia cases annual time series of tp and tn loadings had a steep downward trend in both uppsala and słupsk wwtps fig 2 for the quasi future scenarios wws1 and wws2 for the first seven years data from 2016 were repeated whereas starting from 2025 estimated reduction rates from the 2016 loading values were applied the results were analysed in two variants wws1 for the period 2018 2034 that included the wastewater ecotechnology development period wws2 for the period 2025 2041 for which a full potential of the developed ecotechnology could be achieved 3 results and discussion 3 1 changed soil properties by oc increments in case vantaanjoki the results of vantaanjoki indicate that the tp loading from the entire catchment would reduce by less than 1 in ocs1 and ocs2 and 3 3 in ocs3 fig 3 in the tuusulanjärvi subcatchment reductions were somewhat higher than in the entire vantaanjoki catchment fig 3 as for tn reductions were generally lower than those for tp and like for tp higher in the tuusulanjärvi subcatchment than in the entire vantaanjoki catchment in all scenarios fig 3 it is obvious that the low increase in soc by the digestate increment ocs1 in the vantaanjoki case cannot lead to high nutrient load reductions however the changes in soil properties have desired decreasing effect to nutrient loading and with larger increments ocs3 it is possible to achieve more visible results with use of digestates as soil oc increments more immediate positive effects than those related to water quality improvement can be anticipated in crop yields according to koppelmäki et al 2019 the digestate from biogas production has 10 28 better fertilizer value in terms of crop response than the same biomass used as green manure moreover risberg et al 2017 found out that digestates generally induce higher potential ammonium oxidation activity while e g pig slurry and cattle manure induce considerably higher respiration activity this pattern suggests that digestates may be better fertilizers for heavier soils with high clay content like those in the vantaanjoki catchment when looking at the oc scenarios it is good to bear in mind that the factors behind the historical changes in nutrient loading to the surface waters are slow long term processes like e g shifts in soil p content of finland s agricultural soils induced by first increased until late 1980s and then decreased since late 1980s fertilization ylivainio et al 2014 moreover in a finnish study it was found out that if half of the grassland in the northern savonia province would be fertilized by fractionated n and p from livestock manure instead of raw manure the leaching of total phosphorus would be after 20 years 3 8 lower than in year 1 puustinen et al 2019 similarly when soil structure and water management in agriculture are improved instead of quick and dramatic reductions in nutrient loading long term slow trend towards the better is to be expected 3 2 improvements in wastewater treatment in cases fyrisån and słupia according to the swat simulations the ecotechnology selected for the fyrisån case i e source separation of wastewaters would in wws1 reduce the overall annual tp and tn loading from the entire fyrisån catchment into the lake mälaren on average by 1 0 and 2 8 respectively in wws2 the reductions were naturally higher 1 6 for tp and 5 2 for tn the moderate tp load reductions are partly explained by the already low share of wastewaters 4 of the overall tp loading via the river fyrisån the reductions of the loading from the subbasin where the uppsala wwtp is located upstream area 61 of the entire fyrisån catchment were relatively higher in wws2 scenario 3 4 for tp and 8 2 for tn than those from the entire fyrisån catchment in fyrisån reductions were higher in dry than in wet years with lower nutrient loading from the catchment in the year with the lowest annual flow the tn load was ca 7 and that of p almost 4 lower with the ecotechnology source separation than with baseline wastewater treatment fig 4 meanwhile when annual average flow is high also the nutrient loading from the catchment is high and consequently the role of wastewater treatment in overall loading into the lake is less significant the swat simulations for słupia showed that the chosen ecotechnology nutrient extraction would in wws1 reduce tp loading by 5 1 and tn loading by 3 6 in wws2 the reductions were 6 8 for tp and 6 4 for tn in słupia similar dependence between hydrological years and load reductions as in fyrisån fig 4 was not detected this could be explained by lower inter annual variation of flow in the polish than in the swedish case we also simulated the relative reductions in annual mean tp and tn concentrations mg l 1 at the outlets of rivers fyrisån and słupia in the wws scenarios table 4 except for wws2 in słupia reductions in the annual mean concentrations were higher than those in the loads in summer data from june august only relative reductions were higher than those on annual basis table 4 most probably due to the higher share of wastewaters in river runoff in summer when diffuse loading from agriculture is at its lowest this suggests that the effectiveness of the selected ecotechnologies are at their highest during the summer periods when the risk of algal blooms in the recipient waterbodies are also at their highest willén et al 2000 3 3 comparison with traditional agri environmental best management practices the mean annual nutrient load reductions achieved by the selected ecotechnologies ranged from 1 ocs1 in vantaanjoki to ca 7 wws2 in słupia it has been reported in finnish swedish and polish studies puustinen et al 2019 arheimer et al 2004 piniewski et al 2014 that with agri environmental best management practices bmps similar or higher catchment scale reductions can be achieved typical bmps are constructed wetlands buffer zones reduced tillage and winter time vegetation cover puustinen et al 2019 estimated that if the bmps of the river basin management plan of the eu water framework directive wfd would be implemented in the paimionjoki catchment 1088 km2 in southern finland the tp loading to the archipelago sea would decrease by 8 and that of tn by 28 arheimer et al 2004 reported that constructed wetlands could potentially reduce up to 6 and a combination of on field bmps some 30 of the tn transport from coastal genevadsån catchment 224 km2 in southern sweden with their swat simulations in a 482 km2 agriculture dominated reda catchment in northern poland piniewski et al 2014 found that combination of four on and off field bmps reduced no3 n loading up to 17 and po4 p loading up to 38 extensive use of some of these bmps requires however large areas of land which may mean that their cost effectiveness may be questionable if land acquisition costs are high strand weisner 2013 this is typically the case in the most fertile arable areas of southern finland constructed wetlands for example are also often expensive to implement hyvönen et al 2020 moreover the ecotechnologies dealt with here have in addition to nutrient load reduction many co benefits murcia lópez 2019 that all of the bmps do not have for example by utilizing the carbon and nutrient rich remnant from a biogas mill producing valuable renewable energy and organic fertilizers the cost effectiveness may despite of high investment costs improve in the long run this applies also to the wastewater ecotechnologies indeed the products of source separation chosen for the case fyrisån include electricity heat and biofuel from biogas organic fertilizer from blackwater sludge and fertilizer in the forms of struvite ammonium sulphate and calcium phosphate the fertilizer products generated by nutrient extraction ecotechnology chosen for the case słupia are composted sludge ammonium sulphate and struvite in addition biogas which is generated at both wwtps can be used for heat and electricity production johannesdottir et al 2019 4 conclusions the amounts of oc that could be incremented into the agricultural soil by the ecotechnology implementation simulated for the case vantaanjoki are so low that the effects to the nutrient load reductions remain minor at the level of an entire river basin discharging into a sea area like e g the gulf of finland however the percent reductions are higher in smaller subbasin level this is in line with the common finding that quicker visible results in water protection are more readily achieved for smaller water bodies like lakes see e g www epa gov nps success stories about restoring water bodies impaired nonpoint source pollution than for sea areas helcom fi wp content uploads 2019 08 total phosphorous helcom core indicator 2018 pdf moreover if the oc increments are concentrated in smaller areas than an entire river basin as in our case the effect may be locally significant an exemplar of a local agricultural system efficiently recycling nutrients and carbon is presented by koppelmäki et al 2019 indeed propagation of such agroecological systems into common use in rural areas would improve the soil properties of arable land and as a consequent gradually reduce nutrient loading into the nearby waterbodies and eventually to the sea areas according to our simulations wastewater ecotechnologies tested in cases fyrisån and słupia proved to be more effective in nutrient load reduction than the soc increments applied in vantaanjoki they also possess valuable additional benefits like energy and useful fertilizer products like struvite our comparisons between the selected ecotechnologies and the commonly used agri environmental bmps revealed that when used as combinations the bmps reduce nutrient loading into the baltic sea more than individual bmps or the ecotechnologies of this study indeed no single mitigation measure or ecotechnology should be seen as a silver bullet for water protection instead numbers of all kinds of well tried measures both traditional bmps and carbon and nutrient recycling ecotechnologies should be increased with determined and targeted manner where and whenever appropriate conflict of interest we assure that there are no conflicts of interest related

1058,ethiopia s inland fisheries offer an alternative livelihood for the riparian communities one of these inland fisheries the omo turkana fisheries have not been properly studied and managed the main purpose of this study therefore was to assess social economic aspects and related problems of fisheries in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana for better management and sustainable use of the resources various instruments including structured questionnaires focus group discussions key informant interviews personal observations and secondary sources were used to gather data on the socio economics and management problems of the fisheries the fisheries support a considerable number of the local communities who have much less other livelihood options apart from pastoralism however development of fisheries in these localities is marred by lack of material and technical support to the fishers cooperatives lack of government commitment to capacitate the institutions that work on fisheries management and development and the continued conflicts between ethiopian and kenyan fishers in an apparent competition over a fertile fishing ground for comprehensive insight we developed a fisheries value chain and discussed major issues arising out of it to sustain the fisheries contributions to community livelihoods it is recommended that due attention be given to conflict resolution between the ethiopian daasanach and the kenyan turkana fishers additionally the co management arrangement by the two countries is urgently needed to regulate illegal fishing in the lake as well as the omo river delta keywords conflict ethiopia fisheries kenya lake turkana omo river 1 introduction ethiopia a horn of african nation has a population of more than 100 million un 2017 it has an economy that relies heavily on agriculture which accounts for more than 85 of employment medac 1999 however the country often suffers risks of food insecurity largely due to a recurring drought that affects its crop productions the nation s freshwater system consists of 8 065 km length of rivers and 13 637 km2 area of lakes and reservoirs tesfaye and wolff 2014 its freshwater system supports small scale fisheries that sustain the livelihoods of a considerable number of its people the omo turkana is one of the country s drainage basins that traverses an extensive part in southwestern ethiopia and northern kenya with a catchment area of 131 000 145 500 km2 feibel 2011 velpuri et al 2012 the studies on fish diversity of lake turkana were started in the 1930s by cambridge university and have continued to present time worthington 1931 1932 worthington and richardo 1936 pellegrin 1935 hamblyn 1962 mann 1964 hopson and hopson 1982 kolding 1989 wakjira and getahun 2017 the ethiopian daasanach community also referred to as merille by some is the major inhabitant occupying lower omo river to the delta northern and northeastern shore of the ethiopian side of the lake the population generally constitutes a pastoralist livelihood with sub livelihood systems those residing along omo river are semi pastoralists who used to depend on recession farming the community living in the northeastern part of lake turkana is entirely dependent on lake turkana fishing with no other alternative means of livelihood usaid 2006 personal observations by the authors during various field visits since 2014 show that fisheries in the omo river delta at the junction with lake turkana are important sources of livelihood and income for the local community particularly the youth moreover the first preliminary report by wakjira 2016 indicated that fisheries potential is high in the lower omo river and the ethiopian part of lake turkana with considerable socio economic returns however while fisheries development in the main lake on the kenyan side has received foreign supports hopson 1982 kolding 1989 socioeconomics and management conditions of fisheries on the ethiopian side are not well addressed moreover there exist considerable numbers of development activities including hydropower dams and irrigation weirs in the omo river basin a hydrological impact assessment conducted for the african development bank afdb remarked on the potential impacts of these development activities on the basin fish fauna and the downstream fisheries communities avery 2010 appraisal of any future positive or negative impacts of these development activities on the basin fisheries requires baseline scientific information on fisheries socioeconomics and related characteristics for appropriate intervention and management plan the main purpose of this study is to understand the basic socioeconomic status and related problems of fisheries in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana for better management and sustainable use of the resources therefore the specific objectives of this study include assessing the socio demographic characteristics of the fishers identifying and documenting the commercially important fish species describing fish production consumption and income identifying marketing and value chain of the fisheries and identifying actual and potential conflicts and possible management measures at the study sites 2 study area the study area is located in southern ethiopia at the border with northern kenya approximately 860 km southwest of the capital addis ababa fig 1 lake turkana is the world s largest permanent desert lake located in the eastern arm of the east african great rift valley roughly at geographic coordinates of 02 27 04 40 n 035 50 36 40 e the lake is 257 km long 13 44 km wide and with a surface area of 7 560 km2 a volume of 237 36 km3 and a mean depth of 31 4 m the largest part of the lake lies in northern kenya while it receives more than 90 of its total inflow from omo river that originates in the ethiopian highlands at an elevation of about 2 200 m above sea level the major tributaries of omo river include gibe gojeb gilgel gibe amara alanga denchiya mui zigina shoshuma mantsa and usno with sub tributaries mago and neri the area has an average elevation of 373 3 m above sea level in a lowland agroecological zone it has an annual temperature range of 30 40 c mean 34 5 c with a mean annual rainfall of about 350 mm its wet season extends from april to november receiving a relatively higher amount of rainfall between april and may and september to november despite its bimodal pattern the rainfall generally remains low and erratic eepco 2009 3 methods qualitative and quantitative data were collected using structured questionnaires focus group discussion key informant interview and personal observations in april 2019 the questionnaires were designed to generate data from the fisher respondents in order to reach a large number of respondents more easily and economically major issues addressed in the questionnaires included sociodemographic characteristics of the fishers fishing and livelihood conservation problems and fisheries management items of the questionnaire were tested and refined by removing irrelevant questions based on preliminary information obtained from fishers and fish traders before the commencement of the actual data collection the questionnaire data were collected from a sample of forty fishers with the assistance of trained enumerators focus group discussion fgd was held with fishers representatives fish traders and experts from the livestock and fisheries as well as the cooperatives office of the district the focus group discussion points consisted of items about the fisher communities and fishing fish marketing and those related to conservation problems and fisheries management the fgd was important to obtain in depth perspectives in order to complement data collected via the structured questionnaire as well as to generate pertinent information that otherwise would have been missed in the questionnaire data was also collected from heads of the livestock and fisheries cooperatives and revenue offices who were key informants the items of key informant interview were largely similar to those of fgd and were meant for in depth comprehension and verification of data moreover the investigators took personal observation on most of the issues collected via both questionnaire and fgd to ensure authenticity the methods which involved the above techniques ensure the comprehensive and robust nature of the data collected additionally secondary data related to the fishers income fish consumption gear and boat holding were used from other sources bayley 1982 kmfri 2007 wakjira 2016 quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as means ranges and percentages computed in excel 2013 while qualitative data were presented and narrated 4 results 4 1 sociodemographic characteristics all the forty participants in our present survey 30 from lake turkana and 10 from omo river are male individual fishers from daasanach ethnic group that reside along the bank of the lower omo river and the northern shore of lake turkana they practice indigenous traditional beliefs and have no formal education they are all married heading families of 2 10 persons with an average of four persons in terms of age composition majorities of the study participants 62 are youth in the age range of 21 30 years fig 2 most of these fishers have come from a fishing background 67 5 while a considerable proportion 32 5 also comes from pastoralists 4 2 fisheries and fish marketing the list of commercially important fish species in the lower omo river and the ethiopian side of lake turkana with their local names in daasanach and relative abundance in percentage by number wakjira 2016 is provided in table 1 genera comprising the commercially important species from the highest to the lowest species richness include labeo synodontis schilbe auchenoglanis bagrus hydrocynus alestes citharinus distichodus lates and oreochromis all the fishers who participated in the present survey rely only on fishing for their livelihood and they fish largely for subsistence 78 the majority of these fishers 45 have fished for 10 15 years while considerable numbers 37 5 have also fished up to ten years table 2 the value chain for the fisheries of lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana as determined from the present survey is presented in fig 3 4 3 conflicts and fisheries management conflicts between the ethiopian daasanach and the kenyan turkana tribesmen often occur at the border on the northwest end of lake turkana near omo delta the major conflict related issues identified through the focus group discussion are provided in table 3 moreover there are no well organized fisheries management institutions and structures in the locality fisheries management problems in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana identified through the questionnaire survey are summarized in table 4 5 discussion 5 1 sociodemographic characteristics fishing in lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana is undertaken by both individual and organized fishers the fishers literacy rate in the present assessment is lower compared to other fishing communities in ethiopia for example lake zeway where the literacy rate is above 90 janko and zemedu 2015 kassaw 2019 this lower literacy rate would have a negative impact on providing training to the fishers on the techniques of fishing and fish processing fish handling fisheries management and effectively running their financial transactions all the participants of the present study are male fishers who are family heads 5 2 fisheries and fish marketing high productivity and fish diversity in omo delta is attributed to freshwater and nutrient inflow from the omo river shallow depth and low salinity wakjira 2016 it supports high fisheries activities sustaining livelihoods of several fishers from both ethiopia and kenya kmfri 2007 wakjira 2016 on the ethiopian side fishing is more common in the omo river delta at the junction with lake turkana and around the northern shores of the lake from west to east the basin has the highest fish diversity only next to the baro akobo basin in ethiopia golubtsov and darkov 2008 getahun 2017 wakjira and getahun 2017 while 79 valid native fish species occur in the entire omo turkana system 65 species have been reported for part of the basin within the limit of ethiopia wakjira and getahun 2017 despite the high fish diversity in the basin we have determined through our assessment that only 22 fish species are targets of the fisheries of the lower omo river and lake turkana in ethiopia table 1 while the small sized fish species such as alestes baremoze and synodontis schall have the highest relative abundance by number the two accounting for 48 48 relative abundance fisheries in the ethiopian side of lake turkana largely target lates niloticus accounting only for 8 32 relative abundance apparently due to the fishers preference for the large sized individuals thus in the interest of balanced exploitation and sustainability it requires a management intervention to direct the overall fishing pressure from the large fish towards the small fish kolding et al 2019 the responsibility of organizing follow up and monitoring the fishers cooperatives rests in the wereda s cooperative office the history of the formation of fishers cooperatives dates back to 2011 12 when the first groups consisting of four fishers cooperatives with a total of 120 members were formed by the support obtained from agriservice ethiopia a local ngo that provided a fishing boat gears and refrigerators these cooperatives continued to effectively function for three years until 2014 15 when they were disrupted due to a conflict with the kenyan fishers wakjira 2016 of the many landing sites surrounding omo delta and the lake the six functional ones include yerile koriagn lubur ocholoch fejej eriker and bubu a from west to east respectively according to a key informant from the cooperative office five fishers cooperatives are being established at these landing sites most members of the fishers cooperatives are youth largely in their twenties and thirties the cooperatives are governed by their bylaws the establishment of four cooperatives based at bubu a eriker ocholoch and fejej landing sites has been facilitated by veterinarians without frontìeres vsf germany an international ngo that provided fishing gears boat without engine refrigerator and solar panels the two cooperatives based at ocholoch and fejej sites have virtually become functional each of the cooperatives at these four landing sites consisted of 30 members and only one female member at the ocholoch site although there is no cultural barrier that prevents females from being engaged in fishing activity at present the role of females in the fishing community is limited apparently due to the harsh environmental conditions and hardship to fish as learned from the focus group discussion this is also the case in other water bodies of the country kassaw 2019 moreover fish processing such as filleting and drying is also accomplished by the male fishers thus there is still a lot to be done to involve females in the fishing and processing activities the composition of the fishers largely consisted of the indigenous daasanach community and individuals from other parts of southern ethiopia with previous experience in fishing at abaya and chamo lakes the fifth cooperative consisting of 50 or more members at yerile fishing site located at the junction of omo river with the lake turkana in the omo delta is under establishment this cooperative is materially supported by a grant from christensen fund through addis ababa university as this study came to completion basic fishing facilities such as fishing gears a boat and an engine were handed over to the cooperative to make it functional however still more assistance from governmental and non governmental organizations is required to fully strengthen the cooperatives other problems faced by the cooperatives include threat conflict from the kenyan fishers and small payment provided by the traders to the fishers often in the form of bartering historically fishing was for the poor and marginalized sector of the daasanach community that lives essentially close to omo river and lake turkana however that considerable proportion of fishermen in the present assessment comes from the pastoralist background is indicative of a relative shift from pastoralist to fishing sedentary livelihood moreover more people are being attracted to the fishing sector due to a shift in livelihood from recession agriculture locally omoshesh and pastoralism a decrease in recession farming is apparently due to a decrease in the omo river water level the discussion held with the fgd participants indicated that the omo river water level has decreased nowadays possibly due to the upstream development activities in agreement with our assessment various recent studies indicate changes in the volume and seasonality of inflows from omo river owing to the upstream dams and irrigation schemes significantly impacting on the ecology of lower omo river and lake turkana gownaris et al 2016 avery 2017 carr 2017 hodbod et al 2019 tebbs et al 2019 for instance lake turkana water level declined by 1 5 m during the filling up of the gibe iii dam that took place between january 2015 and january 2017 moreover these flow regulations affected the seasonal flood pulse and consequently reduced the downstream sediment transport which in turn affected primary productivity and fisheries hodbod et al 2019 tebbs et al 2019 evaluated the influence of altered hydrological patterns on large scale lake phytoplankton concentrations using satellite data and found a 30 decline in lake turkana chl a during the dam filling period due to the absence of the floods in august september it was also predicted that future abstractions for irrigation activities would cause substantial declines in mean annual chl a ranging from 19 44 depending on the magnitude of abstraction further affecting fisheries ibid other scenarios also suggest that loss of flood pulse could lead to over a two thirds reduction in fisheries yields at any lake level while extreme reductions in absolute lake level i e 25 m will lead to a total collapse of the lake fishery gownaris et al 2016 kolding 1995 demonstrated that change in lake turkana water level is a more important driver than internal factors and fishing of fish abundance and fisheries yield in light of this the hydrological and ecological changes of the omo turkana system could significantly affect the livelihood of the surrounding community who depend on the riverine and lacustrine fisheries for their livelihood the fgd assessment during the present study further identified that incidences of drought also caused a shortage of grazing land and subsequent loss of livestock prompting a shift in livelihood to fishing despite the potential and actual impacts of the hydrological changes affecting the riverine and the lacustrine fisheries on the other hand road infrastructure has recently been improved facilitating livestock marketing as it does the fishery marketing based on an in depth discussion with fgd participants constraints identified from the fisheries value chain analysis fig 3 are a poor capacity of the wereda livestock fisheries and cooperatives offices to effectively support the fishers and document the amount of catch a limited number of ngos for material and technical support unhygienic fish processing lack of adequate preservation facilities and conflicts between ethiopian and kenyan fishers and illegal traders from northern kenya the constraint that has the greatest impact on the value chain is the illegal fish trading as the practice has led to the use of destructive nets with small mesh sizes affecting the sustainability of the fisheries resource the wereda offices mandated to support the fishers are limited in terms of the number of staff and facilities when this study was conducted the above mentioned wereda offices had only three personnel who were in charge and they had no computer and related facilities to document fishing and other relevant data besides the support provided to the fishers cooperative under formation at yerile landing site computer and printer support was provided to the two offices with the assistance obtained from the christensen fund maximum sustainable fisheries yield msy was estimated at 30 000 tons per year during the 1972 1975 survey using a measurement of opercular bones length measurements of salted dried fish and estimates from experimental gillnets bayley 1982 for the kenyan side of lake turkana while a recent annual catch is only 8 000 tons kmfri 2007 in contrast both the msy and the exact annual catch are not known for the ethiopian side of the lake and omo river at present higher amounts of production originate from nile perch fisheries than from nile tilapia and other small sized fish groups a sample of 66 fishers surveyed by wakjira 2016 produced an average of 8 3 tons of nile perch fillets per year from the ethiopian side of lake turkana and omo river while an average of 6 52 tons of nile tilapia and other small sized fish was produced by the same fishers during the same year the fishers are estimated to have consumed 21 24 of their total productions mainly nile tilapia and other smaller fishes while they sold the rest of their productions for income estimated at a total gross value of 10 377 per year analysis by fishing locality shows that fish productions in the lower omo river are largely utilized for household consumption 75 while only very few 25 are sold to restaurants in omorate town for additional income wakjira 2016 in contrast fish productions along the shores of lake turkana are largely for commercial purposes merchandised by both individual and organized fish traders operating at the landing sites during the present assessment there are two individual traders based at bubu a fishing site one individual trader at koriagn lubur site and one enterprise locally known as omo wenz comprehensive fish traders at yerile site consisting of five members in which one is female therefore major market destinations for the filleted nile perch from lake turkana include ethiopian towns of jinka 200 km arba minch 320 km and the capital addis ababa 830 km via these licensed private fish traders fish production and marketing enterprise fpme ethio fishery plc and other private fish marketing companies that used to operate in these localities are no more active snv 2005 according to a key informant from the livestock and fisheries office apart from nile perch all other fishes produced from lake turkana including nile tilapia citharinids distichodontids and bagrids are bought by illegal traders gutted sun dried and transported to kenya uganda and democratic republic of congo drc the presence of kenyan fishers and traders in the ethiopian side of lake turkana is illegal as they are not legally registered and licensed to operate within the nation s jurisdiction the illegal traders buy fishes from the local fishers largely through bartering systems in which they provide the fishers with salt sugar necklace and other ornaments in an exchange for fish moreover the local fishers do not gain any benefit from the fish processing activity as it is solely accomplished by the illegal traders themselves according to the key informant from revenue office the prime focus of ethiopian fish traders is on nile perch and that has caused nile tilapia and other important fishes to be illegally traded to other countries and eventually cause loss of revenue that is to say the ethiopian fish traders who seem to have been interested only in filleted fish marketing have opened a loophole for illegal trading there is no fixed tariff for tax collection from the fish sale nile perch is taxed per kg of fish fillet while nile tilapia and other fishes are taxed per fish regardless of size the wereda revenue office is not fully capacitated in logistics budget and human resources for proper follow up of the revenue collection process this therefore has resulted in a loss of revenue particularly from illegal fish trading there are also possibilities that some legal traders in ethiopia could evade taxation 5 3 conflicts and fisheries management conflict in the region has existed over a long period and relates to cattle rustling grazing land and water yongo et al 2010 there is also an emergence of competition over the productive fishing ground in omo delta and theft of fishing gears boats by the fishers of both sides in recent days omo river delta reportedly is a fertile fishing ground supporting a high amount of fisheries potential there have been repeated incidences of fisheries resource use conflicts between fishers of the two countries a recent and catastrophic incidence of conflict occurred in 2014 15 when the ethiopian fishers in the omo river delta were attacked and their boats and gears were confiscated by the kenyan fishers who came there in search of fertile fishing ground there are also occasions when the ethiopian fishers cross the border following a receding lake during the low lake levels due to the common understanding that the northern part of the lake is in ethiopia and also due to lack of clear boundary marks snv 2005 as per the information from key informants during our field visit an ad hoc committee comprising of ethiopian and kenyan officials from the bordering daasanach and turkana districts representatives of ngos such as catholic church operating in the border areas representative of the intergovernmental authority on development igad stationed at omorate town ethiopian border town and local elders has been formed to resolve any arising conflicts between the ethnic groups of the two countries the conflict arising between the kenyan turkana and the ethiopian daasanach communities in the vicinity of lake turkana and omo river delta is just part of wider conflicts arising along the 861 km long border shared between the two countries therefore achieving sustainable peace and thus improved livelihoods for the fishers operating at omo river delta and lake turkana could be better dealt with by a country level arrangement the ethio kenya joint border commission is one of the oldest border commissions in the horn of africa region dealing with border issues as can be learned from fana broadcasting corporation 2019 the commission together with the local administrators held its 32nd regular meeting recently in adama town ethiopia in february 2019 at which an agreement was reached to establish joint peace committee igad and international bodies such as the eu and undp have also participated at various times in supporting the establishment of cross border initiatives between the two countries with the ultimate goal of bringing sustainable peace and thus improved livelihood for the border communities of both countries in ethiopia the national and regional fisheries proclamations regulations and guidelines are all in place however there is a lack of awareness about these laws and their implementation by all stakeholders in the daasanach wereda including law enforcement agencies such as police court livestock and fisheries office wereda administration fishers and fish traders although there is a provision restricting fishing area and season in article 4 6 of the southern nations nationalities and peoples regional state snnp fisheries development management and control regulation 62 1999 it has not been properly enforced moreover daasanach wereda livestock and fisheries office which is at the front line for management of the fisheries lacks sufficient resources for follow up and monitoring activities consequently there are widespread fisheries management problems including the use of illegal gears and operations of illegal or unlicensed fishers in the ethiopian part of lake turkana the use of small mesh size and monofilament gillnets has become widespread and remained a major problem illegal traders from kenya provide these gears to the fishers who will eventually sell fish to the traders at low prices and through bartering this lack of proper fisheries management in the ethiopian side of the lake could adversely affect the whole of lake turkana stocks effective management measures of this fishing ground and indeed the whole of lake turkana require regional collaboration between kenya and ethiopia snv 2005 a co management arrangement between ethiopia and kenya would ensure proper regulation of the fishing and associated marketing activities for sustainable socioeconomic returns to the needy local communities depending on this shared lake this study also identified that the co management approach should involve the local community to ensure the sustainability of small scale fisheries of omo river delta and lake turkana in agreement with various studies related to sustainability of small scale fisheries in developing countries evans and andrew 2011 gutiérrez et al 2011 kosamu 2015 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions fisheries in omo river delta and the ethiopian side of lake turkana with a considerable number of commercially important fish species is certainly a key alternative livelihood for the daasanach community around the river and the lake who have much less other livelihood options apart from pastoralism these localities reportedly represent very fertile fishing grounds in terms of the quantity and type of fish species being exploited apparently due to the freshwater inflow from omo river the development of fisheries in these localities however has not received much support from regional as well as international bodies in facilitating the fishers cooperatives and capacitating institutional structures that would support and regulate the fishing process moreover the effective development of fisheries in these localities is marred by a lack of security due to conflicts arising between the ethiopian and kenyan fishers in an apparent competition over a fertile fishing ground a solution to the development of fisheries in these localities therefore requires an approach that integrates conflict resolution from the perspective of ecohydrology sustainable water resource management has four major goals namely enhancement of water resources maintenance and restoration of biodiversity provision of ecosystem services for society and building resilience to climate change and anthropogenic impact zalewski 2013 therefore the present study has covered the ecosystem services component that has related fisheries productivity to a river flow regulation 6 2 recommendations in the interest of developing fisheries and ensuring the sustainability of fisheries resources for the improved livelihood of the local communities we would like to recommend the following measures the ethiopian government should commit itself particularly to strengthening institutions related to fisheries management the regional government should take a prime role of organizing and capacitating institutions such as the wereda livestock and fisheries office cooperatives office and revenue office to enable them fully discharge their duties of regulating and inspecting the fishing activities within its jurisdiction as no training was provided to the fishers in the past local and international ngos should provide continued technical and material assistance as well as training on awareness creation to the fishers cooperatives that have already been organized and being organized on the ethiopian side of lake turkana and omo river delta it is required to strengthen the joint ad hoc committee for conflict resolution between the fishers of the two countries more importantly the joint border commission besides its wider mandate to deal with the entire border issues should handle conflicts arising between turkana and daasanach fisher communities specifically through 1 setting up community elders who can play decisive roles in leading their communities and settling disputes 2 integrating the two communities via various development programs that would reduce competition and enhance cooperation among them and 3 co management arrangement by the two countries in order to regulate illegal fishing in the lake as well as omo river delta furthermore any conflict resolution effort should focus on softening a practice of killing a person from each other s tribe to be considered brave a long held harmful traditional belief that exacerbates the conflicts between the fishers of the two communities policymakers should find the necessary resources material financial and expertise to implement the results of this study and the above recommendations conduct stock assessment and further in depth studies on social and economic aspects of lake turkana via collaborative approach involving professionals from various institutions of the two countries e g kenya marine and fisheries research institute national museums of kenya addis ababa university jimma university ethiopian institute of agriculture research in order to determine the magnitude of the problem however this can be materialized only if the conflicts between the inter competing fishing communities of the two counties are first resolved besides the recent studies that attempted to assess post dam impacts of hydrological changes the impacts on fish migration between lake turkana and omo river for breeding and feeding as well as the environmental base flow of omo river for maintaining fish migration should be studied declaration of competing interest we declare that this manuscript is original and has not been published before nor is currently considered for publication

1058,ethiopia s inland fisheries offer an alternative livelihood for the riparian communities one of these inland fisheries the omo turkana fisheries have not been properly studied and managed the main purpose of this study therefore was to assess social economic aspects and related problems of fisheries in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana for better management and sustainable use of the resources various instruments including structured questionnaires focus group discussions key informant interviews personal observations and secondary sources were used to gather data on the socio economics and management problems of the fisheries the fisheries support a considerable number of the local communities who have much less other livelihood options apart from pastoralism however development of fisheries in these localities is marred by lack of material and technical support to the fishers cooperatives lack of government commitment to capacitate the institutions that work on fisheries management and development and the continued conflicts between ethiopian and kenyan fishers in an apparent competition over a fertile fishing ground for comprehensive insight we developed a fisheries value chain and discussed major issues arising out of it to sustain the fisheries contributions to community livelihoods it is recommended that due attention be given to conflict resolution between the ethiopian daasanach and the kenyan turkana fishers additionally the co management arrangement by the two countries is urgently needed to regulate illegal fishing in the lake as well as the omo river delta keywords conflict ethiopia fisheries kenya lake turkana omo river 1 introduction ethiopia a horn of african nation has a population of more than 100 million un 2017 it has an economy that relies heavily on agriculture which accounts for more than 85 of employment medac 1999 however the country often suffers risks of food insecurity largely due to a recurring drought that affects its crop productions the nation s freshwater system consists of 8 065 km length of rivers and 13 637 km2 area of lakes and reservoirs tesfaye and wolff 2014 its freshwater system supports small scale fisheries that sustain the livelihoods of a considerable number of its people the omo turkana is one of the country s drainage basins that traverses an extensive part in southwestern ethiopia and northern kenya with a catchment area of 131 000 145 500 km2 feibel 2011 velpuri et al 2012 the studies on fish diversity of lake turkana were started in the 1930s by cambridge university and have continued to present time worthington 1931 1932 worthington and richardo 1936 pellegrin 1935 hamblyn 1962 mann 1964 hopson and hopson 1982 kolding 1989 wakjira and getahun 2017 the ethiopian daasanach community also referred to as merille by some is the major inhabitant occupying lower omo river to the delta northern and northeastern shore of the ethiopian side of the lake the population generally constitutes a pastoralist livelihood with sub livelihood systems those residing along omo river are semi pastoralists who used to depend on recession farming the community living in the northeastern part of lake turkana is entirely dependent on lake turkana fishing with no other alternative means of livelihood usaid 2006 personal observations by the authors during various field visits since 2014 show that fisheries in the omo river delta at the junction with lake turkana are important sources of livelihood and income for the local community particularly the youth moreover the first preliminary report by wakjira 2016 indicated that fisheries potential is high in the lower omo river and the ethiopian part of lake turkana with considerable socio economic returns however while fisheries development in the main lake on the kenyan side has received foreign supports hopson 1982 kolding 1989 socioeconomics and management conditions of fisheries on the ethiopian side are not well addressed moreover there exist considerable numbers of development activities including hydropower dams and irrigation weirs in the omo river basin a hydrological impact assessment conducted for the african development bank afdb remarked on the potential impacts of these development activities on the basin fish fauna and the downstream fisheries communities avery 2010 appraisal of any future positive or negative impacts of these development activities on the basin fisheries requires baseline scientific information on fisheries socioeconomics and related characteristics for appropriate intervention and management plan the main purpose of this study is to understand the basic socioeconomic status and related problems of fisheries in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana for better management and sustainable use of the resources therefore the specific objectives of this study include assessing the socio demographic characteristics of the fishers identifying and documenting the commercially important fish species describing fish production consumption and income identifying marketing and value chain of the fisheries and identifying actual and potential conflicts and possible management measures at the study sites 2 study area the study area is located in southern ethiopia at the border with northern kenya approximately 860 km southwest of the capital addis ababa fig 1 lake turkana is the world s largest permanent desert lake located in the eastern arm of the east african great rift valley roughly at geographic coordinates of 02 27 04 40 n 035 50 36 40 e the lake is 257 km long 13 44 km wide and with a surface area of 7 560 km2 a volume of 237 36 km3 and a mean depth of 31 4 m the largest part of the lake lies in northern kenya while it receives more than 90 of its total inflow from omo river that originates in the ethiopian highlands at an elevation of about 2 200 m above sea level the major tributaries of omo river include gibe gojeb gilgel gibe amara alanga denchiya mui zigina shoshuma mantsa and usno with sub tributaries mago and neri the area has an average elevation of 373 3 m above sea level in a lowland agroecological zone it has an annual temperature range of 30 40 c mean 34 5 c with a mean annual rainfall of about 350 mm its wet season extends from april to november receiving a relatively higher amount of rainfall between april and may and september to november despite its bimodal pattern the rainfall generally remains low and erratic eepco 2009 3 methods qualitative and quantitative data were collected using structured questionnaires focus group discussion key informant interview and personal observations in april 2019 the questionnaires were designed to generate data from the fisher respondents in order to reach a large number of respondents more easily and economically major issues addressed in the questionnaires included sociodemographic characteristics of the fishers fishing and livelihood conservation problems and fisheries management items of the questionnaire were tested and refined by removing irrelevant questions based on preliminary information obtained from fishers and fish traders before the commencement of the actual data collection the questionnaire data were collected from a sample of forty fishers with the assistance of trained enumerators focus group discussion fgd was held with fishers representatives fish traders and experts from the livestock and fisheries as well as the cooperatives office of the district the focus group discussion points consisted of items about the fisher communities and fishing fish marketing and those related to conservation problems and fisheries management the fgd was important to obtain in depth perspectives in order to complement data collected via the structured questionnaire as well as to generate pertinent information that otherwise would have been missed in the questionnaire data was also collected from heads of the livestock and fisheries cooperatives and revenue offices who were key informants the items of key informant interview were largely similar to those of fgd and were meant for in depth comprehension and verification of data moreover the investigators took personal observation on most of the issues collected via both questionnaire and fgd to ensure authenticity the methods which involved the above techniques ensure the comprehensive and robust nature of the data collected additionally secondary data related to the fishers income fish consumption gear and boat holding were used from other sources bayley 1982 kmfri 2007 wakjira 2016 quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as means ranges and percentages computed in excel 2013 while qualitative data were presented and narrated 4 results 4 1 sociodemographic characteristics all the forty participants in our present survey 30 from lake turkana and 10 from omo river are male individual fishers from daasanach ethnic group that reside along the bank of the lower omo river and the northern shore of lake turkana they practice indigenous traditional beliefs and have no formal education they are all married heading families of 2 10 persons with an average of four persons in terms of age composition majorities of the study participants 62 are youth in the age range of 21 30 years fig 2 most of these fishers have come from a fishing background 67 5 while a considerable proportion 32 5 also comes from pastoralists 4 2 fisheries and fish marketing the list of commercially important fish species in the lower omo river and the ethiopian side of lake turkana with their local names in daasanach and relative abundance in percentage by number wakjira 2016 is provided in table 1 genera comprising the commercially important species from the highest to the lowest species richness include labeo synodontis schilbe auchenoglanis bagrus hydrocynus alestes citharinus distichodus lates and oreochromis all the fishers who participated in the present survey rely only on fishing for their livelihood and they fish largely for subsistence 78 the majority of these fishers 45 have fished for 10 15 years while considerable numbers 37 5 have also fished up to ten years table 2 the value chain for the fisheries of lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana as determined from the present survey is presented in fig 3 4 3 conflicts and fisheries management conflicts between the ethiopian daasanach and the kenyan turkana tribesmen often occur at the border on the northwest end of lake turkana near omo delta the major conflict related issues identified through the focus group discussion are provided in table 3 moreover there are no well organized fisheries management institutions and structures in the locality fisheries management problems in the lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana identified through the questionnaire survey are summarized in table 4 5 discussion 5 1 sociodemographic characteristics fishing in lower omo river and ethiopian side of lake turkana is undertaken by both individual and organized fishers the fishers literacy rate in the present assessment is lower compared to other fishing communities in ethiopia for example lake zeway where the literacy rate is above 90 janko and zemedu 2015 kassaw 2019 this lower literacy rate would have a negative impact on providing training to the fishers on the techniques of fishing and fish processing fish handling fisheries management and effectively running their financial transactions all the participants of the present study are male fishers who are family heads 5 2 fisheries and fish marketing high productivity and fish diversity in omo delta is attributed to freshwater and nutrient inflow from the omo river shallow depth and low salinity wakjira 2016 it supports high fisheries activities sustaining livelihoods of several fishers from both ethiopia and kenya kmfri 2007 wakjira 2016 on the ethiopian side fishing is more common in the omo river delta at the junction with lake turkana and around the northern shores of the lake from west to east the basin has the highest fish diversity only next to the baro akobo basin in ethiopia golubtsov and darkov 2008 getahun 2017 wakjira and getahun 2017 while 79 valid native fish species occur in the entire omo turkana system 65 species have been reported for part of the basin within the limit of ethiopia wakjira and getahun 2017 despite the high fish diversity in the basin we have determined through our assessment that only 22 fish species are targets of the fisheries of the lower omo river and lake turkana in ethiopia table 1 while the small sized fish species such as alestes baremoze and synodontis schall have the highest relative abundance by number the two accounting for 48 48 relative abundance fisheries in the ethiopian side of lake turkana largely target lates niloticus accounting only for 8 32 relative abundance apparently due to the fishers preference for the large sized individuals thus in the interest of balanced exploitation and sustainability it requires a management intervention to direct the overall fishing pressure from the large fish towards the small fish kolding et al 2019 the responsibility of organizing follow up and monitoring the fishers cooperatives rests in the wereda s cooperative office the history of the formation of fishers cooperatives dates back to 2011 12 when the first groups consisting of four fishers cooperatives with a total of 120 members were formed by the support obtained from agriservice ethiopia a local ngo that provided a fishing boat gears and refrigerators these cooperatives continued to effectively function for three years until 2014 15 when they were disrupted due to a conflict with the kenyan fishers wakjira 2016 of the many landing sites surrounding omo delta and the lake the six functional ones include yerile koriagn lubur ocholoch fejej eriker and bubu a from west to east respectively according to a key informant from the cooperative office five fishers cooperatives are being established at these landing sites most members of the fishers cooperatives are youth largely in their twenties and thirties the cooperatives are governed by their bylaws the establishment of four cooperatives based at bubu a eriker ocholoch and fejej landing sites has been facilitated by veterinarians without frontìeres vsf germany an international ngo that provided fishing gears boat without engine refrigerator and solar panels the two cooperatives based at ocholoch and fejej sites have virtually become functional each of the cooperatives at these four landing sites consisted of 30 members and only one female member at the ocholoch site although there is no cultural barrier that prevents females from being engaged in fishing activity at present the role of females in the fishing community is limited apparently due to the harsh environmental conditions and hardship to fish as learned from the focus group discussion this is also the case in other water bodies of the country kassaw 2019 moreover fish processing such as filleting and drying is also accomplished by the male fishers thus there is still a lot to be done to involve females in the fishing and processing activities the composition of the fishers largely consisted of the indigenous daasanach community and individuals from other parts of southern ethiopia with previous experience in fishing at abaya and chamo lakes the fifth cooperative consisting of 50 or more members at yerile fishing site located at the junction of omo river with the lake turkana in the omo delta is under establishment this cooperative is materially supported by a grant from christensen fund through addis ababa university as this study came to completion basic fishing facilities such as fishing gears a boat and an engine were handed over to the cooperative to make it functional however still more assistance from governmental and non governmental organizations is required to fully strengthen the cooperatives other problems faced by the cooperatives include threat conflict from the kenyan fishers and small payment provided by the traders to the fishers often in the form of bartering historically fishing was for the poor and marginalized sector of the daasanach community that lives essentially close to omo river and lake turkana however that considerable proportion of fishermen in the present assessment comes from the pastoralist background is indicative of a relative shift from pastoralist to fishing sedentary livelihood moreover more people are being attracted to the fishing sector due to a shift in livelihood from recession agriculture locally omoshesh and pastoralism a decrease in recession farming is apparently due to a decrease in the omo river water level the discussion held with the fgd participants indicated that the omo river water level has decreased nowadays possibly due to the upstream development activities in agreement with our assessment various recent studies indicate changes in the volume and seasonality of inflows from omo river owing to the upstream dams and irrigation schemes significantly impacting on the ecology of lower omo river and lake turkana gownaris et al 2016 avery 2017 carr 2017 hodbod et al 2019 tebbs et al 2019 for instance lake turkana water level declined by 1 5 m during the filling up of the gibe iii dam that took place between january 2015 and january 2017 moreover these flow regulations affected the seasonal flood pulse and consequently reduced the downstream sediment transport which in turn affected primary productivity and fisheries hodbod et al 2019 tebbs et al 2019 evaluated the influence of altered hydrological patterns on large scale lake phytoplankton concentrations using satellite data and found a 30 decline in lake turkana chl a during the dam filling period due to the absence of the floods in august september it was also predicted that future abstractions for irrigation activities would cause substantial declines in mean annual chl a ranging from 19 44 depending on the magnitude of abstraction further affecting fisheries ibid other scenarios also suggest that loss of flood pulse could lead to over a two thirds reduction in fisheries yields at any lake level while extreme reductions in absolute lake level i e 25 m will lead to a total collapse of the lake fishery gownaris et al 2016 kolding 1995 demonstrated that change in lake turkana water level is a more important driver than internal factors and fishing of fish abundance and fisheries yield in light of this the hydrological and ecological changes of the omo turkana system could significantly affect the livelihood of the surrounding community who depend on the riverine and lacustrine fisheries for their livelihood the fgd assessment during the present study further identified that incidences of drought also caused a shortage of grazing land and subsequent loss of livestock prompting a shift in livelihood to fishing despite the potential and actual impacts of the hydrological changes affecting the riverine and the lacustrine fisheries on the other hand road infrastructure has recently been improved facilitating livestock marketing as it does the fishery marketing based on an in depth discussion with fgd participants constraints identified from the fisheries value chain analysis fig 3 are a poor capacity of the wereda livestock fisheries and cooperatives offices to effectively support the fishers and document the amount of catch a limited number of ngos for material and technical support unhygienic fish processing lack of adequate preservation facilities and conflicts between ethiopian and kenyan fishers and illegal traders from northern kenya the constraint that has the greatest impact on the value chain is the illegal fish trading as the practice has led to the use of destructive nets with small mesh sizes affecting the sustainability of the fisheries resource the wereda offices mandated to support the fishers are limited in terms of the number of staff and facilities when this study was conducted the above mentioned wereda offices had only three personnel who were in charge and they had no computer and related facilities to document fishing and other relevant data besides the support provided to the fishers cooperative under formation at yerile landing site computer and printer support was provided to the two offices with the assistance obtained from the christensen fund maximum sustainable fisheries yield msy was estimated at 30 000 tons per year during the 1972 1975 survey using a measurement of opercular bones length measurements of salted dried fish and estimates from experimental gillnets bayley 1982 for the kenyan side of lake turkana while a recent annual catch is only 8 000 tons kmfri 2007 in contrast both the msy and the exact annual catch are not known for the ethiopian side of the lake and omo river at present higher amounts of production originate from nile perch fisheries than from nile tilapia and other small sized fish groups a sample of 66 fishers surveyed by wakjira 2016 produced an average of 8 3 tons of nile perch fillets per year from the ethiopian side of lake turkana and omo river while an average of 6 52 tons of nile tilapia and other small sized fish was produced by the same fishers during the same year the fishers are estimated to have consumed 21 24 of their total productions mainly nile tilapia and other smaller fishes while they sold the rest of their productions for income estimated at a total gross value of 10 377 per year analysis by fishing locality shows that fish productions in the lower omo river are largely utilized for household consumption 75 while only very few 25 are sold to restaurants in omorate town for additional income wakjira 2016 in contrast fish productions along the shores of lake turkana are largely for commercial purposes merchandised by both individual and organized fish traders operating at the landing sites during the present assessment there are two individual traders based at bubu a fishing site one individual trader at koriagn lubur site and one enterprise locally known as omo wenz comprehensive fish traders at yerile site consisting of five members in which one is female therefore major market destinations for the filleted nile perch from lake turkana include ethiopian towns of jinka 200 km arba minch 320 km and the capital addis ababa 830 km via these licensed private fish traders fish production and marketing enterprise fpme ethio fishery plc and other private fish marketing companies that used to operate in these localities are no more active snv 2005 according to a key informant from the livestock and fisheries office apart from nile perch all other fishes produced from lake turkana including nile tilapia citharinids distichodontids and bagrids are bought by illegal traders gutted sun dried and transported to kenya uganda and democratic republic of congo drc the presence of kenyan fishers and traders in the ethiopian side of lake turkana is illegal as they are not legally registered and licensed to operate within the nation s jurisdiction the illegal traders buy fishes from the local fishers largely through bartering systems in which they provide the fishers with salt sugar necklace and other ornaments in an exchange for fish moreover the local fishers do not gain any benefit from the fish processing activity as it is solely accomplished by the illegal traders themselves according to the key informant from revenue office the prime focus of ethiopian fish traders is on nile perch and that has caused nile tilapia and other important fishes to be illegally traded to other countries and eventually cause loss of revenue that is to say the ethiopian fish traders who seem to have been interested only in filleted fish marketing have opened a loophole for illegal trading there is no fixed tariff for tax collection from the fish sale nile perch is taxed per kg of fish fillet while nile tilapia and other fishes are taxed per fish regardless of size the wereda revenue office is not fully capacitated in logistics budget and human resources for proper follow up of the revenue collection process this therefore has resulted in a loss of revenue particularly from illegal fish trading there are also possibilities that some legal traders in ethiopia could evade taxation 5 3 conflicts and fisheries management conflict in the region has existed over a long period and relates to cattle rustling grazing land and water yongo et al 2010 there is also an emergence of competition over the productive fishing ground in omo delta and theft of fishing gears boats by the fishers of both sides in recent days omo river delta reportedly is a fertile fishing ground supporting a high amount of fisheries potential there have been repeated incidences of fisheries resource use conflicts between fishers of the two countries a recent and catastrophic incidence of conflict occurred in 2014 15 when the ethiopian fishers in the omo river delta were attacked and their boats and gears were confiscated by the kenyan fishers who came there in search of fertile fishing ground there are also occasions when the ethiopian fishers cross the border following a receding lake during the low lake levels due to the common understanding that the northern part of the lake is in ethiopia and also due to lack of clear boundary marks snv 2005 as per the information from key informants during our field visit an ad hoc committee comprising of ethiopian and kenyan officials from the bordering daasanach and turkana districts representatives of ngos such as catholic church operating in the border areas representative of the intergovernmental authority on development igad stationed at omorate town ethiopian border town and local elders has been formed to resolve any arising conflicts between the ethnic groups of the two countries the conflict arising between the kenyan turkana and the ethiopian daasanach communities in the vicinity of lake turkana and omo river delta is just part of wider conflicts arising along the 861 km long border shared between the two countries therefore achieving sustainable peace and thus improved livelihoods for the fishers operating at omo river delta and lake turkana could be better dealt with by a country level arrangement the ethio kenya joint border commission is one of the oldest border commissions in the horn of africa region dealing with border issues as can be learned from fana broadcasting corporation 2019 the commission together with the local administrators held its 32nd regular meeting recently in adama town ethiopia in february 2019 at which an agreement was reached to establish joint peace committee igad and international bodies such as the eu and undp have also participated at various times in supporting the establishment of cross border initiatives between the two countries with the ultimate goal of bringing sustainable peace and thus improved livelihood for the border communities of both countries in ethiopia the national and regional fisheries proclamations regulations and guidelines are all in place however there is a lack of awareness about these laws and their implementation by all stakeholders in the daasanach wereda including law enforcement agencies such as police court livestock and fisheries office wereda administration fishers and fish traders although there is a provision restricting fishing area and season in article 4 6 of the southern nations nationalities and peoples regional state snnp fisheries development management and control regulation 62 1999 it has not been properly enforced moreover daasanach wereda livestock and fisheries office which is at the front line for management of the fisheries lacks sufficient resources for follow up and monitoring activities consequently there are widespread fisheries management problems including the use of illegal gears and operations of illegal or unlicensed fishers in the ethiopian part of lake turkana the use of small mesh size and monofilament gillnets has become widespread and remained a major problem illegal traders from kenya provide these gears to the fishers who will eventually sell fish to the traders at low prices and through bartering this lack of proper fisheries management in the ethiopian side of the lake could adversely affect the whole of lake turkana stocks effective management measures of this fishing ground and indeed the whole of lake turkana require regional collaboration between kenya and ethiopia snv 2005 a co management arrangement between ethiopia and kenya would ensure proper regulation of the fishing and associated marketing activities for sustainable socioeconomic returns to the needy local communities depending on this shared lake this study also identified that the co management approach should involve the local community to ensure the sustainability of small scale fisheries of omo river delta and lake turkana in agreement with various studies related to sustainability of small scale fisheries in developing countries evans and andrew 2011 gutiérrez et al 2011 kosamu 2015 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions fisheries in omo river delta and the ethiopian side of lake turkana with a considerable number of commercially important fish species is certainly a key alternative livelihood for the daasanach community around the river and the lake who have much less other livelihood options apart from pastoralism these localities reportedly represent very fertile fishing grounds in terms of the quantity and type of fish species being exploited apparently due to the freshwater inflow from omo river the development of fisheries in these localities however has not received much support from regional as well as international bodies in facilitating the fishers cooperatives and capacitating institutional structures that would support and regulate the fishing process moreover the effective development of fisheries in these localities is marred by a lack of security due to conflicts arising between the ethiopian and kenyan fishers in an apparent competition over a fertile fishing ground a solution to the development of fisheries in these localities therefore requires an approach that integrates conflict resolution from the perspective of ecohydrology sustainable water resource management has four major goals namely enhancement of water resources maintenance and restoration of biodiversity provision of ecosystem services for society and building resilience to climate change and anthropogenic impact zalewski 2013 therefore the present study has covered the ecosystem services component that has related fisheries productivity to a river flow regulation 6 2 recommendations in the interest of developing fisheries and ensuring the sustainability of fisheries resources for the improved livelihood of the local communities we would like to recommend the following measures the ethiopian government should commit itself particularly to strengthening institutions related to fisheries management the regional government should take a prime role of organizing and capacitating institutions such as the wereda livestock and fisheries office cooperatives office and revenue office to enable them fully discharge their duties of regulating and inspecting the fishing activities within its jurisdiction as no training was provided to the fishers in the past local and international ngos should provide continued technical and material assistance as well as training on awareness creation to the fishers cooperatives that have already been organized and being organized on the ethiopian side of lake turkana and omo river delta it is required to strengthen the joint ad hoc committee for conflict resolution between the fishers of the two countries more importantly the joint border commission besides its wider mandate to deal with the entire border issues should handle conflicts arising between turkana and daasanach fisher communities specifically through 1 setting up community elders who can play decisive roles in leading their communities and settling disputes 2 integrating the two communities via various development programs that would reduce competition and enhance cooperation among them and 3 co management arrangement by the two countries in order to regulate illegal fishing in the lake as well as omo river delta furthermore any conflict resolution effort should focus on softening a practice of killing a person from each other s tribe to be considered brave a long held harmful traditional belief that exacerbates the conflicts between the fishers of the two communities policymakers should find the necessary resources material financial and expertise to implement the results of this study and the above recommendations conduct stock assessment and further in depth studies on social and economic aspects of lake turkana via collaborative approach involving professionals from various institutions of the two countries e g kenya marine and fisheries research institute national museums of kenya addis ababa university jimma university ethiopian institute of agriculture research in order to determine the magnitude of the problem however this can be materialized only if the conflicts between the inter competing fishing communities of the two counties are first resolved besides the recent studies that attempted to assess post dam impacts of hydrological changes the impacts on fish migration between lake turkana and omo river for breeding and feeding as well as the environmental base flow of omo river for maintaining fish migration should be studied declaration of competing interest we declare that this manuscript is original and has not been published before nor is currently considered for publication

1059,the assessment of the sources abundance and composition of microplastics mps present in the environment is a significant challenge as annually hundreds of millions of plastics are produced and deposited in the environment thus posing real threats hence mps are more frequently perceived as first order environmental pollutants potentially harmful to the health of many groups of organisms to explore the current knowledge in this field we reviewed the scientific literature published mostly in the last 20 years focussing on the presence of mps in water and sediments and their impacts on aquatic ecosystems chinese and us scientists play a leading role in this research field the most commonly used methods of identification and quantification of synthetic polymer particles are fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy due to their high effectiveness however advances in measurement analytics have resulted in the constant development of more accurate methods of collecting and detecting mps in environmental samples necessitating the unification of these methods to develop standard analysis procedures our paper summarises the current knowledge about the sources transport and circulation of mps in the environment based on methods used for identification of the compounds starting from sample collection detection and description to their quantification in water sediments and biota of freshwater ecosystems this holistic approach necessitates focusing research on the importance of mps in the ecohealth approach examining the impact of changes in the global ecosystems on human health keywords microplastic detection aquatic environment analytical methods ecotoxicology 1 introduction microplastics mps are a new type of pollutants including very small 5 mm long pieces of plastic arthur 2009 the continuous increase in their concentration has recently become a major environmental issue because of their persistence ubiquitous occurrence and potential toxicity in aquatic habitats gusmão et al 2016 li et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 threatening biodiversity and potentially human health gall and thompson 2015 chen et al 2020 for decades little was known about the scale of risks caused by the accumulation of mps in aquatic environments and the mechanisms underlying mp migration although our knowledge about the potential damage to the world s oceans has recently increased the impacts of mp on freshwater ecosystems have received less attention there are however some reports on the occurrence of plastics including mps in lakes e g faure et al 2012 rivers e g moore et al 2011 mani et al 2015 and river mouths e g morritt et al 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 potentially causing plastic pollution of marine environments and acting as a plastic sink accumulating plastic from multiple sources microplastics are found in the environment as a result of human activities both on land and in various water bodies the major source of plastic pollution is land where 80 of the plastic originate from andrady 2011 microplastics from terrestrial areas are mainly composed of primary particles derived from cleaning and cosmetic products and secondary particles including fibres or fragments of larger plastic products browne et al 2011 a potential risk posed by mps in the environment is their bioavailability to aquatic organisms kolandhasamy et al 2018 which has been confirmed by toxicological studies of fish benthic invertebrates and zooplankton li et al 2016 nel et al 2018 the total concentration of synthetic or semi synthetic polymers in a given organism is generally closely related to the pollution level of its habitat because of the specific physicochemical properties of mps they are significant stressors in relation to other chemical pollutants potthoff et al 2017 their decomposition results in the release of substances such as bisphenol a bpa which is a toxic xenoestrogen and considered a cause of cardiovascular diseases fertility disturbances and neoplasms rochester 2013 based on previous studies mps can adsorb bacteria viruses or other pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants rodrigues et al 2019 fred ahmadu et al 2020 santos echeandía et al 2020 consequently eliminating some trophic links in the food web unfavourable effects on the feeding metabolism behaviour and fertility of aquatic animals exposed to mps have been observed under laboratory conditions cole et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 recently scientists have started to pay more attention to the issue of mps in water bodies both regarding their concentrations in water as well as the impacts of mp accumulation on human health in this context the ecohealth concept gains importance because it links the changes in the biological physical social and economic environment to human health considerable contributions to the current knowledge about the threats posed by mps have been provided by eu countries the usa canada and australia confirming that identification of the mechanisms of mp transformation is an up to date and increasingly important direction of ecotoxicological research in aquatic habitats this applies not only to the largest easily noticeable fraction of macroplastics 20 mm but also to particles of mesoplastics 5 20 mm mps 5 mm and the smallest fraction nanoplastics 100 nm which have recently been distinguished this review aims to systematize current knowledge about mp circulation in freshwater ecosystems and bioaccumulation in organisms it also indicates the most commonly used methods of sampling and identification of polymer particles 2 literature search this paper reviews a range of studies regarding mps in aquatic ecosystems we analysed the literature using databases such as the web of science and scopus considering research on mps published up to march 2020 the search keywords were as follows microplastics plastics microbeads plastic debris plastic fragment and freshwater of the results we selected a total of 140 publications mainly from the last 20 years with 60 concerning various components of freshwater ecosystems e g water bodies bottom sediments fauna and health problems and 40 focusing on general issues of mp research i e strategies of sample collection processing procedures analytical methods for polymer identification and quantification the importance of these issues is reflected in the increasing numbers of recently published scientific articles concerning these topics according to the web of science wos the total number of articles regarding mp pollution published in the last 10 years exceeded 3 000 and 32 of them originated from china and the usa 14 and 18 respectively among these studies only 40 focused on analysis of freshwater ecosystems although their number has increased significantly in the last two years fig 1 3 methods of sampling and analysis of mp samples from freshwater ecosystems although research on mps has already started in the 1980s the applied methods of sample collection extraction quantification and identification of individual fractions fig 2 have not been standardised yet hampering a reliable comparison of the results in the early stages of this research intensive testing of polymeric microparticles was carried out in marine environments which explains why many methodological procedures were developed based on these results because of their universality they are also used in the study of freshwater ecosystems 3 1 water samples of surface waters are some of the best studied media regarding the occurrence of mps eriksen et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 yu et al 2016 this is mainly due to the low specific weight of mps allowing them to float for some time after a certain period larger plastic items sink and the gradient of mp concentration starts to be directly proportional to the water depth reisser et al 2015 for this reason analyses limited to the surface layer may not adequately reflect the actual mp abundance in water unfortunately no standard recommendations have been developed so far with respect to optimum sampling depth and sampling tools generally using trawling or catching with a net samples from a depth of 0 5 m are obtained eriksen et al 2013 ivar do sul et al 2014 anderson et al 2017 mesh size normally varies from 100 to 500 μm but scientists most frequently use nets with a mesh size of 330 μm hidalgo ruz et al 2012 eriksenet al 2013 zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 baldwin et al 2016 su et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 the use of such sampling tools results from the accepted limit of mp size arthur et al 2009 but also because denser nets would clog up with suspended solids the lack of standard protocols for mp sampling markedly affects the results setälä et al 2016 compared two methods of sample collection from water trawling 333 μm and pumping 300 or 100 μm the estimated concentrations of mps plastic fragments and fibres were highest when the pump with the denser filter was used 0 6 8 n m3 compared to 0 0 8 n m3 for the manta trawl and 0 1 25 n m3 for the other pump 300 μm with the use of less effective methods underestimation of mp content was up to 20 for manta trawl with the largest mesh size some researchers prefer manual sampling which consists of drawing water with a bucket from a depth of about 0 2 m and filtering it through a net with a mesh diameter of 300 μm the basic methodological problem of this procedure is a lack of indication of a minimum volume of water that should be filtered through the net song et al 2014 recommend that 100 dm3 of water should be used whereas other reports indicate much smaller volumes but higher sample numbers leslie et al 2017 3 2 sediments although most mps float on the water surface mp particles with a high density tend to sink for this reason mps in bottom sediments of water bodies are widely studied e g van cauwenberghe et al 2013 nevertheless there are no standards concerning the method of sample collection the necessary amount of collected sediment and the extraction of polymers present both extraction and identification are increasingly difficult with decreasing size and therefore some authors limit their interest to plastic particles 1 mm e g jayasiri et al 2013 baztan et al 2014 or even 2 mm long e g turner and holmes 2011 heo et al 2013 another remarkable problem of mp analysis in bottom sediments is the selection of an appropriate unit microplastic load is often expressed as number of particles per m2 of bottom surface e g martins and sobral 2011 lee et al 2013 or per m3 when determining the mp amount at a specific sediment depth e g ballent et al 2012 turra et al 2014 other commonly used units of volume are ml or l e g nor and obbard 2014 while units of weight vary from g to kg e g mallampati et al 2006 claessens et al 2011 if mp concentration is expressed in relation to weight either wet or dry weight of sediments is used despite some degree of freedom in respect to mp analysis in sediments sampling methods are mostly similar the most frequently used sampling tool is a stainless steel sampler e g ponar after air drying sediment samples are screened through a set of sieves with pore size ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm the mps are collected on the densest sieve subjected to purification from organic matter and finally collected manually and counted 3 3 biota since mps are consumed by organisms fauna samples can be used as indicators for the monitoring of mp contamination in aquatic habitats the most frequently monitored animal groups are fish peters and bratton 2016 invertebrates haegerbaeumer et al 2019 and plankton setälä et al 2014 some species are collected from their natural environment whereas others are reared however davidson and dudas 2016 did not find any important differences in mp consumption between wild and cultured bivalves it is also important to indicate which organs are particularly sensitive to polymer bioaccumulation generally from large individuals only the gastrointestinal tract is taken for sampling while small individuals can be analysed as a whole galgani et al 2013 because of their resistance to the action of digestive enzymes mps are frequently found in the gastrointestinal tracts of the studied organisms however since it is difficult to collect large numbers of samples mp contamination of organisms cannot be determined adequately 3 4 sieving and filtration for mp isolation stainless steel sieves or fibre glass filters are used to minimise procedural pollution and each sieving or filtering operation is followed by rinsing to minimise clogging of the mesh a mesh size of 1 mm is generally used nuelle et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 smaller mesh sizes enable the investigation of the size fraction 500 μm such fractioning is justified as mps 500 μm can be analysed visually hidalgo ruz et al 2012 some studies used sieves or filters with smaller mesh sizes e g 38 65 and 63 μm toobtain the polymers claessens et al 2011 vianello et al 2013 however this comes with its own set of disadvantages such as easy blocking of the mesh difficulty to collect broad range fractions and long processing times to shorten filtration time mp fractions can be separated with the use of stacks of sieves or filters varying in pore size using this approach wu et al 2016 separated paint particles in sediments into four size classes 30 μm 30 63 μm 63 200 μm and 200 2 000 μm size fractionation is also suitable for mps and lambert and wagner 2016 separated three fractions of mps with the use of a 1 mm sieve and filter paper pore size 10 μm similarly mathalon and hill 2014 fractionated polymers 500 μm by using six different sieves 63 106 150 250 355 and 500 μm in a study by browne et al 2010 mps 1 mm comprised 65 of all plastic elements collected in sediments along the shoreline of the tamar estuary uk further research should standardise polymer size ranges to allow comparisons of mps from the same fractions also detailed identification and quantification of mps require methodological refinement 3 5 extraction to improve mining efficiency of material extraction from sediments and wastewater the density separation method is frequently used consisting of mixing of the sample with a flotation solution in most studies saturated nacl solution 1 2 kg l 1 is applied as it is cheap and not toxic to humans browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 its use for typical extraction with mixing allows to separate 80 100 of mp particles fries et al 2013 however smaller particles 1 µm can be separated less effectively i e only about 40 weight that s why not only filtered seawater or distilled water but also nacl solution has been applied hanvey et al 2017 however none of these solutions would be useful to separate high density mps such as pvc or polyoxymethylene alternative salt solutions used for this purpose include sodium polytungstate spt 1 4 1 5 kg l 1 corcoran et al 2015 cacl2 1 3 kg l 1 stolte et al 2015 or nai 1 8 kg l 1 nuelle et al 2014 the choice of these solutions is based on the assessment of the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the process for example fluidisation in nacl solution combined with flotation in nai solution can result in a high recovery rate of up to 99 nuelle et al 2014 the purification process can be divided into two main categories chemical degradation and enzymatic degradation aimed to eliminate polluting substances e g organic tissues and inorganic particulates in the first approach mps are treated with a 10 30 solution of h2o2 zettler et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 or peroxide mixed with acids such as h2so4 imhof et al 2013 to develop a short but effective purification procedure prata et al 2019a subjected organic matter to combinations of various treatments 1 redox solutions h2o2 h2o2 fe koh hno3 and surfactant 2 temperature 25 and 50 c 3 time 1 and 6 h the combination of a strong redox activity h2o2 fe and a high ph koh was most successful at a period of 1 h at and a temperature of 50 c 65 9 and 58 3 respectively individual testing of organic matter under such conditions showed that h2o2 fe was the most suitable agent for the removal of plant material while koh was most effective in animal tissue removal however the highest efficiency of up to 90 was reached when using 1m naoh cole et al 2014 digestion efficiency is strongly and positively correlated with concentration and temperature but the threshold values seem to be 10m naoh and 60 c as higher values lead to mp destruction for this reason a more reliable method of sample purification is based on the use of h2o2 another recent approach to remove organic substances is enzymatic degradation using a mixture of biocatalysts such as amylases proteases chitinases and cellulases e g cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 enabling the removal of organic substances such as proteins lipids and carbohydrates in a study by cole et al 2014 the use of a proteolytic enzyme proteinase k for sample purification allowed the removal of 97 of plankton w w while the structure of the mps remained unchanged although this procedure can reduce working time and provides reliable results it requires along digestion time up to 15 days and this approach therefore needs to be further refined a combination of several methods such as density separation with chemical and enzymatic degradation can increase the final efficiency up to 98 löder et al 2017 3 6 identification and quantification of mps achieving a suitable purity of samples containing mp particles allows their visual sorting aimed to separate mps for continued identification and quantification hidalgo ruz et al 2012 qiu et al 2016 this step is limited to qualitative analyses of micropolymers and the effectiveness of purification determines the possibility of mp separation from similar pollution in samples for this reason various methods are used in the current quantitative qualitative analyses of mps such as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pygc ms raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir liquid chromatography or labelling table 1 identification and quantification polymer particles in the aquatic environment are usually based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and raman spectroscopy rs käppler et al 2016 3 7 sources of mps in freshwater microplastics are particularly common near plastic processing plants in industrial and domestic wastewaters discharged into rivers hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and in estuaries browne et al 2010 vianello et al 2013 gall and thompson 2015 globally china produces the largest amount of mps contributing approximately 26 to the global release including both primary and secondary particles fig 3 globally the average release of 1 5 106 tonnes of plastics annually corresponds to a release of 210 g per person which further corresponds to 43 lightweight plastic bags disposed of in the environment per person or about one per week boucher and friot 2017 primary mps are synthetic or semi synthetic microscopic polymers mostly including molecules added to cleaning agents e g toothpaste and cosmetic products such as face powders or foundations browne et al 2011 plastic particles used in cosmetics for desquamation peeling of hands or face have replaced traditionally used ingredients of natural origin such as sugar salt ground fruit stones and pumice chang 2013 reported that polyethylene particles included in cosmetic products 60 800 µm annually accumulated in the environment from one investigated building weighed about 5 kg microplastics are also components of insect repellents and sunscreens castañeda et al 2014 duis and coors 2016 as well as of synthetic clothes primary mps are also used in abrasive blasting of machines engines and boats to remove rust and varnish a side effect of such multiple uses of polymers is their pollution with heavy metals e g cadmium chromium and lead wang et al 2017a primary mps can have various structures but fibres are the most commonly identified forms in freshwater ecosystems di and wang 2018 they are mostly derived from synthetic textiles released into the environment via washing or abrasion it is estimated that during one washing cycle as many as 1 900 plastic fibres can be released browne et al 2011 globally the annual production of synthetic fibres used for clothing reaches 7 x 107 tonnes with an average of 11 kg per person fao icac 2013 recent research shows that large amounts of fibres have been dispersed especially in urbanised areas due to precipitation dris et al 2016 and there is evidence that tires and horizontal road signs can also be a source of mps horton et al 2017b plastic products under the influence of physical chemical and biological processes are gradually decomposed into smaller parts forming secondary mps these fragments can derive from the decomposition of plastic films industrial and consumer products home appliances or fragments of polymers from biodegradable plastics hidalgo ruz et al 2012 free et al 2014 under the influence of ultraviolet uv radiation plastic fragments are photodegraded cracking and turning brittle and yellowish andrady 2011 in aquatic habitats this process is slower leading to the accumulation of polymer fragments gesamp 2015 based on our findings various forms of synthetic polymers must be analysed table 2 3 8 toxicological impact of mps on living organisms the constant increase in mp concentration is becoming an increasingly important issue because of the associated ecotoxicological threats the influence of microplastics on organisms depends on the bioavailability wu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 which is based on physicochemical features of mps such as particle dimension and polymer density scherer et al 2017 because the shape and density can be largely different depending on the type of polymer these features can determine the place of mps in the aquatic environment water surface water sediment and thus which organisms may be exposed to them de sá et al 2018 the effects of these compounds are essentially the same on marine and freshwater organisms transfer of pollutants to organisms including freshwater hydrobionts can occur through direct exposure to mps absorption of impurities from water phases such as water external exposure or body fluids internal exposure or through contact with mps or adhesion to the external e g skin skeleton or internal surface e g intestines gill walls of the body besseling et al 2015 campbell et al 2017 de sá et al 2018 a smaller size increases mp bioavailability as the particles can be directly swallowed by more organisms peters and bratton 2016 ma et al 2016 campbell et al 2017 hurley et al 2017 horton et al 2018 silva cavalcanti et al 2017 which is a long term threat not only because of the mechanical blockage of the digestive tract of organisms but also because of the high toxicity table 3 since their size is similar to the fraction of sediments and planktonic organisms planktivores can passively consume mps during normal feeding or mistake them for natural food setälä et al 2014 tanaka and takada 2016 li et al 2016 found that mps 250 μm accounted for 20 80 of consumed particles swallowing of contaminated prey can also be a source of mps de sá et al 2018 the transfer of swallowed mps from the digestive system to the circulatory system of aquatic organisms in addition to important toxic effects may cause damage to important organs such as the heart or liver brown et al 2008 as well as the gills karami et al 2016 and the lysosomal system in addition to damage of the haemolymph and within haemocytes bakir et al 2014 nonetheless scientists are more interested in the fact that mps can increase the availability of pollutants adsorbed on their surface liao and yang 2019 liu et al 2020 toxins in water are initially sorbed by mps and can be desorbed in animals and humans solubilisation in digestive fluids results in higher rates of desorption increasing mp assimilation by the organism zarfl et al 2011 several studies have confirmed that the rate of desorption of adsorbed pollutants in organisms was considerably faster than that in water bakir et al 2014 rivera hernández et al 2019 found that hg adsorbed on mp particles accumulated in the digestive gland however over 70 of the accumulated mp hg uptake were quickly eliminated with the removal of mps from the mussel body kärrman et al 2016 reported an increase in the desorption of plastic contaminants in the presence of organic matter and surfactants this has also been found by ahrens et al 2001 where digestive surfactants from deposit feeders led to an increase in the desorption of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl pcb and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah the sorptive behaviour of durable organic pollutants at varying parameters of water quality and polymer types has attracted increased attention in the last few years lee et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 e g regarding polychlorinated biphenyl pcb velzeboer et al 2014 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt rios et al 2010 which are highly toxic and persistent in the environment of these pcb is carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic hammer et al 2012 while ddt can lead to unfavourable neurological effects and lower immunity mansouri et al 2016 microplastics are associated with several unfavourable effects e g carcinogenic activity and disturbance of the hormonal system teuten et al 2009 reducing fish population lowering species richness and evenness as well as diminishing growth and reproduction of freshwater amphibians au et al 2015 ma et al 2016 studied the action of phenanthrene phe with mps of various sizes 10 50 μm and the associated toxicity for daphnia magna they reported that during 14 days of incubation 50 µm particles showed a high toxicity and physical damage to this crustacean whereas mps of 10 μm did not have any considerable influence on the accumulation dispersal and change of phe in another study african catfish clarias gariepinus was exposed to pure mps or with phe for 96 h at the end of the experiment significant histopathological changes in gills and the liver were observed accompanied by changes in biochemical parameters of blood and transcription of some genes in the fish karami et al 2016 rochman et al 2017 elaborated a model to distinguish bioaccumulation of pcbs between polymers pet pe pvc ps the authors also investigated the impact of various mp types including pcbs on bivalves under this model pcb accumulation in bivalves exposed to pe and ps would be higher than in those exposed to pet and pvc moreover at the end of a 28 day exposure the greatest histopathological abnormalities were observed in bivalves fed with pcb pvc or pcb ps however many additives such as heavy metals can be more damaging than the polymers themselves filella and turner 2018 this is important because effects of mp accumulation can be observed at all trophic levels scherer et al 2017 posing a potential threat to top predators including humans castañeda et al 2014 driedger et al 2015 in everyday life humans are generally constantly in contact with synthetic polymers in the light of current knowledge mps can enter the human body via ingestion inhalation and dermal contact prata et al 2020 dong et al 2020 exposure to mps in the environment can be directly or indirectly e g through food tanaka and takada 2016 wu et al 2019 rochman et al 2015 estimated the mp concentration in fish intended for human consumption and discovered plastic particles in 25 33 of single fish and 55 67 of all species after entering the body mps do not undergo chemical degradation and can be resistant to mechanical removal resulting in their deposition and embedding in tissues studies conducted among mammals indicate that mps can pass through live cells to the lymphatic system e g in the digestive tract and to the blood cycle accumulate in internal organs and disrupt the functioning of the immune system and cell health prata et al 2020 gambino et al 2020 analysis of biological toxicity indicates that potential toxicity resulting from exposure to mps can induce a set of different reactions the development of inflammation genotoxicity oxidative stress disruption of planned cell death apoptosis and development of necrosis persistence of these effects may lead to tissue damage fibrosis and the formation of malignant tumours deng et al 2017 the effects of mp consumption are still poorly studied and require intensive research particularly in freshwater ecosystems browne 2015 scherer et al 2017 4 conclusions based on the results of an extensive literature research we conclude that mps are widespread in the environment including freshwater ecosystems and negatively impact environmental systems and organisms currently china is the major source of primary and secondary mps and chinese scientists provided most of the information on the presence of plastics in freshwater ecosystems concerning both new methods of detection of synthetic polymer particles and their effects on aquatic organisms despite this the presence and transformation of plastics require further research especially with respect to the factors responsible for their distribution globally researchers are currently developing methods for mp detection and standardised protocols are needed to facilitate comparisons and monitoring of these compounds also complex investigations into bioaccumulation migration and toxicity levels of mps in the environment are needed based on combined in situ and ex situ research progress in research on mps in freshwater ecosystems should include i development of a standardised system for identification and quantification of mps in respect of composition size and form ii quantification of the rate of decomposition of macroplastics iii clarification of protocols for mp monitoring in various components of

1059,the assessment of the sources abundance and composition of microplastics mps present in the environment is a significant challenge as annually hundreds of millions of plastics are produced and deposited in the environment thus posing real threats hence mps are more frequently perceived as first order environmental pollutants potentially harmful to the health of many groups of organisms to explore the current knowledge in this field we reviewed the scientific literature published mostly in the last 20 years focussing on the presence of mps in water and sediments and their impacts on aquatic ecosystems chinese and us scientists play a leading role in this research field the most commonly used methods of identification and quantification of synthetic polymer particles are fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy due to their high effectiveness however advances in measurement analytics have resulted in the constant development of more accurate methods of collecting and detecting mps in environmental samples necessitating the unification of these methods to develop standard analysis procedures our paper summarises the current knowledge about the sources transport and circulation of mps in the environment based on methods used for identification of the compounds starting from sample collection detection and description to their quantification in water sediments and biota of freshwater ecosystems this holistic approach necessitates focusing research on the importance of mps in the ecohealth approach examining the impact of changes in the global ecosystems on human health keywords microplastic detection aquatic environment analytical methods ecotoxicology 1 introduction microplastics mps are a new type of pollutants including very small 5 mm long pieces of plastic arthur 2009 the continuous increase in their concentration has recently become a major environmental issue because of their persistence ubiquitous occurrence and potential toxicity in aquatic habitats gusmão et al 2016 li et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 threatening biodiversity and potentially human health gall and thompson 2015 chen et al 2020 for decades little was known about the scale of risks caused by the accumulation of mps in aquatic environments and the mechanisms underlying mp migration although our knowledge about the potential damage to the world s oceans has recently increased the impacts of mp on freshwater ecosystems have received less attention there are however some reports on the occurrence of plastics including mps in lakes e g faure et al 2012 rivers e g moore et al 2011 mani et al 2015 and river mouths e g morritt et al 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 potentially causing plastic pollution of marine environments and acting as a plastic sink accumulating plastic from multiple sources microplastics are found in the environment as a result of human activities both on land and in various water bodies the major source of plastic pollution is land where 80 of the plastic originate from andrady 2011 microplastics from terrestrial areas are mainly composed of primary particles derived from cleaning and cosmetic products and secondary particles including fibres or fragments of larger plastic products browne et al 2011 a potential risk posed by mps in the environment is their bioavailability to aquatic organisms kolandhasamy et al 2018 which has been confirmed by toxicological studies of fish benthic invertebrates and zooplankton li et al 2016 nel et al 2018 the total concentration of synthetic or semi synthetic polymers in a given organism is generally closely related to the pollution level of its habitat because of the specific physicochemical properties of mps they are significant stressors in relation to other chemical pollutants potthoff et al 2017 their decomposition results in the release of substances such as bisphenol a bpa which is a toxic xenoestrogen and considered a cause of cardiovascular diseases fertility disturbances and neoplasms rochester 2013 based on previous studies mps can adsorb bacteria viruses or other pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants rodrigues et al 2019 fred ahmadu et al 2020 santos echeandía et al 2020 consequently eliminating some trophic links in the food web unfavourable effects on the feeding metabolism behaviour and fertility of aquatic animals exposed to mps have been observed under laboratory conditions cole et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 recently scientists have started to pay more attention to the issue of mps in water bodies both regarding their concentrations in water as well as the impacts of mp accumulation on human health in this context the ecohealth concept gains importance because it links the changes in the biological physical social and economic environment to human health considerable contributions to the current knowledge about the threats posed by mps have been provided by eu countries the usa canada and australia confirming that identification of the mechanisms of mp transformation is an up to date and increasingly important direction of ecotoxicological research in aquatic habitats this applies not only to the largest easily noticeable fraction of macroplastics 20 mm but also to particles of mesoplastics 5 20 mm mps 5 mm and the smallest fraction nanoplastics 100 nm which have recently been distinguished this review aims to systematize current knowledge about mp circulation in freshwater ecosystems and bioaccumulation in organisms it also indicates the most commonly used methods of sampling and identification of polymer particles 2 literature search this paper reviews a range of studies regarding mps in aquatic ecosystems we analysed the literature using databases such as the web of science and scopus considering research on mps published up to march 2020 the search keywords were as follows microplastics plastics microbeads plastic debris plastic fragment and freshwater of the results we selected a total of 140 publications mainly from the last 20 years with 60 concerning various components of freshwater ecosystems e g water bodies bottom sediments fauna and health problems and 40 focusing on general issues of mp research i e strategies of sample collection processing procedures analytical methods for polymer identification and quantification the importance of these issues is reflected in the increasing numbers of recently published scientific articles concerning these topics according to the web of science wos the total number of articles regarding mp pollution published in the last 10 years exceeded 3 000 and 32 of them originated from china and the usa 14 and 18 respectively among these studies only 40 focused on analysis of freshwater ecosystems although their number has increased significantly in the last two years fig 1 3 methods of sampling and analysis of mp samples from freshwater ecosystems although research on mps has already started in the 1980s the applied methods of sample collection extraction quantification and identification of individual fractions fig 2 have not been standardised yet hampering a reliable comparison of the results in the early stages of this research intensive testing of polymeric microparticles was carried out in marine environments which explains why many methodological procedures were developed based on these results because of their universality they are also used in the study of freshwater ecosystems 3 1 water samples of surface waters are some of the best studied media regarding the occurrence of mps eriksen et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 yu et al 2016 this is mainly due to the low specific weight of mps allowing them to float for some time after a certain period larger plastic items sink and the gradient of mp concentration starts to be directly proportional to the water depth reisser et al 2015 for this reason analyses limited to the surface layer may not adequately reflect the actual mp abundance in water unfortunately no standard recommendations have been developed so far with respect to optimum sampling depth and sampling tools generally using trawling or catching with a net samples from a depth of 0 5 m are obtained eriksen et al 2013 ivar do sul et al 2014 anderson et al 2017 mesh size normally varies from 100 to 500 μm but scientists most frequently use nets with a mesh size of 330 μm hidalgo ruz et al 2012 eriksenet al 2013 zhao et al 2014 mani et al 2015 baldwin et al 2016 su et al 2016 anderson et al 2017 the use of such sampling tools results from the accepted limit of mp size arthur et al 2009 but also because denser nets would clog up with suspended solids the lack of standard protocols for mp sampling markedly affects the results setälä et al 2016 compared two methods of sample collection from water trawling 333 μm and pumping 300 or 100 μm the estimated concentrations of mps plastic fragments and fibres were highest when the pump with the denser filter was used 0 6 8 n m3 compared to 0 0 8 n m3 for the manta trawl and 0 1 25 n m3 for the other pump 300 μm with the use of less effective methods underestimation of mp content was up to 20 for manta trawl with the largest mesh size some researchers prefer manual sampling which consists of drawing water with a bucket from a depth of about 0 2 m and filtering it through a net with a mesh diameter of 300 μm the basic methodological problem of this procedure is a lack of indication of a minimum volume of water that should be filtered through the net song et al 2014 recommend that 100 dm3 of water should be used whereas other reports indicate much smaller volumes but higher sample numbers leslie et al 2017 3 2 sediments although most mps float on the water surface mp particles with a high density tend to sink for this reason mps in bottom sediments of water bodies are widely studied e g van cauwenberghe et al 2013 nevertheless there are no standards concerning the method of sample collection the necessary amount of collected sediment and the extraction of polymers present both extraction and identification are increasingly difficult with decreasing size and therefore some authors limit their interest to plastic particles 1 mm e g jayasiri et al 2013 baztan et al 2014 or even 2 mm long e g turner and holmes 2011 heo et al 2013 another remarkable problem of mp analysis in bottom sediments is the selection of an appropriate unit microplastic load is often expressed as number of particles per m2 of bottom surface e g martins and sobral 2011 lee et al 2013 or per m3 when determining the mp amount at a specific sediment depth e g ballent et al 2012 turra et al 2014 other commonly used units of volume are ml or l e g nor and obbard 2014 while units of weight vary from g to kg e g mallampati et al 2006 claessens et al 2011 if mp concentration is expressed in relation to weight either wet or dry weight of sediments is used despite some degree of freedom in respect to mp analysis in sediments sampling methods are mostly similar the most frequently used sampling tool is a stainless steel sampler e g ponar after air drying sediment samples are screened through a set of sieves with pore size ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm the mps are collected on the densest sieve subjected to purification from organic matter and finally collected manually and counted 3 3 biota since mps are consumed by organisms fauna samples can be used as indicators for the monitoring of mp contamination in aquatic habitats the most frequently monitored animal groups are fish peters and bratton 2016 invertebrates haegerbaeumer et al 2019 and plankton setälä et al 2014 some species are collected from their natural environment whereas others are reared however davidson and dudas 2016 did not find any important differences in mp consumption between wild and cultured bivalves it is also important to indicate which organs are particularly sensitive to polymer bioaccumulation generally from large individuals only the gastrointestinal tract is taken for sampling while small individuals can be analysed as a whole galgani et al 2013 because of their resistance to the action of digestive enzymes mps are frequently found in the gastrointestinal tracts of the studied organisms however since it is difficult to collect large numbers of samples mp contamination of organisms cannot be determined adequately 3 4 sieving and filtration for mp isolation stainless steel sieves or fibre glass filters are used to minimise procedural pollution and each sieving or filtering operation is followed by rinsing to minimise clogging of the mesh a mesh size of 1 mm is generally used nuelle et al 2014 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 smaller mesh sizes enable the investigation of the size fraction 500 μm such fractioning is justified as mps 500 μm can be analysed visually hidalgo ruz et al 2012 some studies used sieves or filters with smaller mesh sizes e g 38 65 and 63 μm toobtain the polymers claessens et al 2011 vianello et al 2013 however this comes with its own set of disadvantages such as easy blocking of the mesh difficulty to collect broad range fractions and long processing times to shorten filtration time mp fractions can be separated with the use of stacks of sieves or filters varying in pore size using this approach wu et al 2016 separated paint particles in sediments into four size classes 30 μm 30 63 μm 63 200 μm and 200 2 000 μm size fractionation is also suitable for mps and lambert and wagner 2016 separated three fractions of mps with the use of a 1 mm sieve and filter paper pore size 10 μm similarly mathalon and hill 2014 fractionated polymers 500 μm by using six different sieves 63 106 150 250 355 and 500 μm in a study by browne et al 2010 mps 1 mm comprised 65 of all plastic elements collected in sediments along the shoreline of the tamar estuary uk further research should standardise polymer size ranges to allow comparisons of mps from the same fractions also detailed identification and quantification of mps require methodological refinement 3 5 extraction to improve mining efficiency of material extraction from sediments and wastewater the density separation method is frequently used consisting of mixing of the sample with a flotation solution in most studies saturated nacl solution 1 2 kg l 1 is applied as it is cheap and not toxic to humans browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 its use for typical extraction with mixing allows to separate 80 100 of mp particles fries et al 2013 however smaller particles 1 µm can be separated less effectively i e only about 40 weight that s why not only filtered seawater or distilled water but also nacl solution has been applied hanvey et al 2017 however none of these solutions would be useful to separate high density mps such as pvc or polyoxymethylene alternative salt solutions used for this purpose include sodium polytungstate spt 1 4 1 5 kg l 1 corcoran et al 2015 cacl2 1 3 kg l 1 stolte et al 2015 or nai 1 8 kg l 1 nuelle et al 2014 the choice of these solutions is based on the assessment of the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the process for example fluidisation in nacl solution combined with flotation in nai solution can result in a high recovery rate of up to 99 nuelle et al 2014 the purification process can be divided into two main categories chemical degradation and enzymatic degradation aimed to eliminate polluting substances e g organic tissues and inorganic particulates in the first approach mps are treated with a 10 30 solution of h2o2 zettler et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 or peroxide mixed with acids such as h2so4 imhof et al 2013 to develop a short but effective purification procedure prata et al 2019a subjected organic matter to combinations of various treatments 1 redox solutions h2o2 h2o2 fe koh hno3 and surfactant 2 temperature 25 and 50 c 3 time 1 and 6 h the combination of a strong redox activity h2o2 fe and a high ph koh was most successful at a period of 1 h at and a temperature of 50 c 65 9 and 58 3 respectively individual testing of organic matter under such conditions showed that h2o2 fe was the most suitable agent for the removal of plant material while koh was most effective in animal tissue removal however the highest efficiency of up to 90 was reached when using 1m naoh cole et al 2014 digestion efficiency is strongly and positively correlated with concentration and temperature but the threshold values seem to be 10m naoh and 60 c as higher values lead to mp destruction for this reason a more reliable method of sample purification is based on the use of h2o2 another recent approach to remove organic substances is enzymatic degradation using a mixture of biocatalysts such as amylases proteases chitinases and cellulases e g cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 enabling the removal of organic substances such as proteins lipids and carbohydrates in a study by cole et al 2014 the use of a proteolytic enzyme proteinase k for sample purification allowed the removal of 97 of plankton w w while the structure of the mps remained unchanged although this procedure can reduce working time and provides reliable results it requires along digestion time up to 15 days and this approach therefore needs to be further refined a combination of several methods such as density separation with chemical and enzymatic degradation can increase the final efficiency up to 98 löder et al 2017 3 6 identification and quantification of mps achieving a suitable purity of samples containing mp particles allows their visual sorting aimed to separate mps for continued identification and quantification hidalgo ruz et al 2012 qiu et al 2016 this step is limited to qualitative analyses of micropolymers and the effectiveness of purification determines the possibility of mp separation from similar pollution in samples for this reason various methods are used in the current quantitative qualitative analyses of mps such as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry pygc ms raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir liquid chromatography or labelling table 1 identification and quantification polymer particles in the aquatic environment are usually based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and raman spectroscopy rs käppler et al 2016 3 7 sources of mps in freshwater microplastics are particularly common near plastic processing plants in industrial and domestic wastewaters discharged into rivers hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and in estuaries browne et al 2010 vianello et al 2013 gall and thompson 2015 globally china produces the largest amount of mps contributing approximately 26 to the global release including both primary and secondary particles fig 3 globally the average release of 1 5 106 tonnes of plastics annually corresponds to a release of 210 g per person which further corresponds to 43 lightweight plastic bags disposed of in the environment per person or about one per week boucher and friot 2017 primary mps are synthetic or semi synthetic microscopic polymers mostly including molecules added to cleaning agents e g toothpaste and cosmetic products such as face powders or foundations browne et al 2011 plastic particles used in cosmetics for desquamation peeling of hands or face have replaced traditionally used ingredients of natural origin such as sugar salt ground fruit stones and pumice chang 2013 reported that polyethylene particles included in cosmetic products 60 800 µm annually accumulated in the environment from one investigated building weighed about 5 kg microplastics are also components of insect repellents and sunscreens castañeda et al 2014 duis and coors 2016 as well as of synthetic clothes primary mps are also used in abrasive blasting of machines engines and boats to remove rust and varnish a side effect of such multiple uses of polymers is their pollution with heavy metals e g cadmium chromium and lead wang et al 2017a primary mps can have various structures but fibres are the most commonly identified forms in freshwater ecosystems di and wang 2018 they are mostly derived from synthetic textiles released into the environment via washing or abrasion it is estimated that during one washing cycle as many as 1 900 plastic fibres can be released browne et al 2011 globally the annual production of synthetic fibres used for clothing reaches 7 x 107 tonnes with an average of 11 kg per person fao icac 2013 recent research shows that large amounts of fibres have been dispersed especially in urbanised areas due to precipitation dris et al 2016 and there is evidence that tires and horizontal road signs can also be a source of mps horton et al 2017b plastic products under the influence of physical chemical and biological processes are gradually decomposed into smaller parts forming secondary mps these fragments can derive from the decomposition of plastic films industrial and consumer products home appliances or fragments of polymers from biodegradable plastics hidalgo ruz et al 2012 free et al 2014 under the influence of ultraviolet uv radiation plastic fragments are photodegraded cracking and turning brittle and yellowish andrady 2011 in aquatic habitats this process is slower leading to the accumulation of polymer fragments gesamp 2015 based on our findings various forms of synthetic polymers must be analysed table 2 3 8 toxicological impact of mps on living organisms the constant increase in mp concentration is becoming an increasingly important issue because of the associated ecotoxicological threats the influence of microplastics on organisms depends on the bioavailability wu et al 2019 chen et al 2020 which is based on physicochemical features of mps such as particle dimension and polymer density scherer et al 2017 because the shape and density can be largely different depending on the type of polymer these features can determine the place of mps in the aquatic environment water surface water sediment and thus which organisms may be exposed to them de sá et al 2018 the effects of these compounds are essentially the same on marine and freshwater organisms transfer of pollutants to organisms including freshwater hydrobionts can occur through direct exposure to mps absorption of impurities from water phases such as water external exposure or body fluids internal exposure or through contact with mps or adhesion to the external e g skin skeleton or internal surface e g intestines gill walls of the body besseling et al 2015 campbell et al 2017 de sá et al 2018 a smaller size increases mp bioavailability as the particles can be directly swallowed by more organisms peters and bratton 2016 ma et al 2016 campbell et al 2017 hurley et al 2017 horton et al 2018 silva cavalcanti et al 2017 which is a long term threat not only because of the mechanical blockage of the digestive tract of organisms but also because of the high toxicity table 3 since their size is similar to the fraction of sediments and planktonic organisms planktivores can passively consume mps during normal feeding or mistake them for natural food setälä et al 2014 tanaka and takada 2016 li et al 2016 found that mps 250 μm accounted for 20 80 of consumed particles swallowing of contaminated prey can also be a source of mps de sá et al 2018 the transfer of swallowed mps from the digestive system to the circulatory system of aquatic organisms in addition to important toxic effects may cause damage to important organs such as the heart or liver brown et al 2008 as well as the gills karami et al 2016 and the lysosomal system in addition to damage of the haemolymph and within haemocytes bakir et al 2014 nonetheless scientists are more interested in the fact that mps can increase the availability of pollutants adsorbed on their surface liao and yang 2019 liu et al 2020 toxins in water are initially sorbed by mps and can be desorbed in animals and humans solubilisation in digestive fluids results in higher rates of desorption increasing mp assimilation by the organism zarfl et al 2011 several studies have confirmed that the rate of desorption of adsorbed pollutants in organisms was considerably faster than that in water bakir et al 2014 rivera hernández et al 2019 found that hg adsorbed on mp particles accumulated in the digestive gland however over 70 of the accumulated mp hg uptake were quickly eliminated with the removal of mps from the mussel body kärrman et al 2016 reported an increase in the desorption of plastic contaminants in the presence of organic matter and surfactants this has also been found by ahrens et al 2001 where digestive surfactants from deposit feeders led to an increase in the desorption of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyl pcb and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah the sorptive behaviour of durable organic pollutants at varying parameters of water quality and polymer types has attracted increased attention in the last few years lee et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 e g regarding polychlorinated biphenyl pcb velzeboer et al 2014 and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt rios et al 2010 which are highly toxic and persistent in the environment of these pcb is carcinogenic mutagenic and or teratogenic hammer et al 2012 while ddt can lead to unfavourable neurological effects and lower immunity mansouri et al 2016 microplastics are associated with several unfavourable effects e g carcinogenic activity and disturbance of the hormonal system teuten et al 2009 reducing fish population lowering species richness and evenness as well as diminishing growth and reproduction of freshwater amphibians au et al 2015 ma et al 2016 studied the action of phenanthrene phe with mps of various sizes 10 50 μm and the associated toxicity for daphnia magna they reported that during 14 days of incubation 50 µm particles showed a high toxicity and physical damage to this crustacean whereas mps of 10 μm did not have any considerable influence on the accumulation dispersal and change of phe in another study african catfish clarias gariepinus was exposed to pure mps or with phe for 96 h at the end of the experiment significant histopathological changes in gills and the liver were observed accompanied by changes in biochemical parameters of blood and transcription of some genes in the fish karami et al 2016 rochman et al 2017 elaborated a model to distinguish bioaccumulation of pcbs between polymers pet pe pvc ps the authors also investigated the impact of various mp types including pcbs on bivalves under this model pcb accumulation in bivalves exposed to pe and ps would be higher than in those exposed to pet and pvc moreover at the end of a 28 day exposure the greatest histopathological abnormalities were observed in bivalves fed with pcb pvc or pcb ps however many additives such as heavy metals can be more damaging than the polymers themselves filella and turner 2018 this is important because effects of mp accumulation can be observed at all trophic levels scherer et al 2017 posing a potential threat to top predators including humans castañeda et al 2014 driedger et al 2015 in everyday life humans are generally constantly in contact with synthetic polymers in the light of current knowledge mps can enter the human body via ingestion inhalation and dermal contact prata et al 2020 dong et al 2020 exposure to mps in the environment can be directly or indirectly e g through food tanaka and takada 2016 wu et al 2019 rochman et al 2015 estimated the mp concentration in fish intended for human consumption and discovered plastic particles in 25 33 of single fish and 55 67 of all species after entering the body mps do not undergo chemical degradation and can be resistant to mechanical removal resulting in their deposition and embedding in tissues studies conducted among mammals indicate that mps can pass through live cells to the lymphatic system e g in the digestive tract and to the blood cycle accumulate in internal organs and disrupt the functioning of the immune system and cell health prata et al 2020 gambino et al 2020 analysis of biological toxicity indicates that potential toxicity resulting from exposure to mps can induce a set of different reactions the development of inflammation genotoxicity oxidative stress disruption of planned cell death apoptosis and development of necrosis persistence of these effects may lead to tissue damage fibrosis and the formation of malignant tumours deng et al 2017 the effects of mp consumption are still poorly studied and require intensive research particularly in freshwater ecosystems browne 2015 scherer et al 2017 4 conclusions based on the results of an extensive literature research we conclude that mps are widespread in the environment including freshwater ecosystems and negatively impact environmental systems and organisms currently china is the major source of primary and secondary mps and chinese scientists provided most of the
