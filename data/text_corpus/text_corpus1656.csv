structures making it possible to identify the main factors influencing changes in hab occurrence these results can inform operating methods for hydraulic structures to improve river water quality management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the geum river is the third largest river in south korea with a length of 395 km and watershed area of 9912 km2 the river starts from the bottom center of its basin and flows into yongdam lake and daecheong lake the fifth and the third largest reservoirs in the country respectively fig 1 below daecheong dam the river turns to the west total length of the study area in the river is 69 5 km from daecheong balancing reservoir dam dbrd to baekje weir fig 1 the gab cheon river tr1 enters at 5 km from dbrd with second greatest pollutant loads in the study area then the miho cheon river tr2 enters at 20 5 km with the greatest loads the sejong weir weir1 is located at 27 5 km followed by gongju weir weir2 at 46 5 km and baekje weir weir3 at 69 5 km after the weir3 the river flows to the west sea via geumgang estuary dam the study area has 9 water level monitoring stations wl1 to 6 weir1 to 3 9 water quality monitoring stations on the mainstream q1 to 9 q1 represents the upstream area and q9 represents the downstream area and 6 water quality monitoring stations tr1 to 6 on tributaries fig 1 each weir has a different shape gate type and specifications supplemental fig 1 operation in 2018 was implemented with partial opening of gates on each weir the gates of weir1 and weir2 were operated with the goal of full opening and for weir 3 the gates were opened only for a limited period supplemental fig 2 2 2 water quality characteristics of the study sites water quality metrics including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chl a showed both temporal and spatial variation in the study reach between 2010 and 2018 figs 2 and 3 the three weirs were completed in october 2011 so the dataset covers the period prior and post construction water quality at q1 showed the lowest concentrations for tn tp and chl a the first tributary tr1 delivers urban pollutant loads from daejeon city with over a million residents tn and tp concentrations at q2 sharply increased by 2 3 and 3 4 times on average respectively the second tributary tr2 carries pollutants from cheongiu city and its vicinity as a result water quality concentrations at q3 averaged 2 6 and 5 4 times the minimum tn and tp at q1 showing the worst condition in the study area water quality of the weir1 weir2 and weir3 have been monitored at q3 q6 and q9 respectively water quality downstream gradually improved due to natural processes such as sedimentation or biochemical reactions though more pollutants were likely introduced from tributaries and other unknown sources summer monsoon weather in korea increases sediment delivery during storm events jones et al 2009 as tp tends to be strongly adsorbed to sediment its concentration during summer storms will increase in contrast tn is dominated as dissolved forms and is relatively independent of sediment transport seo and kim 2016 nitrogen to phosphorus n p ratios of ten or less indicate nitrogen limited systems for algal growth while the ratio of twenty or greater indicates a phosphorus limited system thomann and mueller 1987 n p ratios in the geum river supplemental fig 3 were calculated using 1 tn tp and 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen hereafter din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus po4 p hereafter dip which are considered available forms for phytoplankton growth the ratios were mostly above 20 indicating growth of algae in the geum river was controlled by phosphorus in most seasons diatoms dominated the suspended phytoplankton at all sampling sites supplemental table 1 a seasonal increase in chl a however occurs at each site during summer fig 4 when the dominant cyanobacteria taxa were microcystis 83 aphanizomenon 13 anabaena 2 and oscillatoria 2 maximum chl a in 2018 was 209 9 mg m3 at q6 although nutrient concentrations were higher at q3 fig 4 this result suggests hydraulic residence time limited algal growth in weir1 due to increased water velocity during open gate conditions in 2018 summer peak chl a was lowest 120 1 mg m3 at q9 among the three weirs which seems related to dip depletion during active algal growth at q6 discussed in detail later 2 3 model construction and application 2 3 1 hydrodynamic and water quality model the major purpose of model application is to analyze possible outcomes by computer methods given actual operation can be costly or impossible to implement mathematical model application is best suited for scenario analysis or sensitivity analysis in this study environment fluid dynamics code efdc a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model hamrick 1992 was used this model has been applied to rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas in various locations li et al 2011 park et al 2005 tang et al 2016 the efdc can efficiently reflect complicated morphology of the study site using orthogonal curvilinear coordinate methods chikhliwala and yortsos 1985 and can consider weir operation the water quality module of efdc is focused on the growth of multiple algal groups park et al 1995 a detailed description of efdc can be found in previous studies bae and seo 2018 kim et al 2017 in addition the equation for algal growth of efdc is in the supplemental file equations 1 3 2 3 2 grid development for this study a grid system was developed with 6698 horizontal cells and 5 vertical cells by the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method fig 5 the number and size of horizontal cells were adjusted to accurately reflect locations of water gates in each weir the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1928 was less than 0 4 and the average of orthogonal deviation od was 1 37 the suggested limit of cfl number for an appropriate grid system is 1 0 and the closer the od is to 0 the smaller the error for developed curvilinear grid 2 3 3 boundary condition water quality temperature flow rates and meteorological data were obtained from the national database system of the republic of korea water nier go kr wamis go kr data kma go kr data were interpolated as daily rates for variables with longer monitoring intervals algae were divided into three groups as cyanobacteria diatoms and other algae including green algae and flagellates supplemental table 1 2 4 calibration of water levels and water quality concentrations model calibrations were performed against field observations in 2018 water level calibrations were performed at 9 water level monitoring stations including 6 water level monitoring stations and 3 weir locations water quality calibrations were performed at 8 water quality monitoring stations q2 9 for total organic carbon toc tn tp chl a do ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and dip fig 6 shows the calibration results for three weir locations calibration accuracy was calculated table 1 using root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 the parameters were initially chosen from previous research reports bowie et al 1985 shin et al 2008 and adjusted further to improve calibration accuracy table 2 2 5 scenario development in this study three water level operation scenarios were considered closed means weir gates remain closed all year and water flows over fixed structures in contrast open indicates all the weir gates remain open and water flows freely through the gates water levels differ between the closed and open scenarios table 3 during the 2018 evaluation weir gates were operated between closed and open levels for various test purposes and this flow condition is characterized as field supplemental fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in water levels and water quality due to gate control water level water temperature and velocity fluctuated in three weirs in response to gate control scenarios fig 7 fully closed condition closed fully open condition open and field operation condition field after 2018 to evaluate the effects of different gate operations volume averaged values of 40 horizontal and vertical cells were used in the vicinity of weirs for the weighted averaged values calculated values for open and field scenarios were compared with the closed scenario at each weir table 4 water temperature in all regions does not show appreciable differences among these scenarios however in closed water temperature averaged 0 5 higher than in other scenarios water velocity was the fastest for open and the slowest for closed the hydraulic residence time in a finite segment is inversely proportional to water velocity for the same cross sectional area therefore annual average hydraulic residence times were 0 26 0 40 times lower for open than closed conditions water quality and algal biomass varied in response to gate operation scenarios fig 8 while tn and din do not show large changes greater changes were observed in dip chl a cyanobacteria cyano and toc for open tp increased in weir3 by 79 relative to the closed operation concurrent with seasonal algal growth days 200 240 toc was affected by increases in chl a reflecting production of organic material through photosynthetic activity two different peaks were observed for cyano during the summer and fall during the non summer periods chl a was considerably higher in weir2 than elsewhere in the study reach in weir1 dip was depleted under the closed scenario when the algal biomass measured as chl a and cyano peaked at 131 and 94 mg m3 respectively days 200 240 which coincided with increased hydraulic residence time dip depletion however was also occurred in weir2 and weir3 during the same period for all gate scenarios while dip depletion did not occur in weir1 during days 290 310 it occurred in weir2 and weir3 only for closed annual average chl a and cyano were lower in all locations in the study site in an open scenario relative to closed condition table 4 and fig 8 the maximum change rates of annual average chl a and cyano were 52 and 55 in weir2 and weir1 respectively whereas the minimum change rates of them were 28 and 2 in weir1 and weir3 respectively algal bloom occurrence however shows a seasonal pattern and annual averages may not fully represent field conditions in open summer averages of cyano were 55 and 36 lower for weir1 and weir2 but this was 17 higher in weir3 than closed the maximum value of cyano in the first peak was 71 and 14 lower in weir1 and weir2 but it was 90 higher in weir3 in open than closed noteworthy average bottom slopes from dbrd to weir1 and from weir2 to weir3 are 0 054 and 0 012 respectively steeper bottom slopes increase the kinematic water velocity due to increased gravity higher water velocity reduces hydraulic residence time allowing less time for algal growth this effect was especially pronounced in weir1 in the upper stream area of this study site where the bottom slope was the steepest for open less algal growth would result in reduced uptake of dip which would increase dip transport downstream therefore lower uptake of dip in weir1 provides nutrients for algal growth in weir2 and weir3 during open conditions despite shorter residence time than closed this situation may lead to a chain reaction downstream during the period between days 200 240 during this same period days 200 240 in weir1 closed showed higher chl a and cyano than open and coincided with extremely low dip fig 8 and supplemental table 2 in weir2 chl a and cyano peaks relative to weir1 were lower by 31 and 19 during closed operation whereas they were 29 and 143 larger during open this difference was due to dip uptake occurring in weir1 during the closed scenario which did not occur during the open operation in weir3 dip was depleted during the closed operation which may limit algal growth dip in open condition however it was supplied from upstream at concentrations to support algal growth therefore gate operation in the open condition may reduce algal blooms upstream but may increase them downstream in conclusion algal blooms in the study site seem to be determined by not only residence time but also the delivery of limiting nutrients especially dip from the upstream reach 3 2 changes in algal growth limiting conditions due to gate operations din and dip are limiting nutrients for algal growth supplemental eq 2 odum and barrett 1971 as confirmed by n p ratios supplemental fig 3 dip is the nutrient controlling algal growth in the geum river in this study dip was especially low in all cases during days 200 240 when habs were 20 mg m3 chl a for all scenarios and all locations this phenomenon in weir1 was more pronounced for closed than other gate operations but dip depletion occurred for all gate conditions in weir2 and weir3 concurrent with summer algal blooms when the second algae peak occurred in fall however dip was higher in weir2 and weir3 for open than closed reflecting less consumption in upstream and greater supply to downstream areas it is probable that extreme hab occurrences can occur downstream of weir3 though this area is beyond the scope of this study light availability for algal photosynthesis supplemental eq 3 steele 1965 is a function of water depth h and light extinction coefficient ke also ke is a function of total suspended solids and chl a concentration supplemental eq 6 reflecting scattering and adsorption by particulates consequently algal growth benefits when the water depth is shallow as is the case in the open scenario however during days 200 240 light limiting factors were lowest for all gate conditions concurrent with peak chl a and cyano as a result of self shading by phytoplankton which made ke larger during this period depth control may not be the major factor for algal blooms fig 9 in this paper total multiplication of limiting factors supplemental eq 1 di toro et al 1971 will be referred to as the net growth limiting ngl value for algal growth algal growth becomes closer to the maximum when this value is closer to unity ngl table 5 was calculated during summer days 180 320 when cyano peaks occurred in the study site open showed 0 38 0 64 ngl values while closed showed 0 13 0 38 which means cyanobacteria can grow up to 4 times greater in open this contrast seems in response to reduction of water depth allowing greater light penetration also more dip would be available for weir2 and weir3 when open although annual average ngls increased in open water velocity also increased to evaluate the effect of the residence time change lagrangian particle tracking lpt dunsbergen and stelling 1993 hamrick 1992 was used for cyano particles the lpt method uses total derivative rather than partial derivative to accurately track the path of a particle in the water in this study lpt module in efdc was applied and a hundred particles were introduced every 10 days for 7 times during the summer between days 180 and 240 when cyano growth was greatest in all conditions lpt residence time can be 1 2 6 7 times longer with an average of 3 7 times longer for closed than open table 6 to assess the dominant factor affecting algal growth which would be either a decrease in hydraulic residence time dhrt or an increase in net growth limitation ingl factors for open and field scenarios were compared with the based case closed data from table 6 individual scenarios were plotted in dhrt vs ingl space and assessed relative to the isocline of no net change fig 10 positive direction on the y axis suggests favorable conditions for algal growth whereas positive on the x axis does not at the x y intercept 0 0 algal growth conditions for open and field options are the same as closed in the case of o5 fig 10 its coordinates are 85 1495 which means residence time decreased by 85 17 33 2 58 17 33 0 85 while ngl increased by 1 495 0 299 0 022 0 022 14 95 this calculation indicates ingl in o5 is far greater than dhrt suggesting the algal growth rate would be higher for open than closed despite the shorter residence time alternatively coordinates of f7 fig 10 are 21 6 7 where dhrt is greater than ingl fig 11 shows horizontal cyano distributions in the study site on the 206th day july 25th in the surface layer during the hydrodynamic simulation for closed cyano or harmful algal bloom occurred at the highest level at a location between weir1 and weir2 for field and open the maximum hab occurrence locations tend to move further downstream due to increased hydrodynamic transportation under the open scenario the lateral difference of cyano became more pronounced as longitudinal advection was stronger which would limit lateral transportation of matter compared to other scenarios for open lateral cyano distribution in weir1 became more apparent when tr2 the largest tributary in the study area was introduced which increased velocity in the left side of the river from upper to downstream direction kim et al 2018 this pattern was more pronounced near weir2 and downstream shown in the magnified section of fig 12 in contrast closed shows an almost completely mixed pattern in the lateral direction near weir3 cyano growth was apparently greater along the river margins than the middle in open therefore when the gate operation method changed from closed to open habs occurrence pattern changed both in a longitudinal direction as well as lateral the lateral pattern for toc tn tp chl a and cyano in the right center and left cells in three weirs shows distinct differences fig 12 in closed weir2 and weir3 did not show significant concentration differences in the lateral direction relative to other scenarios the most obvious concentration distinction was found in open overall nutrient concentrations tended to become greater at the right side of the river and this pattern was clearer in open case 4 conclusion the purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the water quality and hab occurrence dynamics in the 69 5 km section of the geum river in response to gate operation controls closed open and field of 3 in stream weirs the major findings are as follows when gates were fully open annual averages of habs decreased by 55 upstream weir1 and 2 downstream weir3 summer averages and peak values however were lower in upstream areas and higher downstream the summer peak value of cyanobacteria in weir3 was nearly two times greater 97 for open than closed therefore open can reduce hab occurrences in upstream area but can cause habs proliferation downstream when habs occurred during summer dip depletion was observed in all locations indicating p was the limiting factor for algal growth for open decreased hydraulic residence time allowed less time for algal growth and this would result in less consumption of dip upstream allowing greater dip delivery downstream as a result less consumed dip in weir1 promotes algal bloom occurrences in weir2 and weir3 in open in addition water depth reduction in all regions provides more light for photosynthesis therefore algal blooms in the study site seem regulated by not only physical changes including hydraulic residence time hrt time and vertical average light but also the availability of limiting nutrients especially dip in the study site hrts were estimated by lagrangian particle tracking lpt method in efdc model summer average hrt was 3 7 times longer for closed than open the plot of dhrt decrease in hydraulic residence time versus ingl increase in nutrient growth limitation was developed to evaluate factors controlling algal growth control under alternative gate operations relative to a base case closed most of the time ingl were significantly higher than dhrt which indicates nutrient effect on algal growth would be greater than the effect of water velocity despite the interconnection between these factors this research focused on the changes in habs for the full opening and closing of gates in the three weirs actual operation methods of the weir gates however can be determined using various combinations of gate control this study considered limited scenarios for specific time conditions there may be limits to generalize the weir gate operation method for all circumstances therefore further study would be necessary considering external and internal conditions of the receiving water body on water quality and habs occurrences this study suggests the effect of physical changes on the improvement of water quality and habs would be limited when other factors such as pollution load do not change although this conclusion was derived for a specific river similar results and conclusions can be drawn in other water systems using the same analysis methodology the weir gate control in the geum river will affect hydrodynamic conditions and algal growth kinetics along the river significantly downstream areas are directly affected by operations upstream which determines conditions that promote hab occurrence careful consideration must be made before making any decision on whether gate operations should be changed or gates removed credit authorship contribution statement jaeyoung kim conceptualization methodology software formal

nitrogen limited systems for algal growth while the ratio of twenty or greater indicates a phosphorus limited system thomann and mueller 1987 n p ratios in the geum river supplemental fig 3 were calculated using 1 tn tp and 2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen hereafter din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus po4 p hereafter dip which are considered available forms for phytoplankton growth the ratios were mostly above 20 indicating growth of algae in the geum river was controlled by phosphorus in most seasons diatoms dominated the suspended phytoplankton at all sampling sites supplemental table 1 a seasonal increase in chl a however occurs at each site during summer fig 4 when the dominant cyanobacteria taxa were microcystis 83 aphanizomenon 13 anabaena 2 and oscillatoria 2 maximum chl a in 2018 was 209 9 mg m3 at q6 although nutrient concentrations were higher at q3 fig 4 this result suggests hydraulic residence time limited algal growth in weir1 due to increased water velocity during open gate conditions in 2018 summer peak chl a was lowest 120 1 mg m3 at q9 among the three weirs which seems related to dip depletion during active algal growth at q6 discussed in detail later 2 3 model construction and application 2 3 1 hydrodynamic and water quality model the major purpose of model application is to analyze possible outcomes by computer methods given actual operation can be costly or impossible to implement mathematical model application is best suited for scenario analysis or sensitivity analysis in this study environment fluid dynamics code efdc a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model hamrick 1992 was used this model has been applied to rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas in various locations li et al 2011 park et al 2005 tang et al 2016 the efdc can efficiently reflect complicated morphology of the study site using orthogonal curvilinear coordinate methods chikhliwala and yortsos 1985 and can consider weir operation the water quality module of efdc is focused on the growth of multiple algal groups park et al 1995 a detailed description of efdc can be found in previous studies bae and seo 2018 kim et al 2017 in addition the equation for algal growth of efdc is in the supplemental file equations 1 3 2 3 2 grid development for this study a grid system was developed with 6698 horizontal cells and 5 vertical cells by the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method fig 5 the number and size of horizontal cells were adjusted to accurately reflect locations of water gates in each weir the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1928 was less than 0 4 and the average of orthogonal deviation od was 1 37 the suggested limit of cfl number for an appropriate grid system is 1 0 and the closer the od is to 0 the smaller the error for developed curvilinear grid 2 3 3 boundary condition water quality temperature flow rates and meteorological data were obtained from the national database system of the republic of korea water nier go kr wamis go kr data kma go kr data were interpolated as daily rates for variables with longer monitoring intervals algae were divided into three groups as cyanobacteria diatoms and other algae including green algae and flagellates supplemental table 1 2 4 calibration of water levels and water quality concentrations model calibrations were performed against field observations in 2018 water level calibrations were performed at 9 water level monitoring stations including 6 water level monitoring stations and 3 weir locations water quality calibrations were performed at 8 water quality monitoring stations q2 9 for total organic carbon toc tn tp chl a do ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and dip fig 6 shows the calibration results for three weir locations calibration accuracy was calculated table 1 using root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 the parameters were initially chosen from previous research reports bowie et al 1985 shin et al 2008 and adjusted further to improve calibration accuracy table 2 2 5 scenario development in this study three water level operation scenarios were considered closed means weir gates remain closed all year and water flows over fixed structures in contrast open indicates all the weir gates remain open and water flows freely through the gates water levels differ between the closed and open scenarios table 3 during the 2018 evaluation weir gates were operated between closed and open levels for various test purposes and this flow condition is characterized as field supplemental fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in water levels and water quality due to gate control water level water temperature and velocity fluctuated in three weirs in response to gate control scenarios fig 7 fully closed condition closed fully open condition open and field operation condition field after 2018 to evaluate the effects of different gate operations volume averaged values of 40 horizontal and vertical cells were used in the vicinity of weirs for the weighted averaged values calculated values for open and field scenarios were compared with the closed scenario at each weir table 4 water temperature in all regions does not show appreciable differences among these scenarios however in closed water temperature averaged 0 5 higher than in other scenarios water velocity was the fastest for open and the slowest for closed the hydraulic residence time in a finite segment is inversely proportional to water velocity for the same cross sectional area therefore annual average hydraulic residence times were 0 26 0 40 times lower for open than closed conditions water quality and algal biomass varied in response to gate operation scenarios fig 8 while tn and din do not show large changes greater changes were observed in dip chl a cyanobacteria cyano and toc for open tp increased in weir3 by 79 relative to the closed operation concurrent with seasonal algal growth days 200 240 toc was affected by increases in chl a reflecting production of organic material through photosynthetic activity two different peaks were observed for cyano during the summer and fall during the non summer periods chl a was considerably higher in weir2 than elsewhere in the study reach in weir1 dip was depleted under the closed scenario when the algal biomass measured as chl a and cyano peaked at 131 and 94 mg m3 respectively days 200 240 which coincided with increased hydraulic residence time dip depletion however was also occurred in weir2 and weir3 during the same period for all gate scenarios while dip depletion did not occur in weir1 during days 290 310 it occurred in weir2 and weir3 only for closed annual average chl a and cyano were lower in all locations in the study site in an open scenario relative to closed condition table 4 and fig 8 the maximum change rates of annual average chl a and cyano were 52 and 55 in weir2 and weir1 respectively whereas the minimum change rates of them were 28 and 2 in weir1 and weir3 respectively algal bloom occurrence however shows a seasonal pattern and annual averages may not fully represent field conditions in open summer averages of cyano were 55 and 36 lower for weir1 and weir2 but this was 17 higher in weir3 than closed the maximum value of cyano in the first peak was 71 and 14 lower in weir1 and weir2 but it was 90 higher in weir3 in open than closed noteworthy average bottom slopes from dbrd to weir1 and from weir2 to weir3 are 0 054 and 0 012 respectively steeper bottom slopes increase the kinematic water velocity due to increased gravity higher water velocity reduces hydraulic residence time allowing less time for algal growth this effect was especially pronounced in weir1 in the upper stream area of this study site where the bottom slope was the steepest for open less algal growth would result in reduced uptake of dip which would increase dip transport downstream therefore lower uptake of dip in weir1 provides nutrients for algal growth in weir2 and weir3 during open conditions despite shorter residence time than closed this situation may lead to a chain reaction downstream during the period between days 200 240 during this same period days 200 240 in weir1 closed showed higher chl a and cyano than open and coincided with extremely low dip fig 8 and supplemental table 2 in weir2 chl a and cyano peaks relative to weir1 were lower by 31 and 19 during closed operation whereas they were 29 and 143 larger during open this difference was due to dip uptake occurring in weir1 during the closed scenario which did not occur during the open operation in weir3 dip was depleted during the closed operation which may limit algal growth dip in open condition however it was supplied from upstream at concentrations to support algal growth therefore gate operation in the open condition may reduce algal blooms upstream but may increase them downstream in conclusion algal blooms in the study site seem to be determined by not only residence time but also the delivery of limiting nutrients especially dip from the upstream reach 3 2 changes in algal growth limiting conditions due to gate operations din and dip are limiting nutrients for algal growth supplemental eq 2 odum and barrett 1971 as confirmed by n p ratios supplemental fig 3 dip is the nutrient controlling algal growth in the geum river in this study dip was especially low in all cases during days 200 240 when habs were 20 mg m3 chl a for all scenarios and all locations this phenomenon in weir1 was more pronounced for closed than other gate operations but dip depletion occurred for all gate conditions in weir2 and weir3 concurrent with summer algal blooms when the second algae peak occurred in fall however dip was higher in weir2 and weir3 for open than closed reflecting less consumption in upstream and greater supply to downstream areas it is probable that extreme hab occurrences can occur downstream of weir3 though this area is beyond the scope of this study light availability for algal photosynthesis supplemental eq 3 steele 1965 is a function of water depth h and light extinction coefficient ke also ke is a function of total suspended solids and chl a concentration supplemental eq 6 reflecting scattering and adsorption by particulates consequently algal growth benefits when the water depth is shallow as is the case in the open scenario however during days 200 240 light limiting factors were lowest for all gate conditions concurrent with peak chl a and cyano as a result of self shading by phytoplankton which made ke larger during this period depth control may not be the major factor for algal blooms fig 9 in this paper total multiplication of limiting factors supplemental eq 1 di toro et al 1971 will be referred to as the net growth limiting ngl value for algal growth algal growth becomes closer to the maximum when this value is closer to unity ngl table 5 was calculated during summer days 180 320 when cyano peaks occurred in the study site open showed 0 38 0 64 ngl values while closed showed 0 13 0 38 which means cyanobacteria can grow up to 4 times greater in open this contrast seems in response to reduction of water depth allowing greater light penetration also more dip would be available for weir2 and weir3 when open although annual average ngls increased in open water velocity also increased to evaluate the effect of the residence time change lagrangian particle tracking lpt dunsbergen and stelling 1993 hamrick 1992 was used for cyano particles the lpt method uses total derivative rather than partial derivative to accurately track the path of a particle in the water in this study lpt module in efdc was applied and a hundred particles were introduced every 10 days for 7 times during the summer between days 180 and 240 when cyano growth was greatest in all conditions lpt residence time can be 1 2 6 7 times longer with an average of 3 7 times longer for closed than open table 6 to assess the dominant factor affecting algal growth which would be either a decrease in hydraulic residence time dhrt or an increase in net growth limitation ingl factors for open and field scenarios were compared with the based case closed data from table 6 individual scenarios were plotted in dhrt vs ingl space and assessed relative to the isocline of no net change fig 10 positive direction on the y axis suggests favorable conditions for algal growth whereas positive on the x axis does not at the x y intercept 0 0 algal growth conditions for open and field options are the same as closed in the case of o5 fig 10 its coordinates are 85 1495 which means residence time decreased by 85 17 33 2 58 17 33 0 85 while ngl increased by 1 495 0 299 0 022 0 022 14 95 this calculation indicates ingl in o5 is far greater than dhrt suggesting the algal growth rate would be higher for open than closed despite the shorter residence time alternatively coordinates of f7 fig 10 are 21 6 7 where dhrt is greater than ingl fig 11 shows horizontal cyano distributions in the study site on the 206th day july 25th in the surface layer during the hydrodynamic simulation for closed cyano or harmful algal bloom occurred at the highest level at a location between weir1 and weir2 for field and open the maximum hab occurrence locations tend to move further downstream due to increased hydrodynamic transportation under the open scenario the lateral difference of cyano became more pronounced as longitudinal advection was stronger which would limit lateral transportation of matter compared to other scenarios for open lateral cyano distribution in weir1 became more apparent when tr2 the largest tributary in the study area was introduced which increased velocity in the left side of the river from upper to downstream direction kim et al 2018 this pattern was more pronounced near weir2 and downstream shown in the magnified section of fig 12 in contrast closed shows an almost completely mixed pattern in the lateral direction near weir3 cyano growth was apparently greater along the river margins than the middle in open therefore when the gate operation method changed from closed to open habs occurrence pattern changed both in a longitudinal direction as well as lateral the lateral pattern for toc tn tp chl a and cyano in the right center and left cells in three weirs shows distinct differences fig 12 in closed weir2 and weir3 did not show significant concentration differences in the lateral direction relative to other scenarios the most obvious concentration distinction was found in open overall nutrient concentrations tended to become greater at the right side of the river and this pattern was clearer in open case 4 conclusion the purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the water quality and hab occurrence dynamics in the 69 5 km section of the geum river in response to gate operation controls closed open and field of 3 in stream weirs the major findings are as follows when gates were fully open annual averages of habs decreased by 55 upstream weir1 and 2 downstream weir3 summer averages and peak values however were lower in upstream areas and higher downstream the summer peak value of cyanobacteria in weir3 was nearly two times greater 97 for open than closed therefore open can reduce hab occurrences in upstream area but can cause habs proliferation downstream when habs occurred during summer dip depletion was observed in all locations indicating p was the limiting factor for algal growth for open decreased hydraulic residence time allowed less time for algal growth and this would result in less consumption of dip upstream allowing greater dip delivery downstream as a result less consumed dip in weir1 promotes algal bloom occurrences in weir2 and weir3 in open in addition water depth reduction in all regions provides more light for photosynthesis therefore algal blooms in the study site seem regulated by not only physical changes including hydraulic residence time hrt time and vertical average light but also the availability of limiting nutrients especially dip in the study site hrts were estimated by lagrangian particle tracking lpt method in efdc model summer average hrt was 3 7 times longer for closed than open the plot of dhrt decrease in hydraulic residence time versus ingl increase in nutrient growth limitation was developed to evaluate factors controlling algal growth control under alternative gate operations relative to a base case closed most of the time ingl were significantly higher than dhrt which indicates nutrient effect on algal growth would be greater than the effect of water velocity despite the interconnection between these factors this research focused on the changes in habs for the full opening and closing of gates in the three weirs actual operation methods of the weir gates however can be determined using various combinations of gate control this study considered limited scenarios for specific time conditions there may be limits to generalize the weir gate operation method for all circumstances therefore further study would be necessary considering external and internal conditions of the receiving water body on water quality and habs occurrences this study suggests the effect of physical changes on the improvement of water quality and habs would be limited when other factors such as pollution load do not change although this conclusion was derived for a specific river similar results and conclusions can be drawn in other water systems using the same analysis methodology the weir gate control in the geum river will affect hydrodynamic conditions and algal growth kinetics along the river significantly downstream areas are directly affected by operations upstream which determines conditions that promote hab occurrence careful consideration must be made before making any decision on whether gate operations should be changed or gates removed credit authorship contribution statement jaeyoung kim conceptualization methodology software formal

8281,study region the new formulation was applied in a complex tropical river system of luanginga sub basin western zambia study focus we propose a novel pseudo reservoir concept hereinafter psrc in the framework of the soil and water assessment tool swat to mimick and model the behavior of an alluvial floodplain outflows from psrc are predicated on a conceptual storage outflow stage relationship

understanding of water resources dynamics in typical environments as the present study area the model can also potentially be useful for applied studies such as restoration designs and impact assessment of modified floodplains keywords soil and water assessment tool reservoir outflows targeted release reservoir alluvial floodplain pseudo reservoir concept critical bankful height 1 introduction floodplains are relatively low lying areas surrounding active river channels that periodically flood during high flow events syvitski et al 2012 burt et al 2002 define alluvial floodplains as fringing wetlands that receive water from river rainwater groundwater and hillslope for this reason alluvial floodplains are regarded as part of an integrated system of the watershed with a perennial or seasonal connection with the parent water body such as a river or lake cole et al 2003 maintaining natural river floodplain connectivity is critical for sustainable supply of numerous ecosystem services that have significant socio economic and environmental benefits emerton and bos 2004 these include mitigating flood damage by sequestrating excess runoff bullock and acreman 2003 controlling erosion by slowing the rate of overland flow acreman and holden 2013 improving water quality through absorption recycling and filtering of pollutant load brookes and shields 1996 recharging aquifers and sustaining base flow in a river kondolf et al 1987 and providing habitats for a myriad of aquatic species nygaard and ejrneas 2009 modeling natural functions of floodplain wetlands is a topical issue in environmental studies e g junk et al 1989 reckendorfer et al 2006 cabezas et al 2009 wang et al 2010 this interest has arguably grown largely due to the need to protect such functions from adverse effects of land use and climate changes which are linked to environmentally degenerative anthropogenic activities for instance it is held that a shift from hard control to use of hydrogeomorphic principles in the management of floodplains is critical for ensuring sustainability of many of the natural functions acreman et al 2003 the traditional goal of the former has been to control floods or store large volumes of water often without serious consideration for sediment transport in maintaining channel stability and to the detriment of maintenance of river bio diversity steiger et al 2005 flooding is also often studied from an ecological or hydrological perspective without due attention to understanding how hydrogeomorphic attributes of floodplains affect the mechanics of flood transmission lininger and latrubesse 2016 floodplain wetlands can be studied in details at site scale using computational models e g restrepo et al 1998 lee et al 2002 kazezyilmaj alhan et al 2007 this is however not sufficient as obtained results at one site cannot easily be interpreted from an integrated water resources management perspective lee et al 2017 on the other hand it is feasible to use global rainfall runoff models to study cumulative effects of several floodplain wetlands on hydrological processes however most basin scale hydrological models do not represent floodplain river interactions and wetlands and their functions adequately liu et al 2008 sun et al 2015 evenson et al 2018 integration of floodplain wetland dynamics into most of such models has also been largely neglected hughes et al 2013 riparian water bodies in swat have been studied using i wetland modules which consider detailed physical processes of interest ii the swat reservoir module development of the former has been largely motivated by the desire to simulate dynamic flow exchange between riparian water bodies and their associated streams and aquifers for instance liu et al 2008 replaced the routing algorithm in swat s wetland module with more robust hydraulic routing as well as incorporating lateral subsurface wetland river interactions however this solution still has several shortcomings rahman et al 2016 it also requires considerable amount of data that usually are not available in ungauged catchments sun et al 2015 developed the modified swat landscape unit swat lu model to account for horizontal hydraulic interactions between channel streams and floodplain aquifers this model does not however include effects of riparian wetlands on catchment hydrology rahman et al 2016 developed an enhanced swat wetland module to quantify hydraulic connectivity between riparian depressional wetlands rivers and aquifers the model is applicable to off channel wetlands and not water bodies that are potentially perennially hydraulically connected to streams michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2013 modified a floodplain model after dincer et al 1987 to simulate the barotse floodplain in zambia the model only considered water transfers with the main reach and evapotranspiration a fairly attractive practice among swat users e g schoul et al 2008a schoul et al 2008b is to simulate natural water bodies on the main stream networks as a reservoir however schoul et al 2008a reported difficulties in simulating outflows from floodplains and lakes using the swat reservoir model in areas with extensive riparian water bodies in the upper volta east african lakes region and zambezi and orange basins model uncertainties were also reported to be larger in west african sub basins containing dams and wetlands schoul et al 2008b leitchi et al 2014 modified the swat reservoir by separating outflow from the reservoir simulating the floodplain into main channel flow and flow over the floodplain area based on principles of a weir its performance in simulating discharge downstream of large floodplains in the zambezi basin was found to be superior to the original swat reservoir annual average releases model this model is rather steeped in the tradition of hard control structures and does not explicitly emphasise the natural tendency of river floodplain systems from a hydrogeomorphic perspective some studies on wetland hydrology have also been done using different basin scale hydrological models for instance hughes et al 2013 modified the pitman wetland sub model by adding complexities to the channel wetland exchanges to account for hysteresis resulting from storage inflow outflow relationship test results indicated potential for reproducing dynamics of wetlands and natural lakes this sub model does not however consider sub surface drainage others studies include padmanabhan and bengtson 2001 vining 2002 and hattermann et al 2006 in this paper we present a novel conceptual floodplain model which places emphasis on linkages of river channel with multiple riparian geomorphic features e g floodplain wetlands lakes and other depressional features in typical tropical alluvial floodplain systems we integrate the development of this concept in the framework swat to mimick and model the influence of an alluvial floodplain on hydrological processes the resultant product is a model which can serve dual functions i examine effects of an alluvial floodplain on high and base flows and ii as a potential tool for assessing effects of anthropogenic activities on natural functioning of alluvial floodplains we demonstrate applicability of this new model and evaluate its performance compared to the original swat reservoir in the complex tropical river system of the luanginga sub basin western zambia the rest of this paper is organised as follows structure of swat and the novel reservoir model are described in section two 2 model application and set up and the study area are dealt with in section three 3 model sensitivity analyses performance evaluation and discussion of obtained results are presented in section four 4 and conclusions on performance and future improvements and other potential uses of the developed model are provided in the last section 2 methods 2 1 structure of swat 2012 model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physically based continuous time semi distributed river basin model arnold et al 1998 it was developed to simulate the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large river basins it integrates several components to model processes within a watershed which include weather hydrology erosion soil properties plant growth nutrients pesticide land management channel and reservoir routing a full description of swat model is found in nietsch et al 2005 2011 2 2 the swat reservoir module a reservoir in swat is conceived as an impoundment located on the main channel network of a watershed it receives water from all sub basins upstream of its location neitsch et al 2005 swat models other types of water bodies which are ponds wetlands and depressions or potholes these however are assumed to be located within the sub basin off the main stream channel they only receive flows that originate from the sub basin in which they are located the water balance of the swat reservoir model is governed by eq 1 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is volume of water in reservoir at the end of the day v s t o r e d is volume of water stored at the beginning of the day v f l o w i n is volume of water entering reservoir during the day v f l o w o u t is volume of water leaving the reservoir during the day v p c p is volume of precipitation falling on the water body during the day v e v a p is volume of water removed from the water body by evaporation during the day v s e e p is volume of water lost from the water body by seepage all terms here and in the rest of this paper are in cubic metres m3 unless otherwise stated the amount of precipitation falling on the reservoir and amount of water removed by evaporation and lost by seepage are calculated based on the surface area of the reservoir see appendix a the formulae for estimating vpcp vevap and vseep are given in appendix b outflow from the swat reservoir can be modeled using four options i measured daily outflow ii measured monthly outflow iii average annual release rate for uncontrolled reservoir and iv target release for controlled reservoirs there is no clear evidence about which of these options is best suited to simulate natural water bodies like floodplains for instance lietch et al 2014 suggest that the average annual release is the best candidate on the other hand our cursory research on swat users platform www swatusers com revealed that some modelers are of the view that on stream water bodies can best be simulated using target release option nevertheless we are not aware of any published studies that have fully explored this issue in this study however we adopted the target release method because it shares basic principles with our conceptualization of a floodplain reservoir consequently the new proposed model in this study is implemented via modification of the simulated targeted release approach in contrast to other reservoirs the targeted release is structured in such way that the principal spillway volume corresponds to maximum flood control reservation while the emergency spillway volume corresponds to no flood control reservation outflow can be estimated using two different ways i flood season and soil moisture and ii monthly target volume the former requires the modeler to specify beginning and ending of the flood season then outflow is calculated using simple decision rules a in the non flood season no flood reservation is required and target storage is set at emergency spillway volume b during the flood season flood control reservation is a function of soil water content this is set to maximum and 50 of maximum for wet and dry grounds respectively these decision criteria are represented as follows neitsch et al 2011 2 v t a r g v e m i f m o n f l d b e g m o n m o n f l d e n d v t a r g v p r 1 m i n s w f c 1 2 v e m v p r 3 i f m o n m o n f l c b e g o r i f m o n m o n f l d e n d where v t a r g is target reservoir volume for a given day s w is average water content in the sub basin f c is water content of the sub basin at field capacity m o n is month of the year m o n f l d b e g is the beginning month of the flood season m o n f l d e n d is ending month of the flood season on the other hand the target volume can be specified by the modeler on a monthly basis if this option is chosen then target volume is calculated as follows eq 4 4 v t a r g s t a r g where s t a r g is the target reservoir volume specified for a given month once the target volume has been determined using any of the two options in the target release approach outflow from the reservoir is computed as follows eq 5 5 v f l o w o u t v s v t a r g n d t a r g where v f l o w o u t is the volume of water flowing out of the water body during the day v s is volume of water stored in the reservoir v t a r g is target reservoir volume for a given day n d t a r g is the number of days required for the reservoir to reach target storage to simulate outflow from floodplains on the basis of eqs 2 and 3 is probably counter intuitive to real situations setting flood control reservation storage to maximum when soils are wet in the flood months would suggest that water levels in floodplains are low when the soil is wet on the other setting flood control reservation to emergency volume in non flood months implies that the floodplain either does not release any water at all or spills everything above this volume the same day it is fairly clear that this approach is suited for reservoirs that are managed for water supply its emphasis is on holding as much water as possible in the dry season and leaving just enough storage to mitigate against the possibility of disastrous floods in the wet season 2 3 the novel pseudo reservoir concept the foregoing review points to the need for reconceptualization of swat reservoir model in order to better simulate the behavior of undrained floodplain wetlands thus we propose to remodel the swat reservoir structure on the basis of a novel concept pseudo reservoir concept psrc in order to simulate floodplain outflows as a naturally occurring reservoir like phenomenon although the phrase swat reservoir is used to denote impoundments by location and not differentiate man made reservoir from naturally occurring water bodies we are of the view that this is subject to ambiguity it is apparent that swat reservoir is essentially modeled on the mechanics of a typical man made impoundment structure lietchi et al 2014 it is questionable if the assumptions of such a model can also be ascribed to floodplain wetlands flood attenuation occurs due to differences in flow velocities over the floodplain and main channel with a large roughness factor being responsible for low velocities over the floodplain harvey et al 2009 the resulting attenuation effect is generated by flow retention the assumption here is that the floodplain is not necessarily a retention basin but operates as an extension of a river channel which then facilitates for water to be released gradually to downstream areas the magnitude of flow retention is also influenced by other factors such as length of the section of the river floodplain and duration of the flood another process that may induce flood attenuation is when water from the channel inundates the floodplain and is stored in riverine wetlands hollows and depressions etc the stored water can separate from the main body of the flood to become dead storage flood attenuation in this case is produced by standing retention the size of the storage dominate attenuation rather than flood roughness acreman and holden 2013 the aforementioned mechanics of flood attenuation do not necessarily occur separately thus natural flood attenuation is considered as the overall effect of the floodplain to change the shape of the hydrograph i e decrease flood peak and increase flood duration during out of bank events due to a combination of storage and resistance to flow we conceptualize this scenario based on modification of the acreman and holden 2013 model as shown in fig 1 in the first scenario fig 1a floodplain roughness plays a significant role in determining flow retention as floodplain water flows parallel with the river whereas in the second scenario fig 1 b the size of the retention basin determines the effectiveness of peak flow attenuation acreman and holden 2013 in the third fig 1c we consider a situation where water flows in to and is stored in floodplain wetlands lakes depressions or other geomorphic features during out of bank events then part of the water flows back into the main channel via a complex of floodplain channels after the storage capacity of a retention feature is breached water can also return to the channel via sub surface drainage once the flood begins to recede the presence of vegetation and depositional features e g natural levees in the same scenario will also increase the storage time of water within the floodplain as these can delay flow of water back into the river channels williams et al 2012 all these features and processes described in relation to fig 1c are commonly association with alluvial floodplains which usually consist of a complex of paleo meanders oxbow lakes relict river pools and local sources of water which interact to control the flood dynamics lininger and latrubesse 2016 the floodplain of the luanginga sub basin western zambia is characterised by many of such geomorphic elements see appendix c a useful reservoir model should be able to account for the above described floodplain processes and simulate their cumulative effects on the overall catchment water balance thus all water bodies located within the floodplain in our proposed psrc model are considered as part of the main channel system i e hydraulically connected to the stream perennially and seasonally as a result the notion of natural outflow is predicated on floodplain storage dynamics in relation to river stage discharge at a gauging station along the main reach which is associated with the floodplain to achieve this the outflows from psrc are quantified based on a conceptual storage outflow stage sos relationship further to explicitly model these outflows on the natural reservoir like behaviour of the floodplain the sos relationship is initialised following a set of procedures which are based on some assumptions specifically it is assumed that 1 the floodplain reservoir fills up to the flood control reservation volume when stage at a reference downstream gauging station exceeds a critical bankful height 2 reservoir volume in the floodplain exceeding the defined flood control reservation threshold is subject to being released as overflow and 3 reservoir volume in the floodplain equal to or below the defined flood control reservation threshold is subject to being released as base flow a schematic representation of the water balance of psrc is shown in fig 2 this model simulates hydrological responses of a floodplain to direct precipitation and inflows during low flow and out of bank events other forms of inflows including overland and subsurface flows from upland slopes groundwater discharge from bed rock and seepage from channel through banks are not explicitly considered the fluxes simulated in psrc represent the following components i overland flow i e overflow from floodplain to the river channel ii subsurface flow i e baseflow from floodplain to the river channel iii evapotranspiration losses and iv seepage into the bed rock conceptually therefore outflows from psrc should not be confused with total discharge passing through a point at a downstream gauging station rather these are floodplain flux quantities that influence discharge at that point this is logical since it is expected that the flood attenuation properties e g floodplain area volume connectivity width etc will vary depending on hydrologic flow regime and the physical attributes of individual floodplains the water balance of psrc fig 2 is written as a piecewise function as follows eq 6 6 v p s r c d s d t v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v b a s e f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s

precipitation falling on psrc during the day v e v a p is volume of water lost from psrc during the day through volume evaporation v s e e p is water lost from psrc through seepage v b a s e f l o w o

stage at a reference gauging station reaches a critical bankful height the outflow from psrc are calculated as a sum of base flow and overflow as follows eq 7 7 v f l o w o u t v b a s e f l o w o u t v o v e r f l o w o u t where v f l o w o u t is volume of water released in a day v b a s e f l o w o u t is volume of water released as base flow in a day and v o v e r f l o w o u t is the volume of water released as overflow in a day a simple linear base flow recession formula was developed in this study to compute the base flow component as follows eq 8 8 v b a s e f l o w v s 1 δ s t d where v s is volume of water stored in psrc at the end of the day and we define the term δ s t d as a storage time delay factor for psrc days this was assumed to be a calibration parameter that ranges between zero 0 and one 1 thus the term 1 δ s t d translates to a fraction of volume that is released as base flow at any time it is also possible to conceive the δ s t d term in the framework of linearity of base flow singh and stall 1971 by assuming that it is time taken for discharge to reduce by one log cycle on semi hydrograph i e by a factor of 10 as follows eq 9 9 δ s t d 10 1 k where k is the base flow recession constant the overflow component was retrieved based on the principles of the swat s original simulated targeted release formula here however the terms were adapted to account for effect of flood attenuation by the floodplain at a downstream location as follows eq 10 10 v o v e r f l o w 0 i f v s v t a r g v s v t a r g n d t a r g i f v s v t a r g where v o v e r f l o w is volume of water flowing over psrc during the day v s is stored volume of water in psrc at the end of the day v t a r g is volume of water in psrc which corresponds to a critical bankful height at a reference gauging station n d t a r g is number of days required for volume of water in psrc to reach the v t a r g threshold value the v t a r g term can be estimated from the power relationship between volume in the floodplain reservoir and water depth at the outlet of the basin this relationship can be established using remote sensing and gis techniques since the interest is to determine the flood control reservation volume with respect to the critical bankful height v t a r g is estimated as follows eq 11 11 v t a r g h c δ 1 λ where h c is critical bankful height δ a n d λ are coefficients linking volume in the floodplain reservoir and water depth at the outlet of the basin by a power law critical bankful height can be determined based on river width decharme et al 2011 as follows eq 12 12 h c w 1 3 where w is river width in metres alternatively v t a r g can be estimated from literature based values this was the option used in this study in this case v t a r g was set to be the equivalent of monthly target volume starg this parameter was calibrated in a local parameterisation scheme in which only the number of months constituting the rainy season were selected 3 application 3 1 study site this study was conducted in the luanginga sub basin western zambia geographically it lies between longitudes 19 6 e and 23 0 e and between latitudes 13 0 s and 15 5 s fig 3 the sub basin covers an area of approximately 33 000 km2 which ranges from eastern angolan highlands 1490 m a s l to the relatively flat 1000 m a s l terrains in the western parts of zambia a significant part of the sub basin is frequently inundated during the flood season which usually peaks between march and april the study area experiences a tropical savanna climate with three distinct seasons warm wet cool dry and dry hot seasons the warm wet period which starts in november until april is characterised by higher rainfall particularly in the northern western parts 1100 mm yr 1 the mean annual rainfall for the entire catchment is about 958 mm yr 1 the world bank 2010 the rainy season is largely controlled by the latitudinal movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures during this season range between 14 19 c and 25 30 c respectively the cool dry season occurs between may and august while the dry hot season is in phase in september and october the former is marked by lower temperatures mean daily minimum 6 12 c mean daily maximum 21 26 c whereas the former is a period of very high temperatures mean daily maximum 17 22 c mean daily maximum 28 35 c yec yachiyo engineering company 1995 the drainage system of luanginga is part of the six vital water tower tributaries of the upper zambezi river beilfuss 2012 the luanginga river is characterised by an annual flow regime and extensive wetlands upstream of the outlet at kalabo meinhardt et al 2018 the maximum monthly runoff is extremely variable from year to year the mean annual runoff is about 2190 mm3 69 4 m3 s 1 the world bank 2010 runoff in the luanginga sub basin follows rapidly from rainfall but is attenuated by swamps and floodplain wetlands moore et al 2007 beilfuss 2012 turpie et al 1999 estimate the floodplain wetland arm associated with the luanginga river to cover at least 1000 km2 there are also large flooded zones called the nyengo swamps on and between the south bank tributaries of the luanginga river the maximum area flooded by these swamps during the rainy season can reach 700 km2 hughes and hughes 1992 mccartney et al 2013 several other swamps pans and lakes are dotted around the plain to the south and north of northern lueti near the angolan zambian borders another effect of the floodplains in the zambezi basin is increased loss of water via evaporation meier et al 2011 water loss due to evapotranspiration may exceed 1660 mm yr 1 in the luanginga sub basin beilfuss 2012 there are no dams for hydropower generation and water consumption for irrigation and other demands is insignificant in the sub basin beilfuss 2012 3 2 input data swat requires several datasets regarding land use soils topographic and climatic characteristics in addition stream discharge data is required for calibration and validation these data were either available with a low quality poor temporal and spatial resolution or completely missing consequently freely available global datasets were used table 1 there is a good coverage of discharge data between 2006 and 2017 for kalabo gauging station in addition we conducted random discharge measurements at this station between 2013 and 2017 using teledyne s river ray acoustic doppler profiler adcp and a rugged field computer these measurements were used to directly validate simulated outputs technical details of this adcp regarding water velocity profiling bottom tracking and depth of measurement is available at http www rdinstruments com the original soil database in swat 2012 does not capture soil types that are in the luanginga sub basin therefore we created a user defined soil database based on soil global datasets textural and organic matter from these sources were used to quantify available water content sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and bulk density sol bd this was achieved by using the soil plant air water spaw model saxton and willey 2009 3 3 model set up and evaluation three model configurations were parameterized in this study i swat model without a floodplain reservoir swatnres ii swat model with original simulated targeted release reservoir swatsres and iii swat model with psrc swatpsrc the models were run at a daily time step for a period of thirteen years 2003 2015 the first three years 2003 2005 however were excluded from analysis as the data over this period were used to warm up the model to eliminate the effect of initial conditions the models were calibrated with 2006 2011 discharge data validation was performed using the rest of the data 2012 2015 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 was used to perform a combined uncertainty analysis and calibration this algorithm quantifies uncertainty using the p factor and r factor the p factor measures ability of model to bracket measured data with the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu its value ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect model the r factor is the ratio between average thicknesses of 95ppu band and standard deviation of measured data it represents width of uncertainty interval which ideally should be zero the two statistics were used to assess quality of model performance the nash sutcliffe ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the primary objective function furthermore as it is recommended to use multiple performance indicators moriasi et al 2007 six ancillary objective functions were also included in the evaluation criteria these were modified nash sutcliffe mns krause et al 2005 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient of determination r2 and weighted coefficient of determination br2 krause et al 2005 prior to model calibration a list of candidate sensitive parameters was generated based on a hydrological knowledge of the study area b reveal of parameters used in previous studies schoul et al 2008a schoul et al 2008b michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2013 lietchi et al 2014 and c sensitivity indices of global sensitivity analyses generated with sufi 2 several calibration tests were conducted using candidate parameters model performance was carefully revealed for each test run the final selected list of parameters used for calibrating swatnres swatsres and swatpsrc models is shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis in discussing parameter sensitivity results we are cognizant of the equifinality concept beven and freer 2001 that different combinations of values of the same parameters may produce an identical output signal nevertheless in this study we evaluate the significance of swatpsrc parameter sensitivities relative to their being physically plausible and consistent with the hydrogeological and climatic characteristics of the study area the aim was to assess how these influenced two hydrological components i stream flow and ii water balance of the novel psrc model simulating an alluvial floodplain global sensitivity analysis results which demonstrate sensitivity of a variable to changes in a parameter while other parameters are also changing abbaspour 2015 are shown in table 3 the most sensitive parameters p value 0 05 were related to channel alpha bnk and ch k2 groundwater gw delay and psrc ndtargr water balance components temporal bank storage alpha bnk was expected to be a dominant process in the study area due to recurrent flooding of the large alluvial floodplain fig 1 this process usually supplies water to alluvial aquifers during high flow periods whiting and pomeranets 1997 winter et al 1998 it can also attenuate flood waves decrease peak discharge and extend hydrograph base time chen and chen 2003 the effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 is one of parameters which control channel transmission losses in swat these losses are partitioned into bank and deep aquifer storages the former can return to river channels whereas the latter is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 sensitivities of groundwater parameters appeared consistent with hydrogeological settings of the study area for instance we noted that sensitivity of gw delay and alpha bf tended to be higher than rchrg dp this suggested that aquifer transmitting properties exerted a greater influence on baseflow compared to storativity properties this is a more likely scenario for the study area geologically luanginga sub basin is predominantly composed of loosely consolidated sediments of the kalahari group money 1972 the main aquifer unit is typically sand gravel and sandstone where inter granular groundwater flow is dominant yec yachiyo engineering company 1995 higher sensitivities of gw revap and revapmin compared to epco suggested that the shallow aquifer also actively influenced supply of plant water requirements the sensitivities of psrc parameters clearly highlighted the dominance of the alluvial floodplain in controlling discharge in the study area it was noted that all of them except for res k were more sensitive than surface run off parameters i e surlag cn2 sol k and sol awc and some groundwater processes run off generation in a semi arid sub basin like the luanginga is expected to be horton type see hughes 1995 smith and goodrich 2005 due to occurrence of high intensities of convective rainfall which exceeds soil infiltration capacity however this is attenuated by swamps and floodplains beilfuss 2012 hence the lower sensitivities of surface run off parameters we also noted that the number of days required for psrc to reach target volume i e ndtargr was more strongly sensitive p value 0 05 to discharge than the target volume starg itself this showed that downstream discharge was highly affected by the seasonal and variable character of flooding in the luanginga sub basin the ndtargr calibrated value of 85 335 days table 3 meant that psrc did not release overflows from january until late march this is largely reflective of the annual flooding cycle of the study area in the context of rainfall variability due to anthropogenically driven land use and climate changes however discharge is also expected to vary significantly in this case the sensitivity of ndtargr can be used to understand the effects of such changes we found the higher sensitivity of res psa and the new parameter psrc std relative to the channel roughness i e ch n2 in tandem with the basis of our conceptual model fig 1c in this case these sensitivities meant that flood attenuation in luanginga sub basin is more controlled by standing retention than flow retention this also implied that return of flood storage to channels via sub surface is a prevalent hydrologic process in the study area hydraulic conductivity at the reservoir bottom res k was the least sensitive it was also dominated by high evaporative water demand this is reflected in higher sensitivities of esco and epco parameters we also found that evaporation over the psrc reservoir ranged between 400 000 to 730 000 m3 per day nevertheless it was expected that parameter sensitivities would vary according to adopted objective function and flow regime 4 2 sensitivity to objective functions as single objective functions are susceptible to influences of specific flow modes price et al 2012 we conducted sensitivity analyses of swatpsrc parameters to different objective functions the aim was to determine the significance of changes in predicted swatpsrc hydrological processes as a result of change in adopted objective function to achieve this a matrix table of sensitivities was created table 4 for easy of detection of interrelationships the following were done i parameter sensitivities to ns which was the primary objective function were treated as reference ii ranking orders similar to the reference were shaded light grey iii ranking orders similar only among ancillary objective functions were shaded dark grey and iv unique ranking orders were left unshaded in addition the sensitivities were ranked according to hydrological water balance components this produced an interesting matrix of sensitivities table 4 the significance of parameter sensitivities to four objective functions i e ns rsr mns and kge were the same considering ranking by hydrological water balance components table 4 these reflected that processes influencing discharge were in decreasing order channel groundwater psrc evaporative water demand surface run off water balance components this order was slightly different for sensitivities to r2 i e channel psrc groundwater evaporative water demand surface run off the ranking order resulting from sensitivities to pbias was quiet unique i e groundwater channel psrc surface run off evaporative water demand to understand the general parameter set favoured by each objective function we based our analysis on the knowledge that all objective functions used in this study are mathematically related e g see murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 gupta et al 2009 for instance gupta et al 2009 show that ns can be decomposed into correlation variability and bias components and that i in order to maximise ns the variability component has to be underestimated and ii in watersheds with runoff variability bias component will tend to have a smaller impact in optimisation of ns considering results in table 4 in this light it was noted that the ns rank order did not score a single match with pbias this indicated that ns results did not favour parameter sets that put a high weight on bias and variability components e g awc cn2 and surlag parameters in contrast pbias was highly sensitive to these surface run off parameters fig 4 4 3 sensitivity of psrc to flow regime to investigate sensitivity of psrc parameters to magnitude of discharge analysis was performed by considering observed relatively high 200 m3 s 1 and low 72 m3 s 1 annual flows in 2008 and 2015 respectively in general results indicated that res psa and psrc std were most sensitive in 2008 fig 7 a b d and e the res k was notably sensitive to pbias fig 5 c and r2 fig 5 f this can be attributed to possible high alluvial deposition in 2008 the res k tends to be high on alluvial floodplains sun et al 2015 it may also suggest rapid lateral spread of over bank flow to drier locations within the floodplain where water is lost via infiltration the high sensitivity of discharge to res psa during high flows is supported by studies conducted in the study area for instance zimba et al 2018 demonstrated the significance of floodplains in the upper zambezi basin in controlling flows via correlation analysis of floodplain inundated area with upstream and downstream stage mccartney et al 2013 found that floodplains in the zambezi basin significantly reduce flood flows in the order of 10 60 percent beilfuss 2012 indicated that floodplain wetlands in the luanginga su basin behave like a reservoir by absorbing water from upstream and local rainfall and then releasing it gradually to downstream areas the res k and psrc std sensitivities were mostly significant in 2015 fig 6 a d e and f the ndtargr also showed increased sensitivity fig 6 c on the other hand the res psa was less sensitive these results suggested that discharge is highly sensitive to losses via hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of psrc and baseflow gains from psrc during low flow regimes the increase of losses via res k can be attributed to pre existing moisture conditions within the floodplain during low flows overbank flow that enters a dry floodplain are more likely to quickly infiltrate the soil naiman et al 2005 4 4 implications of model parameter sensitivities qualitatively we deemed global sensitivities based on the primary ns objective function as largely physically plausible and consistent with hydrogeological and climatic characteristics of the study area we also found less discrepancies when parameter sensitivities were ranked according to hydrological water balance components however we observed that individual hydrological processes were weighted significantly different depending on adopted objective function therefore it may be misleading to emphasise predicating assessment of the skill of models in this study on the so called best simulation i e best parameter set rather we believe that the robustness of models will be strongly reflected in the ability to account for most of uncertainties in the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty band 95ppu this is in fact recommended by many researchers e g schuol et al 2008b gupta et al 2009 abbaspour 2015 as the proper method of evaluating model performance 4 5 performance evaluation of the models the model configured with a pseudo reservoir concept swatpsrc and the original targeted release reservoir swatsres were evaluated in terms of their skill to improve simulation of daily discharge downstream of a seasonally inundated floodplain in addition a third configuration without a reservoir swatnres was run to serve as control for the study setup the ns efficiencies indicated that swatpsrc outperformed swatsres table 5 swatpsrc improved ns results by over 100 and 75 compared to swatsres during calibration i e ns 0 04 to ns 0 78 and validation i e ns 0 20 to ns 0 80 respectively its performance was also clearly better than swatsres for the other objective functions table 5 since only the floodplain was modeled differently between the two models these results meant that psrc was superior to the original reservoir model for simulating the floodplain improved performance by swatpsrc for mns and kge objective functions implied that psrc simulated the effect of the floodplain on both low and high flows very well compared to the original reservoir this is because mns krause et al 2005 and kge gupta et al 2009 are more sensitive to significant over or under prediction of flows than ns the performance of swatpsrc in simulating average magnitudes pbias for validation period was acceptable following the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 this criteria was satisfied since swatpsrc also simulated the trends ns and the indicator of stream flow residual variation rsr very good during validation and calibration on the other hand swatsres pbias results were obviously unacceptable as the model failed to produce satisfactory results for ns and rsr objective functions the r2 and its derivative br2 appeared to be satisfactory for swatsres these were however not supported by other indicators besides it is known that a model which systematically over or under predicts all the time will score high r2 values close to unity in spite of all the predictions being wrong krause et al 2005 the swatpsrc model was also superior to swatnres it improved ns by 19 2 i e ns 0 63 to ns 0 78 during calibration and 8 8 i e ns 0 73 to ns 0 80 during validation compared to swatnres results also showed that swatpsrc consistently outperformed swatnres for all objective functions except for r2 table 5 all these statistical performance indicators attest to the skill of psrc to simulate the floodplain interestingly the results which provided further proof that psrc enhanced simulation of the floodplain was the finding that swatsres performed worse than swatnres table 5 indeed the obtained results suggested that the original reservoir does not have the skill to simulate the behaviour of an extensive floodplain the comparison between observed and simulated daily discharge for all the three models is shown in fig 7 swatpsrc reproduced the hydrograph of the luanginga sub basin better than swatsres and swatnres it was the only model that was able to simulate base flows which were prolongated and better matched with the observed especially during the validation period the swatpsrc model also replicated the rising and falling limbs quiet well compared to the other two on the other hand swatsres severely overestimated both flood peaks and base flows over estimation of base flow by swatnres was also pronounced throughout study period the swatnres peak discharges were somewhat similar to the ones predicted by swatpsrc fig 7 swatsres appeared to reproduce the rising limb this was likely due to the mechanics of the reservoir the targeted release reservoir maintains a steady outflow when volume of water is between target volume and principle spillway volume pvol it appears that this occurred between mid and peak flows nevertheless it failed to simulate flood attenuation as the wet season progressed since it damps the whole volume of water above pvol on the same day neitsch et al 2011 it could not equally simulate the effect of the floodplain on base flow since groundwater in this model is treated simply as seepage that is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 it was expected that swatnres would over estimate peak flows surprisingly it was baseflow that was consistently overestimated instead this seem to contradict the global perception e g lietchi et al 2014 it is anticipated that different results may be obtained depending on one or a combination of the following factors i model parameters considered ii size and configuration of the floodplain iii quality of input data e g rainfall and observation data used for calibration and iv model used to simulate the floodplain in this study we suspect channel parameters over compensated for processes that would otherwise be better simulated with psrc this resulted in dampening of flood peaks in the swatnres model temporal bank storage is however a transient process it is released as soon as hydraulic head change towards channels following storm events chen and chen 2003 in psrc flood water stored in geomorphic compartments within the floodplain is also considered fig 1 this also influences base flow during low flows lininger and latrubesse 2016 4 6 prediction uncertainty bands to quantify the fit between observation and simulated results using only the statistical performance indicators in table 5 is not sufficient since in a stochastic calibration there is no single set of parameters that can claim to produce the best model simulation abbaspour 2015 thus the ns objective function was optimised whilst also considering the good calibration solutions on the basis of the uncertainty bands generated by parameter ranges this was expressed as the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu using the sufi 2 algorithm the 95ppus for the three models are shown in fig 8 and are quantified by the p factor and r factor although no recommended hard values for these indices exist for model performance evaluation p factor 0 70 abbaspour et al 2007 and r factor of close to or less than one schuol et al 2008a are suggested for discharge the swatpsrc met this criteria during validation as the p factor and r factor were 0 73 and 076 respectively fig 5 a the width of uncertainty i e r factor of swatpsrc was also good during calibration however its p factor though still considered satisfactory see schuol et al 2008a was somewhat lower therefore we directly used discharge measured using the adcp to further ascertain the robustness of the models in simulating hydrological processes the use of these measurements proved that the skill of swatpsrc to account for uncertainties in the 95ppu is in fact better see section 4 7 the r factor and p factor statistics for swatsres and swatnres models in fig 8 were however not satisfactory during calibration and validation periods these models exhibited high prediction uncertainties during low flows prediction uncertainties were worst for swatsres model as the peak flows and falling limb were not also covered by the 95ppu 4 7 uncertainty bands as model solution the average model simulations will converge towards true measurements if the r factor is narrow enough and the p factor brackets most of the observed data based on this interpretation of the sufi 2 concept abbaspour 2015 and in order to further ascertain the ability of the models to account for uncertainties we wanted to know if in fact the average results i e 95ppus of the models can be used as model solutions thus we attempted to validate these simulated values with discharge data measured using the adcp the results revealed very interesting details fig 9 it was found that only swatpsrc replicated adcp measurements very well ns 0 86 r2 0 96 pbias 10 7 the other models performed below satisfaction the swatnres produced a hydrograph with an early peak flow i e no flood attenuation similarly the average tendency of swatsres produced early peak flow but this was greatly flattened even so both of these models showed unpredictable behaviour in 2015 which experienced below normal rainfall i e hydrological drought these results proved that swatpsrc is a robust model 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to properly simulate the behaviour of an alluvial floodplain through remodeling swat reservoir on a novel construct the pseudo reservoir concept psrc using this concept a historical ambiguity between a man made and natural reservoir in swat was rectified which allowed for simulation of the latter from a hydrogeomorphic perspective the model was applied in a complex tropical river system of luanginga western zambia the results were compared to the original swat targeted releases and the set up without a reservoir we demonstrated that psrc via its parameters was dynamically and significantly p value 0 05 sensitive to discharge it was superior to original targeted releases reservoir in simulating daily discharge downstream of a seasonally inundated floodplain in the luanginga sub basin the psrc model improved swat performance by four to over 100 percent depending on adopted objective functions it also outperformed the swat set up without a reservoir furthermore use of discharge data measured using adcp proved that the skill of swatpsrc to account for uncertainties in the 95ppu was very good the finding that the model set up without a reservoir performed better than one with targeted releases reservoir suggested that the latter lacks the skill to simulate an extensive alluvial floodplain it also provided proof of the psrc improved skill to simulate the floodplain compared to the original targeted releases reservoir accordingly we advise that the latter model should be avoided when simulating extensive natural reservoirs such as floodplains the widely known global phenomenon is that models without a floodplain overestimate peak flows thus the finding in this study that the model without the reservoir overestimated baseflow rather than peaks flows more likely demonstrated the case of unique character of the luanginga sub basin satellite imagery see appendix a shows that the luanginga river passes through a long and wide stretch of a seasonally inundated floodplain this area provide a large storage space for flood waters and act like a reservoir it also sequestrate large volume of water via bank storage hence high sensitivities of alpha bnk and ch k2 the swat model without a reservoir was able to partially simulate the behaviour of floodplain during high flows with these parameters nevertheless this model failed to simulate the low flows the psrc model was able to account for effect of floodplain on both high and low flows as the psrc parameter sensitivities were not only influenced by adopted objective function but also magnitude of annual flows we recommend that the psrc dimensions i e area and volume should be determined accurately to reduce uncertainties future research should include use of high resolution remote sensing to determine variations of flood inundated extent and volume analysis of this information alongside discharge data at the outlet of the basin can also form the basis of evaluating psrc this will increase confidence in the model simulations in general results indicated that psrc is a potentially robust model that is capable of modeling the behavior of undrained alluvial floodplains and their impact on downstream discharge it can therefore find further application into such undertakings as restoration designs and impact assessment of modified floodplains lastly we point out that psrc simplifies complex river alluvial floodplain hydrological processes and interactions to simulate the aggregate effect of multiple riparian geomorphic features on flows this is necessary to reduce computational demands in alluvial floodplain systems consisting of numerous water bodies which are intricately connected e g see wang et al 2008 however this approach implies that spatially variable wetland interaction with local areas including groundwater systems and hydrological exchange with streams may be disregarded thus for future research psrc could be improved further by disaggregating these hydrogeomorphic processes and explicitly considering detailed bidirectional flow exchange between riparian water bodies and associated streams and aquifers additionally it could include sub routines for routing sediments and water quality to gain an overall understanding of alluvial floodplain processes and functions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this research was

8281,study region the new formulation was applied in a complex tropical river system of luanginga sub basin western zambia study focus we propose a novel pseudo reservoir concept hereinafter psrc in the framework of the soil and water assessment tool swat to mimick and model the behavior of an alluvial floodplain outflows from psrc are predicated on a conceptual storage outflow stage relationship and decomposed into overflow and baseflow by considering floodplain hydrogeomorphic attributes and their dynamics in relation to critical bankful height the model was tested for its skill to improve simulation of discharge it s performance was evaluated against swat targeted release reservoir and a configuration without a reservoir new hydrological insights we demonstrated that psrc via its parameters was dynamically and significantly p value 0 05 sensitive to discharge it improved swat discharge predictions by four to over 100 percent compared to two model control set ups results were influenced by sensitivities of parameters to flow regime and objective functions the swat configured with psrc swatpsrc was the only model which accounted for uncertainties in the ninety five percent

assessment of modified floodplains keywords soil and water assessment tool reservoir outflows targeted release reservoir alluvial floodplain pseudo reservoir concept critical bankful height 1 introduction floodplains are relatively low lying areas surrounding active river channels that periodically flood during high flow events syvitski et al 2012 burt et al 2002 define alluvial floodplains as fringing wetlands that receive water from river rainwater groundwater and hillslope for this reason alluvial floodplains are regarded as part of an integrated system of the watershed with a perennial or seasonal connection with the parent water body such as a river or lake cole et al 2003 maintaining natural river floodplain connectivity is critical for sustainable supply of numerous ecosystem services that have significant socio economic and environmental benefits emerton and bos 2004 these include mitigating flood damage by sequestrating excess runoff bullock and acreman 2003 controlling erosion by slowing the rate of overland flow acreman and holden 2013 improving water quality through absorption recycling and filtering of pollutant load brookes and shields 1996 recharging aquifers and sustaining base flow in a river kondolf et al 1987 and providing habitats for a myriad of aquatic species nygaard and ejrneas 2009 modeling natural functions of floodplain wetlands is a topical issue in environmental studies e g junk et al 1989 reckendorfer et al 2006 cabezas et al 2009 wang et al 2010 this interest has arguably grown largely due to the need to protect such functions from adverse effects of land use and climate changes which are linked to environmentally degenerative anthropogenic activities for instance it is held that a shift from hard control to use of hydrogeomorphic principles in the management of floodplains is critical for ensuring sustainability of many of the natural functions acreman et al 2003 the traditional goal of the former has been to control floods or store large volumes of water often without serious consideration for sediment transport in maintaining channel stability and to the detriment of maintenance of river bio diversity steiger et al 2005 flooding is also often studied from an ecological or hydrological perspective without due attention to understanding how hydrogeomorphic attributes of floodplains affect the mechanics of flood transmission lininger and latrubesse 2016 floodplain wetlands can be studied in details at site scale using computational models e g restrepo et al 1998 lee et al 2002 kazezyilmaj alhan et al 2007 this is however not sufficient as obtained results at one site cannot easily be interpreted from an integrated water resources management perspective lee et al 2017 on the other hand it is feasible to use global rainfall runoff models to study cumulative effects of several floodplain wetlands on hydrological processes however most basin scale hydrological models do not represent floodplain river interactions and wetlands and their functions adequately liu et al 2008 sun et al 2015 evenson et al 2018 integration of floodplain wetland dynamics into most of such models has also been largely neglected hughes et al 2013 riparian water bodies in swat have been studied using i wetland modules which consider detailed physical processes of interest ii the swat reservoir module development of the former has been largely motivated by the desire to simulate dynamic flow exchange between riparian water bodies and their associated streams and aquifers for instance liu et al 2008 replaced the routing algorithm in swat s wetland module with more robust hydraulic routing as well as incorporating lateral subsurface wetland river interactions however this solution still has several shortcomings rahman et al 2016 it also requires considerable amount of data that usually are not available in ungauged catchments sun et al 2015 developed the modified swat landscape unit swat lu model to account for horizontal hydraulic interactions between channel streams and floodplain aquifers this model does not however include effects of riparian wetlands on catchment hydrology rahman et al 2016 developed an enhanced swat wetland module to quantify hydraulic connectivity between riparian depressional wetlands rivers and aquifers the model is applicable to off channel wetlands and not water bodies that are potentially perennially hydraulically connected to streams michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2013 modified a floodplain model after dincer et al 1987 to simulate the barotse floodplain in zambia the model only considered water transfers with the main reach and evapotranspiration a fairly attractive practice among swat users e g schoul et al 2008a schoul et al 2008b is to simulate natural water bodies on the main stream networks as a reservoir however schoul et al 2008a reported difficulties in simulating outflows from floodplains and lakes using the swat reservoir model in areas with extensive riparian water bodies in the upper volta east african lakes region and zambezi and orange basins model uncertainties were also reported to be larger in west african sub basins containing dams and wetlands schoul et al 2008b leitchi et al 2014 modified the swat reservoir by separating outflow from the reservoir simulating the floodplain into main channel flow and flow over the floodplain area based on principles of a weir its performance in simulating discharge downstream of large floodplains in the zambezi basin was found to be superior to the original swat reservoir annual average releases model this model is rather steeped in the tradition of hard control structures and does not explicitly emphasise the natural tendency of river floodplain systems from a hydrogeomorphic perspective some studies on wetland hydrology have also been done using different basin scale hydrological models for instance hughes et al 2013 modified the pitman wetland sub model by adding complexities to the channel wetland exchanges to account for hysteresis resulting from storage inflow outflow relationship test results indicated potential for reproducing dynamics of wetlands and natural lakes this sub model does not however consider sub surface drainage others studies include padmanabhan and bengtson 2001 vining 2002 and hattermann et al 2006 in this paper we present a novel conceptual floodplain model which places emphasis on linkages of river channel with multiple riparian geomorphic features e g floodplain wetlands lakes and other depressional features in typical tropical alluvial floodplain systems we integrate the development of this concept in the framework swat to mimick and model the influence of an alluvial floodplain on hydrological processes the resultant product is a model which can serve dual functions i examine effects of an alluvial floodplain on high and base flows and ii as a potential tool for assessing effects of anthropogenic activities on natural functioning of alluvial floodplains we demonstrate applicability of this new model and evaluate its performance compared to the original swat reservoir in the complex tropical river system of the luanginga sub basin western zambia the rest of this paper is organised as follows structure of swat and the novel reservoir model are described in section two 2 model application and set up and the study area are dealt with in section three 3 model sensitivity analyses performance evaluation and discussion of obtained results are presented in section four 4 and conclusions on performance and future improvements and other potential uses of the developed model are provided in the last section 2 methods 2 1 structure of swat 2012 model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physically based continuous time semi distributed river basin model arnold et al 1998 it was developed to simulate the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large river basins it integrates several components to model processes within a watershed which include weather hydrology erosion soil properties plant growth nutrients pesticide land management channel and reservoir routing a full description of swat model is found in nietsch et al 2005 2011 2 2 the swat reservoir module a reservoir in swat is conceived as an impoundment located on the main channel network of a watershed it receives water from all sub basins upstream of its location neitsch et al 2005 swat models other types of water bodies which are ponds wetlands and depressions or potholes these however are assumed to be located within the sub basin off the main stream channel they only receive flows that originate from the sub basin in which they are located the water balance of the swat reservoir model is governed by eq 1 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is volume of water in reservoir at the end of the day v s t o r e d is volume of water stored at the beginning of the day v f l o w i n is volume of water entering reservoir during the day v f l o w o u t is volume of water leaving the reservoir during the day v p c p is volume of precipitation falling on the water body during the day v e v a p is volume of water removed from the water body by evaporation during the day v s e e p is volume of water lost from the water body by seepage all terms here and in the rest of this paper are in cubic metres m3 unless otherwise stated the amount of precipitation falling on the reservoir and amount of water removed by evaporation and lost by seepage are calculated based on the surface area of the reservoir see appendix a the formulae for estimating vpcp vevap and vseep are given in appendix b outflow from the swat reservoir can be modeled using four options i measured daily outflow ii measured monthly outflow iii average annual release rate for uncontrolled reservoir and iv target release for controlled reservoirs there is no clear evidence about which of these options is best suited to simulate natural water bodies like floodplains for instance lietch et al 2014 suggest that the average annual release is the best candidate on the other hand our cursory research on swat users platform www swatusers com revealed that some modelers are of the view that on stream water bodies can best be simulated using target release option nevertheless we are not aware of any published studies that have fully explored this issue in this study however we adopted the target release method because it shares basic principles with our conceptualization of a floodplain reservoir consequently the new proposed model in this study is implemented via modification of the simulated targeted release approach in contrast to other reservoirs the targeted release is structured in such way that the principal spillway volume corresponds to maximum flood control reservation while the emergency spillway volume corresponds to no flood control reservation outflow can be estimated using two different ways i flood season and soil moisture and ii monthly target volume the former requires the modeler to specify beginning and ending of the flood season then outflow is calculated using simple decision rules a in the non flood season no flood reservation is required and target storage is set at emergency spillway volume b during the flood season flood control reservation is a function of soil water content this is set to maximum and 50 of maximum for wet and dry grounds respectively these decision criteria are represented as follows neitsch et al 2011 2 v t a r g v e m i f m o n f l d b e g m o n m o n f l d e n d v t a r g v p r 1 m i n s w f c 1 2 v e m v p r 3 i f m o n m o n f l c b e g o r i f m o n m o n f l d e n d where v t a r g is target reservoir volume for a given day s w is average water content in the sub basin f c is water content of the sub basin at field capacity m o n is month of the year m o n f l d b e g is the beginning month of the flood season m o n f l d e n d is ending month of the flood season on the other hand the target volume can be specified by the modeler on a monthly basis if this option is chosen then target volume is calculated as follows eq 4 4 v t a r g s t a r g where s t a r g is the target reservoir volume specified for a given month once the target volume has been determined using any of the two options in the target release approach outflow from the reservoir is computed as follows eq 5 5 v f l o w o u t v s v t a r g n d t a r g where v f l o w o u t is the volume of water flowing out of the water body during the day v s is volume of water stored in the reservoir v t a r g is target reservoir volume for a given day n d t a r g is the number of days required for the reservoir to reach target storage to simulate outflow from floodplains on the basis of eqs 2 and 3 is probably counter intuitive to real situations setting flood control reservation storage to maximum when soils are wet in the flood months would suggest that water levels in floodplains are low when the soil is wet on the other setting flood control reservation to emergency volume in non flood months implies that the floodplain either does not release any water at all or spills everything above this volume the same day it is fairly clear that this approach is suited for reservoirs that are managed for water supply its emphasis is on holding as much water as possible in the dry season and leaving just enough storage to mitigate against the possibility of disastrous floods in the wet season 2 3 the novel pseudo reservoir concept the foregoing review points to the need for reconceptualization of swat reservoir model in order to better simulate the behavior of undrained floodplain wetlands thus we propose to remodel the swat reservoir structure on the basis of a novel concept pseudo reservoir concept psrc in order to simulate floodplain outflows as a naturally occurring reservoir like phenomenon although the phrase swat reservoir is used to denote impoundments by location and not differentiate man made reservoir from naturally occurring water bodies we are of the view that this is subject to ambiguity it is apparent that swat reservoir is essentially modeled on the mechanics of a typical man made impoundment structure lietchi et al 2014 it is questionable if the assumptions of such a model can also be ascribed to floodplain wetlands flood attenuation occurs due to differences in flow velocities over the floodplain and main channel with a large roughness factor being responsible for low velocities over the floodplain harvey et al 2009 the resulting attenuation effect is generated by flow retention the assumption here is that the floodplain is not necessarily a retention basin but operates as an extension of a river channel which then facilitates for water to be released gradually to downstream areas the magnitude of flow retention is also influenced by other factors such as length of the section of the river floodplain and duration of the flood another process that may induce flood attenuation is when water from the channel inundates the floodplain and is stored in riverine wetlands hollows and depressions etc the stored water can separate from the main body of the flood to become dead storage flood attenuation in this case is produced by standing retention the size of the storage dominate attenuation rather than flood roughness acreman and holden 2013 the aforementioned mechanics of flood attenuation do not necessarily occur separately thus natural flood attenuation is considered as the overall effect of the floodplain to change the shape of the hydrograph i e decrease flood peak and increase flood duration during out of bank events due to a combination of storage and resistance to flow we conceptualize this scenario based on modification of the acreman and holden 2013 model as shown in fig 1 in the first scenario fig 1a floodplain roughness plays a significant role in determining flow retention as floodplain water flows parallel with the river whereas in the second scenario fig 1 b the size of the retention basin determines the effectiveness of peak flow attenuation acreman and holden 2013 in the third fig 1c we consider a situation where water flows in to and is stored in floodplain wetlands lakes depressions or other geomorphic features during out of bank events then part of the water flows back into the main channel via a complex of floodplain channels after the storage capacity of a retention feature is breached water can also return to the channel via sub surface drainage once the flood begins to recede the presence of vegetation and depositional features e g natural levees in the same scenario will also increase the storage time of water within the floodplain as these can delay flow of water back into the river channels williams et al 2012 all these features and processes described in relation to fig 1c are commonly association with alluvial floodplains which usually consist of a complex of paleo meanders oxbow lakes relict river pools and local sources of water which interact to control the flood dynamics lininger and latrubesse 2016 the floodplain of the luanginga sub basin western zambia is characterised by many of such geomorphic elements see appendix c a useful reservoir model should be able to account for the above described floodplain processes and simulate their cumulative effects on the overall catchment water balance thus all water bodies located within the floodplain in our proposed psrc model are considered as part of the main channel system i e hydraulically connected to the stream perennially and seasonally as a result the notion of natural outflow is predicated on floodplain storage dynamics in relation to river stage discharge at a gauging station along the main reach which is associated with the floodplain to achieve this the outflows from psrc are quantified based on a conceptual storage outflow stage sos relationship further to explicitly model these outflows on the natural reservoir like behaviour of the floodplain the sos relationship is initialised following a set of procedures which are based on some assumptions specifically it is assumed that 1 the floodplain reservoir fills up to the flood control reservation volume when stage at a reference downstream gauging station exceeds a critical bankful height 2 reservoir volume in the floodplain exceeding the defined flood control reservation threshold is subject to being released as overflow and 3 reservoir volume in the floodplain equal to or below the defined flood control reservation threshold is subject to being released as base flow a schematic representation of the water balance of psrc is shown in fig 2 this model simulates hydrological responses of a floodplain to direct precipitation and inflows during low flow and out of bank events other forms of inflows including overland and subsurface flows from upland slopes groundwater discharge from bed rock and seepage from channel through banks are not explicitly considered the fluxes simulated in psrc represent the following components i overland flow i e overflow from floodplain to the river channel ii subsurface flow i e baseflow from floodplain to the river channel iii evapotranspiration losses and iv seepage into the bed rock conceptually therefore outflows from psrc should not be confused with total discharge passing through a point at a downstream gauging station rather these are floodplain flux quantities that influence discharge at that point this is logical since it is expected that the flood attenuation properties e g floodplain area volume connectivity width etc will vary depending on hydrologic flow regime and the physical attributes of individual floodplains the water balance of psrc fig 2 is written as a piecewise function as follows eq 6 6 v p s r c d s d t v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v b a s e f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p i f v v t a r g v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v b a s e f l o w o u t v o v e r f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p i f v v t a r g where v p s r c is volume of water in the conceptual pseudo reservoir at the end of the day v s t o r e d is volume of water stored at the beginning of the day v f l o w i n is volume of water entering psrc during the day v p c p is volume of precipitation falling on psrc during the day v e v a p is volume of water lost from psrc during the day through volume evaporation v s e e p is water lost from psrc through seepage v b a s e f l o w o u t is volume of water leaving psrc during the day as base flow v o v e r f l o w o u t is volume of water leaving psrc during the day as over flow v t a r g is volume of water stored in psrc when stage at a reference gauging station reaches a critical bankful height the outflow from psrc are calculated as a sum of base flow and overflow as follows eq 7 7 v f l o w o u t v b a s e f l o w o u t v o v e r f l o w o u t where v f l o w o u t is volume of water released in a day v b a s e f l o w o u t is volume of water released as base flow in a day and v o v e r f l o w o u t is the volume of water released as overflow in a day a simple linear base flow recession formula was developed in this study to compute the base flow component as follows eq 8 8 v b a s e f l o w v s 1 δ s t d where v s is volume of water stored in psrc at the end of the day and we define the term δ s t d as a storage time delay factor for psrc days this was assumed to be a calibration parameter that ranges between zero 0 and one 1 thus the term 1 δ s t d translates to a fraction of volume that is released as base flow at any time it is also possible to conceive the δ s t d term in the framework of linearity of base flow singh and stall 1971 by assuming that it is time taken for discharge to reduce by one log cycle on semi hydrograph i e by a factor of 10 as follows eq 9 9 δ s t d 10 1 k where k is the base flow recession constant the overflow component was retrieved based on the principles of the swat s original simulated targeted release formula here however the terms were adapted to account for effect of flood attenuation by the floodplain at a downstream location as follows eq 10 10 v o v e r f l o w 0 i f v s v t a r g v s v t a r g n d t a r g i f v s v t a r g where v o v e r f l o w is volume of water flowing over psrc during the day v s is stored volume of water in psrc at the end of the day v t a r g is volume of water in psrc which corresponds to a critical bankful height at a reference gauging station n d t a r g is number of days required for volume of water in psrc to reach the v t a r g threshold value the v t a r g term can be estimated from the power relationship between volume in the floodplain reservoir and water depth at the outlet of the basin this relationship can be established using remote sensing and gis techniques since the interest is to determine the flood control reservation volume with respect to the critical bankful height v t a r g is estimated as follows eq 11 11 v t a r g h c δ 1 λ where h c is critical bankful height δ a n d λ are coefficients linking volume in the floodplain reservoir and water depth at the outlet of the basin by a power law critical bankful height can be determined based on river width decharme et al 2011 as follows eq 12 12 h c w 1 3 where w is river width in metres alternatively v t a r g can be estimated from literature based values this was the option used in this study in this case v t a r g was set to be the equivalent of monthly target volume starg this parameter was calibrated in a local parameterisation scheme in which only the number of months constituting the rainy season were selected 3 application 3 1 study site this study was conducted in the luanginga sub basin western zambia geographically it lies between longitudes 19 6 e and 23 0 e and between latitudes 13 0 s and 15 5 s fig 3 the sub basin covers an area of approximately 33 000 km2 which ranges from eastern angolan highlands 1490 m a s l to the relatively flat 1000 m a s l terrains in the western parts of zambia a significant part of the sub basin is frequently inundated during the flood season which usually peaks between march and april the study area experiences a tropical savanna climate with three distinct seasons warm wet cool dry and dry hot seasons the warm wet period which starts in november until april is characterised by higher rainfall particularly in the northern western parts 1100 mm yr 1 the mean annual rainfall for the entire catchment is about 958 mm yr 1 the world bank 2010 the rainy season is largely controlled by the latitudinal movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures during this season range between 14 19 c and 25 30 c respectively the cool dry season occurs between may and august while the dry hot season is in phase in september and october the former is marked by lower temperatures mean daily minimum 6 12 c mean daily maximum 21 26 c whereas the former is a period of very high temperatures mean daily maximum 17 22 c mean daily maximum 28 35 c yec yachiyo engineering company 1995 the drainage system of luanginga is part of the six vital water tower tributaries of the upper zambezi river beilfuss 2012 the luanginga river is characterised by an annual flow regime and extensive wetlands upstream of the outlet at kalabo meinhardt et al 2018 the maximum monthly runoff is extremely variable from year to year the mean annual runoff is about 2190 mm3 69 4 m3 s 1 the world bank 2010 runoff in the luanginga sub basin follows rapidly from rainfall but is attenuated by swamps and floodplain wetlands moore et al 2007 beilfuss 2012 turpie et al 1999 estimate the floodplain wetland arm associated with the luanginga river to cover at least 1000 km2 there are also large flooded zones called the nyengo swamps on and between the south bank tributaries of the luanginga river the maximum area flooded by these swamps during the rainy season can reach 700 km2 hughes and hughes 1992 mccartney et al 2013 several other swamps pans and lakes are dotted around the plain to the south and north of northern lueti near the angolan zambian borders another effect of the floodplains in the zambezi basin is increased loss of water via evaporation meier et al 2011 water loss due to evapotranspiration may exceed 1660 mm yr 1 in the luanginga sub basin beilfuss 2012 there are no dams for hydropower generation and water consumption for irrigation and other demands is insignificant in the sub basin beilfuss 2012 3 2 input data swat requires several datasets regarding land use soils topographic and climatic characteristics in addition stream discharge data is required for calibration and validation these data were either available with a low quality poor temporal and spatial resolution or completely missing consequently freely available global datasets were used table 1 there is a good coverage of discharge data between 2006 and 2017 for kalabo gauging station in addition we conducted random discharge measurements at this station between 2013 and 2017 using teledyne s river ray acoustic doppler profiler adcp and a rugged field computer these measurements were used to directly validate simulated outputs technical details of this adcp regarding water velocity profiling bottom tracking and depth of measurement is available at http www rdinstruments com the original soil database in swat 2012 does not capture soil types that are in the luanginga sub basin therefore we created a user defined soil database based on soil global datasets textural and organic matter from these sources were used to quantify available water content sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and bulk density sol bd this was achieved by using the soil plant air water spaw model saxton and willey 2009 3 3 model set up and evaluation three model configurations were parameterized in this study i swat model without a floodplain reservoir swatnres ii swat model with original simulated targeted release reservoir swatsres and iii swat model with psrc swatpsrc the models were run at a daily time step for a period of thirteen years 2003 2015 the first three years 2003 2005 however were excluded from analysis as the data over this period were used to warm up the model to eliminate the effect of initial conditions the models were calibrated with 2006 2011 discharge data validation was performed using the rest of the data 2012 2015 the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 was used to perform a combined uncertainty analysis and calibration this algorithm quantifies uncertainty using the p factor and r factor the p factor measures ability of model to bracket measured data with the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu its value ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 represents a perfect model the r factor is the ratio between average thicknesses of 95ppu band and standard deviation of measured data it represents width of uncertainty interval which ideally should be zero the two statistics were used to assess quality of model performance the nash sutcliffe ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the primary objective function furthermore as it is recommended to use multiple performance indicators moriasi et al 2007 six ancillary objective functions were also included in the evaluation criteria these were modified nash sutcliffe mns krause et al 2005 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient of determination r2 and weighted coefficient of determination br2 krause et al 2005 prior to model calibration a list of candidate sensitive parameters was generated based on a hydrological knowledge of the study area b reveal of parameters used in previous studies schoul et al 2008a schoul et al 2008b michailovsky and bauer gottwein 2013 lietchi et al 2014 and c sensitivity indices of global sensitivity analyses generated with sufi 2 several calibration tests were conducted using candidate parameters model performance was carefully revealed for each test run the final selected list of parameters used for calibrating swatnres swatsres and swatpsrc models is shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis in discussing parameter sensitivity results we are cognizant of the equifinality concept beven and freer 2001 that different combinations of values of the same parameters may produce an identical output signal nevertheless in this study we evaluate the significance of swatpsrc parameter sensitivities relative to their being physically plausible and consistent with the hydrogeological and climatic characteristics of the study area the aim was to assess how these influenced two hydrological components i stream flow and ii water balance of the novel psrc model simulating an alluvial floodplain global sensitivity analysis results which demonstrate sensitivity of a variable to changes in a parameter while other parameters are also changing abbaspour 2015 are shown in table 3 the most sensitive parameters p value 0 05 were related to channel alpha bnk and ch k2 groundwater gw delay and psrc ndtargr water balance components temporal bank storage alpha bnk was expected to be a dominant process in the study area due to recurrent flooding of the large alluvial floodplain fig 1 this process usually supplies water to alluvial aquifers during high flow periods whiting and pomeranets 1997 winter et al 1998 it can also attenuate flood waves decrease peak discharge and extend hydrograph base time chen and chen 2003 the effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 is one of parameters which control channel transmission losses in swat these losses are partitioned into bank and deep aquifer storages the former can return to river channels whereas the latter is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 sensitivities of groundwater parameters appeared consistent with hydrogeological settings of the study area for instance we noted that sensitivity of gw delay and alpha bf tended to be higher than rchrg dp this suggested that aquifer transmitting properties exerted a greater influence on baseflow compared to storativity properties this is a more likely scenario for the study area geologically luanginga sub basin is predominantly composed of loosely consolidated sediments of the kalahari group money 1972 the main aquifer unit is typically sand gravel and sandstone where inter granular groundwater flow is dominant yec yachiyo engineering company 1995 higher sensitivities of gw revap and revapmin compared to epco suggested that the shallow aquifer also actively influenced supply of plant water requirements the sensitivities of psrc parameters clearly highlighted the dominance of the alluvial floodplain in controlling discharge in the study area it was noted that all of them except for res k were more sensitive than surface run off parameters i e surlag cn2 sol k and sol awc and some groundwater processes run off generation in a semi arid sub basin like the luanginga is expected to be horton type see hughes 1995 smith and goodrich 2005 due to occurrence of high intensities of convective rainfall which exceeds soil infiltration capacity however this is attenuated by swamps and floodplains beilfuss 2012 hence the lower sensitivities of surface run off parameters we also noted that the number of days required for psrc to reach target volume i e ndtargr was more strongly sensitive p value 0 05 to discharge than the target volume starg itself this showed that downstream discharge was highly affected by the seasonal and variable character of flooding in the luanginga sub basin the ndtargr calibrated value of 85 335 days table 3 meant that psrc did not release overflows from january until late march this is largely reflective of the annual flooding cycle of the study area in the context of rainfall variability due to anthropogenically driven land use and climate changes however discharge is also expected to vary significantly in this case the sensitivity of ndtargr can be used to understand the effects of such changes we found the higher sensitivity of res psa and the new parameter psrc std relative to the channel roughness i e ch n2 in tandem with the basis of our conceptual model fig 1c in this case these sensitivities meant that flood attenuation in luanginga sub basin is more controlled by standing retention than flow retention this also implied that return of flood storage to channels via sub surface is a prevalent hydrologic process in the study area hydraulic conductivity at the reservoir bottom res k was the least sensitive it was also dominated by high evaporative water demand this is reflected in higher sensitivities of esco and epco parameters we also found that evaporation over the psrc reservoir ranged between 400 000 to 730 000 m3 per day nevertheless it was expected that parameter sensitivities would vary according to adopted objective function and flow regime 4 2 sensitivity to objective functions as single objective functions are susceptible to influences of specific flow modes price et al 2012 we conducted sensitivity analyses of swatpsrc parameters to different objective functions the aim was to determine the significance of changes in predicted swatpsrc hydrological processes as a result of change in adopted objective function to achieve this a matrix table of sensitivities was created table 4 for easy of detection of interrelationships the following were done i parameter sensitivities to ns which was the primary objective function were treated as reference ii ranking orders similar to the reference were shaded light grey iii ranking orders similar only among ancillary objective functions were shaded dark grey and iv unique ranking orders were left unshaded in addition the sensitivities were ranked according to hydrological water balance components this produced an interesting matrix of sensitivities table 4 the significance of parameter sensitivities to four objective functions i e ns rsr mns and kge were the same considering ranking by hydrological water balance components table 4 these reflected that processes influencing discharge were in decreasing order channel groundwater psrc evaporative water demand surface run off water balance components this order was slightly different for sensitivities to r2 i e channel psrc groundwater evaporative water demand surface run off the ranking order resulting from sensitivities to pbias was quiet unique i e groundwater channel psrc surface run off evaporative water demand to understand the general parameter set favoured by each objective function we based our analysis on the knowledge that all objective functions used in this study are mathematically related e g see murphy 1988 weglarczyk 1998 gupta et al 2009 for instance gupta et al 2009 show that ns can be decomposed into correlation variability and bias components and that i in order to maximise ns the variability component has to be underestimated and ii in watersheds with runoff variability bias component will tend to have a smaller impact in optimisation of ns considering results in table 4 in this light it was noted that the ns rank order did not score a single match with pbias this indicated that ns results did not favour parameter sets that put a high weight on bias and variability components e g awc cn2 and surlag parameters in contrast pbias was highly sensitive to these surface run off parameters fig 4 4 3 sensitivity of psrc to flow regime to investigate sensitivity of psrc parameters to magnitude of discharge analysis was performed by considering observed relatively high 200 m3 s 1 and low 72 m3 s 1 annual flows in 2008 and 2015 respectively in general results indicated that res psa and psrc std were most sensitive in 2008 fig 7 a b d and e the res k was notably sensitive to pbias fig 5 c and r2 fig 5 f this can be attributed to possible high alluvial deposition in 2008 the res k tends to be high on alluvial floodplains sun et al 2015 it may also suggest rapid lateral spread of over bank flow to drier locations within the floodplain where water is lost via infiltration the high sensitivity of discharge to res psa during high flows is supported by studies conducted in the study area for instance zimba et al 2018 demonstrated the significance of floodplains in the upper zambezi basin in controlling flows via correlation analysis of floodplain inundated area with upstream and downstream stage mccartney et al 2013 found that floodplains in the zambezi basin significantly reduce flood flows in the order of 10 60 percent beilfuss 2012 indicated that floodplain wetlands in the luanginga su basin behave like a reservoir by absorbing water from upstream and local rainfall and then releasing it gradually to downstream areas the res k and psrc std sensitivities were mostly significant in 2015 fig 6 a d e and f the ndtargr also showed increased sensitivity fig 6 c on the other hand the res psa was less sensitive these results suggested that discharge is highly sensitive to losses via hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of psrc and baseflow gains from psrc during low flow regimes the increase of losses via res k can be attributed to pre existing moisture conditions within the floodplain during low flows overbank flow that enters a dry floodplain are more likely to quickly infiltrate the soil naiman et al 2005 4 4 implications of model parameter sensitivities qualitatively we deemed global sensitivities based on the primary ns objective function as largely physically plausible and consistent with hydrogeological and climatic characteristics of the study area we also found less discrepancies when parameter sensitivities were ranked according to hydrological water balance components however we observed that individual hydrological processes were weighted significantly different depending on adopted objective function therefore it may be misleading to emphasise predicating assessment of the skill of models in this study on the so called best simulation i e best parameter set rather we believe that the robustness of models will be strongly reflected in the ability to account for most of uncertainties in the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty band 95ppu this is in fact recommended by many researchers e g schuol et al 2008b gupta et al 2009 abbaspour 2015 as the proper method of evaluating model performance 4 5 performance evaluation of the models the model configured with a pseudo reservoir concept swatpsrc and the original targeted release reservoir swatsres were evaluated in terms of their skill to improve simulation of daily discharge downstream of a seasonally inundated floodplain in addition a third configuration without a reservoir swatnres was run to serve as control for the study setup the ns efficiencies indicated that swatpsrc outperformed swatsres table 5 swatpsrc improved ns results by over 100 and 75 compared to swatsres during calibration i e ns 0 04 to ns 0 78 and validation i e ns 0 20 to ns 0 80 respectively its performance was also clearly better than swatsres for the other objective functions table 5 since only the floodplain was modeled differently between the two models these results meant that psrc was superior to the original reservoir model for simulating the floodplain improved performance by swatpsrc for mns and kge objective functions implied that psrc simulated the effect of the floodplain on both low and high flows very well compared to the original reservoir this is because mns krause et al 2005 and kge gupta et al 2009 are more sensitive to significant over or under prediction of flows than ns the performance of swatpsrc in simulating average magnitudes pbias for validation period was acceptable following the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 this criteria was satisfied since swatpsrc also simulated the trends ns and the indicator of stream flow residual variation rsr very good during validation and calibration on the other hand swatsres pbias results were obviously unacceptable as the model failed to produce satisfactory results for ns and rsr objective functions the r2 and its derivative br2 appeared to be satisfactory for swatsres these were however not supported by other indicators besides it is known that a model which systematically over or under predicts all the time will score high r2 values close to unity in spite of all the predictions being wrong krause et al 2005 the swatpsrc model was also superior to swatnres it improved ns by 19 2 i e ns 0 63 to ns 0 78 during calibration and 8 8 i e ns 0 73 to ns 0 80 during validation compared to swatnres results also showed that swatpsrc consistently outperformed swatnres for all objective functions except for r2 table 5 all these statistical performance indicators attest to the skill of psrc to simulate the floodplain interestingly the results which provided further proof that psrc enhanced simulation of the floodplain was the finding that swatsres performed worse than swatnres table 5 indeed the obtained results suggested that the original reservoir does not have the skill to simulate the behaviour of an extensive floodplain the comparison between observed and simulated daily discharge for all the three models is shown in fig 7 swatpsrc reproduced the hydrograph of the luanginga sub basin better than swatsres and swatnres it was the only model that was able to simulate base flows which were prolongated and better matched with the observed especially during the validation period the swatpsrc model also replicated the rising and falling limbs quiet well compared to the other two on the other hand swatsres severely overestimated both flood peaks and base flows over estimation of base flow by swatnres was also pronounced throughout study period the swatnres peak discharges were somewhat similar to the ones predicted by swatpsrc fig 7 swatsres appeared to reproduce the rising limb this was likely due to the mechanics of the reservoir the targeted release reservoir maintains a steady outflow when volume of water is between target volume and principle spillway volume pvol it appears that this occurred between mid and peak flows nevertheless it failed to simulate flood attenuation as the wet season progressed since it damps the whole volume of water above pvol on the same day neitsch et al 2011 it could not equally simulate the effect of the floodplain on base flow since groundwater in this model is treated simply as seepage that is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 it was expected that swatnres would over estimate peak flows surprisingly it was baseflow that was consistently overestimated instead this seem to contradict the global perception e g lietchi et al 2014 it is anticipated that different results may be obtained depending on one or a combination of the following factors i model parameters considered ii size and configuration of the floodplain iii quality of input data e g rainfall and observation data used for calibration and iv model used to simulate the floodplain in this study we suspect channel parameters over compensated for processes that would otherwise be better simulated with psrc this resulted in dampening of flood peaks in the swatnres model temporal bank storage is however a transient process it is released as soon as hydraulic head change towards channels following storm events chen and chen 2003 in psrc flood water stored in geomorphic compartments within the floodplain is also considered fig 1 this also influences base flow during low flows lininger and latrubesse 2016 4 6 prediction uncertainty bands to quantify the fit between observation and simulated results using only the statistical performance indicators in table 5 is not sufficient since in a stochastic calibration there is no single set of parameters that can claim to produce the best model simulation abbaspour 2015 thus the ns objective function was optimised whilst also considering the good calibration solutions on the basis of the uncertainty bands generated by parameter ranges this was expressed as the ninety five percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu using the sufi 2 algorithm the 95ppus for the three models are shown in fig 8 and are quantified by the p factor and r factor although no recommended hard values for these indices exist for model performance evaluation p factor 0 70 abbaspour et al 2007 and r factor of close to or less than one schuol et al 2008a are suggested for discharge the swatpsrc met this criteria during validation as the p factor and r factor were 0 73 and 076 respectively fig 5 a the width of uncertainty i e r factor of swatpsrc was also good during calibration however its p factor though still considered satisfactory see schuol et al 2008a was somewhat lower therefore we directly used discharge measured using the adcp to further ascertain the robustness of the models in simulating hydrological processes the use of these measurements proved that the skill of swatpsrc to account for uncertainties in the 95ppu is in fact better see section 4 7 the r factor and p factor statistics for swatsres and swatnres models in fig 8 were however not satisfactory during calibration and validation periods these models exhibited high prediction uncertainties during low flows prediction uncertainties were worst for swatsres model as the peak flows and falling limb were not also covered by the 95ppu 4 7 uncertainty bands as model solution the average model simulations will converge towards true measurements if the r factor is narrow enough and the p factor brackets most of the observed data based on this interpretation of the sufi 2 concept abbaspour 2015 and in order to further ascertain the ability of the models to account for uncertainties we wanted to know if in fact the average results i e 95ppus of the models can be used as model solutions thus we attempted to validate these simulated values with discharge data measured using the adcp the results revealed very interesting details fig 9 it was found that only swatpsrc replicated adcp measurements very well ns 0 86 r2 0 96 pbias 10 7 the other models performed below satisfaction the swatnres produced a hydrograph with an early peak flow i e no flood attenuation similarly the average tendency of swatsres produced early peak flow but this was greatly flattened even so both of these models showed unpredictable behaviour in 2015 which experienced below normal rainfall i e hydrological drought these results proved that swatpsrc is a robust model 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to properly simulate the behaviour of an alluvial floodplain through remodeling swat reservoir on a novel construct the pseudo reservoir concept psrc using this concept a historical ambiguity between a man made and natural reservoir in swat was rectified which allowed for simulation of the latter from a hydrogeomorphic perspective the model was applied in a complex tropical river system of luanginga western zambia the results were compared to the original swat targeted releases and the set up without a reservoir we demonstrated that psrc via its parameters was dynamically and significantly p value 0 05 sensitive to discharge it was superior to original targeted releases reservoir in simulating daily discharge downstream of a seasonally inundated floodplain in the luanginga sub basin the psrc model improved swat performance by four to over 100 percent depending on adopted objective functions it also outperformed the swat set up without a reservoir furthermore use of discharge data measured using adcp proved that the skill of swatpsrc to account for uncertainties in the 95ppu was very good the finding that the model set up without a reservoir performed better than one with targeted releases reservoir suggested that the latter lacks the skill to simulate an extensive alluvial floodplain it also provided proof of the psrc improved skill to simulate the floodplain compared to the original targeted releases reservoir accordingly we advise that the latter model should be avoided when simulating extensive natural reservoirs such as floodplains the widely known global phenomenon is that models without a floodplain overestimate peak flows thus the finding in this study that the model without the reservoir overestimated baseflow rather than peaks flows more likely demonstrated the case of unique character of the luanginga sub basin satellite imagery see appendix a shows that the luanginga river passes through a long and wide stretch of a seasonally inundated floodplain this area provide a large storage space for flood waters and act like a reservoir it also sequestrate large volume of water via bank storage hence high sensitivities of alpha bnk and ch k2 the swat model without a reservoir was able to partially simulate the behaviour of floodplain during high flows with these parameters nevertheless this model failed to simulate the low flows the psrc model was able to account for effect of floodplain on both high and low flows as the psrc parameter sensitivities were not only influenced by adopted objective function but also magnitude of annual flows we recommend that the psrc dimensions i e area and volume should be determined accurately to reduce uncertainties future research should include use of high resolution remote sensing to determine variations of flood inundated extent and volume analysis of this information alongside discharge data at the outlet of the basin can also form the basis of evaluating psrc this will increase confidence in the model simulations in general results indicated that psrc is a potentially robust model that is capable of modeling the behavior of undrained alluvial floodplains and their impact on downstream discharge it can therefore find further application into such undertakings as restoration designs and impact assessment of modified floodplains lastly we point out that psrc simplifies complex river alluvial floodplain hydrological processes and interactions to simulate the aggregate effect of multiple riparian geomorphic features on flows this is necessary to reduce computational demands in alluvial floodplain systems consisting of numerous water bodies which are intricately connected e g see wang et al 2008 however this approach implies that spatially variable wetland interaction with local areas including groundwater systems and hydrological exchange with streams may be disregarded thus for future research psrc could be improved further by disaggregating these hydrogeomorphic processes and explicitly considering detailed bidirectional flow exchange between riparian water bodies and associated streams and aquifers additionally it could include sub routines for routing sediments and water quality to gain an overall understanding of alluvial floodplain processes and functions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this research was

8282,study region noseong stream watershed in nonsan chuncheongnam do south korea study focus this study aims to identify and quantify groundwater inflow to a stream based on the spatial and temporal distributions of 220rn and 222rn activities in stream water and groundwater groundwater stream water exchange fluxes were estimated on the basis of 222rn mass balance approaches under losing and gaining stream conditions and groundwater inflow type was identified using a spatial survey of 220rn in stream water new hydrological insights for the region the 222rn activities at 20 stations along the stream during four sampling campaigns were higher at high altitudes than low altitudes regardless of the season at two sections which appeared to be gaining systems the groundwater inflow rates were estimated to be 6 5 102 and 4 0 102 m3 d 1 at another stream section where groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage into groundwater may alternatingly occur the groundwater inflow and stream water leakage were 1 5 102 and 2 5 104 m3 d 1 respectively a spatial survey of 220rn along the stream indicates that groundwater may dominantly discharge to the stream water as point sources rather than diffuse seepage keywords stream aquifer exchange flux 220rn 222rn mass balance model groundwater inflow rate losing and gaining streams noseong stream 1 introduction understanding groundwater and surface water interactions is important for the management and allocation of water resources as well as the protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 in particular the identification and quantification of groundwater inflow to rivers and streams are critical to a complete understanding of the water mass balances in stream aquifer systems cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 ortega et al 2015 however characterizing groundwater surface water interactions in aquatic systems especially in a small stream or river is challenging and time consuming due to hydrogeological and topographical heterogeneities as well as human activities such as groundwater pumping for irrigation kalbus et al 2006 to quantify groundwater surface water exchange fluxes and determine the groundwater inflow types in rivers and streams various chemical physical and numerical methods have been used in recent decades kalbus et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 the quantification methods for this exchange include direct water flux measurements using a seepage meter lee 1977 methods based on darcy s law woessner 2000 groundwater modeling nyholm et al 2002 rodríguez et al 2006 and the heat tracer method bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 furthermore environmental tracers have also been used to quantify groundwater inflow rate from subsurface to surface water for example water temperature and electrical conductivity ec have been used as environmental tracers to estimate groundwater inflow rates conant 2004 lamontagne et al 2005 mccallum et al 2010 major ions na si and no3 and stable isotopes 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h have been used to evaluate groundwater inflow rates cartwright and gilfedder 2015 hinkle et al 2001 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 yehdeghoa et al 1997 in addition methods employing thermal infrared imagery have been used in several lakes and streams to determine groundwater inflow rates and locate groundwater inflow points banks et al 1996 lee et al 2016 however in certain cases the temperature and ec of groundwater often do not show a significant difference from the surface water and these tracers are not always available furthermore evaporation mineral precipitation and biological processes may render the use of stable isotope tracers difficult owing to modifications of the major ion chemistry and overlapping isotope ratios cartwright et al 2011 radon 222rn is produced by radioactive decay of 226ra which is retained within or adsorbed onto sediment surfaces and ubiquitous in sediments and sedimentary rocks radon 222 has been used as a natural tracer to quantify groundwater discharge into water systems such as streams rivers wetlands and estuaries over the past two decades because 222rn activities in groundwater are typically 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of surface water burnett et al 2003a cook et al 2008 kim et al 2003 ortega et al 2015 santos and eyre 2011 shaw et al 2013 after 222rn enters surface water through groundwater inflow its activity in surface water rapidly decreases due to both radioactive decay half life of 222rn 3 8 days and atmospheric loss from wind driven evasion recently cartwright and gilfedder 2015 measured the 222rn activity in surface water for approximately 190 days to define the distribution of gaining reaches and estimate groundwater discharge into deep creek australia ortega et al 2015 investigated groundwater discharge in mundo river spain using a 222rn mass balance model reporting that the estimated groundwater discharge was 8 16 of the total river flow in contrast 220rn has also been recently used as an effective tracer to identify and locate groundwater discharge points in rivers and estuaries although 220rn half life 55 6 s rapidly decays after it enters the environment due to its short half life such that it is difficult to measure 220rn in surface waters chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 this is because the detection of 220rn in surface water must be indicative of its source such as groundwater inflow in this study we determined the groundwater surface water interactions in a stream using both 220rn and 222rn as natural tracers the study area is noseong stream watershed where water curtain cultivation systems have been applied in the winter season because the groundwater temperature is usually higher than the atmosphere pumped groundwater sprayed onto double layered vinyl walls of greenhouses can assist in heating this pumping causes a severe drawdown of the groundwater level in this area cho et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the spatial and temporal groundwater inflow characteristics using 222rn and 220rn tracers in stream water and groundwater and 2 estimate groundwater stream water exchange fluxes based on 222rn mass balance approaches under losing and gaining stream conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area noseong stream ns located in nonsan korea is approximately 20 km long and 5 30 m wide with an average depth of 0 3 m fig 1 the elevation decreases from gyeryong reservoir n1 52 m downstream n20 6 m gyeryong reservoir is located in the most upstream area of ns and forms from a dam across the horizontal width in this stream there are several weirs which can be obstructions with a gate that allows stream water to flow or maintains the stream water level to control river discharge for irrigation water kwon et al 2017 the mean annual air temperature and precipitation in the study area are 12 c and 1350 mm respectively the alluvium depth is 20 30 m and the basement is composed of biotite granite and amphibole granite cho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 detailed geological and hydrogeological information for this region is described elsewhere kwon et al 2020 in certain areas of ns watershed especially downstream of the ns water curtain cultivation has been intensively conducted to warm greenhouses during the winter because the groundwater temperature is relatively warm compared with the cold air temperatures however as the number of greenhouses and cultivated areas has increased the use of groundwater has also increased causing groundwater depletion problems moon et al 2012 previous studies have reported an estimated total amount of groundwater for water curtain cultivation in the area using a rating curve of 10 900 m3 d 1 lee et al 2015 with an annual maximum groundwater level change in the wells in this region of approximately 10 m cho et al 2012 water from ns is also used for irrigation in this region which is closely related to the groundwater flow in the surrounding aquifer kwon et al 2020 therefore understanding groundwater surface water interactions for groundwater management and sustainable groundwater use in this region is highly important 2 2 sampling stream water was collected using a submersible pump installed at stations n19 and n20 at section c for continuous 222rn measurements on july 28 and october 17 18 2017 fig 1 the pump was fixed at a depth of 20 cm above the streambed with a water flow rate of approximately 1 l min 1 the distance between n19 and n20 was 1 4 km and a weir was installed just above station n19 stream water was also collected using a 4 l glass bottle to measure the 222rn activity hereafter referred to as the grab method the sampling bottle was completely submerged in the stream and the bottle was filled and capped in the stream to minimize leaking of 222rn gas into air lee and kim 2006 zhang et al 2016 four sampling campaigns were conducted in november 2017 and february april and september 2018 at twenty stations along the stream n1 n20 to investigate the spatial and temporal variabilities in the 222rn activity in the stream water using the grab method sample n1 was collected at gyeryong reservoir the stream water samples were collected at sections a between n5 and n6 and b between n12 and n13 in october 2018 using the grab method a spatial survey of 220rn was conducted along the stream between stations n19 and n20 on an inflatable boat at a slow speed 1 km h 1 on july 27 2017 stream water was collected using a submersible pump installed on a boat with installed gps navigation to ensure the monitoring position groundwater was collected using a submersible pump from four wells a2 1 a2 2 b2 1 and b2 2 in fig 1 at different depths 20 11 5 14 7 and 9 2 m respectively after the temperature and ec of the groundwater exhibited constant values to measure the dissolved 226ra half life 1600 years activity in the stream water for the 222rn mass balance approximately 100 l of the stream water at n19 were collected using a submersible pump and passed through a 16 g mn fiber at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump moore and arnold 1996 in addition five sediment samples from the streambed fig 1b were collected to measure the 226ra contents in sediments for the 222rn mass balance 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 rn isotopes 222rn and 220rn and 226ra the 222rn activity in the stream water was continuously measured using a radon in air monitor rad7 durridge co u s a coupled with an air water exchanger spray chamber durridge co u s a burnett et al 2001 the 222rn data characterized by high relative humidity 10 were discarded the 222rn activities in the stream water collected using the 4 l glass bottles were measured using rad7 within a day of collection lee and kim 2006 water temperature and ec were also continuously measured using a ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands which was deployed in the exchanger the 222rn data were corrected using calculation procedures that consider the volumes of water and air water temperature salinity and the bunsen coefficient lee and kim 2006 schubert et al 2012 the 222rn activities in the groundwater samples were analyzed using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter lsc wallac 1220 quantulus perkin elmer u s a technique detailed quality assurance and control procedures for the 222rn measurements using the lsc are described elsewhere kim et al 2006 temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and ec in the groundwater were measured in situ using a portable sensor multi 3420 wtw germany the activity of 220rn in the stream water was continuously measured using rad7 and an air water exchanger measuring the 220rn activity in a water sample is difficult because of its short half life therefore we used a minimum tubing length and small desiccant volume to minimize the loss of 220rn by decay during water transport from the sampling point to the rad7 chamber the relative 220rn activities were examined to locate the groundwater discharge points rather than measuring the absolute 220rn activity concentrations in the stream water the 220rn activity was integrated over 5 min and expressed as an arbitrary unit chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 the activities and meaningful threshold of 220rn were calculated using capture durridge co u s a where the spill factor was assumed to be 0 015 for all measurements for the 226ra measurements the mn fiber and sediment samples were packed in air tight al canisters for more than three weeks to allow equilibrium of 222rn and its daughters 214pb and 214bi with 226ra the 226ra activity was analyzed using gamma spectrometry with an hpge detector model gr10026 canberra u s a based on previous studies lee et al 2009 2000 2 3 2 water level and stream flow rate the levels of the stream water around n19 and groundwater monitoring wells a2 1 and b2 1 were measured every 5 min using the td diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands and baro diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands for barometric correction the stream water velocity was directly measured using a propeller type current meter z400 ott hydromet germany at the upstream and downstream stations in october 2017 and 2018 the stream channel cross section was divided into several subsections 1 m intervals and individual subsection areas were estimated by multiplying the water depth by each width the total stream flow was then calculated by summing the discharge of each subsection weather parameter data air temperature precipitation and wind speed in the study area were obtained from the korea meteorological administration 2 4 222rn mass balance model the 222rn mass balance model was used to quantify groundwater inflow to the stream following the methods reported in previous studies burnett and dulaiova 2003 cartwright et al 2011 cook et al 2008 the 222rn mass balance equation to estimate groundwater inflow between two stations is as follows 1 q g w q d w c d w f a t m c a v v λ 222 f p r o f d i f q u p c u p c g w where qgw qup and qdw represent the groundwater inflow rate m3 day 1 the stream flow upstream m3 day 1 and the stream flow downstream m3 day 1 respectively cgw is the average 222rn activity bq m 3 of the groundwater samples cup and cdw are the 222rn activities bq m 3 in the upstream and downstream waters respectively cav represents the average 222rn activity bq m 3 in the upstream and downstream waters v is the water volume m3 of a selected section between the upstream and downstream λ222 is the 222rn decay constant day 1 here fatm is the loss term bq d 1 due to gas exchange with the atmosphere which was calculated using the wind speed and water temperature

the decay of dissolved 226ra in the stream water and diffusion from the streambed sediment respectively we calculated fpro using v the dissolved 226ra activity in the stream water 226radis and λ222 as follows 3 f p r o v r a d i s 226 λ 222 we estimated fdif using the relationship between the diffusive flux of 222rn and the 226ra activity of the sediments 226rased bq kg 1 burnett et al 2003b cockenpot et al 2015 as follows 4 f d i f a 0 495 r a s e d 226 0 303 using an average of the 226ra activities in the sediments fdif was calculated for the 222rn mass balance the groundwater derived 222rn flux was converted to groundwater inflow by dividing the calculated total 222rn flux by the 222rn activity in the groundwater to estimate the groundwater inflow using the 222rn mass balance we assumed that 1 all inputs and outputs of the water mass are characterized by a steady state because there was no significant rainfall event as well as no artificial control from the reservoir during the sampling campaigns 2 the measured 222rn activities in the water samples are representative of the steady state condition based on the results of the continuous 222rn measurements showing that there was no significant change in the activity figs 2 and 3 3 the 222rn input from a hyporheic exchange may be negligible because the material of the streambed in the study area mainly consists of sand and gravel and the connection between the stream and aquifer is excellent such that the residence time in the streambed zone hyporheic zone is too short for the ingrowth of 222rn and 4 the stream is a gaining stream which is supported by the fact that the measured stream water discharge rate downstream was higher than in the upstream at both sections a and b additionally there was no tributary between the upstream and downstream areas at sections a and b furthermore the groundwater and surface water levels measured in 2018 surrounding sections a and b indicated that the ns was a gaining stream except for the winter season from december to april kigam korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources 2019 for section c the differences in the groundwater and stream water level fig s1 and the results of the measured stream water discharge rate table 1 suggest that groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage alternatingly occurred at section c we used the average 222rn activity of all the groundwater samples as the groundwater endmember in the 222rn mass balance model 3 results table 1 lists the stream discharge sampling date the distance between the upstream and downstream and the 222rn activities in the stream water at the upstream and downstream areas of sections a b and c in july and october 2017 and october 2018 3 1 222rn and 220rn activities in the stream water the 222rn activity in the stream water was continuously measured at the upstream n19 and downstream n20 stations on july 28 2017 fig 2 the 222rn activities at stations n19 and n20 ranged from 130 13 to 270 17 bq m 3 and 350 18 to 540 22 bq m 3 respectively the 222rn activity was also measured using the grab method on july 28 2017 at n19 and n20 at n19 the 222rn activity was 140 13 bq m 3 using the continuous method and 170 17 bq m 3 using the grab method the 222rn activity was 420 21 bq m 3 using the continuous method and 350 30 bq m 3 with the grab method at n20 respectively the air and water temperatures showed distinct differences between the day time high temperature and night time low temperature the wind speed varied from 0 to 4 1 m s 1 with an average of 1 3 m s 1 the 222rn activities at n19 and n20 measured on october 17 18 2017 ranged from 370 22 to 540 27 bq m 3 and 390 24 to 560 26 bq m 3 respectively fig 3 the stream water temperature in october 2017 average of 17 7 c was cooler than that of july 2017 average of 28 4 c the wind speed in october ranged from 0 3 to 3 7 m s 1 with an average of 2 2 m s 1 during continuous measurement at section c in july and october 2017 there was no significant effect of variations in the environmental parameters i e air and water temperatures and wind speed on the 222rn activity in the stream water figs 2 and 3 there was a negligible change in the 222rn activities in the stream during the measurement period at both n19 and n20 the 222rn activities measured along the stream during the four campaigns ranged from 100 10 to 5800 600 bq m 3 with an average of 1300 1000 bq m 3 fig 4 and table s1 in general the 222rn activities at high altitudes upstream of ns were higher than at low altitudes downstream of ns the 222rn activities measured at station n1 were low relative to the other stations located at higher altitudes 2 km from the reservoir because the water at n1 had a relatively long residence time such that it was subjected to more decay and atmospheric evasion the 222rn activity sharply increased at station n2 the 222rn activity also increased at station n4 and decreased at station n5 the 220rn activity in the stream water was measured at intervals of 5 min along the stream from n19 to n20 the 220rn activity was up to 307 470 arbitrary unit 2σ fig 5 the stream water temperature showed no significant difference between the upstream and downstream 31 7 0 4 c the wind speed showed a small variation ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 m s 1 during the 220rn spatial survey 3 2 222rn activities in the groundwater table 2 lists the field parameters and 222rn activities measured in july and october 2017 in the groundwater of four groundwater wells the temperature and ph of the groundwater ranged from 12 4 to 15 6 c and from 6 1 to 6 9 respectively do in the groundwater was below 1 mg l 1 ec varied from 159 to 448 μs cm 1 showing relatively higher values in october than those in july the 222rn activities ranged from 2 0 0 4 104 to 7 3 1 5 104 bq m 3 and 1 7 0 4 104 to 7 5 1 6 104 bq m 3 respectively in july and october the average 222rn activity of the four wells in july 3 9 2 4 104 bq m 3 was similar to that of october 3 7 2 6 104 bq m 3 3 3 226ra activities in stream water and sediments the dissolved 226ra activity 226radis in the stream water was 1 6 0 2 bq m 3 the 226ra activities of five sediments sampled from ns fig 1b ranged from 15 2 to 26 3 bq kg 1 with an average of 19 5 0 bq kg 1 4 discussion 4 1 continuous method vs grab method the 222rn activities 130 13 bq m 3 using the continuous method were lower than that 170 17 bq m 3 using the grab method at n19 in july 2017 whereas the 222rn activities 420 21 bq m 3 using the continuous method were higher than that 350 30 bq m 3 using the grab method at n20 these differences in the 222rn activity between the two methods may be attributed to the fact that while samples obtained using the grab method were collected at a specific time the 222rn activities measured using the continuous method were results integrated over a period of 30 min when considering the uncertainties of the 222rn activities however these results are not significantly different especially the average 222rn activity 190 17 bq m 3 in the stream water at n19 which is similar to the 222rn activity 170 17 bq m 3 obtained using the grab method although it is time consuming and laborious we can acquire more reliable 222rn data using an average value obtained from continuous measurement or we can simply obtain the 222rn activity in the samples using the grab method when continuous measurement is impossible in this study we used the grab method to measure the 222rn activity in the stream water during four campaigns at sections a and b because the field conditions such as a steep slope and equipment power supply were not suitable for continuous measurements at section c we used the continuous method to verify the changes in the 222rn activities and assumed a steady state for the 222rn mass balance 4 2 rates and type of groundwater inflow to estimate the groundwater inflow rate in the stream a 222rn mass balance was constructed based on the fluxes of the 222rn sources and sinks although stream water and groundwater level data were not obtained we assumed that ns was a gaining stream at sections a and b because the stream flow downstream qdw was higher than that upstream qup using eq 1 the groundwater inflow rates of sections a and b were estimated to be 6 5 4 5 102 m3 d 1 0 54 m3 m 1 d 1 and 4 0 3 5 102 m3 d 1 0 22 m3 m 1 d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the 222rn fluxes of the sources and sinks at sections a and b in the 222rn mass balance the uncertainties of the fluxes were calculated based on error propagation we assumed an approximately 50 uncertainty for the 222rn evasion flux to the atmosphere fatm based on an independent experiment dulaiova and burnett 2006 the 222rn activities in the groundwater exhibited a large variation with an average of 3 7 2 6 104 bq m 3 uncertainties in fpro and fdif were negligible because these fluxes accounted for 1 of all the 222rn sources the 222rn sink fluxes from atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay accounted for less than approximately 20 of all the 222rn sinks therefore the uncertainties in the estimated groundwater inflow mainly derive from the evasion flux and 222rn groundwater endmember additionally although there are spatial and temporal heterogeneities e g water depth permeability and porosity in the stream and anthropogenic effects e g groundwater pumping the groundwater inflow throughout the entire stream 20 km was estimated to be 7 6 103 m3 d 1 using the average 0 38 m3 m 1 d 1 groundwater inflow rate estimated at sections a and b our estimated groundwater inflow was similar to those reported in previous studies which were conducted on the cockburn river 0 56 m3 m 1 d 1 and the king river 0 25 m3 m 1 d 1 in australia cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 while the stream flow rate of sections a and b increased from the upstream to downstream the stream flow of section c in october 2017 decreased from the upstream n19 2 0 105 m3 d 1 to the downstream n20 1 8 105 m3 d 1 table 1 in contrast the 222rn activities were similar between n19 and n20 despite 222rn losses due to decay and atmospheric evasion which suggests that there should be additional 222rn sources such as groundwater inflow production from 226ra and diffusion from the sediment with the stream water flow at section c because fdif and fpro were two orders of magnitude lower than all of the 222rn input fluxes fig 7 the constant 222rn activities in the upstream and downstream may have resulted from groundwater inflows furthermore the fact that the groundwater levels observed in the a2 1 and b2 1 wells were higher than the stream water level fig s1 also indicates the existence of groundwater inflow in this section this hydrological phenomenon i e groundwater inflow and stream water leakage stream water discharge into the groundwater occurring concurrently throughout section c may be a result of heavy groundwater use for irrigation between the upstream and downstream therefore we assumed that two processes groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage occurred alternatingly at section c we then applied a water mass balance and a modified 222rn mass balance model which considers stream water leakage qr m3 d 1 into the groundwater as well as the groundwater inflow to the stream as follows 5 q u p q g w q d w q r 6 q g w q d w c d w f a t m c a v v λ 222 f p r o f d i f q u p c u p c a v q r c g w the 222rn loss from stream water leakage was calculated by multiplying qr by cav which is the average 222rn activity in the stream water of n19 and n20 using eqs 5 and 6 the stream water leakage in october 2017 was estimated to be 2 5 104 m3 d 1 approximately 15 of the stream flow rate while groundwater inflow was estimated to be 1 5 102 m3 d 1 an uncertainty of more than 100 which is two orders of magnitude lower than the stream water leakage fig 7 our results suggest that the 222rn tracer can be applied to estimate the groundwater inflow rate and stream water leakage rate in both losing and gaining streams the 220rn activity concentrations were plotted against the distance from n19 to n20 fig 5 as 220rn completely decays within 5 min after it enters the stream water due to its short half life compared with 222rn relatively high or higher than the thresholds 220rn activity at a certain station can suggest that there is an active groundwater inflow process during the 220rn spatial survey there was no significant difference in the wind speed and water temperature between the upstream and downstream stations the observed 220rn activities in the stream water between n19 and n20 were significantly higher than the thresholds only at 100 400 800 and 1300 m from n19 suggesting that groundwater discharges through several points rather than diffuse sources in ns the meaningful thresholds are described elsewhere chanyotha et al 2014 4 3 spatial and temporal variations in the 222rn activities in stream water the 222rn activities in the stream water during four seasons generally decreased with an increase in the distance from gyeryong reservoir i e up to approximately 6000 bq m 3 upstream n4 and below 1000 bq m 3 downstream a distance of 10 km these 222rn activities showed strong and significant correlations with altitude regardless of the season fig 8 there are several potential reasons why the 222rn activities in the stream water showed a strong significant correlation with the altitude first 222rn losses via decay and atmospheric evasion as the stream flows downstream or relatively large groundwater inflow upstream would induce relatively lower 222rn activities downstream because decay and evasion processes notably and naturally occur as the stream water flows downstream approximately 20 km however the calculated groundwater inflow at section a altitude of 25 m was higher than that at section b altitude of 15 m based on the 222rn mass balance which already considers 222rn losses via decay and atmospheric evasion suggesting that larger groundwater inflow upstream can also induce the high 222rn at high altitudes this results higher groundwater inflow at higher altitudes may be due to a relatively larger hydraulic gradient upstream induced by the reservoir upstream of ns because the reservoir forms from a dam such that the increase in the water level in the reservoir creates a hydraulic head that drives groundwater inflow to the stream additionally a few small mountains located upstream can also cause a relatively larger hydraulic gradient upstream fig 1a second the low 222rn activities at low altitudes can be attributed to relatively larger groundwater use which lowers groundwater level and results in less groundwater discharge to the stream groundwater well density may represent an amount of groundwater use for irrigation fig s2 shows the spatial distributions of irrigation wells surrounding the high n1 n5 and low n19 n20 altitudes of ns showing that the density of the groundwater well is approximately 20 wells per km2 at high altitude while it is approximately 70 wells per km2 at low altitude data obtained from national groundwater information center http www gims go kr third the dilution effect of the tributaries t1 t2 and t3 in fig 1a downstream can also decrease the 222rn activities downstream because the 222rn activities in the surface water of t2 and t3 which were measured in april 2018 were smaller than 500 bq m 3 additionally there was no geological difference between each sampling station fig s3 a previous study conducted at gyeryong mountain located adjacent to our study area reported that shallow groundwater mainly discharges at higher altitudes due to enhanced rainfall and a poor hydrological connection between the soil layer and soil bedrock interface based on δ18o and δ2h data jung et al 2020 the 222rn activities were higher in november 2017 and february 2018 than those in april and september 2018 fig 4 this result may be due to the drainage of groundwater to the stream after water curtain cultivation in the winter from november to february approximately 8100 m3 d 1 daily average of groundwater is used for water curtain cultivation surrounding stations n19 and n20 which is more than approximately 30 of the lowest stream water discharge cho et al 2012 the 222rn activity in the drained groundwater may be relatively higher than that in the stream water indeed the 222rn activity in the drained groundwater collected around station n20 in february was 3 1 0 2 104 bq m 3 another reason for the high 222rn activities in november and february can be attributed to the water temperature the average of stream water temperature was 6 0 1 7 c and 7 8 1 4 c in february and november respectively while it was 15 5 1 8 c and 23 4 1 4 c in april and september respectively the high water temperature can also reduce the 222rn activities in the stream water by decreasing the water air partitioning coefficient of 222rn which is approximately 0 42 at 5 c and 0 22 at 25 c for freshwater schubert et al 2012 5 conclusions we measured radon isotopes 220rn and 222rn in the stream water and groundwater to identify and quantify groundwater inflow based on the 222rn mass balance considering all 222rn sources and sinks the groundwater inflow rates into ns and the stream water leakage were estimated the results from the 220rn survey along the stream suggest that groundwater may discharge to the stream water through point sources the 222rn mass balance method is advantageous because of its low cost high sensitivity and simplicity relative to the installation of groundwater wells however more intensive studies are necessary to reduce uncertainties associated with groundwater inflow rate in the 222rn mass balance by considering hyporheic exchanges and selecting a reasonable 222rn groundwater endmember furthermore a spatial 220rn survey can provide information on groundwater inflow types point or non point and be used to investigate large springs as groundwater resources in coastal zones our methods using both 222rn and 220rn can be applied to understand groundwater surface water interactions in various environments such as lakes wetlands and rivers in addition these methods are helpful in determining groundwater depletion problems in rural areas and the mechanisms of river water generation in mountainous areas credit authorship contribution statement yong hwa oh conceptualization investigation data curation methodology writing original

8282,study region noseong stream watershed in nonsan chuncheongnam do south korea study focus this study aims to identify and quantify groundwater inflow to a stream based on the spatial and temporal distributions of 220rn and 222rn activities in stream water and groundwater groundwater stream water exchange fluxes were estimated on the basis of 222rn mass balance approaches under losing and gaining stream conditions and groundwater inflow type was identified using a spatial survey of 220rn in stream water new hydrological insights for the region the 222rn activities at 20 stations along the stream during four sampling campaigns were higher at high altitudes than low altitudes regardless of the season at two sections which appeared to be gaining systems the groundwater inflow rates were estimated to be 6 5 102 and 4 0 102 m3 d 1 at another stream section where groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage into groundwater may alternatingly occur the groundwater inflow and stream water leakage were 1 5 102 and 2 5 104 m3 d 1 respectively a spatial survey of 220rn along the stream indicates that groundwater may dominantly discharge to the stream water as point sources rather than diffuse seepage keywords stream aquifer exchange flux 220rn 222rn mass balance model groundwater inflow rate losing and gaining streams noseong stream 1 introduction understanding groundwater and surface water interactions is important for the management and allocation of water resources as well as the protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 in particular the identification and quantification of groundwater inflow to rivers and streams are critical to a complete understanding of the water mass balances in stream aquifer systems cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 ortega et al 2015 however characterizing groundwater surface water interactions in aquatic systems especially in a small stream or river is challenging and time consuming due to hydrogeological and topographical heterogeneities as well as human activities such as groundwater pumping for irrigation kalbus et al 2006 to quantify groundwater surface water exchange fluxes and determine the groundwater inflow types in rivers and streams various chemical physical and numerical methods have been used in recent decades kalbus et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 the quantification methods for this exchange include direct water flux measurements using a seepage meter lee 1977 methods based on darcy s law woessner 2000 groundwater modeling nyholm et al 2002 rodríguez et al 2006 and the heat tracer method bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 furthermore environmental tracers have also been used to quantify groundwater inflow rate from subsurface to surface water for example water temperature and electrical conductivity ec have been used as environmental tracers to estimate groundwater inflow rates conant 2004 lamontagne et al 2005 mccallum et al 2010 major ions na si and no3 and stable isotopes 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h have been used to evaluate groundwater inflow rates cartwright and gilfedder 2015 hinkle et al 2001 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 yehdeghoa et al 1997 in addition methods employing thermal infrared imagery have been used in several lakes and streams to determine groundwater inflow rates and locate groundwater inflow points banks et al 1996 lee et al 2016 however in certain cases the temperature and ec of groundwater often do not show a significant difference from the surface water and these tracers are not always available furthermore evaporation mineral precipitation and biological processes may render the use of stable isotope tracers difficult owing to modifications of the major ion chemistry and overlapping isotope ratios cartwright et al 2011 radon 222rn is produced by radioactive decay of 226ra which is retained within or adsorbed onto sediment surfaces and ubiquitous in sediments and sedimentary rocks radon 222 has been used as a natural tracer to quantify groundwater discharge into water systems such as streams rivers wetlands and estuaries over the past two decades because 222rn activities in groundwater are typically 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of surface water burnett et al 2003a cook et al 2008 kim et al 2003 ortega et al 2015 santos and eyre 2011 shaw et al 2013 after 222rn enters surface water through groundwater inflow its activity in surface water rapidly decreases due to both radioactive decay half life of 222rn 3 8 days and atmospheric loss from wind driven evasion recently cartwright and gilfedder 2015 measured the 222rn activity in surface water for approximately 190 days to define the distribution of gaining reaches and estimate groundwater discharge into deep creek australia ortega et al 2015 investigated groundwater discharge in mundo river spain using a 222rn mass balance model reporting that the estimated groundwater discharge was 8 16 of the total river flow in contrast 220rn has also been recently used as an effective tracer to identify and locate groundwater discharge points in rivers and estuaries although 220rn half life 55 6 s rapidly decays after it enters the environment due to its short half life such that it is difficult to measure 220rn in surface waters chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 this is because the detection of 220rn in surface water must be indicative of its source such as groundwater inflow in this study we determined the groundwater surface water interactions in a stream using both 220rn and 222rn as natural tracers the study area is noseong stream watershed where water curtain cultivation systems have been applied in the winter season because the groundwater temperature is usually higher than the atmosphere pumped groundwater sprayed onto double layered vinyl walls of greenhouses can assist in heating this pumping causes a severe drawdown of the groundwater level in this area cho et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the spatial and temporal groundwater inflow characteristics using 222rn and 220rn tracers in stream water and groundwater and 2 estimate groundwater stream water exchange fluxes based on 222rn mass balance approaches under losing and gaining stream conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area noseong stream ns located in nonsan korea is approximately 20 km long and 5 30 m wide with an average depth of 0 3 m fig 1 the elevation decreases from gyeryong reservoir n1 52 m downstream n20 6 m gyeryong reservoir is located in the most upstream area of ns and forms from a dam across the horizontal width in this stream there are several weirs which can be obstructions with a gate that allows stream water to flow or maintains the stream water level to control river discharge for irrigation water kwon et al 2017 the mean annual air temperature and precipitation in the study area are 12 c and 1350 mm respectively the alluvium depth is 20 30 m and the basement is composed of biotite granite and amphibole granite cho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 detailed geological and hydrogeological information for this region is described elsewhere kwon et al 2020 in certain areas of ns watershed especially downstream of the ns water curtain cultivation has been intensively conducted to warm greenhouses during the winter because the groundwater temperature is relatively warm compared with the cold air temperatures however as the number of greenhouses and cultivated areas has increased the use of groundwater has also increased causing groundwater depletion problems moon et al 2012 previous studies have reported an estimated total amount of groundwater for water curtain cultivation in the area using a rating curve of 10 900 m3 d 1 lee et al 2015 with an annual maximum groundwater level change in the wells in this region of approximately 10 m cho et al 2012 water from ns is also used for irrigation in this region which is closely related to the groundwater flow in the surrounding aquifer kwon et al 2020 therefore understanding groundwater surface water interactions for groundwater management and sustainable groundwater use in this region is highly important 2 2 sampling stream water was collected using a submersible pump installed at stations n19 and n20 at section c for continuous 222rn measurements on july 28 and october 17 18 2017 fig 1 the pump was fixed at a depth of 20 cm above the streambed with a water flow rate of approximately 1 l min 1 the distance between n19 and n20 was 1 4 km and a weir was installed just above station n19 stream water was also collected using a 4 l glass bottle to measure the 222rn activity hereafter referred to as the grab method the sampling bottle was completely submerged in the stream and the bottle was filled and capped in the stream to minimize leaking of 222rn gas into air lee and kim 2006 zhang et al 2016 four sampling campaigns were conducted in november 2017 and february april and september 2018 at twenty stations along the stream n1 n20 to investigate the spatial and temporal variabilities in the 222rn activity in the stream water using the grab method sample n1 was collected at gyeryong reservoir the stream water samples were collected at sections a between n5 and n6 and b between n12 and n13 in october 2018 using the grab method a spatial survey of 220rn was conducted along the stream between stations n19 and n20 on an inflatable boat at a slow speed 1 km h 1 on july 27 2017 stream water was collected using a submersible pump installed on a boat with installed gps navigation to ensure the monitoring position groundwater was collected using a submersible pump from four wells a2 1 a2 2 b2 1 and b2 2 in fig 1 at different depths 20 11 5 14 7 and 9 2 m respectively after the temperature and ec of the groundwater exhibited constant values to measure the dissolved 226ra half life 1600 years activity in the stream water for the 222rn mass balance approximately 100 l of the stream water at n19 were collected using a submersible pump and passed through a 16 g mn fiber at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump moore and arnold 1996 in addition five sediment samples from the streambed fig 1b were collected to measure the 226ra contents in sediments for the 222rn mass balance 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 rn isotopes 222rn and 220rn and 226ra the 222rn activity in the stream water was continuously measured using a radon in air monitor rad7 durridge co u s a coupled with an air water exchanger spray chamber durridge co u s a burnett et al 2001 the 222rn data characterized by high relative humidity 10 were discarded the 222rn activities in the stream water collected using the 4 l glass bottles were measured using rad7 within a day of collection lee and kim 2006 water temperature and ec were also continuously measured using a ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands which was deployed in the exchanger the 222rn data were corrected using calculation procedures that consider the volumes of water and air water temperature salinity and the bunsen coefficient lee and kim 2006 schubert et al 2012 the 222rn activities in the groundwater samples were analyzed using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter lsc wallac 1220 quantulus perkin elmer u s a technique detailed quality assurance and control procedures for the 222rn measurements using the lsc are described elsewhere kim et al 2006 temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and ec in the groundwater were measured in situ using a portable sensor multi 3420 wtw germany the activity of 220rn in the stream water was continuously measured using rad7 and an air water exchanger measuring the 220rn activity in a water sample is difficult because of its short half life therefore we used a minimum tubing length and small desiccant volume to minimize the loss of 220rn by decay during water transport from the sampling point to the rad7 chamber the relative 220rn activities were examined to locate the groundwater discharge points rather than measuring the absolute 220rn activity concentrations in the stream water the 220rn activity was integrated over 5 min and expressed as an arbitrary unit chanyotha et al 2014 xu et al 2014 the activities and meaningful threshold of 220rn were calculated using capture durridge co u s a where the spill factor was assumed to be 0 015 for all measurements for the 226ra measurements the mn fiber and sediment samples were packed in air tight al canisters for more than three weeks to allow equilibrium of 222rn and its daughters 214pb and 214bi with 226ra the 226ra activity was analyzed using gamma spectrometry with an hpge detector model gr10026 canberra u s a based on previous studies lee et al 2009 2000 2 3 2 water level and stream flow rate the levels of the stream water around n19 and groundwater monitoring wells a2 1 and b2 1 were measured every 5 min using the td diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands and baro diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands for barometric correction the stream water velocity was directly measured using a propeller type current meter z400 ott hydromet germany at the upstream and downstream stations in october 2017 and 2018 the stream channel cross section was divided into several subsections 1 m intervals and individual subsection areas were estimated by multiplying the water depth by each width the total stream flow was then calculated by summing the discharge of each subsection weather parameter data air temperature precipitation and wind speed in the study area were obtained from the korea meteorological administration 2 4 222rn mass balance model the 222rn mass balance model was used to quantify groundwater inflow to the stream following the methods reported in previous studies burnett and dulaiova 2003 cartwright et al 2011 cook et al 2008 the 222rn mass balance equation to estimate groundwater inflow between two stations is as follows 1 q g w q d w c d w f a t m c a v v λ 222 f p r o f d i f q u p c u p c g w where qgw qup and qdw represent the groundwater inflow rate m3 day 1 the stream flow upstream m3 day 1 and the stream flow downstream m3 day 1 respectively cgw is the average 222rn activity bq m 3 of the groundwater samples cup and cdw are the 222rn activities bq m 3 in the upstream and downstream waters respectively cav represents the average 222rn activity bq m 3 in the upstream and downstream waters v is the water volume m3 of a selected section between the upstream and downstream λ222 is the 222rn decay constant day 1 here fatm is the loss term bq d 1 due to gas exchange with the atmosphere which was calculated using the wind speed and water temperature

the decay of dissolved 226ra in the stream water and diffusion from the streambed sediment respectively we calculated fpro using v the dissolved 226ra activity in the stream water 226radis and λ222 as follows 3 f p r o v r a d i s 226 λ 222 we estimated fdif using the relationship between the diffusive flux of 222rn and the 226ra activity of the sediments 226rased bq kg 1 burnett et al 2003b cockenpot et al 2015 as follows 4 f d i f a 0 495 r a s e d 226 0 303 using an average of the 226ra activities in the sediments fdif was calculated for the 222rn mass balance the groundwater derived 222rn flux was converted to groundwater inflow by dividing the calculated total 222rn flux by the 222rn activity in the groundwater to estimate the groundwater inflow using the 222rn mass balance we assumed that 1 all inputs and outputs of the water mass are characterized by a steady state because there was no significant rainfall event as well as no artificial control from the reservoir during the sampling campaigns 2 the measured 222rn activities in the water samples are representative of the steady state condition based on the results of the continuous 222rn measurements showing that there was no significant change in the activity figs 2 and 3 3 the 222rn input from a hyporheic exchange may be negligible because the material of the streambed in the study area mainly consists of sand and gravel and the connection between the stream and aquifer is excellent such that the residence time in the streambed zone hyporheic zone is too short for the ingrowth of 222rn and 4 the stream is a gaining stream which is supported by the fact that the measured stream water discharge rate downstream was higher than in the upstream at both sections a and b additionally there was no tributary between the upstream and downstream areas at sections a and b furthermore the groundwater and surface water levels measured in 2018 surrounding sections a and b indicated that the ns was a gaining stream except for the winter season from december to april kigam korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources 2019 for section c the differences in the groundwater and stream water level fig s1 and the results of the measured stream water discharge rate table 1 suggest that groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage alternatingly occurred at section c we used the average 222rn activity of all the groundwater samples as the groundwater endmember in the 222rn mass balance model 3 results table 1 lists the stream discharge sampling date the distance between the upstream and downstream and the 222rn activities in the stream water at the upstream and downstream areas of sections a b and c in july and october 2017 and october 2018 3 1 222rn and 220rn activities in the stream water the 222rn activity in the stream water was continuously measured at the upstream n19 and downstream n20 stations on july 28 2017 fig 2 the 222rn activities at stations n19 and n20 ranged from 130 13 to 270 17 bq m 3 and 350 18 to 540 22 bq m 3 respectively the 222rn activity was also measured using the grab method on july 28 2017 at n19 and n20 at n19 the 222rn activity was 140 13 bq m 3 using the continuous method and 170 17 bq m 3 using the grab method the 222rn activity was 420 21 bq m 3 using the continuous method and 350 30 bq m 3 with the grab method at n20 respectively the air and water temperatures showed distinct differences between the day time high temperature and night time low temperature the wind speed varied from 0 to 4 1 m s 1 with an average of 1 3 m s 1 the 222rn activities at n19 and n20 measured on october 17 18 2017 ranged from 370 22 to 540 27 bq m 3 and 390 24 to 560 26 bq m 3 respectively fig 3 the stream water temperature in october 2017 average of 17 7 c was cooler than that of july 2017 average of 28 4 c the wind speed in october ranged from 0 3 to 3 7 m s 1 with an average of 2 2 m s 1 during continuous measurement at section c in july and october 2017 there was no significant effect of variations in the environmental parameters i e air and water temperatures and wind speed on the 222rn activity in the stream water figs 2 and 3 there was a negligible change in the 222rn activities in the stream during the measurement period at both n19 and n20 the 222rn activities measured along the stream during the four campaigns ranged from 100 10 to 5800 600 bq m 3 with an average of 1300 1000 bq m 3 fig 4 and table s1 in general the 222rn activities at high altitudes upstream of ns were higher than at low altitudes downstream of ns the 222rn activities measured at station n1 were low relative to the other stations located at higher altitudes 2 km from the reservoir because the water at n1 had a relatively long residence time such that it was subjected to more decay and atmospheric evasion the 222rn activity sharply increased at station n2 the 222rn activity also increased at station n4 and decreased at station n5 the 220rn activity in the stream water was measured at intervals of 5 min along the stream from n19 to n20 the 220rn activity was up to 307 470 arbitrary unit 2σ fig 5 the stream water temperature showed no significant difference between the upstream and downstream 31 7 0 4 c the wind speed showed a small variation ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 m s 1 during the 220rn spatial survey 3 2 222rn activities in the groundwater table 2 lists the field parameters and 222rn activities measured in july and october 2017 in the groundwater of four groundwater wells the temperature and ph of the groundwater ranged from 12 4 to 15 6 c and from 6 1 to 6 9 respectively do in the groundwater was below 1 mg l 1 ec varied from 159 to 448 μs cm 1 showing relatively higher values in october than those in july the 222rn activities ranged from 2 0 0 4 104 to 7 3 1 5 104 bq m 3 and 1 7 0 4 104 to 7 5 1 6 104 bq m 3 respectively in july and october the average 222rn activity of the four wells in july 3 9 2 4 104 bq m 3 was similar to that of october 3 7 2 6 104 bq m 3 3 3 226ra activities in stream water and sediments the dissolved 226ra activity 226radis in the stream water was 1 6 0 2 bq m 3 the 226ra activities of five sediments sampled from ns fig 1b ranged from 15 2 to 26 3 bq kg 1 with an average of 19 5 0 bq kg 1 4 discussion 4 1 continuous method vs grab method the 222rn activities 130 13 bq m 3 using the continuous method were lower than that 170 17 bq m 3 using the grab method at n19 in july 2017 whereas the 222rn activities 420 21 bq m 3 using the continuous method were higher than that 350 30 bq m 3 using the grab method at n20 these differences in the 222rn activity between the two methods may be attributed to the fact that while samples obtained using the grab method were collected at a specific time the 222rn activities measured using the continuous method were results integrated over a period of 30 min when considering the uncertainties of the 222rn activities however these results are not significantly different especially the average 222rn activity 190 17 bq m 3 in the stream water at n19 which is similar to the 222rn activity 170 17 bq m 3 obtained using the grab method although it is time consuming and laborious we can acquire more reliable 222rn data using an average value obtained from continuous measurement or we can simply obtain the 222rn activity in the samples using the grab method when continuous measurement is impossible in this study we used the grab method to measure the 222rn activity in the stream water during four campaigns at sections a and b because the field conditions such as a steep slope and equipment power supply were not suitable for continuous measurements at section c we used the continuous method to verify the changes in the 222rn activities and assumed a steady state for the 222rn mass balance 4 2 rates and type of groundwater inflow to estimate the groundwater inflow rate in the stream a 222rn mass balance was constructed based on the fluxes of the 222rn sources and sinks although stream water and groundwater level data were not obtained we assumed that ns was a gaining stream at sections a and b because the stream flow downstream qdw was higher than that upstream qup using eq 1 the groundwater inflow rates of sections a and b were estimated to be 6 5 4 5 102 m3 d 1 0 54 m3 m 1 d 1 and 4 0 3 5 102 m3 d 1 0 22 m3 m 1 d 1 respectively fig 6 shows the 222rn fluxes of the sources and sinks at sections a and b in the 222rn mass balance the uncertainties of the fluxes were calculated based on error propagation we assumed an approximately 50 uncertainty for the 222rn evasion flux to the atmosphere fatm based on an independent experiment dulaiova and burnett 2006 the 222rn activities in the groundwater exhibited a large variation with an average of 3 7 2 6 104 bq m 3 uncertainties in fpro and fdif were negligible because these fluxes accounted for 1 of all the 222rn sources the 222rn sink fluxes from atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay accounted for less than approximately 20 of all the 222rn sinks therefore the uncertainties in the estimated groundwater inflow mainly derive from the evasion flux and 222rn groundwater endmember additionally although there are spatial and temporal heterogeneities e g water depth permeability and porosity in the stream and anthropogenic effects e g groundwater pumping the groundwater inflow throughout the entire stream 20 km was estimated to be 7 6 103 m3 d 1 using the average 0 38 m3 m 1 d 1 groundwater inflow rate estimated at sections a and b our estimated groundwater inflow was similar to those reported in previous studies which were conducted on the cockburn river 0 56 m3 m 1 d 1 and the king river 0 25 m3 m 1 d 1 in australia cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 while the stream flow rate of sections a and b increased from the upstream to downstream the stream flow of section c in october 2017 decreased from the upstream n19 2 0 105 m3 d 1 to the downstream n20 1 8 105 m3 d 1 table 1 in contrast the 222rn activities were similar between n19 and n20 despite 222rn losses due to decay and atmospheric evasion which suggests that there should be additional 222rn sources such as groundwater inflow production from 226ra and diffusion from the sediment with the stream water flow at section c because fdif and fpro were two orders of magnitude lower than all of the 222rn input fluxes fig 7 the constant 222rn activities in the upstream and downstream may have resulted from groundwater inflows furthermore the fact that the groundwater levels observed in the a2 1 and b2 1 wells were higher than the stream water level fig s1 also indicates the existence of groundwater inflow in this section this hydrological phenomenon i e groundwater inflow and stream water leakage stream water discharge into the groundwater occurring concurrently throughout section c may be a result of heavy groundwater use for irrigation between the upstream and downstream therefore we assumed that two processes groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage occurred alternatingly at section c we then applied a water mass balance and a modified 222rn mass balance model which considers stream water leakage qr m3 d 1 into the groundwater as well as the groundwater inflow to the stream as follows 5 q u p q g w q d w q r 6 q g w q d w c d w f a t m c a v v λ 222 f p r o f d i f q u p c u p c a v q r c g w the 222rn loss from stream water leakage was calculated by multiplying qr by cav which is the average 222rn activity in the stream water of n19 and n20 using eqs 5 and 6 the stream water leakage in october 2017 was estimated to be 2 5 104 m3 d 1 approximately 15 of the stream flow rate while groundwater inflow was estimated to be 1 5 102 m3 d 1 an uncertainty of more than 100 which is two orders of magnitude lower than the stream water leakage fig 7 our results suggest that the 222rn tracer can be applied to estimate the groundwater inflow rate and stream water leakage rate in both losing and gaining streams the 220rn activity concentrations were plotted against the distance from n19 to n20 fig 5 as 220rn completely decays within 5 min after it enters the stream water due to its short half life compared with 222rn relatively high or higher than the thresholds 220rn activity at a certain station can suggest that there is an active groundwater inflow process during the 220rn spatial survey there was no significant difference in the wind speed and water temperature between the upstream and downstream stations the observed 220rn activities in the stream water between n19 and n20 were significantly higher than the thresholds only at 100 400 800 and 1300 m from n19 suggesting that groundwater discharges through several points rather than diffuse sources in ns the meaningful thresholds are described elsewhere chanyotha et al 2014 4 3 spatial and temporal variations in the 222rn activities in stream water the 222rn activities in the stream water during four seasons generally decreased with an increase in the distance from gyeryong reservoir i e up to approximately 6000 bq m 3 upstream n4 and below 1000 bq m 3 downstream a distance of 10 km these 222rn activities showed strong and significant correlations with altitude regardless of the season fig 8 there are several potential reasons why the 222rn activities in the stream water showed a strong significant correlation with the altitude first 222rn losses via decay and atmospheric evasion as the stream flows downstream or relatively large groundwater inflow upstream would induce relatively lower 222rn activities downstream because decay and evasion processes notably and naturally occur as the stream water flows downstream approximately 20 km however the calculated groundwater inflow at section a altitude of 25 m was higher than that at section b altitude of 15 m based on the 222rn mass balance which already considers 222rn losses via decay and atmospheric evasion suggesting that larger groundwater inflow upstream can also induce the high 222rn at high altitudes this results higher groundwater inflow at higher altitudes may be due to a relatively larger hydraulic gradient upstream induced by the reservoir upstream of ns because the reservoir forms from a dam such that the increase in the water level in the reservoir creates a hydraulic head that drives groundwater inflow to the stream additionally a few small mountains located upstream can also cause a relatively larger hydraulic gradient upstream fig 1a second the low 222rn activities at low altitudes can be attributed to relatively larger groundwater use which lowers groundwater level and results in less groundwater discharge to the stream groundwater well density may represent an amount of groundwater use for irrigation fig s2 shows the spatial distributions of irrigation wells surrounding the high n1 n5 and low n19 n20 altitudes of ns showing that the density of the groundwater well is approximately 20 wells per km2 at high altitude while it is approximately 70 wells per km2 at low altitude data obtained from national groundwater information center http www gims go kr third the dilution effect of the tributaries t1 t2 and t3 in fig 1a downstream can also decrease the 222rn activities downstream because the 222rn activities in the surface water of t2 and t3 which were measured in april 2018 were smaller than 500 bq m 3 additionally there was no geological difference between each sampling station fig s3 a previous study conducted at gyeryong mountain located adjacent to our study area reported that shallow groundwater mainly discharges at higher altitudes due to enhanced rainfall and a poor hydrological connection between the soil layer and soil bedrock interface based on δ18o and δ2h data jung et al 2020 the 222rn activities were higher in november 2017 and february 2018 than those in april and september 2018 fig 4 this result may be due to the drainage of groundwater to the stream after water curtain cultivation in the winter from november to february approximately 8100 m3 d 1 daily average of groundwater is used for water curtain cultivation surrounding stations n19 and n20 which is more than approximately 30 of the lowest stream water discharge cho et al 2012 the 222rn activity in the drained groundwater may be relatively higher than that in the stream water indeed the 222rn activity in the drained groundwater collected around station n20 in february was 3 1 0 2 104 bq m 3 another reason for the high 222rn activities in november and february can be attributed to the water temperature the average of stream water temperature was 6 0 1 7 c and 7 8 1 4 c in february and november respectively while it was 15 5 1 8 c and 23 4 1 4 c in april and september respectively the high water temperature can also reduce the 222rn activities in the stream water by decreasing the water air partitioning coefficient of 222rn which is approximately 0 42 at 5 c and 0 22 at 25 c for freshwater schubert et al 2012 5 conclusions we measured radon isotopes 220rn and 222rn in the stream water and groundwater to identify and quantify groundwater inflow based on the 222rn mass balance considering all 222rn sources and sinks the groundwater inflow rates into ns and the stream water leakage were estimated the results from the 220rn survey along the stream suggest that groundwater may discharge to the stream water through point sources the 222rn mass balance method is advantageous because of its low cost high sensitivity and simplicity relative to the installation of groundwater wells however more intensive studies are necessary to reduce uncertainties associated with groundwater inflow rate in the 222rn mass balance by considering hyporheic exchanges and selecting a reasonable 222rn groundwater endmember furthermore a spatial 220rn survey can provide information on groundwater inflow types point or non point and be used to investigate large springs as groundwater resources in coastal zones our methods using both 222rn and 220rn can be applied to understand groundwater surface water interactions in various environments such as lakes wetlands and rivers in addition these methods are helpful in determining groundwater depletion problems in rural areas and the mechanisms of river water generation in mountainous areas credit authorship contribution statement yong hwa oh conceptualization investigation data curation methodology writing original

8283,study region guangdong province south china study focus with evident climate and land use changes concerns have arisen regarding the challenges for land and water management brought by alterations of the vegetation hydroclimate relationships here we characterized the relationships under contrasting dryness conditions in guangdong province of china during 2002 2015 based on multiple datasets with a focus on forests and crops to identify the controlling roles of water and energy in vegetation growth new hydrological insights an increasing trend of annual vegetation and water availability and diverse seasonal characteristics were revealed in dry and wet years gpp was higher while ndvi and wue were lower in dry years than wet years intra annual ndvi and gpp were positively and wue was negatively related to both water tws and energy etp ta and rs factors linear regression shows that the correlation between twsa and ndvi gpp was stronger than that between atmospheric factors and ndvi gpp at the annual scale while the impact of the atmospheric factors on ndvi gpp was stronger at the monthly scale that is water plays a dominant role in vegetation growth in the long term while energy is more important in the short term different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate may lie in the gpp estimation algorithms this study enhances our understanding of plant water energy interactions in the humid subtropical environment under contrasting dryness conditions keywords vegetation dynamics gross primary productivity total water storage climate change plant water relations subtropical ecohydrology 1 introduction the role of vegetation in land and water conservation and climate change impacts mitigation has been well recognized and the research on vegetation responses to hydrologic and climatic changes has drawn increasing attention bryan et al 2018 schwärzel et al 2020 due to its importance for the implementation and adjustment of ecological programs such as the grain for green project in china liang et al 2015 alteration of vegetation cover can result in changes in hydrologic regimes such as precipitation p and evapotranspiration et partitioning llorens and domingo 2007 xiao et al 2018 and river discharge variation brown et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 conversely changes in hydroclimate such as high low temperatures and rainwater deficit can trigger adaptive vegetation responses through physiological regulations on water and carbon exchanges klein 2015 mcdowell 2011 when water availability is significantly below normal levels and the supply cannot meet the demand over a certain period drought happens vicente serrano et al 2013 previous studies developed several indices to characterize drought such as the pdsi palmer drought severity index and its variants palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 and spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 apart from drought index aridity index ai as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration etp to p le houérou 1996 is also used to describe the regional dryness condition usually in a long term sohoulande djebou 2017 it should be noted that aridity characterizes the climate while drought refers to weather induced moisture deficiency however they both are essentially related to precipitation and temperature although the formulations are different for pdsi spei and ai they all incorporate p and etp one way or another to represent the relationship between water supply and demand moreover soil moisture and total water storage tws can effectively reflect the local dry wet condition regarding water supply and hence have also been used to assess impacts of water resources on vegetation krueger et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 although the aforementioned indices have their own forms and advantages disadvantages towards the description of water deficit condition of an area comparative studies showed that they are overall highly correlated and in many cases can give comparable patterns adnan et al 2018 jain et al 2015 yang et al 2017 water availability is one of the main drivers for variations in vegetation greenness inferred by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and production e g gross primary productivity gpp especially during severe droughts in the arid and semi arid areas ivits et al 2014 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however resistance and resilience of vegetation to water deficit is largely determined by plant physiological responses mcdowell et al 2008 yang et al 2016 and therefore the vulnerability of vegetation to drought varies greatly among plant types for example ivits et al 2014 found that the northern and mediterranean ecosystems in europe were more resilient to drought in terms of productivity while ecosystems in western atlantic regions and eastern europe could not buffer well the effects of drought yang et al 2016 reported that water use efficiency wue increased with drought in arid areas and decreased with drought in semi arid and semi humid areas zhang et al 2016 found that ndvi in tropical forests of southeast asia decreased with drought in dry seasons but it was insensitive to drought during wet seasons which is related to radiation availability many previous studies have revealed vegetation response to drought for different biomes over different climate and geographic zones and on different time scales the time scale related to drought analysis refers to the time period from the onset of drought to the presence of its consequences vicente serrano et al 2010 for instance zhang et al 2017a 2017b found high sensitivity of vegetation to drought existed on a short time scale 3 6 months over grassland and cropland and on a longer time scale over forests across china gouveia et al 2017 found that the time scales for the greatest impact of drought on vegetation increased from wet temperate oceanic to dry mediterranean dry and desertic zones although it is important to investigate the time scales on which the hydroclimate change would exert strongest impacts on later on vegetation growth it is equally important to characterize the concurrent vegetation hydroclimate relationships in the dry wet and average years and across different temporal scales e g monthly seasonal and annual in order to examine the possible controlling roles of water availability and water demand on vegetation growth and productivity from short to long terms deciphering these roles may assist forest management and planting structure optimization accordingly however such comparative studies are still limited in the literature despite that they are important for vegetation resilience assessment and conservation under a changing climate it is remarkably rich in literature regarding vegetation climate relationships in arid and semiarid regions whereas there is relatively less research in humid and semi humid areas where vegetation cover and annual p is usually high while the impacts of dry spells on vegetation may be pronounced during the growing seasons in the semiarid areas wang et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2019 they could be still persistent beyond growing seasons in the subtropical humid semi humid areas because the forested and cultivated lands that cover a large proportion of the land surfaces are constantly productive throughout the year gao et al 2008 wang et al 2020 as to influencing factors of vegetation change zhang et al 2017a 2017b analyzed spei and ndvi relationships and concluded that water availability is the determinant factor for vegetation change in both arid and humid regions in the long term and vegetation variations are not sensitive to changes in p and et in humid areas however radiative energy may boost plant water use between frequent and heavy rain events wang et al 2017 and thus exerts crucial effect on vegetation growth and productivity in a short term however the role of energy is insufficiently studied so far therefore a summary of the vegetation responses to hydroclimate change and investigation of the mechanisms is still largely expandable this study was carried out in guangdong province of the humid south china with the overall aim of examining the relationship between vegetation growth and hydroclimate conditions at different temporal scales the specific objectives are to 1 characterize the changes and variability of vegetation and hydroclimate in the recent decade 2 investigate the determinant role of water and energy in governing vegetation growth from monthly to seasonal and annual scales and 3 reveal the response of vegetation to hydroclimate change in dry and wet years compared to long term means results can extend our knowledge about how vegetation responds to a changing environment in the humid areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area guangdong is the most prosperous province in south china it has a tropical and subtropical monsoonal climate the mean annual temperature is 22 c mean sunshine duration is around 1745 h and mean annual precipitation is 1780 mm ranging from 1300 to 2600 mm previous analysis showed that precipitation was overall on the rise in the province especially in the pearl river delta fu et al 2016 yan et al 2020 while evapotranspiration decreased during 1980 2006 chen et al 2015 alongside the global warming tendency the province confronts with water shortages induced by population growth extreme weather and water contamination chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2011a 2011b elevated areas are in the northern hills with highest altitude over 1800 m a s l dominated by forest cover fig 1 the flat terrain is mainly occupied by croplands and urban areas based on a 30 m resolution land cover dataset li et al 2017 forests 59 4 croplands 23 8 and urban areas 12 4 cover 95 of the total provincial area and the rest is constituted of grassland shrubland water bodies etc we extracted only the data under coverage of forest and cropland to analyze the change and interactions between vegetation and hydroclimate data from the national bureau of statistics show that guangdong has the largest population compared to other regions in china but the food production is 3 of the national totals ranking the 3rd place in terms of the least food production per capita as reforestation has approached its steady state chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 agricultural development and its relationship with water resources is of strategic importance to support the populations and economy both in guangdong and the greater bay area particularly under the threat of repetitive dry spells ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 2 2 data sources and pre processing to analyze the vegetation hydroclimate relationships at different temporal scales we obtained the relevant data from multiple sources p was extracted from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and validated against the station based data from the china meteorological administration cma in the supplementary document figure s1 which shows that p from the two sources agree generally well over the entire study period and gldas underestimates p slightly obtained station based data also include air temperature ta and solar radiation rs which are also indicators of energy or water demand in addition to etp actual et was extracted from the gldas modis mu et al 2007 and pml zhang et al 2019 datasets etp was obtained from gldas and modis and also calculated based on weather station measurement using the penman monteith equation total water storage anomaly twsa was based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data tapley et al 2004 provided at the center for space research csr with mascon solutions release 6 ndvi was obtained from gimms3g based on the advanced very high resolution radiometer pinzon and tucker 2014 gross primary production gpp was from modis running et al 2004 vpm zhang et al 2017a 2017b and pml the products source links and original spatiotemporal resolutions were provided in table 1 all the data were prepared for 13 hydrological years during 04 2002 03 2015 with all variables available data were resampled to 0 25 using the nearest neighbor method and averaged aggregated to monthly to be consistent with the spatial and temporal resolutions of gracecsr for the variables obtained from multiple sources the ensemble means were used for further analysis to reduce the uncertainty in a single data source a comparison of et etp and gpp from different sources was given in the supplementary document figure s2 4 based on which et and gpp was calculated as the ensemble mean of values from three sources while etp based on station measurements was kept for analysis land cover data were also resampled using the nearest neighbor method and then the other data were extracted for forested and cultivated lands 2 3 data analysis it has been reported that the hydroclimate controls on vegetation can be different across temporal scales wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011a 2011b so we analyzed the annual and seasonal changes of both the vegetation and hydroclimate variables annual trends were analyzed using the mann kendall test method typical dry years were differentiated from the other years by examining the annual variability of p twsa etp and ai the difference of hydroclimate and vegetation variables between forests and crops and between dry and wet years was compared by their mean and median values and also tested using the nonparametric two sided wilcoxon rank sum test method gibbons and chakraborti 2011 the response of vegetation parameters ndvi gpp and wue equals to gpp divided by et to hydroclimate change was investigated using the pearson correlation analysis for forests and crops in both dry wet years and the entire study period for comparison of the relationships between dry and average years we also calculated the monthly climatological mean values of each variable and examined the linkage between deviations of the dry year means from the all year means by characterizing and comparing the responses of vegetation to the contrasting hydroclimate conditions we may determine the changes and restrictions of hydrologic and climatic changes and their impacts on vegetation dynamics which would be helpful in designing plans to mitigate future climate change impacts on water resources and ecosystems 3 results 3 1 temporal variations of vegetation and hydroclimate fig 2 shows that vegetation and hydroclimate data had very clear interannual fluctuations and presented alternate dry and wet cycles ndvi and gpp both showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 with the magnitude of 0 0038 per year and 12 66 gc m 2 per year over the province p and tws have also seen an increase of 12 75 and 4 85 mm yr 1 respectively together with a reduction in etp 0 96 mm yr 1 resulted from decreased ta and rs leading to an overall decreased aridity index therefore over the last 13 years water supply and demand have increased and decreased respectively in the entire guangdong meanwhile an increase in wue was observed over the entire province although not statistically significant and small in magnitudes noticeably wue over forests showed a decreasing trend in contrast to that over croplands and the increasing rate over crops was 10 5 times of the decreasing rate over forests the annual trend of ndvi gpp tws and ai for croplands was 16 2 17 4 4 4 and 17 6 higher than forests and the annual trend of p and ta for croplands was 18 3 and 73 1 lower than forests the largest difference between forest and cropland existed in annual trend of etp and rs with croplands having multifold greater reduction rate than forests with less increase in annual p and more decrease in etp croplands greenness and primary production have increased faster than forests which may reflect the result of ongoing intensified agricultural activities or a shift of planting structures in every season the vegetation parameters had significantly higher values for forests than crops based on the wilcoxon rank sum test but the hydroclimatic variables did not show such significant differences except ta in spring autumn and winter and etp rs in spring fig 3 ndvi and gpp was higher in summer and autumn than spring and winter consistent with hydroclimate variables while wue was higher in winter and autumn than summer and spring in comparison water deficit negative twsa most likely existed in spring and winter and water surplus positive twsa existed in summer and autumn moreover water availability over forest was higher than cropland in spring and summer but lower in autumn and winter while water demand factors were consistently lower in forests than croplands interestingly seasonal gpp followed both the water availability and demand variations whilst the change in ndvi occurred sometime later than the change in water availability and demand this infers different processes regarding the timing of vegetation leaf greening and biomass accumulation or that the algorithms of gpp may not precisely reflect vegetation photosynthetic process combining the annual dynamics of the hydroclimate data in fig 2 we identified the year when drought highly likely occurred i e 2003 2004 2007 and 2011 which is denoted as dry years hereafter the relatively wet years include 2002 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2013 fig 4 shows the comparisons of vegetation parameters and hydroclimate variables over forests and croplands between dry and wet years forests had consistently higher ndvi gpp and wue in general than crops as is also shown in fig 2 at the annual scale the median and mean ndvi and wue was slightly lower not statistically significant in dry years than in wet years for both forests and crops sharing the same characteristics with twsa and ta this is contrary to gpp which was higher in dry years than wet years coincident with etp and rs 3 2 influence of hydroclimate on vegetation at different temporal scales pearson correlation analysis table 2 shows that only the relationship between annual twsa and ndvi was statistically significant with a correlation coefficient r of 0 64 p 0 018 higher than that between ndvi and p r 0 45 p 0 125 and ndvi and ai r 0 42 p 0 157 as well as other demand factors stronger correlation was also found between annual gpp and twsa r 0 32 p 0 280 than other hydroclimate factors in contrast the monthly ndvi gpp and wue were all significantly related with hydroclimate variables except for ndvi p r 0 06 p 0 459 and all variables investigated had a stronger impact on gpp than ndvi the relatively weak synchrony between vegetation and hydroclimate variables fig 5 can be attributed to the non linearity and phase lag effect between them largest lag existed between p and ndvi for 3 months in comparison to 1 month between twsa and ndvi and 2 months between etp as well as ta and rs and ndvi it is observed that gpp was more synchronized with hydroclimate variables than ndvi the lag between p and gpp was 1 month while between twsa etp and gpp was 0 month the lag could accumulate through time to have influenced the hydroclimate ndvi relationships at the annual seasonal scale fig 3 fig 6 shows that more water deficit and higher water demand existed in dry years than in wet years it also shows that changes of ndvi did not completely synchronize with the variations of hydroclimate variables for instance ndvi peaked in autumn later than twsa peak in summer this infers that water deficit will not necessarily restrain vegetation growth because the time when the water deficit occurs also matters moreover ndvi gpp and wue responded differently to water availability in a way that increase in water availability benefited plant greening and production but suppressed water use efficiency in addition to twsa vegetation parameters were also significantly corelated with energy factors seasonally fig 6 linear regression showed a generally greater r 2 between energy factors than twsa for ndvi rs and twsa were two more influential factors while for gpp and wue the three energy factors were more influential than water moreover it is found that the intra seasonal relationships between ndvi gpp and twsa show some different features from the inter seasonal relationships for instance gpp increased with twsa inter seasonally following the regression line but clearly decreased with twsa in summer and autumn ndvi also increased inter seasonally with twsa but decreased with twsa in spring and summer generally higher seasonal ndvi gpp and wue in dry years than in wet years fig 6 may imply that vegetation growth is not primarily limited by water resources but rather the radiative energy these present the diversity in vegetation hydroclimate relationships across temporal scales furthermore to investigate the effect of mean hydroclimate conditions on vegetation we calculated the difference of monthly climatological means between dry years and all years δndvi δgpp δwue δtwsa δetp δta and δrs and compared their relationships between forests and crops fig 7 deviations of ndvi gpp and wue of dry years from the all year means were more sensitive to the deviations of energy factors than water δgpp and δwue were significantly and positively related to all energy factors p 0 05 while δndvi was only significantly related to δetp and δrs when there is more water deficit in a month relative to the average condition ndvi and gpp will be lower than the averages and water use efficiency will be improved the relationships imply that water deficit did not always result in deteriorated vegetation greenness but only if the absolute value of δtwsa was greater than 14 mm month 1 based on the linear regressions would vegetation greenness be restricted under such dry conditions the threshold of δtwsa for δwue sign change was about 40 mm month 1 4 discussion 4 1 changes in hydroclimate and vegetation in guangdong during the study period both the precipitation and water storage showed an increasing trend specifically annual p increased by 14 1 and 11 5 mm yr 1 p 0 05 tws increased by 4 8 and 5 0 mm yr 1 p 0 05 over forests and crops respectively annual precipitation increase has been found in several studies in guangdong using both remote sensing data and station data chen et al 2015 shen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 but the increase was not statistically significant as also shown in this study total water storage change based on the grace data with the same high resolution has not yet been reported specifically in guangdong province while many studies in the pearl river basin reported that the water storage was on the rise at a rate of 5 5 6 3 mm yr 1 varying with the study period long et al 2017 luo et al 2016 mo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and the increase was particularly prominent in the middle to east part of the basin where most of guangdong province 70 of total basin area is enclosed increased p and decreased etp induced by reduced air temperature and solar radiation have resulted in reduction in aridity in the province recently duan et al 2020 has pointed out that in addition to radiation and temperature terrestrial stilling related to wind speed is also an nonnegligible factor contributing to reduced aridity in the pearl river basin nevertheless guangdong has overall experienced hydrologic wetting in terms of precipitation and water storage regardless of land cover types which is consistent with other studies mo et al 2016 yan et al 2020 apart from hydroclimate variables the vegetation parameters also showed increasing trends particularly significant for the greenness and production and the increase rate was higher over crops than forests zhou et al 2010 and chen et al 2015 found that the forest cover in guangdong province has increased rapidly since the late 1980s reached a relatively steady state around early 2000s and increased very slowly since then using the modis land cover data during 2001 2013 wu et al 2019 reported that conversion of grassland and cropland to forest led to increased ndvi in guangdong using only the recent land cover data this study cannot detect the contribution of land cover type conversion to ndvi change however we observed significant increase of ndvi over both forests and crops different from wu et al 2019 who detected no significant changing trends this can be resulted from markedly contrasting spatial resolutions of the ndvi and land cover datasets in their study 0 5 km and this one 0 25 or 25 km enhanced ndvi and gpp implies intensifying agricultural activities and possible shifts of planting structures for instance from rice in the paddy fields to vegetables and fruits in the relatively dry lands liu et al 2016 which is expected to increase ndvi greatly over these areas alongside improvement of water use efficiency of crops was found to be 10 times that of forests during the study period martínez vilalta et al 2007 and skubel et al 2015 found that water use efficiency decreased with tree age because old growth trees can maintain a relative high transpiration rate as they age in particular during drought events which leads to a lower wue relative to young trees this may help explain the higher wue of crops than forests if assuming their findings can be extrapolated to a broader range of plant types as crops are generally younger than forests nevertheless based on the changing trends of both water supply and demand factors and vegetation establishment the flood control measures involving vegetation terêncio et al 2019 are suggested to be implemented in the future 4 2 diverse effects of hydroclimate on vegetation growth across scales vegetation greenness and productivity are found to respond differently to water supply and demand from short to long terms at the annual scale the impacts of p and tws on ndvi and gpp were positive and strong table 2 and the dependence on tws is stronger than that on p that is water storage is a more important water resource to support vegetation growth meanwhile the relationships between both ndvi and gpp and water demand factors were weaker compared to water availability therefore vegetation in this humid subtropical area is mainly constrained by water availability in the long term however at the monthly and seasonal scales ndvi was negatively associated with p the negative relationship was also reported elsewhere linscheid et al 2020 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2018 this implies that vegetation growth is not completely limited by water supply but also by other factors like radiation table 2 in the short term similar to the findings in a humid boreal oceanic forest wang et al 2017 the climate regime that precipitation in guangdong falls in large amounts and at high frequency in the monsoon seasons but less so beyond could be responsible for the alternate water and energy controls on vegetation within a year because in the monsoon seasons the frequent cloudy conditions will effectively reduce the available light that plants are exposed to which carries radiative energy for the photosynthesis and transpiration processes this differs from vegetation water relations in the water limited areas hawinkel et al 2016 zeppel et al 2008 where the water deficit is substantial because of low precipitation and high evaporative demand even in the rainy seasons the diverse responses of vegetation to hydroclimate are usually species specific due mainly to the different sensitivity of vegetation to environmental changes mediated by stomates openness under stress aranda et al 2012 martin stpaul et al 2017 the relationships revealed in this study based on a lumped forest crop land cover type cannot reflect the plant water interactions on a specific species or ecosystem level but rather the overall superior adaptive role of dominant ecosystems even so a characteristic of the plant water relations was found common across species that is the lag between hydroclimate and ndvi studies have revealed that precipitation and temperature in 1 3 months prior to the major phenological phases e g leaf green up and senescence has a decisive role in vegetation growth piao et al 2006 wang et al 2019 the lag time between p and ndvi is 3 months in this study and that between tws and ndvi is 1 month regardless of land cover types in this sense water storage is a more readily available water resource than precipitation to meet the plant need this is consistent with the findings by méndez barroso et al 2009 in the mexican region under north american monsoon climate meanwhile p and tws in 1 and 0 month in advance showed the strongest impacts on gpp change the difference in lag times between vegetation parameters and p from that between vegetation parameters and tws can be partly attributed to the 1 month lag of twsa after p additionally we found that there is a time lag between monthly ndvi and gpp series fig 5 although theoretically they should change synchronically as they both reflect vegetation phenological development this lag is believed to result from the gpp algorithms that is gpp is calculated as a function of atmospheric variables including temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation pei et al 2020 hence because of the asynchrony in the atmospheric variables and ndvi piao et al 2006 and fig 5 the gpp and ndvi have some inconsistency in time which led to different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate conditions the inconsistency of ndvi and gpp also explains why the lag time between gpp and hydroclimate was shorter than that between ndvi and hydroclimate furthermore this may indicate that gpp algorithms should be improved for instance by increasing the weight of soil water content constraints and considering the asynchrony between gpp and hydroclimate dynamics as a result more caution should be given when choosing parameter ndvi or gpp to better represent vegetation growing status which is still lack in literature for discussion during the growth period vegetation can experience many dry and wet cycles instead of focusing solely on the impact of drought events investigation of the relationships between vegetation and dry wet cycles may be equally informative for understanding the adaptive changes of vegetation for example thapa et al 2016 proposed an adaptive cycle model to describe the response of vegetation to water availability in floodplains during the wetting wet drying dry hydrologic phases by tracking the loops of vegetation productivity and hydrologic phase changes one may find a threshold or tipping point at which ecosystem is most unstable and tends to establish a new state this study compared the relationships of vegetation and hydroclimate in dry years relative to the long term climatological means rather than dry and wet fluctuations in a year results in fig 7 give an approximate water deficit threshold for forests and crops to respond to dry conditions specifically in a year when the mean monthly water deficit inferred by δtwsa is lower than 14 mm compared to the monthly climatological mean forest ndvi in this dry year would be higher relative the long term mean the water deficit threshold for forest wue is around 45 mm month 1 threshold for crops is slightly higher than forests which indicates a stronger resilience of crops to dry conditions and this is probably due to timely irrigation when under stress for food production and security the relationships here confirm again that the presence of water deficit induced by less p and more etp during dry periods can promote vegetation growth in this specific subtropical humid region furthermore slightly different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate variables may indicate that these two quantities have their own unique features to reflect vegetation status although they both are widely used as indicators of vegetation phenology their similarities and differences are yet to be discussed in a deeper way in responses to climatic and hydrologic changes 5 conclusions we analyzed the vegetation hydroclimate relationships in guangdong province of china and found diverse characteristics across monthly seasonal to annual scales the results indicate that water is the primary factor influencing vegetation growth at the annual scale and water storage is a more readily available resource to plants than precipitation however the monthly and seasonal vegetation index and water use efficiency decreases while gross primary productivity increases with reduced water deficit moreover vegetation responds to hydroclimate change differently in dry and wet years because of the differences in water and energy loadings these results indicate that forests and crops in this region are restrained alternately by the available energy and water resources throughout a year and they benefit from the drying conditions in terms of biomass production in addition the current gpp estimation algorithms may not reflect photosynthetic process properly because they rely very much on the atmospheric variables while soil water content is rarely accounted for understanding the responses of vegetation to hydroclimate can help improve the mitigation of future climate change through ecohydrological programs and the cross scale relationships

8283,study region guangdong province south china study focus with evident climate and land use changes concerns have arisen regarding the challenges for land and water management brought by alterations of the vegetation hydroclimate relationships here we characterized the relationships under contrasting dryness conditions in guangdong province of china during 2002 2015 based on multiple datasets with a focus on forests and crops to identify the controlling roles of water and energy in vegetation growth new hydrological insights an increasing trend of annual vegetation and water availability and diverse seasonal characteristics were revealed in dry and wet years gpp was higher while ndvi and wue were lower in dry years than wet years intra annual ndvi and gpp were positively and wue was negatively related to both water tws and energy etp ta and rs factors linear regression shows that the correlation between twsa and ndvi gpp was stronger than that between atmospheric factors and ndvi gpp at the annual scale while the impact of the atmospheric factors on ndvi gpp was stronger at the monthly scale that is water plays a dominant role in vegetation growth in the long term while energy is more important in the short term different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate may lie in the gpp estimation algorithms this study enhances our understanding of plant water energy interactions in the humid subtropical environment under contrasting dryness conditions keywords vegetation dynamics gross primary productivity total water storage climate change plant water relations subtropical ecohydrology 1 introduction the role of vegetation in land and water conservation and climate change impacts mitigation has been well recognized and the research on vegetation responses to hydrologic and climatic changes has drawn increasing attention bryan et al 2018 schwärzel et al 2020 due to its importance for the implementation and adjustment of ecological programs such as the grain for green project in china liang et al 2015 alteration of vegetation cover can result in changes in hydrologic regimes such as precipitation p and evapotranspiration et partitioning llorens and domingo 2007 xiao et al 2018 and river discharge variation brown et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 conversely changes in hydroclimate such as high low temperatures and rainwater deficit can trigger adaptive vegetation responses through physiological regulations on water and carbon exchanges klein 2015 mcdowell 2011 when water availability is significantly below normal levels and the supply cannot meet the demand over a certain period drought happens vicente serrano et al 2013 previous studies developed several indices to characterize drought such as the pdsi palmer drought severity index and its variants palmer 1965 wells et al 2004 spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 and spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 apart from drought index aridity index ai as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration etp to p le houérou 1996 is also used to describe the regional dryness condition usually in a long term sohoulande djebou 2017 it should be noted that aridity characterizes the climate while drought refers to weather induced moisture deficiency however they both are essentially related to precipitation and temperature although the formulations are different for pdsi spei and ai they all incorporate p and etp one way or another to represent the relationship between water supply and demand moreover soil moisture and total water storage tws can effectively reflect the local dry wet condition regarding water supply and hence have also been used to assess impacts of water resources on vegetation krueger et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 although the aforementioned indices have their own forms and advantages disadvantages towards the description of water deficit condition of an area comparative studies showed that they are overall highly correlated and in many cases can give comparable patterns adnan et al 2018 jain et al 2015 yang et al 2017 water availability is one of the main drivers for variations in vegetation greenness inferred by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and production e g gross primary productivity gpp especially during severe droughts in the arid and semi arid areas ivits et al 2014 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however resistance and resilience of vegetation to water deficit is largely determined by plant physiological responses mcdowell et al 2008 yang et al 2016 and therefore the vulnerability of vegetation to drought varies greatly among plant types for example ivits et al 2014 found that the northern and mediterranean ecosystems in europe were more resilient to drought in terms of productivity while ecosystems in western atlantic regions and eastern europe could not buffer well the effects of drought yang et al 2016 reported that water use efficiency wue increased with drought in arid areas and decreased with drought in semi arid and semi humid areas zhang et al 2016 found that ndvi in tropical forests of southeast asia decreased with drought in dry seasons but it was insensitive to drought during wet seasons which is related to radiation availability many previous studies have revealed vegetation response to drought for different biomes over different climate and geographic zones and on different time scales the time scale related to drought analysis refers to the time period from the onset of drought to the presence of its consequences vicente serrano et al 2010 for instance zhang et al 2017a 2017b found high sensitivity of vegetation to drought existed on a short time scale 3 6 months over grassland and cropland and on a longer time scale over forests across china gouveia et al 2017 found that the time scales for the greatest impact of drought on vegetation increased from wet temperate oceanic to dry mediterranean dry and desertic zones although it is important to investigate the time scales on which the hydroclimate change would exert strongest impacts on later on vegetation growth it is equally important to characterize the concurrent vegetation hydroclimate relationships in the dry wet and average years and across different temporal scales e g monthly seasonal and annual in order to examine the possible controlling roles of water availability and water demand on vegetation growth and productivity from short to long terms deciphering these roles may assist forest management and planting structure optimization accordingly however such comparative studies are still limited in the literature despite that they are important for vegetation resilience assessment and conservation under a changing climate it is remarkably rich in literature regarding vegetation climate relationships in arid and semiarid regions whereas there is relatively less research in humid and semi humid areas where vegetation cover and annual p is usually high while the impacts of dry spells on vegetation may be pronounced during the growing seasons in the semiarid areas wang et al 2015 zhang and zhang 2019 they could be still persistent beyond growing seasons in the subtropical humid semi humid areas because the forested and cultivated lands that cover a large proportion of the land surfaces are constantly productive throughout the year gao et al 2008 wang et al 2020 as to influencing factors of vegetation change zhang et al 2017a 2017b analyzed spei and ndvi relationships and concluded that water availability is the determinant factor for vegetation change in both arid and humid regions in the long term and vegetation variations are not sensitive to changes in p and et in humid areas however radiative energy may boost plant water use between frequent and heavy rain events wang et al 2017 and thus exerts crucial effect on vegetation growth and productivity in a short term however the role of energy is insufficiently studied so far therefore a summary of the vegetation responses to hydroclimate change and investigation of the mechanisms is still largely expandable this study was carried out in guangdong province of the humid south china with the overall aim of examining the relationship between vegetation growth and hydroclimate conditions at different temporal scales the specific objectives are to 1 characterize the changes and variability of vegetation and hydroclimate in the recent decade 2 investigate the determinant role of water and energy in governing vegetation growth from monthly to seasonal and annual scales and 3 reveal the response of vegetation to hydroclimate change in dry and wet years compared to long term means results can extend our knowledge about how vegetation responds to a changing environment in the humid areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area guangdong is the most prosperous province in south china it has a tropical and subtropical monsoonal climate the mean annual temperature is 22 c mean sunshine duration is around 1745 h and mean annual precipitation is 1780 mm ranging from 1300 to 2600 mm previous analysis showed that precipitation was overall on the rise in the province especially in the pearl river delta fu et al 2016 yan et al 2020 while evapotranspiration decreased during 1980 2006 chen et al 2015 alongside the global warming tendency the province confronts with water shortages induced by population growth extreme weather and water contamination chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2011a 2011b elevated areas are in the northern hills with highest altitude over 1800 m a s l dominated by forest cover fig 1 the flat terrain is mainly occupied by croplands and urban areas based on a 30 m resolution land cover dataset li et al 2017 forests 59 4 croplands 23 8 and urban areas 12 4 cover 95 of the total provincial area and the rest is constituted of grassland shrubland water bodies etc we extracted only the data under coverage of forest and cropland to analyze the change and interactions between vegetation and hydroclimate data from the national bureau of statistics show that guangdong has the largest population compared to other regions in china but the food production is 3 of the national totals ranking the 3rd place in terms of the least food production per capita as reforestation has approached its steady state chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 agricultural development and its relationship with water resources is of strategic importance to support the populations and economy both in guangdong and the greater bay area particularly under the threat of repetitive dry spells ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 2 2 data sources and pre processing to analyze the vegetation hydroclimate relationships at different temporal scales we obtained the relevant data from multiple sources p was extracted from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and validated against the station based data from the china meteorological administration cma in the supplementary document figure s1 which shows that p from the two sources agree generally well over the entire study period and gldas underestimates p slightly obtained station based data also include air temperature ta and solar radiation rs which are also indicators of energy or water demand in addition to etp actual et was extracted from the gldas modis mu et al 2007 and pml zhang et al 2019 datasets etp was obtained from gldas and modis and also calculated based on weather station measurement using the penman monteith equation total water storage anomaly twsa was based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data tapley et al 2004 provided at the center for space research csr with mascon solutions release 6 ndvi was obtained from gimms3g based on the advanced very high resolution radiometer pinzon and tucker 2014 gross primary production gpp was from modis running et al 2004 vpm zhang et al 2017a 2017b and pml the products source links and original spatiotemporal resolutions were provided in table 1 all the data were prepared for 13 hydrological years during 04 2002 03 2015 with all variables available data were resampled to 0 25 using the nearest neighbor method and averaged aggregated to monthly to be consistent with the spatial and temporal resolutions of gracecsr for the variables obtained from multiple sources the ensemble means were used for further analysis to reduce the uncertainty in a single data source a comparison of et etp and gpp from different sources was given in the supplementary document figure s2 4 based on which et and gpp was calculated as the ensemble mean of values from three sources while etp based on station measurements was kept for analysis land cover data were also resampled using the nearest neighbor method and then the other data were extracted for forested and cultivated lands 2 3 data analysis it has been reported that the hydroclimate controls on vegetation can be different across temporal scales wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011a 2011b so we analyzed the annual and seasonal changes of both the vegetation and hydroclimate variables annual trends were analyzed using the mann kendall test method typical dry years were differentiated from the other years by examining the annual variability of p twsa etp and ai the difference of hydroclimate and vegetation variables between forests and crops and between dry and wet years was compared by their mean and median values and also tested using the nonparametric two sided wilcoxon rank sum test method gibbons and chakraborti 2011 the response of vegetation parameters ndvi gpp and wue equals to gpp divided by et to hydroclimate change was investigated using the pearson correlation analysis for forests and crops in both dry wet years and the entire study period for comparison of the relationships between dry and average years we also calculated the monthly climatological mean values of each variable and examined the linkage between deviations of the dry year means from the all year means by characterizing and comparing the responses of vegetation to the contrasting hydroclimate conditions we may determine the changes and restrictions of hydrologic and climatic changes and their impacts on vegetation dynamics which would be helpful in designing plans to mitigate future climate change impacts on water resources and ecosystems 3 results 3 1 temporal variations of vegetation and hydroclimate fig 2 shows that vegetation and hydroclimate data had very clear interannual fluctuations and presented alternate dry and wet cycles ndvi and gpp both showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 with the magnitude of 0 0038 per year and 12 66 gc m 2 per year over the province p and tws have also seen an increase of 12 75 and 4 85 mm yr 1 respectively together with a reduction in etp 0 96 mm yr 1 resulted from decreased ta and rs leading to an overall decreased aridity index therefore over the last 13 years water supply and demand have increased and decreased respectively in the entire guangdong meanwhile an increase in wue was observed over the entire province although not statistically significant and small in magnitudes noticeably wue over forests showed a decreasing trend in contrast to that over croplands and the increasing rate over crops was 10 5 times of the decreasing rate over forests the annual trend of ndvi gpp tws and ai for croplands was 16 2 17 4 4 4 and 17 6 higher than forests and the annual trend of p and ta for croplands was 18 3 and 73 1 lower than forests the largest difference between forest and cropland existed in annual trend of etp and rs with croplands having multifold greater reduction rate than forests with less increase in annual p and more decrease in etp croplands greenness and primary production have increased faster than forests which may reflect the result of ongoing intensified agricultural activities or a shift of planting structures in every season the vegetation parameters had significantly higher values for forests than crops based on the wilcoxon rank sum test but the hydroclimatic variables did not show such significant differences except ta in spring autumn and winter and etp rs in spring fig 3 ndvi and gpp was higher in summer and autumn than spring and winter consistent with hydroclimate variables while wue was higher in winter and autumn than summer and spring in comparison water deficit negative twsa most likely existed in spring and winter and water surplus positive twsa existed in summer and autumn moreover water availability over forest was higher than cropland in spring and summer but lower in autumn and winter while water demand factors were consistently lower in forests than croplands interestingly seasonal gpp followed both the water availability and demand variations whilst the change in ndvi occurred sometime later than the change in water availability and demand this infers different processes regarding the timing of vegetation leaf greening and biomass accumulation or that the algorithms of gpp may not precisely reflect vegetation photosynthetic process combining the annual dynamics of the hydroclimate data in fig 2 we identified the year when drought highly likely occurred i e 2003 2004 2007 and 2011 which is denoted as dry years hereafter the relatively wet years include 2002 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2013 fig 4 shows the comparisons of vegetation parameters and hydroclimate variables over forests and croplands between dry and wet years forests had consistently higher ndvi gpp and wue in general than crops as is also shown in fig 2 at the annual scale the median and mean ndvi and wue was slightly lower not statistically significant in dry years than in wet years for both forests and crops sharing the same characteristics with twsa and ta this is contrary to gpp which was higher in dry years than wet years coincident with etp and rs 3 2 influence of hydroclimate on vegetation at different temporal scales pearson correlation analysis table 2 shows that only the relationship between annual twsa and ndvi was statistically significant with a correlation coefficient r of 0 64 p 0 018 higher than that between ndvi and p r 0 45 p 0 125 and ndvi and ai r 0 42 p 0 157 as well as other demand factors stronger correlation was also found between annual gpp and twsa r 0 32 p 0 280 than other hydroclimate factors in contrast the monthly ndvi gpp and wue were all significantly related with hydroclimate variables except for ndvi p r 0 06 p 0 459 and all variables investigated had a stronger impact on gpp than ndvi the relatively weak synchrony between vegetation and hydroclimate variables fig 5 can be attributed to the non linearity and phase lag effect between them largest lag existed between p and ndvi for 3 months in comparison to 1 month between twsa and ndvi and 2 months between etp as well as ta and rs and ndvi it is observed that gpp was more synchronized with hydroclimate variables than ndvi the lag between p and gpp was 1 month while between twsa etp and gpp was 0 month the lag could accumulate through time to have influenced the hydroclimate ndvi relationships at the annual seasonal scale fig 3 fig 6 shows that more water deficit and higher water demand existed in dry years than in wet years it also shows that changes of ndvi did not completely synchronize with the variations of hydroclimate variables for instance ndvi peaked in autumn later than twsa peak in summer this infers that water deficit will not necessarily restrain vegetation growth because the time when the water deficit occurs also matters moreover ndvi gpp and wue responded differently to water availability in a way that increase in water availability benefited plant greening and production but suppressed water use efficiency in addition to twsa vegetation parameters were also significantly corelated with energy factors seasonally fig 6 linear regression showed a generally greater r 2 between energy factors than twsa for ndvi rs and twsa were two more influential factors while for gpp and wue the three energy factors were more influential than water moreover it is found that the intra seasonal relationships between ndvi gpp and twsa show some different features from the inter seasonal relationships for instance gpp increased with twsa inter seasonally following the regression line but clearly decreased with twsa in summer and autumn ndvi also increased inter seasonally with twsa but decreased with twsa in spring and summer generally higher seasonal ndvi gpp and wue in dry years than in wet years fig 6 may imply that vegetation growth is not primarily limited by water resources but rather the radiative energy these present the diversity in vegetation hydroclimate relationships across temporal scales furthermore to investigate the effect of mean hydroclimate conditions on vegetation we calculated the difference of monthly climatological means between dry years and all years δndvi δgpp δwue δtwsa δetp δta and δrs and compared their relationships between forests and crops fig 7 deviations of ndvi gpp and wue of dry years from the all year means were more sensitive to the deviations of energy factors than water δgpp and δwue were significantly and positively related to all energy factors p 0 05 while δndvi was only significantly related to δetp and δrs when there is more water deficit in a month relative to the average condition ndvi and gpp will be lower than the averages and water use efficiency will be improved the relationships imply that water deficit did not always result in deteriorated vegetation greenness but only if the absolute value of δtwsa was greater than 14 mm month 1 based on the linear regressions would vegetation greenness be restricted under such dry conditions the threshold of δtwsa for δwue sign change was about 40 mm month 1 4 discussion 4 1 changes in hydroclimate and vegetation in guangdong during the study period both the precipitation and water storage showed an increasing trend specifically annual p increased by 14 1 and 11 5 mm yr 1 p 0 05 tws increased by 4 8 and 5 0 mm yr 1 p 0 05 over forests and crops respectively annual precipitation increase has been found in several studies in guangdong using both remote sensing data and station data chen et al 2015 shen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 but the increase was not statistically significant as also shown in this study total water storage change based on the grace data with the same high resolution has not yet been reported specifically in guangdong province while many studies in the pearl river basin reported that the water storage was on the rise at a rate of 5 5 6 3 mm yr 1 varying with the study period long et al 2017 luo et al 2016 mo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and the increase was particularly prominent in the middle to east part of the basin where most of guangdong province 70 of total basin area is enclosed increased p and decreased etp induced by reduced air temperature and solar radiation have resulted in reduction in aridity in the province recently duan et al 2020 has pointed out that in addition to radiation and temperature terrestrial stilling related to wind speed is also an nonnegligible factor contributing to reduced aridity in the pearl river basin nevertheless guangdong has overall experienced hydrologic wetting in terms of precipitation and water storage regardless of land cover types which is consistent with other studies mo et al 2016 yan et al 2020 apart from hydroclimate variables the vegetation parameters also showed increasing trends particularly significant for the greenness and production and the increase rate was higher over crops than forests zhou et al 2010 and chen et al 2015 found that the forest cover in guangdong province has increased rapidly since the late 1980s reached a relatively steady state around early 2000s and increased very slowly since then using the modis land cover data during 2001 2013 wu et al 2019 reported that conversion of grassland and cropland to forest led to increased ndvi in guangdong using only the recent land cover data this study cannot detect the contribution of land cover type conversion to ndvi change however we observed significant increase of ndvi over both forests and crops different from wu et al 2019 who detected no significant changing trends this can be resulted from markedly contrasting spatial resolutions of the ndvi and land cover datasets in their study 0 5 km and this one 0 25 or 25 km enhanced ndvi and gpp implies intensifying agricultural activities and possible shifts of planting structures for instance from rice in the paddy fields to vegetables and fruits in the relatively dry lands liu et al 2016 which is expected to increase ndvi greatly over these areas alongside improvement of water use efficiency of crops was found to be 10 times that of forests during the study period martínez vilalta et al 2007 and skubel et al 2015 found that water use efficiency decreased with tree age because old growth trees can maintain a relative high transpiration rate as they age in particular during drought events which leads to a lower wue relative to young trees this may help explain the higher wue of crops than forests if assuming their findings can be extrapolated to a broader range of plant types as crops are generally younger than forests nevertheless based on the changing trends of both water supply and demand factors and vegetation establishment the flood control measures involving vegetation terêncio et al 2019 are suggested to be implemented in the future 4 2 diverse effects of hydroclimate on vegetation growth across scales vegetation greenness and productivity are found to respond differently to water supply and demand from short to long terms at the annual scale the impacts of p and tws on ndvi and gpp were positive and strong table 2 and the dependence on tws is stronger than that on p that is water storage is a more important water resource to support vegetation growth meanwhile the relationships between both ndvi and gpp and water demand factors were weaker compared to water availability therefore vegetation in this humid subtropical area is mainly constrained by water availability in the long term however at the monthly and seasonal scales ndvi was negatively associated with p the negative relationship was also reported elsewhere linscheid et al 2020 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2018 this implies that vegetation growth is not completely limited by water supply but also by other factors like radiation table 2 in the short term similar to the findings in a humid boreal oceanic forest wang et al 2017 the climate regime that precipitation in guangdong falls in large amounts and at high frequency in the monsoon seasons but less so beyond could be responsible for the alternate water and energy controls on vegetation within a year because in the monsoon seasons the frequent cloudy conditions will effectively reduce the available light that plants are exposed to which carries radiative energy for the photosynthesis and transpiration processes this differs from vegetation water relations in the water limited areas hawinkel et al 2016 zeppel et al 2008 where the water deficit is substantial because of low precipitation and high evaporative demand even in the rainy seasons the diverse responses of vegetation to hydroclimate are usually species specific due mainly to the different sensitivity of vegetation to environmental changes mediated by stomates openness under stress aranda et al 2012 martin stpaul et al 2017 the relationships revealed in this study based on a lumped forest crop land cover type cannot reflect the plant water interactions on a specific species or ecosystem level but rather the overall superior adaptive role of dominant ecosystems even so a characteristic of the plant water relations was found common across species that is the lag between hydroclimate and ndvi studies have revealed that precipitation and temperature in 1 3 months prior to the major phenological phases e g leaf green up and senescence has a decisive role in vegetation growth piao et al 2006 wang et al 2019 the lag time between p and ndvi is 3 months in this study and that between tws and ndvi is 1 month regardless of land cover types in this sense water storage is a more readily available water resource than precipitation to meet the plant need this is consistent with the findings by méndez barroso et al 2009 in the mexican region under north american monsoon climate meanwhile p and tws in 1 and 0 month in advance showed the strongest impacts on gpp change the difference in lag times between vegetation parameters and p from that between vegetation parameters and tws can be partly attributed to the 1 month lag of twsa after p additionally we found that there is a time lag between monthly ndvi and gpp series fig 5 although theoretically they should change synchronically as they both reflect vegetation phenological development this lag is believed to result from the gpp algorithms that is gpp is calculated as a function of atmospheric variables including temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation pei et al 2020 hence because of the asynchrony in the atmospheric variables and ndvi piao et al 2006 and fig 5 the gpp and ndvi have some inconsistency in time which led to different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate conditions the inconsistency of ndvi and gpp also explains why the lag time between gpp and hydroclimate was shorter than that between ndvi and hydroclimate furthermore this may indicate that gpp algorithms should be improved for instance by increasing the weight of soil water content constraints and considering the asynchrony between gpp and hydroclimate dynamics as a result more caution should be given when choosing parameter ndvi or gpp to better represent vegetation growing status which is still lack in literature for discussion during the growth period vegetation can experience many dry and wet cycles instead of focusing solely on the impact of drought events investigation of the relationships between vegetation and dry wet cycles may be equally informative for understanding the adaptive changes of vegetation for example thapa et al 2016 proposed an adaptive cycle model to describe the response of vegetation to water availability in floodplains during the wetting wet drying dry hydrologic phases by tracking the loops of vegetation productivity and hydrologic phase changes one may find a threshold or tipping point at which ecosystem is most unstable and tends to establish a new state this study compared the relationships of vegetation and hydroclimate in dry years relative to the long term climatological means rather than dry and wet fluctuations in a year results in fig 7 give an approximate water deficit threshold for forests and crops to respond to dry conditions specifically in a year when the mean monthly water deficit inferred by δtwsa is lower than 14 mm compared to the monthly climatological mean forest ndvi in this dry year would be higher relative the long term mean the water deficit threshold for forest wue is around 45 mm month 1 threshold for crops is slightly higher than forests which indicates a stronger resilience of crops to dry conditions and this is probably due to timely irrigation when under stress for food production and security the relationships here confirm again that the presence of water deficit induced by less p and more etp during dry periods can promote vegetation growth in this specific subtropical humid region furthermore slightly different responses of ndvi and gpp to hydroclimate variables may indicate that these two quantities have their own unique features to reflect vegetation status although they both are widely used as indicators of vegetation phenology their similarities and differences are yet to be discussed in a deeper way in responses to climatic and hydrologic changes 5 conclusions we analyzed the vegetation hydroclimate relationships in guangdong province of china and found diverse characteristics across monthly seasonal to annual scales the results indicate that water is the primary factor influencing vegetation growth at the annual scale and water storage is a more readily available resource to plants than precipitation however the monthly and seasonal vegetation index and water use efficiency decreases while gross primary productivity increases with reduced water deficit moreover vegetation responds to hydroclimate change differently in dry and wet years because of the differences in water and energy loadings these results indicate that forests and crops in this region are restrained alternately by the available energy and water resources throughout a year and they benefit from the drying conditions in terms of biomass production in addition the current gpp estimation algorithms may not reflect photosynthetic process properly because they rely very much on the atmospheric variables while soil water content is rarely accounted for understanding the responses of vegetation to hydroclimate can help improve the mitigation of future climate change through ecohydrological programs and the cross scale relationships

evapotranspiration et and compare with five reference evapotranspiration eto estimation models of fao56 penman monteith modified penman thornthwaite blaney criddle and hargreaves under poly covered

empirical et models canopy cover was the driving force responsible for the reduced pan evaporation within the crop canopy temperature and relative humidity are the driving forces controlling

keywords evapotranspiration small pan evaporimeter open field controlled environment hydrologic studies 1 introduction water is becoming an economic scarce resource in many areas of the world agriculture is the largest consumer of global freshwater accounting for around 70 of withdrawals as irrigation wwap 2009 increasing the efficiency of water use within agriculture systems is important in order to ensure a balance for agricultural production municipal and industrial purposes and ecosystem function jacobsen et al 2012 and an estimate of evapotranspiration provides an outlook of soil water balance in association with the amount of precipitation and irrigation such estimates have been described as a vital component for determining water requirement of field crops mauel et al 2009

changes in the management of the water balance ortega farias et al 2009 and hydrologic studies and modelling zhao et al 2013 yu et al 2016 rajib et al 2018 birhanu et al 2019 according to allen et al 1998 crop evapotranspiration can be measured directly or by indirectly methods the direct method involves measurements using the lysimeter soil water balance technique and eddy covariance while the indirect method involves estimating from reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient with the indirect method faster inexpensive and less laborous the reference evapotranspiration eto has been estimated from weather data and several empirical models have been developed including the blaney criddle priestley taylor thornthwaite hargreaves fao radiation penman equation fao penman monteith modified penman penman kimberly allen et al 1998 and they have been evaluated by various authors certain setbacks are associated with these models that is they depend on observations and rigorous computations and generally perform better in the specific climate or region for which they are developed gavilan et al 2006 ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 nevertheless different combinations of these models have been tested in different climes with diverse results e g bandyopadhyay et al 2012 tabari et al 2013 bochetti et al 2016 gotardo et al 2016 fernandes et al 2018 which are attributed to the setback already mentioned however out of these models the international scientific community has universally accepted the fao pm equation as the most precise for good results compared to other equations in various regions throughout the world garcia et al 2004 because it incorporates all the climatic data and the characteristics of the specific vegetation that is transpiring in its computation which may vary significantly between climates and vegetation types allen et al 1998 several studies have demonstrated the superiority of the fao pm equation over other methods compared to lysimetric or other measurement techniques especially for daily calculations e g garcia et al 2004 lopez urrea et al 2006 cai et al 2007 whereas it faces difficulty in some climes because of lack or incomplete data in many areas especially in developing nations the necessary meteorological data are lacking therefore limiting the application of fao pm equation even other estimation methods in this context simpler techniques are required and have been in use one of the most common and reliable simple techniques for estimating eto has been from evaporimeters such as the class a and b colorado sunken pans uk british standard pan evaporimeter singh 1989 the piche atmometers atm mauel et al 2009 and the andersson evaporimeters ane messing 1998 pan evaporimeter holds water and the quantity of water loss during observation is determined as the evaporation and are adjusted to obtain eto using a conversion factor called the pan coefficient kp dingman 1994 allen et al 1998 barnett et al 1998 smajstrla et al 2000 stanhill 2002 defined pan evaporimeter as a practical meteorological tool that measures the local evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the measurement has been a vital reference to water resources assessment hydrologic studies climate zoning as well as monitoring evaporative climate change bruton et al 2000 stanhill 2002 sabziparvar et al 2010 further analyses have shown that pan evaporimeter is largely influenced by the micrometeorological environment of its surroundings world meteorological organization wmo 1966 zhuo et al 2016 however pan evaporation has become become one of the mostly used climatic measurements to determine the evaporation from natural and managed ecosystems because of its simplicity and ease of use and data interpretation as well as the high adjustment to climate changes pan evaporimeter has become very important in irrigation scheduling snyder et al 2005 ertek 2011 aschonitis et al 2012 modaberi and assari 2014 however the high cost of the standard evaporation pans such as class a and b colorado sunken pans has limited their adoption and use in developing countries thus reduced pans with smaller sizes have been developed and tested farias et al 1994 torres 1998 thomas et al 2004 farias et al 1991 evaluated the reduced pan 20 cm diameter and 25 cm high in a plastic greenhouse in brazil they found a good correlation between epan versus class a pan and epan versus penman equation and concluded that reduced pan can replace the large and more expensive class a pan in china liu and kang 2006 in their study on irrigation scheduling for winter wheat using 20 cm diameter small pan reported that such pans are being used to monitor evapotranspiration in no less than 1736 weather stations the authors found that pan evaporation epan was highly correlated with actual evapotranspiration et measured using weighing lysimeters similar success has been reported in the greenhouse in japan e g yuan et al 2001 2003 2004 and in the net house in algeria belkhiri et al 2016 the study in japan also used a 20 cm diameter pan to schedule irrigation while the study in algeria used a 24 5 cm diameter pan for the estimation of pan coefficient in nigeria like many other developing countries research on reference evapotranspiration has focused on comparing the different empirical models e g ejieji 2011 obioma et al 2015 echiegu et al 2016 akpootu and iliyasu 2017 with limited or no study evaluating the pan evaporimeter technique for estimating eto either in the open field modified or controlled climate conditions most of the studies depend largely on data downloaded from the internet or either purchased from airports with radars or nigerian meteorological agency nimet however a major concern has been the accuracy of the data especially the rainfall data as a result of the distance of the radar from most of the experimental locations where these options are not available irrigation system designs and studies on irrigation water management depend on the values in allen et al 1998 for computing crop water requirement the latter practice has led to overestimation and underestimation of crop water requirement shideed et al 1995 with substantial waste of water resources and compromising the environment katerji and rana 2008 as well as limiting crop production potentials as the small pan has been tested and compares well with the rather expensive conventional pans and its adoption being advocated in other climes this study also seek to test its performance and how it compares with some empirical models for estimating the atmospheric demand of this hot tropical climate it is hope that the results from the study will provide information that will enable a more accurate quantification of crop water requirement for irrigation system design irrigation scheduling water balance and hydrological studies therefore the objectives of this study therefore were to i evaluate the efficacy of the small pan evaporimeter under a semi controlled and open field conditions in a hot tropical climate and ii compare the small pan evaporimeter with some empirical eto estimation models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the teaching and research farm of the department of soil resources and environmental management faculty of agricultural sciences ekiti state university ado ekiti southwestern nigeria during two seasons of 2018 and 2019 the study site is located on latitude 7 42 48 02 n and longitude 5 14 44 95 e and an altitude of 407 m above sea mean level the site s climatic condition is hot tropical characterized by pronounced seasonal variations with dry mild cold winter and very hot humid summer seasons with mean annual rainfall of about 1368 mm minimum daily temperature not below 12 c during the winter while the maximum daily temperature reaches 42 c during the hot summer period the soil of the study site belongs to the broad group of alfisol soil survey staff 2014 with top sandy loam or loamy sand to bottom clay texture fasina et al 2005 some soil physical and chemical properties of the 0 20 cm surface layer of the site are presented in table 1 2 2 description of the two experiments 2 2 1 open field study maize and tomato the drip irrigated maize experiment was conducted during the first growing season of 2018 the experiment was a two factorial laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications irrigation frequency constituted the main factor comprising three irrigation regimes namely i4 four irrigations per week i3 three irrigations per week and i2 two irrigations per week of filling the soil to field capacity while the other factor was crop variety that is two maize genotypes namely v1 sammaz 27 and v2 oba super 6 there are six 6 treatments and eighteen 18 plots in total sowing of maize was done on beds 0 30 m high made on the plots with each plot 3 5 m wide and 12 0 m long the beds were prepared manually using digger hoes and shovel poultry manure at the rate of 10 tons ha 1 was incorporated during land preparation two to three 2 3 seeds of maize were planted at a spacing of 30 cm by 90 cm using a planting depth of about 5 cm one week after sowing excess seedlings were thinned to two 2 plants per stand other management practices for maize including weeding fertilization and crop protection against insect pests and rodents were carried out on timely basis maize was harvested green as it commands the high price at this period for the tomato trial the experimented was conducted during the second growing season of 2018 and spanned to the off season of 2018 2019 for the open field trial an experimental area of 8m 12m was used six 6 ridges about 0 80 m wide and 12 m long were prepared manually and organic manure poultry manure was incorporated at the rate of 10 t ha 1 as recommended for this crop tomato seedlings after three 3 weeks in nursery were transplanted at one 1 stand per hill and at a spacing of 60 cm on the ridges giving a plant population of 20 833 plants ha water irrigation was added to supplement rainfall for some weeks after transplanting and thereafter full irrigation was applied after the cessation of rainfall weeding and other agronomic practices for tomato were duly followed and carried out harvesting of semi ripe tomatoes was carried out at regular intervals 2 2 2 poly covered house study semi controlled environment the drip irrigated and rainfed tomato capsicum annuum l experiment as a confirmation of the pan evaporimeter test was carried out during the second growing season of 2018 extended to the first growing season 2019 under poly covered house and open field conditions as described above the poly covered house trial was purely irrigated the experimental design was the same drip frequency as for the maize trial and two varieties of tomato local and improved the poly covered house was 8m 12m in dimension with the top covered made of low density woven and laminated polyethylene sheet while the sides were covered with 8 mm mesh net the steel structure galvanized pipe was sourced and fabricated locally while the cover and side net were purchased from dizengoff west africa wa nigeria to guide against wind and heavy storms the structure was oriented e w and passively ventilated by the sides and front door six 6 ridges about 0 80 m wide and 12 m long were also prepared manually and organic manure poultry manure was incorporated at the rate of 10 t ha 1 2 2 3 drip irrigation system and field procedure drip irrigation system was used and the kit consists of a 3000 l tank 25 mm diameter main pipes and sub mains end plugs t joints rubber hose gate valves lateral cum drippers pipe nipples etc fig 1 b and c the main line delivered water from the tank to the sub mains into the drip lines while the emitters delivered water to the field at the rate of 2 2 l hr tomato seedlings after three 3 weeks in nursery were transplanted at one 1 stand per hill and at a spacing of 60 cm on the ridges giving a plant population of 20 833 plants ha the seedlings were adequately irrigated for two 2 weeks for crop establishment before imposing the irrigation scheduling the irrigation application was based on the time to irrigate as shown below t h s w c f c a d x n i e where t is the time to irrigate s w c f c is soil water content at field capacity m the fc was obtained for the 0 60 cm soil layer by equilibration structured soil samples to 10 kpa in the tension table reinert and

as 95 for the drip irrigation system weeding and other agronomic practices for tomato were followed and carried out harvesting of semi ripe tomatoes was also carried out at regular intervals 2 3 small pan evaporimeter construction installation and measurement of evaporation three small evaporation pans 24 5 cm diameter and 11 cm high were constructed using galvanized iron sheet and graduated measuring scale for reading of water level during the 2018 maize trial the pans were installed at two different points one pan within the canopy at the center of the 1 m border between plots while the other two pans were installed in disturbance free places outside the crop canopy for the tomato experiment two pan evaporimeters were installed one in each poly covered house and open field respectively the pans were installed on hollow concrete block about 18 cm high fig 1 which is a little bit above the 15 cm recommended for class a pan the hollow concrete block was chosen because of the prevalent termite attack as well as deterioration due to frequent wetting by rainfall the pans where periodically filled with water while a specific level of 1 0 cm from the top was maintained to prevent overflow pan evaporation measurements were conducted in the morning between 7 30 am and 8 30 am each day a graduated 15 cm long meter rule was installed and secured centrally in each pan to monitor the depth of water the level of water in the pan goes down as indicated by the graduated scale due to evaporation of water vapour from the water surface therefore pan evaporation was measured as the difference in the water level in the pan or as the depth of water evaporated during a certain period of time usually 24 h measurement was not taken on any day after a rainfall event as the water level rises therefore excess water was normally removed to maintain the 1 0 cm level from the tip of the pan water from the nearby tank used to irrigate the field was used to refill the pans as and when due the amount of the evaporation per time unit e p a n m m d 1 the difference between the two measured water levels on the graduated meter rule within 24 h was computed as e p a n w l i 1 w l i where w l i 1 is the water level of the previous 24 h 1 day mm w l i is the present water level mm because of situations with very low evaporation and to ensure the sensitivity of reading the scale a transparent sensitive meter rule 1 mm resolution with a scale showing ten divisions for each centimeter or in tenths of a centimeter was used 2 4 weather data collection weather data of daily maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation where obtained from nasa website available at https power larc nasa gov data access viewer with high resolution daily time series ½ x ½ degrees for the open field experiments for the second experiment two digital and wireless digoo mini weather stations model dg th6699 hd with sensors were installed at 2 m above the ground surface inside the poly covered house and the other outside the poly covered house for the daily record of weather data the equipment automatically records and stores the minimum and maximum values of the air temperature and relative humidity barometric pressure and wind direction the weather data was read and recorded between16 00 and 17 00 h on daily basis a rain gauge was installed in the open field within the experimental site to record rainfall 2 5 estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto from empirical models and small pan the empirical models used for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto include the fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 modified penman doorenbos and pruitt 1975 thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1950 and hargreaves hargreaves et al 1985 equations the detail description of the models can be found in allen et al 1998 the eto values from the fao56 penman monteith modified penman hargreaves and blaney criddle models were obtained using the faoeto calculator software developed by raes 2009 while the eto from thornthwaite method was estimated in an excel spread sheet developed by rolim et al 1998 for the small pan evaporimeter we consider eto epan x kp according to allen et al 1998 where kp is the pan coefficient there are standard kp values for pan evaporimeters in allen et al 1998 however these values depend on the type of pan material wind speed relative humidity and distance to a given barrier against the wind stan and neculau 2014 moreover the values are average for a given period but these conditions are not static therefore the daily kp was computed by the eto values of the standard fao penman monteith allen and pruitt 1991 developed an equation for estimating the kp by using wind speed and relative humidity so the weather data collected during the maize cropping cycle and the kp values obtained from fao pm and epan were used to calibrate the equation using the grg non linear algorithm of solver add in in excel spreadsheet and validated during the tomato open field trial to obtain a new set of kp values with the equation as k p 0 311 0 00439 v 0 0327 ln q 0 1365 ln r h 0 0058 ln q 2 l n r h where v is the wind speed m s measured at 2 m above the ground q is the distance m of the field from a barrier against the wind a building about 20 m from the field r h is the relative humidity the kp values generated from this equation were used to obtain the eto from the epan for both the maize open field only and tomato open field and poly covered house growing seasons 2 6 data analysis the eto obtained from the small pan was compared with the eto from the empirical models using simple linear regression analysis forced to the origin y bx intercept a 0 lacerda and turco 2015 the standard fao pm model was also compared with other empirical models in addition the epan recorded within and outside the maize crop canopy as well as those recorded inside the poly covered house and open field were compared the quality of the adjustments between the estimated and observed values was assessed based on the value of the slope of the regression line b the coefficient of correlation r and standard error of the mean see descriptive statistics was also performed data analysis was done in spss ibm version 20 while regression analysis was done in origin software origin version 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variability in weather conditions the daily time step of the minimum and maximum daily temperature mean relative humidity and rainfall amount during both growing seasons is presented in fig 2 during the first experiment in 2018 there was early onset of rainfall as the first rain was received in early february causing a sharp increase in the mean relative humidity this increase continues throughout the maize growing cycle as a result of increase in water vapour in the atmosphere the minimum and maximum daily temperature also increased shortly before the first rains signaling the arrival of rainfall however the temperature decreases after each rainfall effect as a result of the cooling effect of the rainfall after the initial sharp increase the minimum daily temperature remained more or less stable while the maximum daily temperature decreases and showed more oscillations fig 2a during the tomato growing cycle the opposite was observed with respect to the mean relative humidity which decreased over time fig 2b the mean relative humidity ranged between 20 and 89 5 for the poly covered house mean 58 9 and between 20 and 93 for the open field mean 57 5 the relative humidity of the open field showed more fluctuations cv 27 5 especially from the onset of dry season compared to the poly covered house where the condition is partially controlled the daily daily temperature ranged between 12 8 and 25 c for poly covered house and from 12 2 29 1 c for the open field the daily maximum temperature was 49 8 c inside the poly house while it was 39 9 c in the open field the average daily temperature in the poly covered house was 6 c higher than the open field table 2 it is worthy to note that the two growing seasons were contrasting the first growing season falls to the transition period from dry season to rainy season while the second growing season falls to the transition period from rainy season to dry season which are reflected in the trends of the temperature and relative humidity the total rainfall during the maize growing cycle was about 498 mm with a maximum of 66 5 mm during the tomato growing cycle about 342 mm of rainfall was received and the maximum was 37 mm fig 2 3 2 descriptive statistics of the reference evapotranspiration eto the results of the descriptive statistics of the daily values reference evapotranspiration eto estimated according to five different empirical models during the maize and tomato growing cycles are presented in table 3 the estimated eto values ranged between 3 0 and 5 2 mm for etofao56pm 2 7 and 5 3 mm for etobc 2 5 and 5 0 mm for etomp 3 3 and 5 9 mm for etohar 4 23 and 5 1 mm for etotht and between 3 0 and 5 9 mm for etopan with the highest amplitude from etopan daily averaged eto values ranged between 3 9 mm from etomp and 4 62 from etotht and etopan the lowest 0 20 and highest 0 97 standard deviation were obtained from etotht and etopan respectively the coefficient of variation was also lowest 4 and highest 22 from same etotht and etopan respectively the order of the average daily eto was etotht etohar etopan etofao56pm etobc etopm table 3 as expected the average eto in the poly covered house was higher than that of the open field by 23 21 28 25 and 33 for etofao56pm etobc etomp etohar and etotht respectively while the etopan in the open field was higher than that of the poly covered house by about 0 7 it is interesting to note that the variability in the open field was higher than that of the semi controlled poly covered house table 3 except for thornthwaite model etotht the high eto values recorded from the empirical models in the poly covered house compared to open field may be due to overestimation of missing data wind speed and solar radiation required for the etofao56pm etmp etohar and etobc models in the faoeto calculator as only the minimum and maximum air temperature and relative humidity data recorded from the mini weather station were used although both the wind speed and solar radiation are limited in the poly covered house to a level it could be that air temperature and relative humidity took the major role at play considering the proximity in the eto values from both the thornthwaite model and pan evaporimeter fernandez et al 2010 reported that the penman monteith method estimates the eto with a fairly high precision under plastic greenhouses in mediterranean conditions but that the solar radiation was the main factor affecting theeto in the greenhouse therefore a complete weather station is required in the poly covered house to record all climatic data for better comparison 3 3 evolution of the daily time step pan evaporation epan and pan coefficient kp fig 3 a shows the temporal distribution of the pan coefficient and evaporation measured from the small pan epan within and outside the maize crop canopy epan was similar for both within and outside the maize crop canopy during the initial crop growth stage we were unable to cover the full initial crop growth stage with increase in canopy cover epan within the crop canopy diminished lesser than that observed outside the canopy and this continued throughout the crop cycle the temporal evolution of the pan evaporation measured inside the poly covered house and open field conditions are presented in fig 3b the average pan evaporation was 6 43 and 6 30 mm for the open field and poly covered house respectively the epan measured in the poly covered house followed strictly the time trend of the epan measured in the open field although the epan of the open field was highly variable amplitude 4 0 mm standard deviation 1 80 and coefficient of variation 28 than that of the poly covered house amplitude 2 5 mm standard deviation 1 08 and coefficient of variation 17 the higher variability of eto under the open field condition may be due to the complex interaction of the prevailing climatic factors mostly affected by rainfall cloudiness wind speed and radiant energy when it rains the cooling effect lowers the temperature and increase the vapour pressure sharply thus a corresponding sharp drop in the atmospheric demand for the poly covered house a slightly controlled micro climate is created which moderates the episodes of the atmospheric demand within the structure and strike a balance with the environment evaporation from water and wet surfaces is a continuous process the rate per unit area at which water vapour leaves the surface was found to depend on the properties of the overlying air and the supply of heat to the water surface world meteorological organization wmo 1966 the lower epan recorded within the maize crop canopy is attributed to the state of the surrounding world meteorological organization wmo 1966 such as the shadow effect of crop stands which intercept solar radiation and cause a reduction in the radiant energy reaching the water surface for evaporation thus reducing the heat supply needed for evaporation also is the interference of the maize stands with wind speed the maize canopy stands as barrier or wind shelter effect to the wind speed thus reducing the convective loss associated with wind action the lower epan in the poly covered house compared to open field agrees with results from previous studies montero et al 1985 prados 1986 farias et al 1994 yuan et al 2001 yuan et al 2001 also recorded lower accumulated epan pan of 200 mm diameter in the greenhouse grown to tomato compare to open field according to prados 1986 and rosenberg et al 1989 a lower evaporation inside the poly covered house is due principally to the partial opacity of the plastic film to radiation and the reduction of wind speed the principal factors controlling the evaporative demand of the atmosphere in some instances the air temperature and relative humidity could be greater or lesser in the poly covered house compared to the open which also influence the evaporation demand in this study higher air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the poly covered house although the poly covered house was heated high temperature and but with slightly higher average relative humidity indicating much higher vapour pressure of the air compared to the open field condition thus with the lower vapour pressure of the air below the saturation vapour pressure of the corresponding water temperature in the open field diffusion process continues similarly the unhindered wind flow in the open field may have paved way for higher convective loss wmo 1966 stated that wind enhances evaporation by bringing fresh air in contact with the evaporating surface the temporal evolution of the daily values of pan coefficient kp estimated from fitting the allen and pruitt 1991 equation for both maize and tomato growing cycles is shown in fig 3 c and d for the maize crop the estimated pan coefficient kp varied between 1 00 and 1 05 mean 1 04 with a standard deviation of 0 01 and very low coefficient of variation of about 1 during the tomato growing cycle the estimated pan coefficient kp as monitored in the open field varied between 0 84 and 1 06 mean 0 98 with a standard deviation of 0 05 and coefficient of variation of about 5 the kp showed increase trend over time during the maize growing cycle while it decreased over time during the tomato season indicating a contrasting behaviour in the seasons the maize growing cycle falls to the transition period end of dry season to the onset of the rainy season during which the eto reduces hence increasing kp because of the indirect relationship between the two parameters conversely the tomato growing cycle fall to the transition period from the end of the rainy season to a brief hot period and then to the cold dry season the average kp values obtained in this study agreed with the findings of by yuan et al 2003 who tested kp of similar small pan ranging between 0 25 and 1 25 they recommended kp 0 75 for optimum potato yield under controlled condition liu and kang 2006 reported that grain filling stage of greenhouse grown wheat was best at kp 1 25 yuan et al 2001 recommended kp range between 1 00 1 50 for adequate water supply under the greenhouse condition while a kp 1 10 was recommended for optimum strawberry productivity in the greenhouse by yuan et al 2004 although our findings agree with these authors with diverse climates we recommend testing a wide range of the kp values for different cultures under our hot tropical climate and in other regions 3 4 correlation between small pan eto and other estimation models the summary of the regression analysis of the etopan observed from the small pan versus estimated eto by the different empirical models under open field and poly covered house conditions are presented in table 4 under the open field conditions the etofao56pm etobc etopm and etohar showed high and similar precision about 60 when compared to etopan indicating that a substantial part of the etopan was explained by these models on the other hand the precision from etotht was low about half of other models but it has the lowest see and the average eto value is very close to that of pan followed by etofao56pm in the poly covered house the same trend was observed as the etotht had the highest precision and lowest see also followed by etofao56pm whereas other models showed low precision from the other models can be attributed to the effect of missing data as only the temperature and relatively humidity data were used for driving these models in the faoeto calculator software the reason for this could be attributed to overestimation of missing data of solar radiation and wind speed within the poly covered house as already pointed out the precision obtained in this study is comparable to that of farias et el 1994 who found precision in the range between 0 48 and 0 59 when comparing the reduced pan evaporimeter 20 cm diameter and 25 cm high and class a pan with penman equation in a greenhouse in brazil the authors concluded that the use of the reduced tank inside greenhouses with dimensions well below that of class a pan seems more advisable because it occupies a smaller area and contributes less to raise the humidity of the environment besides having less cost and being more practical the differences in the precision as observed for the empirical models have been attributed to two factors aschonitis et al 2012 namely the different eto models employ single or combination of climatic factors having contrasting characteristics and which influence evapotranspiration differently as well as the complex interactions between the climate and environment the correlation between epan etofao56pm and the weather data are shown in tables 5 and 6 the epan had significant correlation with maximum temperature positive and relative humidity negative during both maize and tomato growing cycles even though the solar radiation did not show significant correlation with epan however it is interesting to see that the minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity are significantly correlated with solar radiation we can say an indirect effect here though the correlation analysis is not a candidate for expressing cause effect phenomenon during the maize growing cycle etofao56pm showed significant correlation with minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity and solar radiation while during the tomato growing cycle etofao56pm correlated with maximum temperature and relative humidity the epan also showed significant correlation with etofao56pm as also observed in the regression analysis the good performance of the etopan compared to the estimation methods indicates a great potential of the small pan for estimating evapotranspiration similar success has been reported under greenhouse conditions elsewhere for example yuan et al 2001 in china yuan et a 2003 2004 and liu and kang 2006 in japan and belkhiri et al 2016 in the nethouse in algeria in this study the consistent results for the two contrasting seasons irrigated poly covered house and open field and rainfed open field agriculture showed that the small pan evaporimeter is considered adequate for estimating evapotranspiration for water management for both rainfed and irrigation agriculture whether in the open field and modified environment as well as for hydrologic studies and modelling 4 conclusions among the different models for estimating reference evapotranspiration both the blaney criddle and hargreaves models could be used in place of the more complex fao56 penman monteith model under open field conditions in this tropical climate the thornthwaite model appeared the best for the poly covered house however a complete weather station is required for further comparison to other models the average daily temperature in the poly covered house was 6 c higher than the open field the small evaporation pan 24 5 cm in diameter showed a good performance for measuring evaporation and estimating evapotranspiration under both open field and poly covered house conditions canopy cover was the driving force responsible for the reduced pan evaporation within the crop canopy while temperature and relative humidity were the driving forces controlling evapotranspiration in the poly house the relatively inexpensive small pan evaporimeter could complement the expensive conventional pans empirical eto models remote sensing lysimeters studies and others for quantifying evapotranspiration a

8284,study region this study was carried out in a hot tropical region of southwest nigeria study focus the study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of small pan evaporimeter in estimating evapotranspiration et and compare with five reference evapotranspiration eto estimation models of fao56 penman monteith modified penman thornthwaite blaney criddle and hargreaves under poly covered house and open field conditions grown to maize and tomato in two contrasting seasons small pan evaporimeters with diameter 24 5 cm and 11 cm high were constructed and installed to measure evaporation the eto from the empirical models was estimated using weather data downloaded from nasa website and a mini weather station installed in the poly covered house a rain gauge was also installed to measure rainfall during the growing period new hydrological insights for the region the small pan evaporation significantly p 0 05 correlated with the reference evapotranspiration obtained from the empirical et models canopy cover was the driving force responsible for the reduced pan evaporation within the crop canopy temperature and relative humidity are the driving forces controlling evapotranspiration in the poly house the inexpensive small pan could complement conventional pans empirical eto models remote sensing and others for quantifying evapotranspiration which is essential

keywords evapotranspiration small pan evaporimeter open field controlled environment hydrologic studies 1 introduction water is becoming an economic scarce resource in many areas of the world agriculture is the largest consumer of global freshwater accounting for around 70 of withdrawals as irrigation wwap 2009 increasing the efficiency of water use within agriculture systems is important in order to ensure a balance for agricultural production municipal and industrial purposes and ecosystem function jacobsen et al 2012 and an estimate of evapotranspiration provides an outlook of soil water balance in association with the amount of precipitation and irrigation such estimates have been described as a vital component for determining water requirement of field crops mauel et al 2009 fernández et al 2010 bacci et al 2011 salcedo et al 2017 identify the time variations on irrigation needs improve the allocation of water resources evaluate the effect of the use of the land use and changes in the management of the water balance ortega farias et al 2009 and hydrologic studies and modelling zhao et al 2013 yu et al 2016 rajib et al 2018 birhanu et al 2019 according to allen et al 1998 crop evapotranspiration can be measured directly or by indirectly methods the direct method involves measurements using the lysimeter soil water balance technique and eddy covariance while the indirect method involves estimating from reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient with the indirect method faster inexpensive and less laborous the reference evapotranspiration eto has been estimated from weather data and several empirical models have been developed including the blaney criddle priestley taylor thornthwaite hargreaves fao radiation penman equation fao penman monteith modified penman penman kimberly allen et al 1998 and they have been evaluated by various authors certain setbacks are associated with these models that is they depend on observations and rigorous computations and generally perform better in the specific climate or region for which they are developed gavilan et al 2006 ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 fooladmand and ahmadi 2009 nevertheless different combinations of these models have been tested in different climes with diverse results e g bandyopadhyay et al 2012 tabari et al 2013 bochetti et al 2016 gotardo et al 2016 fernandes et al 2018 which are attributed to the setback already mentioned however out of these models the international scientific community has universally accepted the fao pm equation as the most precise for good results compared to other equations in various regions throughout the world garcia et al 2004 because it incorporates all the climatic data and the characteristics of the specific vegetation that is transpiring in its computation which may vary significantly between climates and vegetation types allen et al 1998 several studies have demonstrated the superiority of the fao pm equation over other methods compared to lysimetric or other measurement techniques especially for daily calculations e g garcia et al 2004 lopez urrea et al 2006 cai et al 2007 whereas it faces difficulty in some climes because of lack or incomplete data in many areas especially in developing nations the necessary meteorological data are lacking therefore limiting the application of fao pm equation even other estimation methods in this context simpler techniques are required and have been in use one of the most common and reliable simple techniques for estimating eto has been from evaporimeters such as the class a and b colorado sunken pans uk british standard pan evaporimeter singh 1989 the piche atmometers atm mauel et al 2009 and the andersson evaporimeters ane messing 1998 pan evaporimeter holds water and the quantity of water loss during observation is determined as the evaporation and are adjusted to obtain eto using a conversion factor called the pan coefficient kp dingman 1994 allen et al 1998 barnett et al 1998 smajstrla et al 2000 stanhill 2002 defined pan evaporimeter as a practical meteorological tool that measures the local evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the measurement has been a vital reference to water resources assessment hydrologic studies climate zoning as well as monitoring evaporative climate change bruton et al 2000 stanhill 2002 sabziparvar et al 2010 further analyses have shown that pan evaporimeter is largely influenced by the micrometeorological environment of its surroundings world meteorological organization wmo 1966 zhuo et al 2016 however pan evaporation has become become one of the mostly used climatic measurements to determine the evaporation from natural and managed ecosystems because of its simplicity and ease of use and data interpretation as well as the high adjustment to climate changes pan evaporimeter has become very important in irrigation scheduling snyder et al 2005 ertek 2011 aschonitis et al 2012 modaberi and assari 2014 however the high cost of the standard evaporation pans such as class a and b colorado sunken pans has limited their adoption and use in developing countries thus reduced pans with smaller sizes have been developed and tested farias et al 1994 torres 1998 thomas et al 2004 farias et al 1991 evaluated the reduced pan 20 cm diameter and 25 cm high in a plastic greenhouse in brazil they found a good correlation between epan versus class a pan and epan versus penman equation and concluded that reduced pan can replace the large and more expensive class a pan in china liu and kang 2006 in their study on irrigation scheduling for winter wheat using 20 cm diameter small pan reported that such pans are being used to monitor evapotranspiration in no less than 1736 weather stations the authors found that pan evaporation epan was highly correlated with actual evapotranspiration et measured using weighing lysimeters similar success has been reported in the greenhouse in japan e g yuan et al 2001 2003 2004 and in the net house in algeria belkhiri et al 2016 the study in japan also used a 20 cm diameter pan to schedule irrigation while the study in algeria used a 24 5 cm diameter pan for the estimation of pan coefficient in nigeria like many other developing countries research on reference evapotranspiration has focused on comparing the different empirical models e g ejieji 2011 obioma et al 2015 echiegu et al 2016 akpootu and iliyasu 2017 with limited or no study evaluating the pan evaporimeter technique for estimating eto either in the open field modified or controlled climate conditions most of the studies depend largely on data downloaded from the internet or either purchased from airports with radars or nigerian meteorological agency nimet however a major concern has been the accuracy of the data especially the rainfall data as a result of the distance of the radar from most of the experimental locations where these options are not available irrigation system designs and studies on irrigation water management depend on the values in allen et al 1998 for computing crop water requirement the latter practice has led to overestimation and underestimation of crop water requirement shideed et al 1995 with substantial waste of water resources and compromising the environment katerji and rana 2008 as well as limiting crop production potentials as the small pan has been tested and compares well with the rather expensive conventional pans and its adoption being advocated in other climes this study also seek to test its performance and how it compares with some empirical models for estimating the atmospheric demand of this hot tropical climate it is hope that the results from the study will provide information that will enable a more accurate quantification of crop water requirement for irrigation system design irrigation scheduling water balance and hydrological studies therefore the objectives of this study therefore were to i evaluate the efficacy of the small pan evaporimeter under a semi controlled and open field conditions in a hot tropical climate and ii compare the small pan evaporimeter with some empirical eto estimation models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the teaching and research farm of the department of soil resources and environmental management faculty of agricultural sciences ekiti state university ado ekiti southwestern nigeria during two seasons of 2018 and 2019 the study site is located on latitude 7 42 48 02 n and longitude 5 14 44 95 e and an altitude of 407 m above sea mean level the site s climatic condition is hot tropical characterized by pronounced seasonal variations with dry mild cold winter and very hot humid summer seasons with mean annual rainfall of about 1368 mm minimum daily temperature not below 12 c during the winter while the maximum daily temperature reaches 42 c during the hot summer period the soil of the study site belongs to the broad group of alfisol soil survey staff 2014 with top sandy loam or loamy sand to bottom clay texture fasina et al 2005 some soil physical and chemical properties of the 0 20 cm surface layer of the site are presented in table 1 2 2 description of the two experiments 2 2 1 open field study maize and tomato the drip irrigated maize experiment was conducted during the first growing season of 2018 the experiment was a two factorial laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with three replications irrigation frequency constituted the main factor comprising three irrigation regimes namely i4 four irrigations per week i3 three irrigations per week and i2 two irrigations per week of filling the soil to field capacity while the other factor was crop variety that is two maize genotypes namely v1 sammaz 27 and v2 oba super 6 there are six 6 treatments and eighteen 18 plots in total sowing of maize was done on beds 0 30 m high made on the plots with each plot 3 5 m wide and 12 0 m long the beds were prepared manually using digger hoes and shovel poultry manure at the rate of 10 tons ha 1 was incorporated during land preparation two to three 2 3 seeds of maize were planted at a spacing of 30 cm by 90 cm using a planting depth of about 5 cm one week after sowing excess seedlings were thinned to two 2 plants per stand other management practices for maize including weeding fertilization and crop protection against insect pests and rodents were carried out on timely basis maize was harvested green as it commands the high price at this period for the tomato trial the experimented was conducted during the second growing season of 2018 and spanned to the off season of 2018 2019 for the open field trial an experimental area of 8m 12m was used six 6 ridges about 0 80 m wide and 12 m long were prepared manually and organic manure poultry manure was incorporated at the rate of 10 t ha 1 as recommended for this crop tomato seedlings after three 3 weeks in nursery were transplanted at one 1 stand per hill and at a spacing of 60 cm on the ridges giving a plant population of 20 833 plants ha water irrigation was added to supplement rainfall for some weeks after transplanting and thereafter full irrigation was applied after the cessation of rainfall weeding and other agronomic practices for tomato were duly followed and carried out harvesting of semi ripe tomatoes was carried out at regular intervals 2 2 2 poly covered house study semi controlled environment the drip irrigated and rainfed tomato capsicum annuum l experiment as a confirmation of the pan evaporimeter test was carried out during the second growing season of 2018 extended to the first growing season 2019 under poly covered house and open field conditions as described above the poly covered house trial was purely irrigated the experimental design was the same drip frequency as for the maize trial and two varieties of tomato local and improved the poly covered house was 8m 12m in dimension with the top covered made of low density woven and laminated polyethylene sheet while the sides were covered with 8 mm mesh net the steel structure galvanized pipe was sourced and fabricated locally while the cover and side net were purchased from dizengoff west africa wa nigeria to guide against wind and heavy storms the structure was oriented e w and passively ventilated by the sides and front door six 6 ridges about 0 80 m wide and 12 m long were also prepared manually and organic manure poultry manure was incorporated at the rate of 10 t ha 1 2 2 3 drip irrigation system and field procedure drip irrigation system was used and the kit consists of a 3000 l tank 25 mm diameter main pipes and sub mains end plugs t joints rubber hose gate valves lateral cum drippers pipe nipples etc fig 1 b and c the main line delivered water from the tank to the sub mains into the drip lines while the emitters delivered water to the field at the rate of 2 2 l hr tomato seedlings after three 3 weeks in nursery were transplanted at one 1 stand per hill and at a spacing of 60 cm on the ridges giving a plant population of 20 833 plants ha the seedlings were adequately irrigated for two 2 weeks for crop establishment before imposing the irrigation scheduling the irrigation application was based on the time to irrigate as shown below t h s w c f c a d x n i e where t is the

as 95 for the drip irrigation system weeding and other agronomic practices for tomato were followed and carried out harvesting of semi ripe tomatoes was also carried out at regular intervals 2 3 small pan evaporimeter construction installation and measurement of evaporation three small evaporation pans 24 5 cm diameter and 11 cm high were constructed using galvanized iron sheet and graduated measuring scale for reading of water level during the 2018 maize trial the pans were installed at two different points one pan within the canopy at the center of the 1 m border between plots while the other two pans were installed in disturbance free places outside the crop canopy for the tomato experiment two pan evaporimeters were installed one in each poly covered house and open field respectively the pans were installed on hollow concrete block about 18 cm high fig 1 which is a little bit above the 15 cm recommended for class a pan the hollow concrete block was chosen because of the prevalent termite attack as well as deterioration due to frequent wetting by rainfall the pans where periodically filled with water while a specific level of 1 0 cm from the top was maintained to prevent overflow pan evaporation measurements were conducted in the morning between 7 30 am and 8 30 am each day a graduated 15 cm long meter rule was installed and secured centrally in each pan to monitor the depth of water the level of water in the pan goes down as indicated by the graduated scale due to evaporation of water vapour from the water surface therefore pan evaporation was measured as the difference in the water level in the pan or as the depth of water evaporated during a certain period of time usually 24 h measurement was not taken on any day after a rainfall event as the water level rises therefore excess water was normally removed to maintain the 1 0 cm level from the tip of the pan water from the nearby tank used to irrigate the field was used to refill the pans as and when due the amount of the evaporation per time unit e p a n m m d 1 the difference between the two measured water levels on the graduated meter rule within 24 h was computed as e p a n w l i 1 w l i where w l i 1 is the water level of the previous 24 h 1 day mm w l i is the present water level mm because of situations with very low evaporation and to ensure the sensitivity of reading the scale a transparent sensitive meter rule 1 mm resolution with a scale showing ten divisions for each centimeter or in tenths of a centimeter was used 2 4 weather data collection weather data of daily maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation where obtained from nasa website available at https power larc nasa gov data access viewer with high resolution daily time series ½ x ½ degrees for the open field experiments for the second experiment two digital and wireless digoo mini weather stations model dg th6699 hd with sensors were installed at 2 m above the ground surface inside the poly covered house and the other outside the poly covered house for the daily record of weather data the equipment automatically records and stores the minimum and maximum values of the air temperature and relative humidity barometric pressure and wind direction the weather data was read and recorded between16 00 and 17 00 h on daily basis a rain gauge was installed in the open field within the experimental site to record rainfall 2 5 estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto from empirical models and small pan the empirical models used for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto include the fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 modified penman doorenbos and pruitt 1975 thornthwaite thornthwaite 1948 blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1950 and hargreaves hargreaves et al 1985 equations the detail description of the models can be found in allen et al 1998 the eto values from the fao56 penman monteith modified penman hargreaves and blaney criddle models were obtained using the faoeto calculator software developed by raes 2009 while the eto from thornthwaite method was estimated in an excel spread sheet developed by rolim et al 1998 for the small pan evaporimeter we consider eto epan x kp according to allen et al 1998 where kp is the pan coefficient there are standard kp values for pan evaporimeters in allen et al 1998 however these values depend on the type of pan material wind speed relative humidity and distance to a given barrier against the wind stan and neculau 2014 moreover the values are average for a given period but these conditions are not static therefore the daily kp was computed by the eto values of the standard fao penman monteith allen and pruitt 1991 developed an equation for estimating the kp by using wind speed and relative humidity so the weather data collected during the maize cropping cycle and the kp values obtained from fao pm and epan were used to calibrate the equation using the grg non linear algorithm of solver add in in excel spreadsheet and validated during the tomato open field trial to obtain a new set of kp values with the equation as k p 0 311 0 00439 v 0 0327 ln q 0 1365 ln r h 0 0058 ln q 2 l n r h where v is the wind speed m s measured at 2 m above the ground q is the distance m of the field from a barrier against the wind a building about 20 m from the field r h is the relative humidity the kp values generated from this equation were used to obtain the eto from the epan for both the maize open field only and tomato open field and poly covered house growing seasons 2 6 data analysis the eto obtained from the small pan was compared with the eto from the empirical models using simple linear regression analysis forced to the origin y bx intercept a 0 lacerda and turco 2015 the standard fao pm model was also compared with other empirical models in addition the epan recorded within and outside the maize crop canopy as well as those recorded inside the poly covered house and open field were compared the quality of the adjustments between the estimated and observed values was assessed based on the value of the slope of the regression line b the coefficient of correlation r and standard error of the mean see descriptive statistics was also performed data analysis was done in spss ibm version 20 while regression analysis was done in origin software origin version 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variability in weather conditions the daily time step of the minimum and maximum daily temperature mean relative humidity and rainfall amount during both growing seasons is presented in fig 2 during the first experiment in 2018 there was early onset of rainfall as the first rain was received in early february causing a sharp increase in the mean relative humidity this increase continues throughout the maize growing cycle as a result of increase in water vapour in the atmosphere the minimum and maximum daily temperature also increased shortly before the first rains signaling the arrival of rainfall however the temperature decreases after each rainfall effect as a result of the cooling effect of the rainfall after the initial sharp increase the minimum daily temperature remained more or less stable while the maximum daily temperature decreases and showed more oscillations fig 2a during the tomato growing cycle the opposite was observed with respect to the mean relative humidity which decreased over time fig 2b the mean relative humidity ranged between 20 and 89 5 for the poly covered house mean 58 9 and between 20 and 93 for the open field mean 57 5 the relative humidity of the open field showed more fluctuations cv 27 5 especially from the onset of dry season compared to the poly covered house where the condition is partially controlled the daily daily temperature ranged between 12 8 and 25 c for poly covered house and from 12 2 29 1 c for the open field the daily maximum temperature was 49 8 c inside the poly house while it was 39 9 c in the open field the average daily temperature in the poly covered house was 6 c higher than the open field table 2 it is worthy to note that the two growing seasons were contrasting the first growing season falls to the transition period from dry season to rainy season while the second growing season falls to the transition period from rainy season to dry season which are reflected in the trends of the temperature and relative humidity the total rainfall during the maize growing cycle was about 498 mm with a maximum of 66 5 mm during the tomato growing cycle about 342 mm of rainfall was received and the maximum was 37 mm fig 2 3 2 descriptive statistics of the reference evapotranspiration eto the results of the descriptive statistics of the daily values reference evapotranspiration eto estimated according to five different empirical models during the maize and tomato growing cycles are presented in table 3 the estimated eto values ranged between 3 0 and 5 2 mm for etofao56pm 2 7 and 5 3 mm for etobc 2 5 and 5 0 mm for etomp 3 3 and 5 9 mm for etohar 4 23 and 5 1 mm for etotht and between 3 0 and 5 9 mm for etopan with the highest amplitude from etopan daily averaged eto values ranged between 3 9 mm from etomp and 4 62 from etotht and etopan the lowest 0 20 and highest 0 97 standard deviation were obtained from etotht and etopan respectively the coefficient of variation was also lowest 4 and highest 22 from same etotht and etopan respectively the order of the average daily eto was etotht etohar etopan etofao56pm etobc etopm table 3 as expected the average eto in the poly covered house was higher than that of the open field by 23 21 28 25 and 33 for etofao56pm etobc etomp etohar and etotht respectively while the etopan in the open field was higher than that of the poly covered house by about 0 7 it is interesting to note that the variability in the open field was higher than that of the semi controlled poly covered house table 3 except for thornthwaite model etotht the high eto values recorded from the empirical models in the poly covered house compared to open field may be due to overestimation of missing data wind speed and solar radiation required for the etofao56pm etmp etohar and etobc models in the faoeto calculator as only the minimum and maximum air temperature and relative humidity data recorded from the mini weather station were used although both the wind speed and solar radiation are limited in the poly covered house to a level it could be that air temperature and relative humidity took the major role at play considering the proximity in the eto values from both the thornthwaite model and pan evaporimeter fernandez et al 2010 reported that the penman monteith method estimates the eto with a fairly high precision under plastic greenhouses in mediterranean conditions but that the solar radiation was the main factor affecting theeto in the greenhouse therefore a complete weather station is required in the poly covered house to record all climatic data for better comparison 3 3 evolution of the daily time step pan evaporation epan and pan coefficient kp fig 3 a shows the temporal distribution of the pan coefficient and evaporation measured from the small pan epan within and outside the maize crop canopy epan was similar for both within and outside the maize crop canopy during the initial crop growth stage we were unable to cover the full initial crop growth stage with increase in canopy cover epan within the crop canopy diminished lesser than that observed outside the canopy and this continued throughout the crop cycle the temporal evolution of the pan evaporation measured inside the poly covered house and open field conditions are presented in fig 3b the average pan evaporation was 6 43 and 6 30 mm for the open field and poly covered house respectively the epan measured in the poly covered house followed strictly the time trend of the epan measured in the open field although the epan of the open field was highly variable amplitude 4 0 mm standard deviation 1 80 and coefficient of variation 28 than that of the poly covered house amplitude 2 5 mm standard deviation 1 08 and coefficient of variation 17 the higher variability of eto under the open field condition may be due to the complex interaction of the prevailing climatic factors mostly affected by rainfall cloudiness wind speed and radiant energy when it rains the cooling effect lowers the temperature and increase the vapour pressure sharply thus a corresponding sharp drop in the atmospheric demand for the poly covered house a slightly controlled micro climate is created which moderates the episodes of the atmospheric demand within the structure and strike a balance with the environment evaporation from water and wet surfaces is a continuous process the rate per unit area at which water vapour leaves the surface was found to depend on the properties of the overlying air and the supply of heat to the water surface world meteorological organization wmo 1966 the lower epan recorded within the maize crop canopy is attributed to the state of the surrounding world meteorological organization wmo 1966 such as the shadow effect of crop stands which intercept solar radiation and cause a reduction in the radiant energy reaching the water surface for evaporation thus reducing the heat supply needed for evaporation also is the interference of the maize stands with wind speed the maize canopy stands as barrier or wind shelter effect to the wind speed thus reducing the convective loss associated with wind action the lower epan in the poly covered house compared to open field agrees with results from previous studies montero et al 1985 prados 1986 farias et al 1994 yuan et al 2001 yuan et al 2001 also recorded lower accumulated epan pan of 200 mm diameter in the greenhouse grown to tomato compare to open field according to prados 1986 and rosenberg et al 1989 a lower evaporation inside the poly covered house is due principally to the partial opacity of the plastic film to radiation and the reduction of wind speed the principal factors controlling the evaporative demand of the atmosphere in some instances the air temperature and relative humidity could be greater or lesser in the poly covered house compared to the open which also influence the evaporation demand in this study higher air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the poly covered house although the poly covered house was heated high temperature and but with slightly higher average relative humidity indicating much higher vapour pressure of the air compared to the open field condition thus with the lower vapour pressure of the air below the saturation vapour pressure of the corresponding water temperature in the open field diffusion process continues similarly the unhindered wind flow in the open field may have paved way for higher convective loss wmo 1966 stated that wind enhances evaporation by bringing fresh air in contact with the evaporating surface the temporal evolution of the daily values of pan coefficient kp estimated from fitting the allen and pruitt 1991 equation for both maize and tomato growing cycles is shown in fig 3 c and d for the maize crop the estimated pan coefficient kp varied between 1 00 and 1 05 mean 1 04 with a standard deviation of 0 01 and very low coefficient of variation of about 1 during the tomato growing cycle the estimated pan coefficient kp as monitored in the open field varied between 0 84 and 1 06 mean 0 98 with a standard deviation of 0 05 and coefficient of variation of about 5 the kp showed increase trend over time during the maize growing cycle while it decreased over time during the tomato season indicating a contrasting behaviour in the seasons the maize growing cycle falls to the transition period end of dry season to the onset of the rainy season during which the eto reduces hence increasing kp because of the indirect relationship between the two parameters conversely the tomato growing cycle fall to the transition period from the end of the rainy season to a brief hot period and then to the cold dry season the average kp values obtained in this study agreed with the findings of by yuan et al 2003 who tested kp of similar small pan ranging between 0 25 and 1 25 they recommended kp 0 75 for optimum potato yield under controlled condition liu and kang 2006 reported that grain filling stage of greenhouse grown wheat was best at kp 1 25 yuan et al 2001 recommended kp range between 1 00 1 50 for adequate water supply under the greenhouse condition while a kp 1 10 was recommended for optimum strawberry productivity in the greenhouse by yuan et al 2004 although our findings agree with these authors with diverse climates we recommend testing a wide range of the kp values for different cultures under our hot tropical climate and in other regions 3 4 correlation between small pan eto and other estimation models the summary of the regression analysis of the etopan observed from the small pan versus estimated eto by the different empirical models under open field and poly covered house conditions are presented in table 4 under the open field conditions the etofao56pm etobc etopm and etohar showed high and similar precision about 60 when compared to etopan indicating that a substantial part of the etopan was explained by these models on the other hand the precision from etotht was low about half of other models but it has the lowest see and the average eto value is very close to that of pan followed by etofao56pm in the poly covered house the same trend was observed as the etotht had the highest precision and lowest see also followed by etofao56pm whereas other models showed low precision from the other models can be attributed to the effect of missing data as only the temperature and relatively humidity data were used for driving these models in the faoeto calculator software the reason for this could be attributed to overestimation of missing data of solar radiation and wind speed within the poly covered house as already pointed out the precision obtained in this study is comparable to that of farias et el 1994 who found precision in the range between 0 48 and 0 59 when comparing the reduced pan evaporimeter 20 cm diameter and 25 cm high and class a pan with penman equation in a greenhouse in brazil the authors concluded that the use of the reduced tank inside greenhouses with dimensions well below that of class a pan seems more advisable because it occupies a smaller area and contributes less to raise the humidity of the environment besides having less cost and being more practical the differences in the precision as observed for the empirical models have been attributed to two factors aschonitis et al 2012 namely the different eto models employ single or combination of climatic factors having contrasting characteristics and which influence evapotranspiration differently as well as the complex interactions between the climate and environment the correlation between epan etofao56pm and the weather data are shown in tables 5 and 6 the epan had significant correlation with maximum temperature positive and relative humidity negative during both maize and tomato growing cycles even though the solar radiation did not show significant correlation with epan however it is interesting to see that the minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidity are significantly correlated with solar radiation we can say an indirect effect here though the correlation analysis is not a candidate for expressing cause effect phenomenon during the maize growing cycle etofao56pm showed significant correlation with minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity and solar radiation while during the tomato growing cycle etofao56pm correlated with maximum temperature and relative humidity the epan also showed significant correlation with etofao56pm as also observed in the regression analysis the good performance of the etopan compared to the estimation methods indicates a great potential of the small pan for estimating evapotranspiration similar success has been reported under greenhouse conditions elsewhere for example yuan et al 2001 in china yuan et a 2003 2004 and liu and kang 2006 in japan and belkhiri et al 2016 in the nethouse in algeria in this study the consistent results for the two contrasting seasons irrigated poly covered house and open field and rainfed open field agriculture showed that the small pan evaporimeter is considered adequate for estimating evapotranspiration for water management for both rainfed and irrigation agriculture whether in the open field and modified environment as well as for hydrologic studies and modelling 4 conclusions among the different models for estimating reference evapotranspiration both the blaney criddle and hargreaves models could be used in place of the more complex fao56 penman monteith model under open field conditions in this tropical climate the thornthwaite model appeared the best for the poly covered house however a complete weather station is required for further comparison to other models the average daily temperature in the poly covered house was 6 c higher than the open field the small evaporation pan 24 5 cm in diameter showed a good performance for measuring evaporation and estimating evapotranspiration under both open field and poly covered house conditions canopy cover was the driving force responsible for the reduced pan evaporation within the crop canopy while temperature and relative humidity were the driving forces controlling evapotranspiration in the poly house the relatively inexpensive small pan evaporimeter could complement the expensive conventional pans empirical eto models remote sensing lysimeters studies and others for quantifying evapotranspiration a vital component not only for irrigation but also hydrological studies and modelling of catchments watersheds agricultural fields and other landscape in this region and similar tropical and sub
