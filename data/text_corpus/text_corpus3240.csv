16200,groundwater contamination of geogenic arsenic as remains a global health threat particularly in south east asia the prominent correlation often observed between high as concentrations and methane ch 4 stimulated the analysis of the gas dynamics in an as contaminated aquifer whereby noble and reactive gases were analysed results show a progressive depletion of atmospheric gases ar kr and n 2 alongside highly increasing ch 4 implying that a free gas phase comprised mainly of ch 4 is formed within the aquifer in contrast helium he concentrations are high within the ch 4 gas producing zone suggesting longer groundwater residence times we hypothesized that the observed free ch 4 gas phase severely detracts local groundwater flow and significantly reduces water renewal within the gas producing zone results are in line with this hypothesis however a second hypothesis has been developed which focuses on the potential transport of he from an adjacent aquitard into the ch 4 gas producing zone this second hypothesis was formulated as it resolves the particularly high he concentrations observed and since external solute input from the overlying heterogeneous aquitard cannot be excluded the proposed feedback between the gas phase and hydraulics provides a plausible explanation of the anti intuitive correlation between high as and ch 4 and the spatially highly patchy distribution of dissolved as concentrations in contaminated aquifers furthermore the increased groundwater residence time would allow for the dissolution of more crystalline as hosting iron fe oxide phases in conjunction with the formation of more stable secondary fe minerals in the hydraulically slowed i e gas producing zone a subject which calls for further investigation keywords gas production degassing helium reduced flow methane 1 introduction globally many valuable groundwater resources are severely affected by high levels of arsenic as naujokas et al 2013 nordstrom 2002 podgorski and berg 2020 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 particularly in the river deltaic regions of south and south east asia as contaminated aquifers which supply water for local drinking and irrigation coincide with high population densities berg et al 2007 buschmann et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 culminating in a high risk of as exposure and detrimental health impacts abedin et al 2002 berg et al 2001 buschmann et al 2008 huq et al 2006 to understand the origin and extent of as contamination in affected aquifers the spatial distribution of as fendorf et al 2010 podgorski and berg 2020 how as partitions between aqueous and solid phases and the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the partitioning of as have been topics intensively investigated over the last two decades a crucial conclusion of these studies is that as mobilization primarily occurs in conjunction with the microbially mediated reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides anawar et al 2006 berg et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 2000 ravenscroft et al 2011 which is often controlled by the availability of suitable organic carbon sources wallis et al 2020 this reductive dissolution mechanism is commonly accompanied by positive correlations of as concentrations with iron fe dissolved organic carbon doc ammonium nh 4 and methane ch 4 concentrations in groundwater dowling et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 ravenscroft et al 2011 stopelli et al 2020 one of the most puzzling observations is the often close correlation between high as and ch 4 concentrations dowling et al 2002 jessen et al 2008 postma et al 2007 although such studies suggest that ch 4 is an indicator of organic matter degradation no specific mechanism to explain the correlating relationship between as and ch 4 was identified more recently however glodowska et al 2020b found evidence for a potential reaction pathway in which ch 4 acts as electron donor for the direct microbially mediated reduction of fe oxides and concurrent as release yet a full mechanistic link between as and ch 4 gas production which also considers hydrogeological processes remains undetermined deciphering such a possible link calls for an in depth analysis of the overall gas dynamics that characterizes as bearing hydrochemically reduced aquifers elucidating the behaviour of the reactive gas ch 4 requires to simultaneously study the evolution of carbon dioxide co 2 and nitrogen n 2 since these gases are also considerable contributors to the total dissolved gas pressure tdgp in groundwaters therefore making them likewise relevant for determining the overall gas dynamics of an aquifer importantly where tdgp exceeds the in situ hydrostatic pressure of an aquifer a free gas phase will form due to exsolution of oversaturated gases within the groundwater fry et al 1997 the formation of such free gas phases can locally reduce the hydraulic conductivity and significantly interrupt groundwater flow amos and mayer 2006 fortuin and willemsen 2005 fry et al 1997 heilweil et al 2004 ryan et al 2000 thomas et al 2003 while the observation of a free gas phase existing beneath the water table of as contaminated aquifers has been previously observed postma et al 2012 stute et al 2007 no attempt to link such a change in the physical transport characteristics to as concentrations and distributions within contaminated aquifers has been made to date in this study we hypothesize that such in aquifer gas phase production can result in vastly increased groundwater residence times therefore increasing exposure times among critical reactants that govern kinetically controlled as release in particular an increased residence time allows for e g the reductive dissolution of more crystalline and thus less reactive forms of iron and associated as release and more stable fe ii minerals to form thus studying the production and evolution of reactive gases in hydrochemically reduced groundwater is an important aspect which allows us to elucidate a previously overlooked hydrogeological mechanistic link between ch 4 production and elevated as concentrations in affected groundwater flow systems by combining noble gas tracer techniques kipfer et al 2002 with the analysis of reactive gas species in groundwater we employ a unique tool set to determine gas and groundwater dynamics in an as contaminated aquifer we evaluate our hypothesis for a well studied aquifer near hanoi vietnam where complex and interlinked hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes govern the fate of as we assess how the analysed gases co evolve and how they evolve in relation to as groundwater concentrations with the overall aim to establish a mechanistic link between ch 4 gas formation and elevated as concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site background and geological setting the selected study site near hanoi vietnam has a rich history of detailed investigations that began over two decades ago the first in depth study to disclose the extent of as contamination along the alluvial planes of the red river deltaic region was performed by berg et al 2001 these initial findings were complemented by subsequent studies characterizing the geological lithological mineralogical and hydrochemical features of the delta many of these studies have paid particular attention to the aquifer system underlying the village of van phuc berg et al 2008 eiche et al 2008 glodowska et al 2020a 2020b kontny et al 2021 neidhardt et al 2021 nghiem et al 2020 stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 mostly due to the notably high as concentrations but also because the observed small scale spatial variability of as concentrations is highly representative of many other as affected field sites the van phuc aquifer system also the focus of this study is situated 15 km south east of hanoi inside a meander of the red river fig 1 the study site was selected since it is well characterized and highly typical for geomorphological deltaic structures comprised of more recent sediment depositions that have repeatedly shown to be associated with high as concentrations ravenscroft et al 2005 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sutton et al 2009 at the study site as concentrations in groundwaters reach approximately 500 µg l therefore exceeding the drinking water limits as recommended by the world health organisation who by a factor of up to 50 stopelli et al 2020 a cross section of the stratigraphic and other aquifer characteristics are illustrated in fig 2 the studied transect at around 2 km long stretches from the riverbank in the south east se of the village towards the north west nw the aquifer below the se of the village comprises of younger holocene grey coloured reduced sediments associated with high as concentrations eiche et al 2008 in contrast the aquifer below the nw of the village comprises of older pleistocene more oxidized orange coloured sediments in conjunction with low as concentrations the interface between these two depositional layers is characterised by a transition zone tz this tz shows inter layering features between the two lithological fronts van geen et al 2013 and transitional mineralogical assemblages and redox conditions this lithological boundary and changing redox conditions are understood to be the root cause for the sudden drastic change in as concentrations which drop from 500 µg l upstream of the tz to less than 1 µg l some 30 m downstream of the tz stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 arsenic migration through the tz was further found to be retarded relative to the horizontal groundwater flow van geen et al 2013 most likely and predominantly as a result of as sorbing to the secondary iron minerals that here prevail particularly microcrystalline iron oxyhydr oxides rathi et al 2017 both holocene and pleistocene aquifer sections are underlain by a highly conductive gravel aquifer pleistocene from a depth of around 50 m below ground level and overlain by a silty clay aquitard with a thickness of up to 23 m i e from ground level to aquifer the gravel aquifer contains low as concentrations at 10 µg l stopelli et al 2020 in the central part of the investigated transect figs 1 2 the thickness of the overlying aquitard is reduced to around 10 m and underlain by alternating silt silty fine sands and fine sands down to a depth of around 21 m eiche et al 2017 2008 therefore increasing the permeability in the lower part of the aquitard in contrast at the nw end of the transect i e close to multi level well 11 in fig 1 the aquitard is more homogeneous and extends to a depth of around 23 m in general sand lenses and lenses rich in peat and organic matter om are observed to be inter bedded within the aquitard eiche et al 2017 2008 nowadays the groundwater flow in the investigated transect is in the direction towards hanoi from the red river the current hydraulic gradient in fact opposes the natural conditions of groundwater flow berg et al 2008 stahl et al 2016 van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 as a consequence of the large scale abstraction of groundwater by the municipal waterworks in hanoi fig 1 left as a result of the flow reversal surface water from the red river started to intrude the holocene aquifer from the red river more than 50 years ago stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 and passed the tz approximately 20 years ago wallis et al 2020 this conceptual hydrogeological model is underpinned by previously measured 3h 3he data van geen et al 2013 and by inverse numerical groundwater flow and transport modelling of these data wallis et al 2020 while the seasonality of the region varies between dry november april and monsoon may october stahl et al 2016 have shown that the red river replenishes the holocene aquifer year round this recharging by the red river is demonstrated by the observation that annual fluctuations of the groundwater table in the holocene aquifer closely mimic fluctuations of the red river but are almost always lower than the red river by between around 0 3 1 m the recharging of the aquifer from the red river is further supported by hydrogeochemical data obtained in both seasons berg et al 2008 stopelli et al 2020 2 2 the role of noble gases the gas dynamics of groundwaters can be determined using tracer techniques similar to those applied in studies aimed at groundwater dating and at assessing and quantifying in situ groundwater mixing processes kipfer et al 2002 solomon and aeschbach hertig 2012 for such studies noble gases are commonly employed as environmental tracers since they are already present in the groundwater and importantly are biogeochemically inert the non reactive nature of noble gases allows physical groundwater transport and gas exchange to be separated from chemical reactions making them particularly useful to elucidate the impact of biogeochemical processes such as denitrification blicher mathiesen et al 1998 popp et al 2020 stanley and jenkins 2012 or rapid oxygen consumption kipfer et al 2002 mächler et al 2012 for detection of a gas phase noble gases are ideal tracers since they are physically sensitive to partitioning between the liquid and gaseous phases while remaining insensitive to the biogeochemistry of the surrounding environment kipfer et al 2002 stanley and jenkins 2012 therefore analysing the noble gases alongside major reactive gas components in the groundwater are an asset when simultaneously studying biogeochemical gas formation and physical flow and transport processes 2 2 1 sources sinks and gas dynamics to gain a meaningful interpretation of noble gas concentrations in groundwaters measured gas concentrations are compared with air saturated water asw concentrations of the atmospheric gas species at the typical prevailing conditions for the specific study site for van phuc t 25 c s 0 g kg altitude 10 masl see table 1 any deviation from expected asw concentrations allows excess air ea aeschbach hertig et al 2002 kipfer et al 2002 radiogenic 4he accumulation kipfer et al 2002 solomon et al 1996 strauch 2014 and degassing effects to be quantified all of which are indicative that some physical process has occurred in the studied aquatic environment ea is formed in response to a fluctuating water table and is identified in groundwaters where the full range of atmospheric noble gas concentrations exceed their asw concentrations this atmospheric excess arises as the fluctuating water table traps air pockets in the quasi saturated soil zone which are subsequently subject to an increased overlying hydrostatic pressure as the water table rises thus forcing the excess atmospheric gases to dissolve into the groundwater aeschbach hertig et al 2000 kipfer et al 2002 in addition 4he accumulates in ground pore waters due to the radioactive decay of uranium u and thorium th naturally abundant in the aquifer and aquitard matrix kipfer et al 2002 a large excess of he in groundwater is therefore indicative of radiogenic 4he accumulation which allows for the qualitative dating of older ground pore waters in the range 103 108 he years solomon et al 1996 degassing is the only physical process that produces noble gas concentrations lower than asw concentrations degassing describes the removal of dissolved gas species in the groundwater as a consequence of their re partitioning between the groundwater and a newly formed gas phase aeschbach hertig et al 2008 brennwald et al 2005 visser et al 2007 thus noble gas concentrations below their asw concentrations are indicative that degassing has occurred degassing can be an artifact of sampling i e due to the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure as groundwater flows upward within a monitoring borehole or can occur in situ beneath the water table where biogeochemical gas production has increased the tdgp above the local hydrostatic pressure of the aquifer fortuin and willemsen 2005 klump et al 2006 mookherji et al 2003 stute et al 2007 visser et al 2007 to avoid degassing upon sampling in our field site an electric submersible pump was used and tight clamped connections between the clear tubing and entrance to the membrane module input was ensured see below for details on analytical set up no bubbles entering the module were observed during analysis 2 3 sampling and analysis in november 2018 a field campaign was carried out in which the miniruedi gasometrix gmbh switzerland see brennwald 2018 a self contained portable mass spectrometer was installed at 19 pre existing wells the miniruedi determined noble and reactive gas concentrations in the groundwater figs 1 2 wells 1 15 before analysis with the miniruedi each well was purged and observed to stabilize with respect to ph salinity and o 2 concentrations for wells marked with a in figs 1 2 quantitative sampling was not possible as they tended to run dry after a few minutes of pumping nevertheless some qualitative observations from the well with a single provides valuable complimentary information which have been detailed in the discussion and section s1 2 of the appendix the miniruedi continuously quantifies dissolved gas partial pressures in water which traverses through a membrane module the gas permeable membrane separates out gases dissolved in the water into a head space the head space is connected to the mass spectrometer via a 11 m long capillary through which a small fraction of the gas in the head space is abstracted in addition water temperature and tdgp in the head space are continuously recorded ge mims app patent pending further details on the functionality of this instrument are described in brennwald et al 2016 for the van phuc field site the miniruedi was set up to measure he ar kr n 2 o 2 co 2 and ch 4 partial pressures in groundwater wells a tailored gas mixture consisting of 1 ch 4 1 co 2 1 h 2 and 97 n 2 was used for calibration of ch 4 and co 2 in addition to ambient air as a standard for calibration of the remaining gases i e n 2 o 2 he ar kr partial pressures for the analysed gases can be converted into concentrations of cmstp 3 g centimeter cubed of gas at standard temperature 0 c and pressure 1 atm per gram of water by applying henry s law kipfer et al 2002 solomon and aeschbach hertig 2012 typical analytical uncertainties for the gas analysis carried out by the miniruedi are given in table 1 table 1 further details three key spatial zones identified within the field site also shown in figs 1 2 specifically the upper tz denotes wells situated in the upper part approximately 20 30 m in depth of the tz upstream and downstream zones describe wells situated upstream and downstream respectively to the upper tz wells which fall outside of these three specified zones are located as described in table 1 notably while some wells outside could in principle be assigned to one of the identified zones data is also grouped according to dissolved gas and as concentrations in an effort to gain a meaningful understanding of the overall gas evolution of the field site 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns in tdgp n 2 a r k r and c h 4 data the measured tdgp values vary considerably between 0 5 and 1 6 bar with clear variations recognizable among the three previously specified zones this variation in tdgp along with corresponding as concentrations is illustrated in fig 3 for all analysed wells high concentrations of as are found particularly in the wells where the tdgp exceeds 1 1 bar therefore implying that as exhibits a relationship with the gas specie s that contribute to these high tdgps the different zones are similarly identifiable in fig 4 a and b in which he n 2 ar and kr concentrations have been plotted as functions of ch 4 concentrations notably within the upper tz of fig 4b he displays a distinctly different correlation with ch 4 compared to the purely atmospheric gases displayed in fig 4a since the atmospheric gas concentrations and corresponding trends with ch 4 vary spatially the gas dynamics in each zone are evaluated and discussed individually before observations are synthesized to an overall conceptual model of the gas dynamics and its controls as well as its impacts tdgp highest in the upper tz wells 4a 7 show some of the highest tdgp values ranging between 1 2 1 6 bar table 1 fig 3 that correlate strongly with increasing as concentrations these wells additionally have elevated ch 4 concentrations reaching up to 4 2 10 2 cmstp 3 g table 1 therefore linking tdgp to ch 4 production and high as concentrations within the upper tz although tdgp is high in the upper tz ar kr and n 2 concentrations are depleted with respect to asw values whereby this depletion is highly correlated to increasing ch 4 concentrations fig 4a the observed correlation implies that this gas loss is a result of in situ degassing in response to ch 4 over saturation within the aquifer in the most extreme case around 80 of the expected dissolved atmospheric ar kr and n 2 has been lost from the water phase if prior to degassing the groundwater contained ea the above estimate for gas loss would be higher still further details regarding the in situ saturation threshold of ch 4 for this specific aquifer can be found in section s1 1 of the appendix high tdgp and ea upstream of the tz wells 2 and 3 situated around 100 m upstream of the upper tz show a likewise elevated tdgp to wells in the tz though ch 4 concentrations are an order of magnitude lower i e 10 3 cmstp 3 g here the high tdgp is explained additionally by enhanced concentrations of atmospheric gases due to ea formation ar 10 35 kr 23 see fig 4a in conjunction with the enhanced ch 4 concentrations this observed noble gas enrichment suggests that before enough ch 4 is produced to trigger exsolution near the tz the groundwater is over saturated in atmospheric gases as a result of ea formation well 1 situated close to the river approx 1 5 km upstream of the tz follows a similar trend in tdgp and as concentrations to those in the upper tz fig 3 however in contrast it has negligible ch 4 concentrations table 1 fig 4 excess n 2 is instead responsible for the enhanced tdgp of well 1 this n 2 excess at around 60 seems clearly attributed to denitrification and is not a result of ea formation since comparatively he ar and kr concentrations for this well are either below or close to asw concentrations table 1 although the upper tz and well 1 similarly contain both high as concentrations and a high tdgp the two groundwater types are fundamentally hydrochemically different the enhanced tdgp near the river is primarily the result of nitrate reduction while the tdgp within the more anoxic environment in the upper tz is dominated by ch 4 production downstream zone shows unexpected noble gas concentrations while the general prevailing hydraulic gradient van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 would suggest that the gas depleted groundwater in the upper tz should migrate downstream towards wells 8 10 the gas concentrations in these wells are clearly not characteristic of such a flowpath n 2 ar and kr concentrations in wells 8 10 are more representative of asw like groundwater concentrations subject perhaps only to a very slight gas loss the tdgp in wells 8 10 therefore logically range between 0 8 0 9 bar fig 3 since only negligible concentrations of ch 4 are found notably the atmospheric gas concentrations in wells 8 10 are similar to those in wells 4b and 12 situated just below the upper tz depths 32 m and 36 m respectively table 1 groundwater strongly affected by degassing a further 250 m downstream of the upper tz wells 11a c show greatly reduced tdgp 0 5 0 7 bar fig 3 in conjunction with significantly depleted concentrations of all the atmospheric gases relative to asw concentrations table 1 although no ch 4 for these wells we can conclude that the groundwater was in the past subject to an in aquifer degassing process this interpretation does not limit groundwater here to having passed exactly through the upper tz area any similarly ch 4 active or gas producing zone in the young aquifer could be responsible for the observed gas loss notably well 13 outside of the transect fig 1 table 1 shows similar results with a tdgp of only 0 5 bar and excessively depleted dissolved atmospheric gases collectively these results demonstrate that the local groundwater is strongly affected by in situ degassing 3 2 patterns in he data he accumulation in the upper tz in the case of degassing he as the most volatile noble gas is expected to be comparatively more depleted with respect to asw than n 2 ar and kr however such a depletion for he is not observed in the upper tz where he concentrations instead increase with increasing ch 4 concentrations fig 4b clearly the most strongly degassed groundwater well for n 2 ar and kr in the upper tz coincides with the highest he concentration given these stark comparative differences between n 2 ar kr and he concentrations we anticipate an additional non atmospheric he component i e from radioactive decay and accumulation is here present further we can surmise that some mechanism exists which produces a positive correlation between the additional he component and the observed ch 4 concentrations approximate residence time in the upper tz qualitatively the observed he concentrations can be applied to approximately determine the residence time of groundwater within the upper tz kipfer et al 2002 strauch 2014 utilizing concentration data from well 4a and assuming crudely that all excess i e above asw is the result of radioactive production of 4 he within the aquifer initial groundwater residence time estimates are calculated to be around 10 ka see section s1 5 of the appendix for detailed calculation and discussion reported 14 c dating results across the transition zone show an increase in deposition age from 11 ka in the grey holocene sediments to 13 ka in the tz and 25 ka in the orange pleistocene sediments see si of nghiem et al 2020 table s2 our groundwater age approximation as a result of in situ radiogenic he accumulation is therefore in line with these results although on the upper limit of what might be reasonably expected however caution must be exercised when interpreting such groundwater estimates as a real age and we conclude that our estimate of groundwater residence time is at best an order of magnitude approximation yet only such an approximation is here necessary where the aim is to compare with previously published groundwater ages in the upstream zone to this point groundwater in the upstream zone was recharged around 5 6 decades ago according to 3 h 3 he dating van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 thus the observed non atmospheric he excess in the upper tz clearly suggests much larger groundwater residence times than those reported upstream typical he concentrations in upstream zone wells 2 and 3 show he values close to and slightly above asw concentrations respectively since he is more sensitive to ea than the heavier noble gases kipfer et al 2002 one would expect the relative to asw ea component to be larger for he than ar and kr in these wells the opposite however is observed in fig 4 implying groundwater here was subject to a slight degassing since generally only the typical ea component for he is present in these upstream wells we conclude that the residence time of the groundwater is short enough to prevent substantial radiogenic 4he from accumulating results from these wells are therefore in agreement with available 3h 3he age data van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 high he concentrations not significantly transported outside the upper tz similarly to n 2 ar and kr the he concentrations in the downstream zone are slightly less than the expected asw concentrations and are therefore contrasting with he concentrations in the upper tz this drastic change in he concentrations between the upper tz and specifically around 30 m downstream again implies that groundwater from the upper tz is not efficiently transported downstream wells 8 10 further he concentrations in these downstream wells are comparable to he concentrations in the wells just below the upper tz wells 4b 12 table 1 thus the high he concentrations in the upper tz are also not observed in the few meters below the upper tz wells 4b 12 3 3 inferred gas dynamics and groundwater evolution the observed gas patterns in groundwater of the van phuc aquifers draw a complex picture of the gas evolution particularly within and surrounding the upper tz notably gas production high as concentrations and high he concentrations prevail in the upper tz area these observations in conjunction with the severely contrasting gas concentrations between wells surrounding wells 8 9 10 4b and 12 and wells within the upper tz support our conceptual model hypothesis i which can explain both the gas and groundwater quality evolution at our study site principally hypothesis i expands on the already well documented fact that in aquatic systems where the e g microbiological production of gases is significant enough to generate in situ a free gas phase i e gas bubbles the formed gas phase subsequently blocks part of the available aquifer pore space thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity amos and mayer 2006 fortuin and willemsen 2005 fry et al 1997 heilweil et al 2004 ryan et al 2000 applying this concept to the vicinity of the upper tz signifies that ch 4 as the dominating gas species oversaturates and stimulates not only the degassing of the atmospheric gas species in the groundwater but also constrains groundwater flow through and out of the ch 4 gas producing zone fig 5 hypothesis i thus unifies several key observations in our data i e that 1 a reduced hydraulic conductivity in the upper tz vicinity explains why the concentrations of he ar kr and n 2 are so dissimilar between the upper tz and the surrounding wells namely because only the upper tz wells are subject to reduced groundwater flow and continuous degassing 2 it rationalizes the observed correlation between he and ch 4 but also the correlation between the excessively degassed atmospheric gas species and ch 4 fig 4 and 3 it explains the discrepancy in groundwater residence times between the upstream zone and upper tz i e since the accumulation of non atmospheric he is directly related to the residence time given our observations and the distribution of dissolved gases within the studied aquifer we envision that when gas bubbles of ch 4 form in the vicinity of the upper tz groundwater from upstream diverts both laterally and vertically i e by passing around the local gas producing zone fig 5 this interpretation is also supported by our finding that the surrounding wells generally give similar gas concentrations while the above made points show that hypothesis i explains the majority of our data set rather well the high estimation for groundwater residence time in the upper tz may point to an alternative conceptual model this alternative model hypothesis ii tags the vertical transport of old he rich porewater from the upper aquitard into the underlying aquifer fig 5 as previously discussed some sections of the upper aquitard are more hydraulically transmissive eiche et al 2017 2008 see methods and therefore may allow porewater and associated solutes to percolate or diffusely migrate into the underlying aquifer since aquitard porewaters renew rather slowly they can accumulate significant amounts of radiogenic 4he thus input of 4he rich porewater from the more transmissive sections of the overlying aquitard into the upper aquifer may also explain the observed he enrichment in the groundwater of the upper tz the porewaters of such peat rich layers would likewise be enriched in om rationalizing the positive correlation between the concentrations of ch 4 and he since the om supply would fuel the microbially mediated ch 4 production below the aquitard this second conceptual model thus provides an explanation for the estimated groundwater age being on the upper limit of what might be reasonably expected i e due to increased input of non atmospheric he into the upper aquifer however it is important to note that while hypothesis ii provides an explanation for the required om and is consistent with the observed correlation between he and ch 4 concentrations it does not offer an explanation as to why concentrations within and surrounding the wells of the upper tz are so contrastingly different particularly for the conservative noble gases thus even if this second hypothesis is correct it cannot alone explain the evolution of gases throughout and surrounding the upper tz both hypotheses however may simultaneously be valid further investigation into the solute and gas composition of the aquitard sediments may allow to experimentally assess the plausibility of this second hypothesis particularly quantification of he concentrations in the aquitard pore water would help to disentangle between the two presented hypothesis while degassing in response to ch 4 gas production directly impacts those wells within the upper tz particularly well 4a the highest concentrations of ch 4 for this field site are actually observed in well at 58 mg l stopelli et al 2021 or 8 1 10 2 cm stp 3 g which has the same depth as well 4a further discussed in section s1 2 of the appendix this implies that the gas producing zone extends further upstream of the tz where wells 2 and 3 define a boundary in which more normal noble gas concentrations in groundwater are observed thus we anticipate that the most favourable conditions necessary for degassing to prevail are specifically between the here defined tz wells and well in principle however two independent gas producing hotspots may also exist though the overall observations provide convincing evidence that gas loss as a consequence of in situ degassing has and may persist to occur within the aquifer the fate of the ch 4 gas bubbles which become enriched with both noble and other gases in the groundwater remains currently unclear one possibility is that emanation of ch 4 rich gas may from time to time occur from individual wells see discussion in section s1 1 of the appendix 3 4 seasonal and potential anthropogenic influences one factor yet to be considered are the effects of seasonal fluctuations in the water table annual fluctuations of up to 3 m have been observed in the holocene aquifer at van phuc stahl et al 2016 thus indicating that degassing has the potential to be intensified when the water table drops to its lowest point around march as the water table drops both the hydrostatic pressure and the saturation concentration of ch 4 is lowered thus making bubble formation at a specific depth in the aquifer more viable it could therefore be interesting to repeat a study of the gas dynamics around march time to confirm how the gas analysis develops into the dry season similarly increased localised pumping could also exacerbate the production of ch 4 gas in response to a lowered water table while there is no current available data on the extent to which groundwater is being pumped to irrigate locally the overall effect on the here presented hypotheses at the time of the study seems minimal if local pumping was severe the forced renewal of groundwater i e from underneath the pumped well would remove the capacity of the hydraulically isolated zone to contain such a large excess in radiogenic he as observed in the upper tz notably however if the wells are indeed sometimes used for irrigation some of the ch 4 gas enriched with atmospheric gases may be liberated each time the well is opened thus offering an explanation as to how some of the ch 4 gas may leave the aquifer system conversely groundwater entrapped in such gas producing zones may from time to time be released e g if the water table significantly rises increasing the solubility of ch 4 or a new well is installed temporarily releasing gas pressure we highlight this possibility due to the observation that several wells i e 11a c 13 and 15 in the study site show depletion of the atmospheric gases in conjunction with low ch 4 concentrations and a tdgp considerably lower than 1 bar indicating groundwater in those wells must at some point have escaped or bypassed a gas producing zone whilst some of the above discussed seasonal and anthropogenic influences are more speculative than others it s important to emphasize the sensitivity in the dynamics of such gas producing zones and consider what consequences such influences may have 3 5 mineralogical observations a reduced hydraulic conductivity in a ch 4 gas producing zone is expected to have an impact on local mineralogy to which as im mobilisation is unequivocally linked more stable fe ii minerals and or a more complete reduction of fe iii minerals should in principle form under the precursor of longer groundwater residence times to properly compare the mineralogy both within and outside a hydraulically slowed zone samples from both locations should be acquired and ideally without the added complexity of a geochemically active redox front nearby while such comparative data is not explicitly available some mineralogical observations from sediment cores obtained at this study site either adjacent to or in an alternately predicted gas producing zone are considered below eiche et al 2008 kontny et al 2021 nghiem et al 2020 distinctively two independent studies eiche et al 2008 nghiem et al 2020 identified the presence of the stable secondary fe carbonate mineral siderite in parts of the younger aquifer where the highest ch 4 concentrations have also been observed siderite was specifically observed in sediments close to well nghiem et al 2020 see cluster 4 analysis but also in sediments located more centrally along the transect eiche et al 2008 where ch 4 concentrations reach 40 mg l stopelli et al 2021 the point to which siderite is an important observation is the particularly slow reaction kinetics required for this mineral to form postma 1982 thus a hydraulically restricted zone could offer the ideal environment to conceptualize siderite formation in addition we note the formation of the secondary fe mineral magnetite in the grey sands between depths of 20 30 m reported close to the upper tz and implying high rates of fe iii reduction kontny et al 2021 thus the mineralogical research so far published in van phuc are not in contradiction and in some cases rather corroborate our conceptual model namely hypothesis i however given the complexity of the tz mineralogy caution is required not to over interpret such data particularly in the study by nghiem et al 2020 where the cluster analysis also included some samples from outside the here identified high ch 4 gas producing zone for a proper understanding of the mineralogy in a hydraulically slowed zone samples should ideally be taken away from the complication of an immediately impinging redox front such an analysis therefore calls for further investigation 3 6 potential consequences on as transport the discussed gas evolution and its hydrogeological consequences unquestionably have a profound affect on as transport and distribution in van phuc while our results show that as is itself linked to gas production in particular ch 4 the physical effect that such a free gas phase subsequently has on the surrounding environment is an important constraint for predicting future contaminant transport in van phuc the riverbed has been previously identified as a key contributor to the source of dissolved as wallis et al 2020 therefore as carried downstream towards localised gas producing zones is forced to by pass around such zones thus altering the expected as distribution to what might be expected from the current hydrogeological understanding of the field site further a reduced hydraulic conductivity within an as mobilizing and ch 4 gas producing hotspot means the timescales of associated biogeochemical reactions will be substantially affected as a result of the increased groundwater residence time more crystalline and hence less reactive forms of iron often linked with as release can be reductively dissolved while the formation of more stable fe minerals as discussed in section 3 5 is also anticipated accumulation of mobilised as in the ch 4 gas producing zone analogously to how he concentrations accumulate here in the upper tz would also be exacerbated this point in particular tempts us to formulate a provoking hypothesis based on the general observation of high free gas production and high as concentrations accumulation of as simply occurs in zones where there is reduced groundwater movement as the ch 4 gas bubbles do not allow the as to escape thus as accumulates to high concentrations where there is excessive gas e g ch 4 production due to a lack of physical transport given the above discussed repercussions that high gas production has on as transport and mobilization we conclude that such gas producing zones contribute to the wide spread heterogeneity often observed in contaminated aquifers smedley and kinniburgh 2002 van geen et al 2006 4 conclusions in this paper we demonstrate that elevated as concentrations could be the consequence of the substantially increased total dissolved gas pressure tdgp that is generated by the in situ biogeochemical production of ch 4 while degassing stute et al 2007 and elevated tdgp postma et al 2012 have been reported in several contaminated aquifers which exhibit correlating ch 4 and as concentrations dowling et al 2002 jessen et al 2008 postma et al 2007 2012 stute et al 2007 the consequence of such gas production in relation to the hydrogeology mobilization and heterogeneity of as in contaminated aquifers has until now not been considered we further point out that while groundwater age generally provides good initial boundary conditions for the hydrogeology of such field sites assessing groundwater residence times by applying transient trace gas measurements e g 3h 3he in cases where degassing occurs is notoriously difficult as such alternative methods that give insight to the hydrogeology of contaminated aquifers becomes hugely beneficial the combined analysis of reactive gases alongside conservative noble gases in the field can therefore help not to only reveal in aquifer degassing events in contaminated aquifers but also to provide certain constraints on the hydrogeology and thus highlight the relevant timescales necessary to consider for the as mobilizing mechanism itself declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16200,groundwater contamination of geogenic arsenic as remains a global health threat particularly in south east asia the prominent correlation often observed between high as concentrations and methane ch 4 stimulated the analysis of the gas dynamics in an as contaminated aquifer whereby noble and reactive gases were analysed results show a progressive depletion of atmospheric gases ar kr and n 2 alongside highly increasing ch 4 implying that a free gas phase comprised mainly of ch 4 is formed within the aquifer in contrast helium he concentrations are high within the ch 4 gas producing zone suggesting longer groundwater residence times we hypothesized that the observed free ch 4 gas phase severely detracts local groundwater flow and significantly reduces water renewal within the gas producing zone results are in line with this hypothesis however a second hypothesis has been developed which focuses on the potential transport of he from an adjacent aquitard into the ch 4 gas producing zone this second hypothesis was formulated as it resolves the particularly high he concentrations observed and since external solute input from the overlying heterogeneous aquitard cannot be excluded the proposed feedback between the gas phase and hydraulics provides a plausible explanation of the anti intuitive correlation between high as and ch 4 and the spatially highly patchy distribution of dissolved as concentrations in contaminated aquifers furthermore the increased groundwater residence time would allow for the dissolution of more crystalline as hosting iron fe oxide phases in conjunction with the formation of more stable secondary fe minerals in the hydraulically slowed i e gas producing zone a subject which calls for further investigation keywords gas production degassing helium reduced flow methane 1 introduction globally many valuable groundwater resources are severely affected by high levels of arsenic as naujokas et al 2013 nordstrom 2002 podgorski and berg 2020 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 particularly in the river deltaic regions of south and south east asia as contaminated aquifers which supply water for local drinking and irrigation coincide with high population densities berg et al 2007 buschmann et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 culminating in a high risk of as exposure and detrimental health impacts abedin et al 2002 berg et al 2001 buschmann et al 2008 huq et al 2006 to understand the origin and extent of as contamination in affected aquifers the spatial distribution of as fendorf et al 2010 podgorski and berg 2020 how as partitions between aqueous and solid phases and the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the partitioning of as have been topics intensively investigated over the last two decades a crucial conclusion of these studies is that as mobilization primarily occurs in conjunction with the microbially mediated reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides anawar et al 2006 berg et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 2000 ravenscroft et al 2011 which is often controlled by the availability of suitable organic carbon sources wallis et al 2020 this reductive dissolution mechanism is commonly accompanied by positive correlations of as concentrations with iron fe dissolved organic carbon doc ammonium nh 4 and methane ch 4 concentrations in groundwater dowling et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 postma et al 2007 ravenscroft et al 2011 stopelli et al 2020 one of the most puzzling observations is the often close correlation between high as and ch 4 concentrations dowling et al 2002 jessen et al 2008 postma et al 2007 although such studies suggest that ch 4 is an indicator of organic matter degradation no specific mechanism to explain the correlating relationship between as and ch 4 was identified more recently however glodowska et al 2020b found evidence for a potential reaction pathway in which ch 4 acts as electron donor for the direct microbially mediated reduction of fe oxides and concurrent as release yet a full mechanistic link between as and ch 4 gas production which also considers hydrogeological processes remains undetermined deciphering such a possible link calls for an in depth analysis of the overall gas dynamics that characterizes as bearing hydrochemically reduced aquifers elucidating the behaviour of the reactive gas ch 4 requires to simultaneously study the evolution of carbon dioxide co 2 and nitrogen n 2 since these gases are also considerable contributors to the total dissolved gas pressure tdgp in groundwaters therefore making them likewise relevant for determining the overall gas dynamics of an aquifer importantly where tdgp exceeds the in situ hydrostatic pressure of an aquifer a free gas phase will form due to exsolution of oversaturated gases within the groundwater fry et al 1997 the formation of such free gas phases can locally reduce the hydraulic conductivity and significantly interrupt groundwater flow amos and mayer 2006 fortuin and willemsen 2005 fry et al 1997 heilweil et al 2004 ryan et al 2000 thomas et al 2003 while the observation of a free gas phase existing beneath the water table of as contaminated aquifers has been previously observed postma et al 2012 stute et al 2007 no attempt to link such a change in the physical transport characteristics to as concentrations and distributions within contaminated aquifers has been made to date in this study we hypothesize that such in aquifer gas phase production can result in vastly increased groundwater residence times therefore increasing exposure times among critical reactants that govern kinetically controlled as release in particular an increased residence time allows for e g the reductive dissolution of more crystalline and thus less reactive forms of iron and associated as release and more stable fe ii minerals to form thus studying the production and evolution of reactive gases in hydrochemically reduced groundwater is an important aspect which allows us to elucidate a previously overlooked hydrogeological mechanistic link between ch 4 production and elevated as concentrations in affected groundwater flow systems by combining noble gas tracer techniques kipfer et al 2002 with the analysis of reactive gas species in groundwater we employ a unique tool set to determine gas and groundwater dynamics in an as contaminated aquifer we evaluate our hypothesis for a well studied aquifer near hanoi vietnam where complex and interlinked hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes govern the fate of as we assess how the analysed gases co evolve and how they evolve in relation to as groundwater concentrations with the overall aim to establish a mechanistic link between ch 4 gas formation and elevated as concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site background and geological setting the selected study site near hanoi vietnam has a rich history of detailed investigations that began over two decades ago the first in depth study to disclose the extent of as contamination along the alluvial planes of the red river deltaic region was performed by berg et al 2001 these initial findings were complemented by subsequent studies characterizing the geological lithological mineralogical and hydrochemical features of the delta many of these studies have paid particular attention to the aquifer system underlying the village of van phuc berg et al 2008 eiche et al 2008 glodowska et al 2020a 2020b kontny et al 2021 neidhardt et al 2021 nghiem et al 2020 stahl et al 2016 stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 mostly due to the notably high as concentrations but also because the observed small scale spatial variability of as concentrations is highly representative of many other as affected field sites the van phuc aquifer system also the focus of this study is situated 15 km south east of hanoi inside a meander of the red river fig 1 the study site was selected since it is well characterized and highly typical for geomorphological deltaic structures comprised of more recent sediment depositions that have repeatedly shown to be associated with high as concentrations ravenscroft et al 2005 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sutton et al 2009 at the study site as concentrations in groundwaters reach approximately 500 µg l therefore exceeding the drinking water limits as recommended by the world health organisation who by a factor of up to 50 stopelli et al 2020 a cross section of the stratigraphic and other aquifer characteristics are illustrated in fig 2 the studied transect at around 2 km long stretches from the riverbank in the south east se of the village towards the north west nw the aquifer below the se of the village comprises of younger holocene grey coloured reduced sediments associated with high as concentrations eiche et al 2008 in contrast the aquifer below the nw of the village comprises of older pleistocene more oxidized orange coloured sediments in conjunction with low as concentrations the interface between these two depositional layers is characterised by a transition zone tz this tz shows inter layering features between the two lithological fronts van geen et al 2013 and transitional mineralogical assemblages and redox conditions this lithological boundary and changing redox conditions are understood to be the root cause for the sudden drastic change in as concentrations which drop from 500 µg l upstream of the tz to less than 1 µg l some 30 m downstream of the tz stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 arsenic migration through the tz was further found to be retarded relative to the horizontal groundwater flow van geen et al 2013 most likely and predominantly as a result of as sorbing to the secondary iron minerals that here prevail particularly microcrystalline iron oxyhydr oxides rathi et al 2017 both holocene and pleistocene aquifer sections are underlain by a highly conductive gravel aquifer pleistocene from a depth of around 50 m below ground level and overlain by a silty clay aquitard with a thickness of up to 23 m i e from ground level to aquifer the gravel aquifer contains low as concentrations at 10 µg l stopelli et al 2020 in the central part of the investigated transect figs 1 2 the thickness of the overlying aquitard is reduced to around 10 m and underlain by alternating silt silty fine sands and fine sands down to a depth of around 21 m eiche et al 2017 2008 therefore increasing the permeability in the lower part of the aquitard in contrast at the nw end of the transect i e close to multi level well 11 in fig 1 the aquitard is more homogeneous and extends to a depth of around 23 m in general sand lenses and lenses rich in peat and organic matter om are observed to be inter bedded within the aquitard eiche et al 2017 2008 nowadays the groundwater flow in the investigated transect is in the direction towards hanoi from the red river the current hydraulic gradient in fact opposes the natural conditions of groundwater flow berg et al 2008 stahl et al 2016 van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 as a consequence of the large scale abstraction of groundwater by the municipal waterworks in hanoi fig 1 left as a result of the flow reversal surface water from the red river started to intrude the holocene aquifer from the red river more than 50 years ago stopelli et al 2020 van geen et al 2013 and passed the tz approximately 20 years ago wallis et al 2020 this conceptual hydrogeological model is underpinned by previously measured 3h 3he data van geen et al 2013 and by inverse numerical groundwater flow and transport modelling of these data wallis et al 2020 while the seasonality of the region varies between dry november april and monsoon may october stahl et al 2016 have shown that the red river replenishes the holocene aquifer year round this recharging by the red river is demonstrated by the observation that annual fluctuations of the groundwater table in the holocene aquifer closely mimic fluctuations of the red river but are almost always lower than the red river by between around 0 3 1 m the recharging of the aquifer from the red river is further supported by hydrogeochemical data obtained in both seasons berg et al 2008 stopelli et al 2020 2 2 the role of noble gases the gas dynamics of groundwaters can be determined using tracer techniques similar to those applied in studies aimed at groundwater dating and at assessing and quantifying in situ groundwater mixing processes kipfer et al 2002 solomon and aeschbach hertig 2012 for such studies noble gases are commonly employed as environmental tracers since they are already present in the groundwater and importantly are biogeochemically inert the non reactive nature of noble gases allows physical groundwater transport and gas exchange to be separated from chemical reactions making them particularly useful to elucidate the impact of biogeochemical processes such as denitrification blicher mathiesen et al 1998 popp et al 2020 stanley and jenkins 2012 or rapid oxygen consumption kipfer et al 2002 mächler et al 2012 for detection of a gas phase noble gases are ideal tracers since they are physically sensitive to partitioning between the liquid and gaseous phases while remaining insensitive to the biogeochemistry of the surrounding environment kipfer et al 2002 stanley and jenkins 2012 therefore analysing the noble gases alongside major reactive gas components in the groundwater are an asset when simultaneously studying biogeochemical gas formation and physical flow and transport processes 2 2 1 sources sinks and gas dynamics to gain a meaningful interpretation of noble gas concentrations in groundwaters measured gas concentrations are compared with air saturated water asw concentrations of the atmospheric gas species at the typical prevailing conditions for the specific study site for van phuc t 25 c s 0 g kg altitude 10 masl see table 1 any deviation from expected asw concentrations allows excess air ea aeschbach hertig et al 2002 kipfer et al 2002 radiogenic 4he accumulation kipfer et al 2002 solomon et al 1996 strauch 2014 and degassing effects to be quantified all of which are indicative that some physical process has occurred in the studied aquatic environment ea is formed in response to a fluctuating water table and is identified in groundwaters where the full range of atmospheric noble gas concentrations exceed their asw concentrations this atmospheric excess arises as the fluctuating water table traps air pockets in the quasi saturated soil zone which are subsequently subject to an increased overlying hydrostatic pressure as the water table rises thus forcing the excess atmospheric gases to dissolve into the groundwater aeschbach hertig et al 2000 kipfer et al 2002 in addition 4he accumulates in ground pore waters due to the radioactive decay of uranium u and thorium th naturally abundant in the aquifer and aquitard matrix kipfer et al 2002 a large excess of he in groundwater is therefore indicative of radiogenic 4he accumulation which allows for the qualitative dating of older ground pore waters in the range 103 108 he years solomon et al 1996 degassing is the only physical process that produces noble gas concentrations lower than asw concentrations degassing describes the removal of dissolved gas species in the groundwater as a consequence of their re partitioning between the groundwater and a newly formed gas phase aeschbach hertig et al 2008 brennwald et al 2005 visser et al 2007 thus noble gas concentrations below their asw concentrations are indicative that degassing has occurred degassing can be an artifact of sampling i e due to the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure as groundwater flows upward within a monitoring borehole or can occur in situ beneath the water table where biogeochemical gas production has increased the tdgp above the local hydrostatic pressure of the aquifer fortuin and willemsen 2005 klump et al 2006 mookherji et al 2003 stute et al 2007 visser et al 2007 to avoid degassing upon sampling in our field site an electric submersible pump was used and tight clamped connections between the clear tubing and entrance to the membrane module input was ensured see below for details on analytical set up no bubbles entering the module were observed during analysis 2 3 sampling and analysis in november 2018 a field campaign was carried out in which the miniruedi gasometrix gmbh switzerland see brennwald 2018 a self contained portable mass spectrometer was installed at 19 pre existing wells the miniruedi determined noble and reactive gas concentrations in the groundwater figs 1 2 wells 1 15 before analysis with the miniruedi each well was purged and observed to stabilize with respect to ph salinity and o 2 concentrations for wells marked with a in figs 1 2 quantitative sampling was not possible as they tended to run dry after a few minutes of pumping nevertheless some qualitative observations from the well with a single provides valuable complimentary information which have been detailed in the discussion and section s1 2 of the appendix the miniruedi continuously quantifies dissolved gas partial pressures in water which traverses through a membrane module the gas permeable membrane separates out gases dissolved in the water into a head space the head space is connected to the mass spectrometer via a 11 m long capillary through which a small fraction of the gas in the head space is abstracted in addition water temperature and tdgp in the head space are continuously recorded ge mims app patent pending further details on the functionality of this instrument are described in brennwald et al 2016 for the van phuc field site the miniruedi was set up to measure he ar kr n 2 o 2 co 2 and ch 4 partial pressures in groundwater wells a tailored gas mixture consisting of 1 ch 4 1 co 2 1 h 2 and 97 n 2 was used for calibration of ch 4 and co 2 in addition to ambient air as a standard for calibration of the remaining gases i e n 2 o 2 he ar kr partial pressures for the analysed gases can be converted into concentrations of cmstp 3 g centimeter cubed of gas at standard temperature 0 c and pressure 1 atm per gram of water by applying henry s law kipfer et al 2002 solomon and aeschbach hertig 2012 typical analytical uncertainties for the gas analysis carried out by the miniruedi are given in table 1 table 1 further details three key spatial zones identified within the field site also shown in figs 1 2 specifically the upper tz denotes wells situated in the upper part approximately 20 30 m in depth of the tz upstream and downstream zones describe wells situated upstream and downstream respectively to the upper tz wells which fall outside of these three specified zones are located as described in table 1 notably while some wells outside could in principle be assigned to one of the identified zones data is also grouped according to dissolved gas and as concentrations in an effort to gain a meaningful understanding of the overall gas evolution of the field site 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns in tdgp n 2 a r k r and c h 4 data the measured tdgp values vary considerably between 0 5 and 1 6 bar with clear variations recognizable among the three previously specified zones this variation in tdgp along with corresponding as concentrations is illustrated in fig 3 for all analysed wells high concentrations of as are found particularly in the wells where the tdgp exceeds 1 1 bar therefore implying that as exhibits a relationship with the gas specie s that contribute to these high tdgps the different zones are similarly identifiable in fig 4 a and b in which he n 2 ar and kr concentrations have been plotted as functions of ch 4 concentrations notably within the upper tz of fig 4b he displays a distinctly different correlation with ch 4 compared to the purely atmospheric gases displayed in fig 4a since the atmospheric gas concentrations and corresponding trends with ch 4 vary spatially the gas dynamics in each zone are evaluated and discussed individually before observations are synthesized to an overall conceptual model of the gas dynamics and its controls as well as its impacts tdgp highest in the upper tz wells 4a 7 show some of the highest tdgp values ranging between 1 2 1 6 bar table 1 fig 3 that correlate strongly with increasing as concentrations these wells additionally have elevated ch 4 concentrations reaching up to 4 2 10 2 cmstp 3 g table 1 therefore linking tdgp to ch 4 production and high as concentrations within the upper tz although tdgp is high in the upper tz ar kr and n 2 concentrations are depleted with respect to asw values whereby this depletion is highly correlated to increasing ch 4 concentrations fig 4a the observed correlation implies that this gas loss is a result of in situ degassing in response to ch 4 over saturation within the aquifer in the most extreme case around 80 of the expected dissolved atmospheric ar kr and n 2 has been lost from the water phase if prior to degassing the groundwater contained ea the above estimate for gas loss would be higher still further details regarding the in situ saturation threshold of ch 4 for this specific aquifer can be found in section s1 1 of the appendix high tdgp and ea upstream of the tz wells 2 and 3 situated around 100 m upstream of the upper tz show a likewise elevated tdgp to wells in the tz though ch 4 concentrations are an order of magnitude lower i e 10 3 cmstp 3 g here the high tdgp is explained additionally by enhanced concentrations of atmospheric gases due to ea formation ar 10 35 kr 23 see fig 4a in conjunction with the enhanced ch 4 concentrations this observed noble gas enrichment suggests that before enough ch 4 is produced to trigger exsolution near the tz the groundwater is over saturated in atmospheric gases as a result of ea formation well 1 situated close to the river approx 1 5 km upstream of the tz follows a similar trend in tdgp and as concentrations to those in the upper tz fig 3 however in contrast it has negligible ch 4 concentrations table 1 fig 4 excess n 2 is instead responsible for the enhanced tdgp of well 1 this n 2 excess at around 60 seems clearly attributed to denitrification and is not a result of ea formation since comparatively he ar and kr concentrations for this well are either below or close to asw concentrations table 1 although the upper tz and well 1 similarly contain both high as concentrations and a high tdgp the two groundwater types are fundamentally hydrochemically different the enhanced tdgp near the river is primarily the result of nitrate reduction while the tdgp within the more anoxic environment in the upper tz is dominated by ch 4 production downstream zone shows unexpected noble gas concentrations while the general prevailing hydraulic gradient van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 would suggest that the gas depleted groundwater in the upper tz should migrate downstream towards wells 8 10 the gas concentrations in these wells are clearly not characteristic of such a flowpath n 2 ar and kr concentrations in wells 8 10 are more representative of asw like groundwater concentrations subject perhaps only to a very slight gas loss the tdgp in wells 8 10 therefore logically range between 0 8 0 9 bar fig 3 since only negligible concentrations of ch 4 are found notably the atmospheric gas concentrations in wells 8 10 are similar to those in wells 4b and 12 situated just below the upper tz depths 32 m and 36 m respectively table 1 groundwater strongly affected by degassing a further 250 m downstream of the upper tz wells 11a c show greatly reduced tdgp 0 5 0 7 bar fig 3 in conjunction with significantly depleted concentrations of all the atmospheric gases relative to asw concentrations table 1 although no ch 4 for these wells we can conclude that the groundwater was in the past subject to an in aquifer degassing process this interpretation does not limit groundwater here to having passed exactly through the upper tz area any similarly ch 4 active or gas producing zone in the young aquifer could be responsible for the observed gas loss notably well 13 outside of the transect fig 1 table 1 shows similar results with a tdgp of only 0 5 bar and excessively depleted dissolved atmospheric gases collectively these results demonstrate that the local groundwater is strongly affected by in situ degassing 3 2 patterns in he data he accumulation in the upper tz in the case of degassing he as the most volatile noble gas is expected to be comparatively more depleted with respect to asw than n 2 ar and kr however such a depletion for he is not observed in the upper tz where he concentrations instead increase with increasing ch 4 concentrations fig 4b clearly the most strongly degassed groundwater well for n 2 ar and kr in the upper tz coincides with the highest he concentration given these stark comparative differences between n 2 ar kr and he concentrations we anticipate an additional non atmospheric he component i e from radioactive decay and accumulation is here present further we can surmise that some mechanism exists which produces a positive correlation between the additional he component and the observed ch 4 concentrations approximate residence time in the upper tz qualitatively the observed he concentrations can be applied to approximately determine the residence time of groundwater within the upper tz kipfer et al 2002 strauch 2014 utilizing concentration data from well 4a and assuming crudely that all excess i e above asw is the result of radioactive production of 4 he within the aquifer initial groundwater residence time estimates are calculated to be around 10 ka see section s1 5 of the appendix for detailed calculation and discussion reported 14 c dating results across the transition zone show an increase in deposition age from 11 ka in the grey holocene sediments to 13 ka in the tz and 25 ka in the orange pleistocene sediments see si of nghiem et al 2020 table s2 our groundwater age approximation as a result of in situ radiogenic he accumulation is therefore in line with these results although on the upper limit of what might be reasonably expected however caution must be exercised when interpreting such groundwater estimates as a real age and we conclude that our estimate of groundwater residence time is at best an order of magnitude approximation yet only such an approximation is here necessary where the aim is to compare with previously published groundwater ages in the upstream zone to this point groundwater in the upstream zone was recharged around 5 6 decades ago according to 3 h 3 he dating van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 thus the observed non atmospheric he excess in the upper tz clearly suggests much larger groundwater residence times than those reported upstream typical he concentrations in upstream zone wells 2 and 3 show he values close to and slightly above asw concentrations respectively since he is more sensitive to ea than the heavier noble gases kipfer et al 2002 one would expect the relative to asw ea component to be larger for he than ar and kr in these wells the opposite however is observed in fig 4 implying groundwater here was subject to a slight degassing since generally only the typical ea component for he is present in these upstream wells we conclude that the residence time of the groundwater is short enough to prevent substantial radiogenic 4he from accumulating results from these wells are therefore in agreement with available 3h 3he age data van geen et al 2013 wallis et al 2020 high he concentrations not significantly transported outside the upper tz similarly to n 2 ar and kr the he concentrations in the downstream zone are slightly less than the expected asw concentrations and are therefore contrasting with he concentrations in the upper tz this drastic change in he concentrations between the upper tz and specifically around 30 m downstream again implies that groundwater from the upper tz is not efficiently transported downstream wells 8 10 further he concentrations in these downstream wells are comparable to he concentrations in the wells just below the upper tz wells 4b 12 table 1 thus the high he concentrations in the upper tz are also not observed in the few meters below the upper tz wells 4b 12 3 3 inferred gas dynamics and groundwater evolution the observed gas patterns in groundwater of the van phuc aquifers draw a complex picture of the gas evolution particularly within and surrounding the upper tz notably gas production high as concentrations and high he concentrations prevail in the upper tz area these observations in conjunction with the severely contrasting gas concentrations between wells surrounding wells 8 9 10 4b and 12 and wells within the upper tz support our conceptual model hypothesis i which can explain both the gas and groundwater quality evolution at our study site principally hypothesis i expands on the already well documented fact that in aquatic systems where the e g microbiological production of gases is significant enough to generate in situ a free gas phase i e gas bubbles the formed gas phase subsequently blocks part of the available aquifer pore space thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity amos and mayer 2006 fortuin and willemsen 2005 fry et al 1997 heilweil et al 2004 ryan et al 2000 applying this concept to the vicinity of the upper tz signifies that ch 4 as the dominating gas species oversaturates and stimulates not only the degassing of the atmospheric gas species in the groundwater but also constrains groundwater flow through and out of the ch 4 gas producing zone fig 5 hypothesis i thus unifies several key observations in our data i e that 1 a reduced hydraulic conductivity in the upper tz vicinity explains why the concentrations of he ar kr and n 2 are so dissimilar between the upper tz and the surrounding wells namely because only the upper tz wells are subject to reduced groundwater flow and continuous degassing 2 it rationalizes the observed correlation between he and ch 4 but also the correlation between the excessively degassed atmospheric gas species and ch 4 fig 4 and 3 it explains the discrepancy in groundwater residence times between the upstream zone and upper tz i e since the accumulation of non atmospheric he is directly related to the residence time given our observations and the distribution of dissolved gases within the studied aquifer we envision that when gas bubbles of ch 4 form in the vicinity of the upper tz groundwater from upstream diverts both laterally and vertically i e by passing around the local gas producing zone fig 5 this interpretation is also supported by our finding that the surrounding wells generally give similar gas concentrations while the above made points show that hypothesis i explains the majority of our data set rather well the high estimation for groundwater residence time in the upper tz may point to an alternative conceptual model this alternative model hypothesis ii tags the vertical transport of old he rich porewater from the upper aquitard into the underlying aquifer fig 5 as previously discussed some sections of the upper aquitard are more hydraulically transmissive eiche et al 2017 2008 see methods and therefore may allow porewater and associated solutes to percolate or diffusely migrate into the underlying aquifer since aquitard porewaters renew rather slowly they can accumulate significant amounts of radiogenic 4he thus input of 4he rich porewater from the more transmissive sections of the overlying aquitard into the upper aquifer may also explain the observed he enrichment in the groundwater of the upper tz the porewaters of such peat rich layers would likewise be enriched in om rationalizing the positive correlation between the concentrations of ch 4 and he since the om supply would fuel the microbially mediated ch 4 production below the aquitard this second conceptual model thus provides an explanation for the estimated groundwater age being on the upper limit of what might be reasonably expected i e due to increased input of non atmospheric he into the upper aquifer however it is important to note that while hypothesis ii provides an explanation for the required om and is consistent with the observed correlation between he and ch 4 concentrations it does not offer an explanation as to why concentrations within and surrounding the wells of the upper tz are so contrastingly different particularly for the conservative noble gases thus even if this second hypothesis is correct it cannot alone explain the evolution of gases throughout and surrounding the upper tz both hypotheses however may simultaneously be valid further investigation into the solute and gas composition of the aquitard sediments may allow to experimentally assess the plausibility of this second hypothesis particularly quantification of he concentrations in the aquitard pore water would help to disentangle between the two presented hypothesis while degassing in response to ch 4 gas production directly impacts those wells within the upper tz particularly well 4a the highest concentrations of ch 4 for this field site are actually observed in well at 58 mg l stopelli et al 2021 or 8 1 10 2 cm stp 3 g which has the same depth as well 4a further discussed in section s1 2 of the appendix this implies that the gas producing zone extends further upstream of the tz where wells 2 and 3 define a boundary in which more normal noble gas concentrations in groundwater are observed thus we anticipate that the most favourable conditions necessary for degassing to prevail are specifically between the here defined tz wells and well in principle however two independent gas producing hotspots may also exist though the overall observations provide convincing evidence that gas loss as a consequence of in situ degassing has and may persist to occur within the aquifer the fate of the ch 4 gas bubbles which become enriched with both noble and other gases in the groundwater remains currently unclear one possibility is that emanation of ch 4 rich gas may from time to time occur from individual wells see discussion in section s1 1 of the appendix 3 4 seasonal and potential anthropogenic influences one factor yet to be considered are the effects of seasonal fluctuations in the water table annual fluctuations of up to 3 m have been observed in the holocene aquifer at van phuc stahl et al 2016 thus indicating that degassing has the potential to be intensified when the water table drops to its lowest point around march as the water table drops both the hydrostatic pressure and the saturation concentration of ch 4 is lowered thus making bubble formation at a specific depth in the aquifer more viable it could therefore be interesting to repeat a study of the gas dynamics around march time to confirm how the gas analysis develops into the dry season similarly increased localised pumping could also exacerbate the production of ch 4 gas in response to a lowered water table while there is no current available data on the extent to which groundwater is being pumped to irrigate locally the overall effect on the here presented hypotheses at the time of the study seems minimal if local pumping was severe the forced renewal of groundwater i e from underneath the pumped well would remove the capacity of the hydraulically isolated zone to contain such a large excess in radiogenic he as observed in the upper tz notably however if the wells are indeed sometimes used for irrigation some of the ch 4 gas enriched with atmospheric gases may be liberated each time the well is opened thus offering an explanation as to how some of the ch 4 gas may leave the aquifer system conversely groundwater entrapped in such gas producing zones may from time to time be released e g if the water table significantly rises increasing the solubility of ch 4 or a new well is installed temporarily releasing gas pressure we highlight this possibility due to the observation that several wells i e 11a c 13 and 15 in the study site show depletion of the atmospheric gases in conjunction with low ch 4 concentrations and a tdgp considerably lower than 1 bar indicating groundwater in those wells must at some point have escaped or bypassed a gas producing zone whilst some of the above discussed seasonal and anthropogenic influences are more speculative than others it s important to emphasize the sensitivity in the dynamics of such gas producing zones and consider what consequences such influences may have 3 5 mineralogical observations a reduced hydraulic conductivity in a ch 4 gas producing zone is expected to have an impact on local mineralogy to which as im mobilisation is unequivocally linked more stable fe ii minerals and or a more complete reduction of fe iii minerals should in principle form under the precursor of longer groundwater residence times to properly compare the mineralogy both within and outside a hydraulically slowed zone samples from both locations should be acquired and ideally without the added complexity of a geochemically active redox front nearby while such comparative data is not explicitly available some mineralogical observations from sediment cores obtained at this study site either adjacent to or in an alternately predicted gas producing zone are considered below eiche et al 2008 kontny et al 2021 nghiem et al 2020 distinctively two independent studies eiche et al 2008 nghiem et al 2020 identified the presence of the stable secondary fe carbonate mineral siderite in parts of the younger aquifer where the highest ch 4 concentrations have also been observed siderite was specifically observed in sediments close to well nghiem et al 2020 see cluster 4 analysis but also in sediments located more centrally along the transect eiche et al 2008 where ch 4 concentrations reach 40 mg l stopelli et al 2021 the point to which siderite is an important observation is the particularly slow reaction kinetics required for this mineral to form postma 1982 thus a hydraulically restricted zone could offer the ideal environment to conceptualize siderite formation in addition we note the formation of the secondary fe mineral magnetite in the grey sands between depths of 20 30 m reported close to the upper tz and implying high rates of fe iii reduction kontny et al 2021 thus the mineralogical research so far published in van phuc are not in contradiction and in some cases rather corroborate our conceptual model namely hypothesis i however given the complexity of the tz mineralogy caution is required not to over interpret such data particularly in the study by nghiem et al 2020 where the cluster analysis also included some samples from outside the here identified high ch 4 gas producing zone for a proper understanding of the mineralogy in a hydraulically slowed zone samples should ideally be taken away from the complication of an immediately impinging redox front such an analysis therefore calls for further investigation 3 6 potential consequences on as transport the discussed gas evolution and its hydrogeological consequences unquestionably have a profound affect on as transport and distribution in van phuc while our results show that as is itself linked to gas production in particular ch 4 the physical effect that such a free gas phase subsequently has on the surrounding environment is an important constraint for predicting future contaminant transport in van phuc the riverbed has been previously identified as a key contributor to the source of dissolved as wallis et al 2020 therefore as carried downstream towards localised gas producing zones is forced to by pass around such zones thus altering the expected as distribution to what might be expected from the current hydrogeological understanding of the field site further a reduced hydraulic conductivity within an as mobilizing and ch 4 gas producing hotspot means the timescales of associated biogeochemical reactions will be substantially affected as a result of the increased groundwater residence time more crystalline and hence less reactive forms of iron often linked with as release can be reductively dissolved while the formation of more stable fe minerals as discussed in section 3 5 is also anticipated accumulation of mobilised as in the ch 4 gas producing zone analogously to how he concentrations accumulate here in the upper tz would also be exacerbated this point in particular tempts us to formulate a provoking hypothesis based on the general observation of high free gas production and high as concentrations accumulation of as simply occurs in zones where there is reduced groundwater movement as the ch 4 gas bubbles do not allow the as to escape thus as accumulates to high concentrations where there is excessive gas e g ch 4 production due to a lack of physical transport given the above discussed repercussions that high gas production has on as transport and mobilization we conclude that such gas producing zones contribute to the wide spread heterogeneity often observed in contaminated aquifers smedley and kinniburgh 2002 van geen et al 2006 4 conclusions in this paper we demonstrate that elevated as concentrations could be the consequence of the substantially increased total dissolved gas pressure tdgp that is generated by the in situ biogeochemical production of ch 4 while degassing stute et al 2007 and elevated tdgp postma et al 2012 have been reported in several contaminated aquifers which exhibit correlating ch 4 and as concentrations dowling et al 2002 jessen et al 2008 postma et al 2007 2012 stute et al 2007 the consequence of such gas production in relation to the hydrogeology mobilization and heterogeneity of as in contaminated aquifers has until now not been considered we further point out that while groundwater age generally provides good initial boundary conditions for the hydrogeology of such field sites assessing groundwater residence times by applying transient trace gas measurements e g 3h 3he in cases where degassing occurs is notoriously difficult as such alternative methods that give insight to the hydrogeology of contaminated aquifers becomes hugely beneficial the combined analysis of reactive gases alongside conservative noble gases in the field can therefore help not to only reveal in aquifer degassing events in contaminated aquifers but also to provide certain constraints on the hydrogeology and thus highlight the relevant timescales necessary to consider for the as mobilizing mechanism itself declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

studies is lacking we assessed the association of drinking water trihalomethanes thm a proxy for chlorination by products with risk of bladder cancer in 58 672 men and women data came from two population based cohorts parts of the swedish infrastructure for medical population based life course and environmental research simpler individual exposure to thm was assessed by combining residential information with tap water monitoring data participants were categorized into non exposed low 15 µg l or high 15 µg l thm exposure incident cases were ascertained from 1998 through 2019 via register linkage during 16 years of follow up 965 590 person years 831 bladder cancer cases were ascertained we observed no overall association of thm with risk of bladder cancer hazard ratio for the highest exposed compared to the non exposed 0 90 95 confidence interval 0 73 1 11 the null association remained after restricting the analysis to long term residents and across strata of smoking status and cancer stage our results indicate that chlorination by product exposure at thm concentrations representative of chlorinated drinking waters in most european countries is not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorination by products disinfection by products trihalomethanes bladder cancer cohort population based 1 introduction drinking water chlorination is an important public health intervention for control of waterborne infectious disease and the most common drinking water disinfectant globally world health organization 2017 nevertheless the concomitant introduction of potentially carcinogenic chlorination by products to the drinking water presents a drawback of the method these by products are formed when chlorine reacts with natural organic matter and other substances in the water and today more than 600 different by product substances have been identified in drinking water richardson 2011 trihalomethanes thms are together with haloacetic acids the chlorination by products generally found at the highest concentrations in chlorinated drinking water richardson et al 2007 the four most common thms chloroform chlorodibromomethane bromoform and bromodichloromethane are all rodent carcinogens richardson et al 2007 and two of them chloroform and bromodichloromethane are classified as category 2b possibly carcinogenic to humans by iarc iarc 1991 1999 several case control studies beane freeman et al 2017 bove et al 2007 cantor et al 1987 cantor et al 1998 chevrier et al 2004 king and marrett 1996 koivusalo et al 1998 mcgeehin et al 1993 villanueva et al 2007 a historical cohort koivusalo et al 1997 and a small prospective cohort study wilkins and comstock 1981 have all consistently reported associations of chlorination by products with increased risk of bladder cancer in addition the most recent meta analysis of case control studies estimated 47 increased odds of bladder cancer for men exposed to chlorination by products corresponding to thm concentrations above 50 µg l compared to those exposed to levels 5 µg l costet et al 2011 although the combined existing evidence point towards a possible cancer link there is still a lack of large cohort studies that confirm these indications moreover in a recent study the average population weighted thm concentration in public drinking water of 28 european countries was estimated to 12 µg l evlampidou et al 2020 which suggest that most european populations are exposed to chlorination by product levels lower than those for which association with increased cancer risks have been reported to corroborate previous indications of a potential cancer link with chlorination byproducts and to further explore this association at thm concentrations representative of large parts of the european population we used data from two population based prospective cohort studies to assess the association between exposure to thms as a proxy for chlorination by products in drinking water and incidence on bladder cancer among 50 000 middle aged to elderly men and women in sweden 2 materials and methods 2 1 study population the swedish mammography cohort smc and the cohort of swedish men cosm are two large population based prospective cohorts parts of the swedish infrastructure for medical population based life course and environmental research simpler www simpler4health se the smc was initiated in 1987 1990 when all women residing in two counties in central sweden uppsala or adjacent västmanland county born 1914 1948 were invited to the study n 90 303 by receiving a diet and lifestyle questionnaire 74 response rate in 1997 an extended questionnaire was sent out to all women still alive and residing in the study area n 56 030 to update information on diet and lifestyle 70 response rate after excluding those with incorrect or missing personal identification number and pre baseline cancer 37 193 women remained in the study at the time of the second smc questionnaire the male cohort cosm was initiated all men residing in västmanland and örebro counties and who were born 1918 1952 n 100 303 received a questionnaire essentially identical to the smc questionnaire in total 48 850 men returned a completed questionnaire response rate 49 after excluding those with incomplete or missing personal identification numbers or a cancer diagnosis prior to baseline the cohort consisted of 45 872 men the present study is based on the 1997 questionnaire for both cohorts in total 83 065 men and women were eligible for further chlorination by product exposure assessment fig 1 the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm sweden 2 2 exposure assessment and covariates 2 2 1 assessment of chlorination by product exposure we only included participants served by municipal drinking water because this water is closely monitored with respect to several important drinking water parameters moreover by not including populations served by private wells we minimized the risk of introducing unmeasured confounding to identify participants receiving municipal drinking water we collected information on individual annual residential history from the national register for regional divisions based on real estate statistics sweden for all years available in the database 1982 2019 we then included in the study only those residing in localities coherent and densely populated areas with 1 000 inhabitants at baseline in 1997 n 63 804 the reason for not including smaller localities was that some inhabitants in those localities may not yet be connected to the municipal drinking water system i e to avoid exposure misclassification for each locality we then identified the drinking water treatment plant s responsible for the drinking water distribution in each area and collected data on their method s for disinfection and thm monitoring data from swedish water analytical reports and vattentäktsarkivet geological survey of sweden if no monitoring data were available or if changes were made in water source or chlorination procedure during follow up participants in these localities were excluded n 5 132 this resulted in a final study population of 58 672 men and women fig 1 we used the sum of thms sum of chloroform bromoform dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane n 406 sampled in 2008 2017 as a proxy of chlorination by product exposure these are the by products that are formed at the highest concentrations when hypochlorite is used as the main disinfectant richardson et al 2007 and are routinely monitored according to the european drinking water regulation 98 83 eg in our study more than 99 of the study population in the exposed areas was served by drinking water treatment plants using hypochlorite as their main disinfectant only two plants serving in total only 543 participants used chloramine to account for seasonal variability in by product formation and municipal monitoring strategies we first calculated the average thm concentration in drinking water for each water treatment plant n 52 and season december february march may june august september november and then averaged these treatment plant specific seasonal averages fig s1 the rationale for using this approach is that season is the most important determinant of temporal variations in thm concentrations in sweden andersson et al 2019 displaying bimodal peaks during spring and autumn due to concomitant increase of organic matter in the water conditioning on that no changes had occurred in the drinking water production we extrapolated these averages back to baseline 1997 in two cases when localities were served by two water treatment plants we used the average thm concentrations of the two plants the non exposed reference group denoting zero thm exposure were those participants residing in localities served by water treatment plants that used no chlorination in their production for participants living in areas where chlorination was used thm exposure was separated into two exposure categories that were predefined based on prior knowledge on the thm exposure distribution in sweden representing low 15 μg l and high 15 μg l thm exposure respectively 2 2 2 assessment of covariates data on arsenic concentrations in drinking water was based on municipal monitoring data information on household income and level of education was obtained from the longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labor market studies lisa statistics sweden self reported information on smoking status alcohol consumption body mass index bmi calculated from body weight in kg divided by height in m squared and physical activity was obtained from the questionnaire completed at baseline information on intake of cultured milk larsson et al 2008 processed meat crippa et al 2018 fruits and vegetables world cancer research fund american institute for cancer research 2018 tea world cancer research fund american institute for cancer research 2018 and coffee all of which are potentially associated with bladder cancer risk was derived from the validated 96 item food frequency questionnaire ffq harris et al 2013 information on prevalent diabetes was based on self reports and on linkage of the cohorts to the national diabetes and patient registers the national board of health and welfare 2 3 outcome assessment incident cases of bladder cancer including bladder cancer in situ were ascertained through a linkage of the cohort to the national cancer register with over 90 completeness for common cancers barlow et al 2009 and the national patient register national board of health and welfare the international classification of disease 10th revision icd 10 codes used were c67 bladder cancer and d09 0 bladder cancer in situ the rationale for including bladder cancer in situ is that it is a well defined form of bladder cancer with a high risk of progressing into muscle invasive bladder cancer if left untreated tang and chang 2015 to examine any potential differences in the association of thm with bladder cancer by disease stage incident cases were further classified by tumor node metastasis tnm classification stage into non muscle invasive stage ta tcis and t1 and muscle invasive bladder cancer t2 with the latter signaling a more aggressive disease with worse prognosis witjes et al 2021 information tnm stage was obtained from national cancer register 2 4 statistical analysis we used cox proportional hazards regression analysis with attained age as underlying time scale to estimate hazard ratio hr and the 95 confidence interval ci participants contributed to person time from january 1st 1998 until the date of bladder cancer diagnosis death emigration moving from the baseline locality 2 years or end of follow up december 31st 2019 whichever occurred first the rationale for censoring when participants moved was to ensure unceasing exposure to thms and because bladder cancer has a long induction time the date was set to 2 years after the moving date all multivariable adjusted models were adjusted for the following potential confounders age as time scale cohort as a stratum variable level of education household income smoking status and drinking water arsenic concentration further adjustment for prevalent diabetes bmi physical activity alcohol intake intake of cultured milk processed meat fruits and vegetables tea and coffee consumption did not have any impact on the association and estimates from these models are therefore not reported for subsequent analyses missing information on categorical covariates was handled using a missing indicator category while missing data on drinking water arsenic 9 was replaced by the median the proportional hazard assumption was tested using the schoenfeld s residuals and no department from the assumption was observed in addition to the main analysis we performed several sensitivity analyses first to explore the impact of sex and smoking status both strong risk factors for bladder cancer on the thm bladder cancer association we conducted a likelihood ratio test for interaction between thm and sex smoking status and performed stratified analyses for men and women as well as never and ever smokers second to assess potential influence of long term exposures we repeated the main analyses after restricting to individuals with constant long term thm exposure since 1982 lastly we explored potential differences in the association with bladder cancer of different stages by performing separate analyses for non muscle invasive bladder cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer all tests were two sided with the level of significance set at 0 05 the software used for statistical analysis was stata se version 16 0 stata corporation inc collage station tx usa 3 results the average thm concentration in all areas using chlorination was 8 8 6 5 µg l and more than 99 of the participants in the study were exposed to thm concentrations below 20 µg l supplemental table s1 supplemental fig s1 while thms were always below the limit of detection in the non chlorinated areas the average thm concentrations were 6 6 2 2 µg l and 17 1 2 1 µg l in the low and high exposure category respectively baseline age standardized main characteristics of the study population by drinking water thm exposure categories are presented in table 1 participants in the non chlorinated area were less likely to be former heavy smokers 10 cigarettes day somewhat less educated and to a greater degree served by water treatment plants with a slightly higher arsenic concentration in drinking water during a mean follow up of 16 years in total 965 590 person years 831 out of the 58 672 participants developed bladder cancer 699 men and 132 women tnm status was obtained for 70 of the cases resulting in 474 and 112 non muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer cases respectively in the multivariable adjusted model we observed overall no association of exposure to thm with bladder cancer risk hr 0 90 95 ci 0 73 1 11 for the highest exposed category compared to the non chlorinated area table 2 we found no evidence of effect modification by sex and results are therefore presented for the entire study population as a whole analyses stratified by sex are shown in table s2 likewise we observed overall no association of thm with risk of bladder cancer when stratifying the analyses by smoking status ever never smokers pinteraction 0 88 table 2 or restricting it to only long term residents table 3 the association did not vary by cancer stage hrs for the high exposure category versus non chlorinated area were 0 86 95 ci 0 65 1 13 and 0 65 95 ci 0 37 1 14 for non muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer respectively table 4 4 discussion in this population based cohort study of upper middle aged to elderly men and women we observed no association of drinking water thms with increased risk of bladder cancer the results did not vary with smoking status or when the analysis was restricted to participants with long term constant exposure including more than 800 cases this is the first larger cohort study to evaluate the association of chlorination by products with bladder cancer risk our results suggest that at least up to thm concentrations around 20 µg l which is representative of chlorinated drinking waters in most european countries chlorination by products seem not to be associated with increased risk of bladder cancer chlorination by products is a complex mixture of substances that is formed when chlorine oxidizes naturally occurring anthropogenic substances iodine and bromide drinking water richardson 2011 since the first discoveries of these by products were made in the 70 s numerous studies have been performed to increase our understanding of the potentially associated health risks thms which often is the most prevalent class of chlorination by products in chlorinated drinking water has been mostly studied in toxicological in vitro assays three out of the four most common thms bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and bromoform test positive for genotoxicity after glutathione s transferase theta gstt1 activation while the fourth one chloroform generally test negative richardson et al 2007 in rodent bioassays all four thms induce tumours the latter likely through a non genotoxic mode of action suggested to involve cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation richardson et al 2007 also other classes of chlorination by products potentially present such as haloacetic acids display similar patterns of genotoxicity and or rodent carcinogenicity richardson et al 2007 the epidemiological evidence linking chlorination by products to overall cancer is somewhat less clear the strongest evidence for a carcinogenic potential in humans exists for bladder cancer with several case control studies beane freeman et al 2017 bove et al 2007 cantor et al 1987 1998 chevrier et al 2004 king and marrett 1996 koivusalo et al 1998 mcgeehin et al 1993 villanueva et al 2007 a historical cohort koivusalo et al 1997 and a small cohort study with only 52 cases wilkins and comstock 1981 repeatedly reporting associations with increased risks although some inconsistencies exist doyle et al 1997 freedman et al 1997 in addition in one of the most comprehensive studies reporting direct associations the authors found that a polymorphism in gstt1 a key metabolizing enzyme of thms modified the thm bladder cancer association cantor et al 2010 stronger associations were observed among individuals with one or two copies of the functioning allele than among those without supporting a possible causal relationship further different case control meta and pooled analyses have been performed indicating a possible link at thm exposures above approximately 25 µg l that was restricted to men costet et al 2011 villanueva et al 2004 nevertheless although the combined existing evidence point towards a possible association there is still a lack of large scale cohort studies that confirms these indications and it is also uncertain if this association persist at lower exposure levels more representative of large parts of the population today evlampidou et al 2020 in our study we observed no overall association of drinking water thm up to 20 µg l with risk of bladder cancer confirming the lack of an association at low exposure levels observed in pooled analysis of case control studies costet et al 2011 this is also in line with the results of a small population based cohort study of postmenopausal women in iowa us doyle et al 1997 and a more recent population based case control study from new england us beane freeman et al 2017 in which the investigators found overall no association of individual lifetime thm concentration with bladder cancer risk below the 95th percentile of thm exposure 46 µg l strengths of this study include the population based cohort design the linkage to high quality registers for outcome ascertainment and covariate information the detailed information on important risk factors for bladder cancer the use of a representative non chlorinated reference area and the access to a large database on municipal thm monitoring data the complexity of thm formation requires careful consideration since thm levels vary with season temperature ph and retention time in the distribution system in our study we tried to minimize the impact of seasonal variations which are larger than the annual variations in northern european countries andersson et al 2019 by using multiannual seasonal averages moreover while spatial differences in thm levels in large distribution systems is a common issue most water treatment plants in the present study were small and had a rapid turnover time thus relatively low spatial variations can also be assumed another point to consider is that we used thms as a proxy for general chlorination by product exposure although these are frequently used as such thms are poor indicators for some other by products that are formed when disinfectants other than hypochlorite is used nevertheless in our study more than 99 of the exposed study population were served by drinking water treatment plants employing hypochlorite treatment moreover we had limited data on each of the four components of the thms which all display slightly different toxicological patterns in vitro and in vivo richardson et al 2007 and thus we were not able to assess the associations of each of these separately with risk of bladder cancer on the other hand chlorination by products does not only consist of thms but is a complex mixture of several hundreds of substances which may have different toxicological patterns and may or may not interact with each other this complexity must be taken into consideration when interpreting results of studies including ours that are relying on data on a single group or substance of by products for exposure assessment one limitation of our study is that we did not have access to individual information on drinking water consumption however given that thm exposure occurs not only through ingestion but also to a large extent via inhalation and dermal absorption villanueva et al 2007 this might not be an issue of major concern by contrast only considering ingested water could potentially lead to misclassification of individuals highly exposed through routes other than consumption the risk for unmeasured or residual confounding is unavoidable in observational studies and in our study we did not have access to information on employment in risk occupations however we had detailed information on other more important potential confounders such as smoking which has been estimated to contribute to 45 of all cases compared to the estimated 6 caused by occupational exposure cancer research uk 2021 finally the thm concentrations in our study were low in comparison to those in earlier studies reporting direct associations with bladder cancer thus we cannot rule out that increased risks may occur at higher concentrations 5 conclusion in this population based cohort study of upper middle aged to elderly men and women we observed no association of thms as a proxy for chlorination by products in drinking water with increased bladder cancer risk our results suggest that at least at thm concentrations up to 20 µg l which are typically found in chlorinated drinking water in major parts of europe chlorination by products seem not to be associated with increased risk of bladder

studies is lacking we assessed the association of drinking water trihalomethanes thm a proxy for chlorination by products with risk of bladder cancer in 58 672 men and women data came from two population based cohorts parts of the swedish infrastructure for medical population based life course and environmental research simpler individual exposure to thm was assessed by combining residential information with tap water monitoring data participants were categorized into non exposed low 15 µg l or high 15 µg l thm exposure incident cases were ascertained from 1998 through 2019 via register linkage during 16 years of follow up 965 590 person years 831 bladder cancer cases were ascertained we observed no overall association of thm with risk of bladder cancer hazard ratio for the highest exposed compared to the non exposed 0 90 95 confidence interval 0 73 1 11 the null association remained after restricting the analysis to long term residents and across strata of smoking status and cancer stage our results indicate that chlorination by product exposure at thm concentrations representative of chlorinated drinking waters in most european countries is not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorination by products disinfection by products trihalomethanes bladder cancer cohort population based 1 introduction drinking water chlorination is an important public health intervention for control of waterborne infectious disease and the most common drinking water disinfectant globally world health organization 2017 nevertheless the concomitant introduction of potentially carcinogenic chlorination by products to the drinking water presents a drawback of the method these by products are formed when chlorine reacts with natural organic matter and other substances in the water and today more than 600 different by product substances have been identified in drinking water richardson 2011 trihalomethanes thms are together with haloacetic acids the chlorination by products generally found at the highest concentrations in chlorinated drinking water richardson et al 2007 the four most common thms chloroform chlorodibromomethane bromoform and bromodichloromethane are all rodent carcinogens richardson et al 2007 and two of them chloroform and bromodichloromethane are classified as category 2b possibly carcinogenic to humans by iarc iarc 1991 1999 several case control studies beane freeman et al 2017 bove et al 2007 cantor et al 1987 cantor et al 1998 chevrier et al 2004 king and marrett 1996 koivusalo et al 1998 mcgeehin et al 1993 villanueva et al 2007 a historical cohort koivusalo et al 1997 and a small prospective cohort study wilkins and comstock 1981 have all consistently reported associations of chlorination by products with increased risk of bladder cancer in addition the most recent meta analysis of case control studies estimated 47 increased odds of bladder cancer for men exposed to chlorination by products corresponding to thm concentrations above 50 µg l compared to those exposed to levels 5 µg l costet et al 2011 although the combined existing evidence point towards a possible cancer link there is still a lack of large cohort studies that confirm these indications moreover in a recent study the average population weighted thm concentration in public drinking water of 28 european countries was estimated to 12 µg l evlampidou et al 2020 which suggest that most european populations are exposed to chlorination by product levels lower than those for which association with increased cancer risks have been reported to corroborate previous indications of a potential cancer link with chlorination byproducts and to further explore this association at thm concentrations representative of large parts of the european population we used data from two population based prospective cohort studies to assess the association between exposure to thms as a proxy for chlorination by products in drinking water and incidence on bladder cancer among 50 000 middle aged to elderly men and women in sweden 2 materials and methods 2 1 study population the swedish mammography cohort smc and the cohort of swedish men cosm are two large population based prospective cohorts parts of the swedish infrastructure for medical population based life course and environmental research simpler www simpler4health se the smc was initiated in 1987 1990 when all women residing in two counties in central sweden uppsala or adjacent västmanland county born 1914 1948 were invited to the study n 90 303 by receiving a diet and lifestyle questionnaire 74 response rate in 1997 an extended questionnaire was sent out to all women still alive and residing in the study area n 56 030 to update information on diet and lifestyle 70 response rate after excluding those with incorrect or missing personal identification number and pre baseline cancer 37 193 women remained in the study at the time of the second smc questionnaire the male cohort cosm was initiated all men residing in västmanland and örebro counties and who were born 1918 1952 n 100 303 received a questionnaire essentially identical to the smc questionnaire in total 48 850 men returned a completed questionnaire response rate 49 after excluding those with incomplete or missing personal identification numbers or a cancer diagnosis prior to baseline the cohort consisted of 45 872 men the present study is based on the 1997 questionnaire for both cohorts in total 83 065 men and women were eligible for further chlorination by product exposure assessment fig 1 the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm sweden 2 2 exposure assessment and covariates 2 2 1 assessment of chlorination by product exposure we only included participants served by municipal drinking water because this water is closely monitored with respect to several important drinking water parameters moreover by not including populations served by private wells we minimized the risk of introducing unmeasured confounding to identify participants receiving municipal drinking water we collected information on individual annual residential history from the national register for regional divisions based on real estate statistics sweden for all years available in the database 1982 2019 we then included in the study only those residing in localities coherent and densely populated areas with 1 000 inhabitants at baseline in 1997 n 63 804 the reason for not including smaller localities was that some inhabitants in those localities may not yet be connected to the municipal drinking water system i e to avoid exposure misclassification for each locality we then identified the drinking water treatment plant s responsible for the drinking water distribution in each area and collected data on their method s for disinfection and thm monitoring data from swedish water analytical reports and vattentäktsarkivet geological survey of sweden if no monitoring data were available or if changes were made in water source or chlorination procedure during follow up participants in these localities were excluded n 5 132 this resulted in a final study population of 58 672 men and women fig 1 we used the sum of thms sum of chloroform bromoform dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane n 406 sampled in 2008 2017 as a proxy of chlorination by product exposure these are the by products that are formed at the highest concentrations when hypochlorite is used as the main disinfectant richardson et al 2007 and are routinely monitored according to the european drinking water regulation 98 83 eg in our study more than 99 of the study population in the exposed areas was served by drinking water treatment plants using hypochlorite as their main disinfectant only two plants serving in total only 543 participants used chloramine to account for seasonal variability in by product formation and municipal monitoring strategies we first calculated the average thm concentration in drinking water for each water treatment plant n 52 and season december february march may june august september november and then averaged these treatment plant specific seasonal averages fig s1 the rationale for using this approach is that season is the most important determinant of temporal variations in thm concentrations in sweden andersson et al 2019 displaying bimodal peaks during spring and autumn due to concomitant increase of organic matter in the water conditioning on that no changes had occurred in the drinking water production we extrapolated these averages back to baseline 1997 in two cases when localities were served by two water treatment plants we used the average thm concentrations of the two plants the non exposed reference group denoting zero thm exposure were those participants residing in localities served by water treatment plants that used no chlorination in their production for participants living in areas where chlorination was used thm exposure was separated into two exposure categories that were predefined based on prior knowledge on the thm exposure distribution in sweden representing low 15 μg l and high 15 μg l thm exposure respectively 2 2 2 assessment of covariates data on arsenic concentrations in drinking water was based on municipal monitoring data information on household income and level of education was obtained from the longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labor market studies lisa statistics sweden self reported information on smoking status alcohol consumption body mass index bmi calculated from body weight in kg divided by height in m squared and physical activity was obtained from the questionnaire completed at baseline information on intake of cultured milk larsson et al 2008 processed meat crippa et al 2018 fruits and vegetables world cancer research fund american institute for cancer research 2018 tea world cancer research fund american institute for cancer research 2018 and coffee all of which are potentially associated with bladder cancer risk was derived from the validated 96 item food frequency questionnaire ffq harris et al 2013 information on prevalent diabetes was based on self reports and on linkage of the cohorts to the national diabetes and patient registers the national board of health and welfare 2 3 outcome assessment incident cases of bladder cancer including bladder cancer in situ were ascertained through a linkage of the cohort to the national cancer register with over 90 completeness for common cancers barlow et al 2009 and the national patient register national board of health and welfare the international classification of disease 10th revision icd 10 codes used were c67 bladder cancer and d09 0 bladder cancer in situ the rationale for including bladder cancer in situ is that it is a well defined form of bladder cancer with a high risk of progressing into muscle invasive bladder cancer if left untreated tang and chang 2015 to examine any potential differences in the association of thm with bladder cancer by disease stage incident cases were further classified by tumor node metastasis tnm classification stage into non muscle invasive stage ta tcis and t1 and muscle invasive bladder cancer t2 with the latter signaling a more aggressive disease with worse prognosis witjes et al 2021 information tnm stage was obtained from national cancer register 2 4 statistical analysis we used cox proportional hazards regression analysis with attained age as underlying time scale to estimate hazard ratio hr and the 95 confidence interval ci participants contributed to person time from january 1st 1998 until the date of bladder cancer diagnosis death emigration moving from the baseline locality 2 years or end of follow up december 31st 2019 whichever occurred first the rationale for censoring when participants moved was to ensure unceasing exposure to thms and because bladder cancer has a long induction time the date was set to 2 years after the moving date all multivariable adjusted models were adjusted for the following potential confounders age as time scale cohort as a stratum variable level of education household income smoking status and drinking water arsenic concentration further adjustment for prevalent diabetes bmi physical activity alcohol intake intake of cultured milk processed meat fruits and vegetables tea and coffee consumption did not have any impact on the association and estimates from these models are therefore not reported for subsequent analyses missing information on categorical covariates was handled using a missing indicator category while missing data on drinking water arsenic 9 was replaced by the median the proportional hazard assumption was tested using the schoenfeld s residuals and no department from the assumption was observed in addition to the main analysis we performed several sensitivity analyses first to explore the impact of sex and smoking status both strong risk factors for bladder cancer on the thm bladder cancer association we conducted a likelihood ratio test for interaction between thm and sex smoking status and performed stratified analyses for men and women as well as never and ever smokers second to assess potential influence of long term exposures we repeated the main analyses after restricting to individuals with constant long term thm exposure since 1982 lastly we explored potential differences in the association with bladder cancer of different stages by performing separate analyses for non muscle invasive bladder cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer all tests were two sided with the level of significance set at 0 05 the software used for statistical analysis was stata se version 16 0 stata corporation inc collage station tx usa 3 results the average thm concentration in all areas using chlorination was 8 8 6 5 µg l and more than 99 of the participants in the study were exposed to thm concentrations below 20 µg l supplemental table s1 supplemental fig s1 while thms were always below the limit of detection in the non chlorinated areas the average thm concentrations were 6 6 2 2 µg l and 17 1 2 1 µg l in the low and high exposure category respectively baseline age standardized main characteristics of the study population by drinking water thm exposure categories are presented in table 1 participants in the non chlorinated area were less likely to be former heavy smokers 10 cigarettes day somewhat less educated and to a greater degree served by water treatment plants with a slightly higher arsenic concentration in drinking water during a mean follow up of 16 years in total 965 590 person years 831 out of the 58 672 participants developed bladder cancer 699 men and 132 women tnm status was obtained for 70 of the cases resulting in 474 and 112 non muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer cases respectively in the multivariable adjusted model we observed overall no association of exposure to thm with bladder cancer risk hr 0 90 95 ci 0 73 1 11 for the highest exposed category compared to the non chlorinated area table 2 we found no evidence of effect modification by sex and results are therefore presented for the entire study population as a whole analyses stratified by sex are shown in table s2 likewise we observed overall no association of thm with risk of bladder cancer when stratifying the analyses by smoking status ever never smokers pinteraction 0 88 table 2 or restricting it to only long term residents table 3 the association did not vary by cancer stage hrs for the high exposure category versus non chlorinated area were 0 86 95 ci 0 65 1 13 and 0 65 95 ci 0 37 1 14 for non muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer respectively table 4 4 discussion in this population based cohort study of upper middle aged to elderly men and women we observed no association of drinking water thms with increased risk of bladder cancer the results did not vary with smoking status or when the analysis was restricted to participants with long term constant exposure including more than 800 cases this is the first larger cohort study to evaluate the association of chlorination by products with bladder cancer risk our results suggest that at least up to thm concentrations around 20 µg l which is representative of chlorinated drinking waters in most european countries chlorination by products seem not to be associated with increased risk of bladder cancer chlorination by products is a complex mixture of substances that is formed when chlorine oxidizes naturally occurring anthropogenic substances iodine and bromide drinking water richardson 2011 since the first discoveries of these by products were made in the 70 s numerous studies have been performed to increase our understanding of the potentially associated health risks thms which often is the most prevalent class of chlorination by products in chlorinated drinking water has been mostly studied in toxicological in vitro assays three out of the four most common thms bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and bromoform test positive for genotoxicity after glutathione s transferase theta gstt1 activation while the fourth one chloroform generally test negative richardson et al 2007 in rodent bioassays all four thms induce tumours the latter likely through a non genotoxic mode of action suggested to involve cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation richardson et al 2007 also other classes of chlorination by products potentially present such as haloacetic acids display similar patterns of genotoxicity and or rodent carcinogenicity richardson et al 2007 the epidemiological evidence linking chlorination by products to overall cancer is somewhat less clear the strongest evidence for a carcinogenic potential in humans exists for bladder cancer with several case control studies beane freeman et al 2017 bove et al 2007 cantor et al 1987 1998 chevrier et al 2004 king and marrett 1996 koivusalo et al 1998 mcgeehin et al 1993 villanueva et al 2007 a historical cohort koivusalo et al 1997 and a small cohort study with only 52 cases wilkins and comstock 1981 repeatedly reporting associations with increased risks although some inconsistencies exist doyle et al 1997 freedman et al 1997 in addition in one of the most comprehensive studies reporting direct associations the authors found that a polymorphism in gstt1 a key metabolizing enzyme of thms modified the thm bladder cancer association cantor et al 2010 stronger associations were observed among individuals with one or two copies of the functioning allele than among those without supporting a possible causal relationship further different case control meta and pooled analyses have been performed indicating a possible link at thm exposures above approximately 25 µg l that was restricted to men costet et al 2011 villanueva et al 2004 nevertheless although the combined existing evidence point towards a possible association there is still a lack of large scale cohort studies that confirms these indications and it is also uncertain if this association persist at lower exposure levels more representative of large parts of the population today evlampidou et al 2020 in our study we observed no overall association of drinking water thm up to 20 µg l with risk of bladder cancer confirming the lack of an association at low exposure levels observed in pooled analysis of case control studies costet et al 2011 this is also in line with the results of a small population based cohort study of postmenopausal women in iowa us doyle et al 1997 and a more recent population based case control study from new england us beane freeman et al 2017 in which the investigators found overall no association of individual lifetime thm concentration with bladder cancer risk below the 95th percentile of thm exposure 46 µg l strengths of this study include the population based cohort design the linkage to high quality registers for outcome ascertainment and covariate information the detailed information on important risk factors for bladder cancer the use of a representative non chlorinated reference area and the access to a large database on municipal thm monitoring data the complexity of thm formation requires careful consideration since thm levels vary with season temperature ph and retention time in the distribution system in our study we tried to minimize the impact of seasonal variations which are larger than the annual variations in northern european countries andersson et al 2019 by using multiannual seasonal averages moreover while spatial differences in thm levels in large distribution systems is a common issue most water treatment plants in the present study were small and had a rapid turnover time thus relatively low spatial variations can also be assumed another point to consider is that we used thms as a proxy for general chlorination by product exposure although these are frequently used as such thms are poor indicators for some other by products that are formed when disinfectants other than hypochlorite is used nevertheless in our study more than 99 of the exposed study population were served by drinking water treatment plants employing hypochlorite treatment moreover we had limited data on each of the four components of the thms which all display slightly different toxicological patterns in vitro and in vivo richardson et al 2007 and thus we were not able to assess the associations of each of these separately with risk of bladder cancer on the other hand chlorination by products does not only consist of thms but is a complex mixture of several hundreds of substances which may have different toxicological patterns and may or may not interact with each other this complexity must be taken into consideration when interpreting results of studies including ours that are relying on data on a single group or substance of by products for exposure assessment one limitation of our study is that we did not have access to individual information on drinking water consumption however given that thm exposure occurs not only through ingestion but also to a large extent via inhalation and dermal absorption villanueva et al 2007 this might not be an issue of major concern by contrast only considering ingested water could potentially lead to misclassification of individuals highly exposed through routes other than consumption the risk for unmeasured or residual confounding is unavoidable in observational studies and in our study we did not have access to information on employment in risk occupations however we had detailed information on other more important potential confounders such as smoking which has been estimated to contribute to 45 of all cases compared to the estimated 6 caused by occupational exposure cancer research uk 2021 finally the thm concentrations in our study were low in comparison to those in earlier studies reporting direct associations with bladder cancer thus we cannot rule out that increased risks may occur at higher concentrations 5 conclusion in this population based cohort study of upper middle aged to elderly men and women we observed no association of thms as a proxy for chlorination by products in drinking water with increased bladder cancer risk our results suggest that at least at thm concentrations up to 20 µg l which are typically found in chlorinated drinking water in major parts of europe chlorination by products seem not to be associated with increased risk of bladder

16202,increasing microplastic mp pollution and its effects on aquatic systems have become a global issue however the impact of mps on biogeochemical cycles is poorly understood a simulation study was performed to analyse the influence of polyethylene pe microplastics on the morphological physiological and stoichiometric c n p characteristics of submerged plants and to investigate their effects on the nutrient cycle and microbial community in freshwater sediment the results showed that pe mps treatments significantly decreased leaf nitrogen and carbon contents exposure to 1 pe mps suppressed the plant height total biomass root activity and relative growth rate of vallisneria natans decrease in dissolved oxygen do concentrations 19 93 40 26 were observed in the 1 pe mps treatment group compared to that in the control between 1 and 6 days the activities of enzymes ammonia monooxygenase and nitrate reductase related to the nitrogen cycle were significantly altered by the addition of pe mps we found that pe mps acted as obstacle disruptors resulting in a reduction in the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment to the overlying water this is because pe mps significantly alter the composition and metabolic properties of the microbial communities in sediments the plant growth and the nutrient cycle these findings helped evaluate the impacts of pe mps on the water plant sediment system and on the biogeochemical cycles of the freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogeochemistry ecosystems sediment metabolism plant growth 1 introduction recent research has shown that plastics in general and microplastics 5 mm mps are continuously introduced into all environmental compartments including air water columns sediments ice and snow ahmed et al 2021 van sebille et al 2015 freshwater and marine ecosystems receive large quantities of plastic debris that initially float at different water levels however they are colonised by microbes accumulate pollutants and sink to bottom sediments van cauwenberghe et al 2015 high concentrations of mps have been widely recorded in freshwater sediments worldwide including rivers lakes and reservoirs yang et al 2020a xu et al 2020 as research on mps in freshwater sediments is still in its infancy there are substantial differences in the sampling and measurement standards of mps yang et al 2020a thus the average abundance and morphotypes of freshwater sediment mps vary widely amongst different study areas xu et al 2020 mps can alter soil physical properties enzymes and microbial systems at certain levels jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 low density pe mps amendment significantly altered the soil bacterial community structure wang et al 2020 and increased urease and catalase activities in the soil huang et al 2019 moreover mps affected the capacity for related metabolic functions by changing the turnover rate of microbial communities wang et al 2020 sun et al 2022 therefore mps can affect key pools and fluxes within the soil nutrient cycles by changing the structure and metabolic status of the microbial community in terrestrial ecosystems zang et al 2020 sediments can store or release various compounds in the water column especially at the sediment water interface with frequent substance turnover and nutrient exchange due to their sensitivity to physical chemical and biological processes brigolin et al 2011 sanz lázaro et al 2021 reported that biodegradable plastics can alter the carbon and nitrogen cycles in marine sediments including increasing the decomposition of buried carbon and decreasing the release of inorganic nitrogen in addition the nitrogen cycling processes in salt marsh sediments can be significantly affected by different mps seeley et al 2020 however these experiments simulated the effect of mps on the nutrient cycle of marine ecosystems and there is still a lack of studies that focus on freshwater sediments lake sediments play a key role in geochemical cycling for instance most phosphorus in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediments and recycled to the water column through various mechanisms horppila et al 2019 lake sediments can also affect the migration and transformation of pollutants lu et al 2021 sediments seem to be long term sinks for mps globally yang et al 2020a yin et al 2021 cesarini et al 2022 and vegetated ecosystems could act as sinks of mps as efficient particle traps carmen et al 2021 rhizosphere environments significantly affect global biogeochemical cycles such as in macrophytes which have been used to control p release by oxidising rhizosphere sediment and increasing its capacity to bind fe bound p in subtropical aquacultural lakes han et al 2018 li et al 2021 additionally mps significantly affect root growth and root associated microbial communities kalčíková et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 and the structure and function of soil systems therefore investigating the effects of mps on nutrient cycling together with the diffusion flux of the water plant sediment interface may be helpful for assessing the environmental risk of mps in freshwater sediments white polyethylene pe fibres are the dominant structure of mps in freshwater sediments lin et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2020a however few studies have reported the effects of pe mps in freshwater ecosystems thus the purpose of the experiments in this study was to explore the changes in i biogeochemical cycles related to nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur from the sediment to the water column and ii morphological physiological and stoichiometric characteristics of submerged plants upon pe mps exposure considering that mps concentrations in sediments are increasing the results of this experiment would enhance the understanding of the ecological effects of pe mps in freshwater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample

stoichiometry parts of v natans the plspm package in r was used to perform the path models sanchez et al 2015 3 results 3 1 impact of pe mps on nutrient stoichiometry and growth traits of v natans responses of v natans nutrient stoichiometry to mps at different concentrations the leaf c and n content and root c content in v natans significantly decreased with pe mps concentration fig 1 a b the leaf and root p contents of v natans showed no significant correlation with pe mps concentration fig 1c the total biomass plant height and rgr were significantly lower under high concentrations of pe mps 1 than in the control group fig 2 a b d however the addition of 1 pe mps significantly decreased the total biomass and relative growth rates of v natans compared to the 0 5 pe mps treatment fig 2a d no significant differences p 0 05 in the chlorophyll content and maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii of v natans were observed after pe mps exposure fig 2e f we observed that the root length of v natans did not change significantly but root cell activity was significantly affected fig 2c figure s3 when v natans was treated with 1 pe mps seedlings exhibited considerably lower root activity than those in the control group 0 pe mps figure s3 3 2 spatial micro distributions of o2 around the roots of v natans 2d co distributions of o2 concentrations surrounding v natans roots which appeared to be root like structures are shown in fig 3 and figure s4 it is apparent that the distribution of o2 is highly heterogeneous in v natans roots the areas of o2 concentrations represented by yellow to red colours were distributed irregularly on the root surface which may be closely linked to the root induced rols han et al 2018 compared with the 1 pe mps treatment group an increase in o2 concentration 22 11 67 39 was observed for days 1 6 in other treatments fig 3 moreover the concentration of o2 in below ground tissues was 31 74 higher in the 0 1 pe mps group than in the 1 pe mps group on day 3 fig 3 the o2 images clearly show rol around v natans roots for instance o2 concentration in the 1 pe mps treatment group decreased by 19 93 40 26 between 1 and 6 days compared to the control treatment fig 3 figure s4 o2 concentrations in the 0 1 pe mps treatment were reduced by 42 73 compared to that in the control treatment on day 6 fig 3 and s4 at night there was no significant difference in the o2 concentrations of the submerged plants amongst the pe mps treatment groups fig 3 figure s4 3 2 impact of pe mps on water properties the ph value was lowest on days 3 12 and 18 in the control group while it was higher in the 1 pe mps group on days 15 and 18 figure s5 in addition the water conductivity was remarkably higher in the 0 1 and 1 pe mps groups than in the 0 pe mps group figure s5 the 0 1 treatment group had the highest water conductivity on days 3 and 6 and that on days 9 18 was the highest in the 1 treatment group figure s5 however the do concentration in the 0 pe mps group was higher than that in the other mps groups after 6 12 days figure s5 3 3 responses of sediment microbial and enzyme to pe mps addition the phyla actinobacteria desulfobacterota firmicutes and gemmatimonadota were significantly different amongst the three populations figure s6 the relative abundance of actinobacteria and firmicutes in the 0 1 1 mps group was significantly higher than that in the 0 mps group figure s6 however the relative abundance of desulfobacterota and gemmatimonadota in the 0 1 1 mps group was significantly lower than that in the 0 mps group figure s6 qc samples were analysed to confirm the reliability of the lc ms ms based metabolomics approach used in this study which showed a stable retention time without distinct peak drifts there were 5748 and 4232 ions tested in each sample profile in esi and esi modes respectively low quality ions were deleted based on their relative standard deviation 30 a total of 5561 and 4074 ions in each treatment were distinguished in the esi and esi modes respectively pca performed on all the tested samples revealed that the qc samples were clustered close to each other in the two dimensional pca score plots figure s7 suggesting satisfactory stability and repeatability of the lc ms ms analysis we also analysed the distribution of metabolic data across the different mps treatments using two dimensional pca pca score plots in esi mode showed distinct metabolic profiles in the control and mps groups figure s7 furthermore the pls da model was cross validated and can be considered a significant separation of the four mps groups in the esi mode figure s8 a one way anova analysis revealed that 8 11 eicosadiynoic acid was significantly decreased 71 89 p 0 05 in sediment amended with 1 pe mps compared to that in the control figure s9 the relative abundance of melibiose was markedly reduced 43 72 60 73 p 0 001 with increasing pe mps concentration figure s9 similarly the relative abundances of 3 ketosphingosine farnesyl acetone linoleamide 2 dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid oleamide and n undecylbenzenesulfonic acid were also affected p 0 05 at the highest pe mps concentrations 1 figure s9 the kegg database was used to analyse the differential metabolites we uploaded the differential metabolites to the kegg website to identify the relevant pathways analysis of metabolite pathways showed that purine pyrimidine and glutathione metabolism were significantly altered in the mps treatments compared with the control groups fig 4 furthermore pathway topology analysis was conducted using metabo analyst 3 0 using high quality kegg metabolic pathways as reference standards based on the identified metabolites and differences in their abundances two metabolic pathways had a pathway impact value higher than 0 1 which is the cut off value for relevance the two significantly relevant metabolic pathways caprolactam degradation and glutathione metabolism indicated the effect of mps treatment on the sediment metabolite profile fig 4 enzyme activity a key indicator of the nitrogen cycle was significantly altered by the addition of pe mps the activity of amo was increased by 15 8 23 45 and the activity of nr was reduced by 148 with pe mps addition compared to that in the control p 0 05 fig 5 a b this was supported by the decreased microbial activity as evidenced by the disturbance in the nitrogen cycle with pe mps addition fig 5 moreover the addition of pe mps had no effect on nir activity p 0 05 fig 5c 3 4 nutrient exchange across the sediment water interface after nine days as shown in fig 6 the distribution of 2d dgt labile p showed clear spatial variability the results show active layers in the upper part 20 40 mm depth of the 2d profiles in the control group however the labile p of the pe mps groups were almost completely depleted at the interface of the water and sediment fig 6 moreover this experiment found that high concentrations of labile p were mainly concentrated in sediments below 20 mm in the 0 5 and 1 pe mps treatments fig 6 with an increase in the concentration of pe mps the concentration of p released from the sediment to the overlying water gradually decreased the distribution of 2d dgt labile s showed the active layers in the lower part 0 40 mm depth of the control group fig 6 however pe mps significantly reduced the sulphur cycling process at the sediment water interface for example the active layers of s were mainly concentrated at a depth of 0 60 mm and concentration of s at below 20 mm depth was significantly decreased in the 0 5 pe mp groups fig 6 after 18 days the results showed that the active layers were in the lower part of the 2d profiles in the control group however the labile p of the pe mps groups were almost completely depleted at the sediment water interface fig 7 moreover this experiment found that high concentrations of labile p were mainly concentrated in sediments below 40 mm under 0 1 1 pe mps fig 7 the results were similar to those on day 9 with an increase in the concentration of pe mps the p concentration released from the sediment to the overlying water gradually decreased on day 18 the distribution of 2d dgt labile s showed active layers in the lower part 20 mm depth of the control group however pe mps significantly reduced the sulphur cycling process at the sediment water interface for example the active layer of sulphur from 20 to 80 mm depth significantly decreased in the 1 pe mps groups fig 7 the vertical variations in no3 and nh4 concentrations at the sediment water interface are presented in fig 8 the results showed that compared to the control groups the reactive nutrients were distributed differently in the treatment groups the concentration of no3 in the three pe mps treatments generally followed a pattern that increased steadily and peaked at 0 to 70 mm and then remained constant at 0 6 1 2 mg l the nh4 concentration of the sediment in the 1 pe mps treatment was much lower than that in the control and other pe mps treatments fig 8 however after 18 d of pe mps exposure the concentration of no3 in the overlying waters was constant between 0 6 1 2 mg l in the control group the nh4 concentration of the sediment reached its highest range 0 2 0 7 mg l fig 8 3 5 impact of pe mps on water plant sediment systems the model results showed that pe mps have a direct impact on environmental conditions and biological individuals the pls pm model showed that pe mps had a negative effect on aboveground organs path coefficients 0 8175 p 0 03 water properties path coefficients 0 6575 p 0 001 and sediment enzymes path coefficients 0 7629 p 0 001 additionally pe mps showed a positive effect on sediment properties path coefficients 0 5944 p 0 002 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 phenotypic plasticity of v natans in response to pe mps mps contamination of sediment changes aquatic plant growth traits as evident by the plastic exposed decrease in nutrient allocation and biomass production figs 2 3 the influence of mps on plant growth has primarily included the following i direct toxicity of the plastic on the plant for instance nano plastics can accumulate in plant organs and inhibit growth sun et al 2020 ii direct toxicity from contaminant carryover in the plastic for instance plastic particles serve as carriers of microbial pathogens and toxic chemicals mammo et al 2020 and iii indirect effects on plant growth via changes in environmental conditions and biological relationships lozano and rillig 2020 in this study we observed that pe mps significantly decreased the total biomass and the relative growth rate of v natans this may be because pe mps mechanically blocked root activity in particular the 1 pe mps treatment exhibited considerably lower root activity root activity directly reflects the capacity for nutrient exchange and signal transmission in underground systems and low root activity can result in low nutrient uptake yang et al 2018 2020b mps can be absorbed by plant organs and induce growth restriction resulting in changes in the main gene ontology terms sun et al 2020 mps can decrease the root activity of floating aquatic plants lemna minor and salvinia cucullate kalcíkova et al 2017 yu et al 2021 and wetland plants typha latifolia yang et al 2020b our results showed that the root system of submerged plants v natans is also affected by mps in a dose dependant manner in addition o2 can be translocated downward to the rhizosphere from where it diffuses into the sediment surrounding the rhizosphere of submerged macrophytes han et al 2019 resulting in the activation of various critical biogeochemical processes koren et al 2015 in this study the amount of o2 released by the roots was affected in the short term which also affected the nutrient flow in the sediments owing to phenotypic plasticity plants can adapt to maximise their fitness to biotic and abiotic adverse conditions puijalon et al 2008 because macrophytes adapt to anoxia rols from roots stimulates nutrient retention benelli and bartoli 2021 for instance v natans has well developed mechanisms to acclimate to an anaerobic environment and has high rols lemoine et al 2012 therefore the o2 secretion behaviour of v natans is affected by mps stress but the adaptive growth characteristics promote the adaptation of v natans to mps stress and return to normal growth compared to the control group the c and n content in v natans significantly decreased in the pe mps treatment group fig 2 c n and p are the fundamental elements associated with the chemical composition of vegetation and changes in c n and p stoichiometry at the species level have been shown to play crucial roles in biomass composition morphology and physiological function sterner and elser 2002 tang et al 2018 early studies suggested that the n p ratio of vegetation is usually used as an indicator of relative n or p limitation in response to the environment and n p 16 indicates p limitation while n p 14 indicates n limitation koerselman and meuleman 1996 our results showed that the n p ratios of v natans were 6 31 leaf and 9 43 root which may suggest that the growth of v natans was n limited when exposed to pe mps many studies have shown that mps can affect the morphological physiological reproductive and interspecific relationships of plants sun et al 2020 yang et al 2020b lozano and rillig 2020 our research further found that mps can also directly affect the distribution and accumulation traits of elements in aquatic plants 4 2 pe mps can alter nutrient cycles in water plant sediment systems mps can alter sediment microbial community function and composition for instance polyurethane foam polyvinyl chloride and polylactic acid mps change the microbial community composition of salt marsh sediment and nitrogen cycling processes seeley et al 2020 this study confirmed that the presence of pe mps residues significantly alter the bacterial community structure in freshwater sediments microorganisms drive the biogeochemical cycles in an aqueous environment and as an ecological niche they provide habitats for organisms such as diatoms heterotrophic bacteria and fungi harrison et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 microorganisms rapidly colonise plastic debris resulting in changes in the microbial community structure wright et al 2020 in addition exposure to mps increases the abundance of specialised microorganisms zhang et al 2019 microorganisms can degrade mps into carbon sources which affects carbon cycling erni cassola et al 2020 wright et al 2020b for example mps addition alters soil c and nutrient turnover by accelerating microbial biomass and activity zhou et al 2021 our experimental results suggest that mps amendment significantly p 0 05 affected purine pyrimidine and glutathione metabolism this may be because pe mps exacerbated microbial limitations mainly by directly affecting sediment properties and sediment enzymes these significantly modulated metabolites stimulate microbial growth and regulate plant growth faure et al 2009 purine and pyrimidine participate in many biochemical processes in plants stasolla et al 2003 mps pollution from different plastic mulches can have deleterious effects on key soil functions related to microbial metabolism eventually damaging plant growth zhang et al 2021 conventional or biodegradable mps residues in soil significantly change the composition of the microbial community and affect the metabolic functions of microorganisms sun et al 2022 thus pe mps can alter the metabolic function of sediments and indirectly affect the growth of v natans sanz lázaro et al 2021 found that biodegradable plastics reduce the release of inorganic nitrogen from marine sediment to the water column in this study pe mps stimulated the release of no3 from the sediment to the water column this is probably because the addition of pe mps significantly increases the activity of amo which sensitively reflects the direction and extent of soil nitrification reactions urakawa et al 2019 moreover the enhancement of nitrification leads to a considerable amount of ammonia nitrogen conversion which also explains why the addition of mps inhibits the release of nh4 in sediments similar results were reported by seeley et al 2020 and yang et al 2020b who conducted a controlled microcosm experiment to study nitrogen cycling after exposure to mps and observed that nitrogen cycling processes in plants or sediments can be significantly affected by different mps additionally mps play a barrier role in nutrient and gas exchange in sediments de souza machado et al 2018 for instance plastic pollution can disturb the metabolic pathways of sediment by o2 depletion sanz lázaro et al 2021 in addition to interfering with the nitrogen cycle our results suggest that pe mps can contribute to the inhibition of the release and distribution of phosphorus and sulphur by physical barriers and changes in biological functions in sediment thus mps not only indirectly affect the soil nutrient cycle by changing the composition of mps associated biofilms chen et al 2020 but also directly affect the nutrient cycle by altering the abundance of related functional microorganisms rong et al 2021 or directly affect the diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface 5 conclusion the increasing concentrations of pe mps in freshwater systems as a result of plastic pollution has exerted substantial stress on aquatic plants influencing the biomass and element composition and the effect of phytotoxicity on morphological and physiological functions the results of this study suggest that pe mps can significantly affect plant growth microbial structure and function and nutrient cycles in freshwater ecosystems thus mps that are intercepted by aquatic plants and then deposited in sediments may be a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems future studies should focus on how diverse ecological factors such as temperature or sediment type affects the structure and

16202,increasing microplastic mp pollution and its effects on aquatic systems have become a global issue however the impact of mps on biogeochemical cycles is poorly understood a simulation study was performed to analyse the influence of polyethylene pe microplastics on the morphological physiological and stoichiometric c n p characteristics of submerged plants and to investigate their effects on the nutrient cycle and microbial community in freshwater sediment the results showed that pe mps treatments significantly decreased leaf nitrogen and carbon contents exposure to 1 pe mps suppressed the plant height total biomass root activity and relative growth rate of vallisneria natans decrease in dissolved oxygen do concentrations 19 93 40 26 were observed in the 1 pe mps treatment group compared to that in the control between 1 and 6 days the activities of enzymes ammonia monooxygenase and nitrate reductase related to the nitrogen cycle were significantly altered by the addition of pe mps we found that pe mps acted as obstacle disruptors resulting in a reduction in the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment to the overlying water this is because pe mps significantly alter the composition and metabolic properties of the microbial communities in sediments the plant growth and the nutrient cycle these findings helped evaluate the impacts of pe mps on the water plant sediment system and on the biogeochemical cycles of the freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogeochemistry ecosystems sediment metabolism plant growth 1 introduction recent research has shown that plastics in general and microplastics 5 mm mps are continuously introduced into all environmental compartments including air water columns sediments ice and snow ahmed et al 2021 van sebille et al 2015 freshwater and marine ecosystems receive large quantities of plastic debris that initially float at different water levels however they are colonised by microbes accumulate pollutants and sink to bottom sediments van cauwenberghe et al 2015 high concentrations of mps have been widely recorded in freshwater sediments worldwide including rivers lakes and reservoirs yang et al 2020a xu et al 2020 as research on mps in freshwater sediments is still in its infancy there are substantial differences in the sampling and measurement standards of mps yang et al 2020a thus the average abundance and morphotypes of freshwater sediment mps vary widely amongst different study areas xu et al 2020 mps can alter soil physical properties enzymes and microbial systems at certain levels jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 low density pe mps amendment significantly altered the soil bacterial community structure wang et al 2020 and increased urease and catalase activities in the soil huang et al 2019 moreover mps affected the capacity for related metabolic functions by changing the turnover rate of microbial communities wang et al 2020 sun et al 2022 therefore mps can affect key pools and fluxes within the soil nutrient cycles by changing the structure and metabolic status of the microbial community in terrestrial ecosystems zang et al 2020 sediments can store or release various compounds in the water column especially at the sediment water interface with frequent substance turnover and nutrient exchange due to their sensitivity to physical chemical and biological processes brigolin et al 2011 sanz lázaro et al 2021 reported that biodegradable plastics can alter the carbon and nitrogen cycles in marine sediments including increasing the decomposition of buried carbon and decreasing the release of inorganic nitrogen in addition the nitrogen cycling processes in salt marsh sediments can be significantly affected by different mps seeley et al 2020 however these experiments simulated the effect of mps on the nutrient cycle of marine ecosystems and there is still a lack of studies that focus on freshwater sediments lake sediments play a key role in geochemical cycling for instance most phosphorus in lake ecosystems is usually stored in the bottom sediments and recycled to the water column through various mechanisms horppila et al 2019 lake sediments can also affect the migration and transformation of pollutants lu et al 2021 sediments seem to be long term sinks for mps globally yang et al 2020a yin et al 2021 cesarini et al 2022 and vegetated ecosystems could act as sinks of mps as efficient particle traps carmen et al 2021 rhizosphere environments significantly affect global biogeochemical cycles such as in macrophytes which have been used to control p release by oxidising rhizosphere sediment and increasing its capacity to bind fe bound p in subtropical aquacultural lakes han et al 2018 li et al 2021 additionally mps significantly affect root growth and root associated microbial communities kalčíková et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 and the structure and function of soil systems therefore investigating the effects of mps on nutrient cycling together with the diffusion flux of the water plant sediment interface may be helpful for assessing the environmental risk of mps in freshwater sediments white polyethylene pe fibres are the dominant structure of mps in freshwater sediments lin et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2020a however few studies have reported the effects of pe mps in freshwater ecosystems thus the purpose of the experiments in this study was to explore the changes in i biogeochemical cycles related to nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur from the sediment to the water column and ii morphological physiological and stoichiometric characteristics of submerged plants upon pe mps exposure considering that mps concentrations in sediments are increasing the results of this experiment would enhance the understanding of the ecological effects of pe mps in freshwater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample

stoichiometry parts of v natans the plspm package in r was used to perform the path models sanchez et al 2015 3 results 3 1 impact of pe mps on nutrient stoichiometry and growth traits of v natans responses of v natans nutrient stoichiometry to mps at different concentrations the leaf c and n content and root c content in v natans significantly decreased with pe mps concentration fig 1 a b the leaf and root p contents of v natans showed no significant correlation with pe mps concentration fig 1c the total biomass plant height and rgr were significantly lower under high concentrations of pe mps 1 than in the control group fig 2 a b d however the addition of 1 pe mps significantly decreased the total biomass and relative growth rates of v natans compared to the 0 5 pe mps treatment fig 2a d no significant differences p 0 05 in the chlorophyll content and maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii of v natans were observed after pe mps exposure fig 2e f we observed that the root length of v natans did not change significantly but root cell activity was significantly affected fig 2c figure s3 when v natans was treated with 1 pe mps seedlings exhibited considerably lower root activity than those in the control group 0 pe mps figure s3 3 2 spatial micro distributions of o2 around the roots of v natans 2d co distributions of o2 concentrations surrounding v natans roots which appeared to be root like structures are shown in fig 3 and figure s4 it is apparent that the distribution of o2 is highly heterogeneous in v natans roots the areas of o2 concentrations represented by yellow to red colours were distributed irregularly on the root surface which may be closely linked to the root induced rols han et al 2018 compared with the 1 pe mps treatment group an increase in o2 concentration 22 11 67 39 was observed for days 1 6 in other treatments fig 3 moreover the concentration of o2 in below ground tissues was 31 74 higher in the 0 1 pe mps group than in the 1 pe mps group on day 3 fig 3 the o2 images clearly show rol around v natans roots for instance o2 concentration in the 1 pe mps treatment group decreased by 19 93 40 26 between 1 and 6 days compared to the control treatment fig 3 figure s4 o2 concentrations in the 0 1 pe mps treatment were reduced by 42 73 compared to that in the control treatment on day 6 fig 3 and s4 at night there was no significant difference in the o2 concentrations of the submerged plants amongst the pe mps treatment groups fig 3 figure s4 3 2 impact of pe mps on water properties the ph value was lowest on days 3 12 and 18 in the control group while it was higher in the 1 pe mps group on days 15 and 18 figure s5 in addition the water conductivity was remarkably higher in the 0 1 and 1 pe mps groups than in the 0 pe mps group figure s5 the 0 1 treatment group had the highest water conductivity on days 3 and 6 and that on days 9 18 was the highest in the 1 treatment group figure s5 however the do concentration in the 0 pe mps group was higher than that in the other mps groups after 6 12 days figure s5 3 3 responses of sediment microbial and enzyme to pe mps addition the phyla actinobacteria desulfobacterota firmicutes and gemmatimonadota were significantly different amongst the three populations figure s6 the relative abundance of actinobacteria and firmicutes in the 0 1 1 mps group was significantly higher than that in the 0 mps group figure s6 however the relative abundance of desulfobacterota and gemmatimonadota in the 0 1 1 mps group was significantly lower than that in the 0 mps group figure s6 qc samples were analysed to confirm the reliability of the lc ms ms based metabolomics approach used in this study which showed a stable retention time without distinct peak drifts there were 5748 and 4232 ions tested in each sample profile in esi and esi modes respectively low quality ions were deleted based on their relative standard deviation 30 a total of 5561 and 4074 ions in each treatment were distinguished in the esi and esi modes respectively pca performed on all the tested samples revealed that the qc samples were clustered close to each other in the two dimensional pca score plots figure s7 suggesting satisfactory stability and repeatability of the lc ms ms analysis we also analysed the distribution of metabolic data across the different mps treatments using two dimensional pca pca score plots in esi mode showed distinct metabolic profiles in the control and mps groups figure s7 furthermore the pls da model was cross validated and can be considered a significant separation of the four mps groups in the esi mode figure s8 a one way anova analysis revealed that 8 11 eicosadiynoic acid was significantly decreased 71 89 p 0 05 in sediment amended with 1 pe mps compared to that in the control figure s9 the relative abundance of melibiose was markedly reduced 43 72 60 73 p 0 001 with increasing pe mps concentration figure s9 similarly the relative abundances of 3 ketosphingosine farnesyl acetone linoleamide 2 dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid oleamide and n undecylbenzenesulfonic acid were also affected p 0 05 at the highest pe mps concentrations 1 figure s9 the kegg database was used to analyse the differential metabolites we uploaded the differential metabolites to the kegg website to identify the relevant pathways analysis of metabolite pathways showed that purine pyrimidine and glutathione metabolism were significantly altered in the mps treatments compared with the control groups fig 4 furthermore pathway topology analysis was conducted using metabo analyst 3 0 using high quality kegg metabolic pathways as reference standards based on the identified metabolites and differences in their abundances two metabolic pathways had a pathway impact value higher than 0 1 which is the cut off value for relevance the two significantly relevant metabolic pathways caprolactam degradation and glutathione metabolism indicated the effect of mps treatment on the sediment metabolite profile fig 4 enzyme activity a key indicator of the nitrogen cycle was significantly altered by the addition of pe mps the activity of amo was increased by 15 8 23 45 and the activity of nr was reduced by 148 with pe mps addition compared to that in the control p 0 05 fig 5 a b this was supported by the decreased microbial activity as evidenced by the disturbance in the nitrogen cycle with pe mps addition fig 5 moreover the addition of pe mps had no effect on nir activity p 0 05 fig 5c 3 4 nutrient exchange across the sediment water interface after nine days as shown in fig 6 the distribution of 2d dgt labile p showed clear spatial variability the results show active layers in the upper part 20 40 mm depth of the 2d profiles in the control group however the labile p of the pe mps groups were almost completely depleted at the interface of the water and sediment fig 6 moreover this experiment found that high concentrations of labile p were mainly concentrated in sediments below 20 mm in the 0 5 and 1 pe mps treatments fig 6 with an increase in the concentration of pe mps the concentration of p released from the sediment to the overlying water gradually decreased the distribution of 2d dgt labile s showed the active layers in the lower part 0 40 mm depth of the control group fig 6 however pe mps significantly reduced the sulphur cycling process at the sediment water interface for example the active layers of s were mainly concentrated at a depth of 0 60 mm and concentration of s at below 20 mm depth was significantly decreased in the 0 5 pe mp groups fig 6 after 18 days the results showed that the active layers were in the lower part of the 2d profiles in the control group however the labile p of the pe mps groups were almost completely depleted at the sediment water interface fig 7 moreover this experiment found that high concentrations of labile p were mainly concentrated in sediments below 40 mm under 0 1 1 pe mps fig 7 the results were similar to those on day 9 with an increase in the concentration of pe mps the p concentration released from the sediment to the overlying water gradually decreased on day 18 the distribution of 2d dgt labile s showed active layers in the lower part 20 mm depth of the control group however pe mps significantly reduced the sulphur cycling process at the sediment water interface for example the active layer of sulphur from 20 to 80 mm depth significantly decreased in the 1 pe mps groups fig 7 the vertical variations in no3 and nh4 concentrations at the sediment water interface are presented in fig 8 the results showed that compared to the control groups the reactive nutrients were distributed differently in the treatment groups the concentration of no3 in the three pe mps treatments generally followed a pattern that increased steadily and peaked at 0 to 70 mm and then remained constant at 0 6 1 2 mg l the nh4 concentration of the sediment in the 1 pe mps treatment was much lower than that in the control and other pe mps treatments fig 8 however after 18 d of pe mps exposure the concentration of no3 in the overlying waters was constant between 0 6 1 2 mg l in the control group the nh4 concentration of the sediment reached its highest range 0 2 0 7 mg l fig 8 3 5 impact of pe mps on water plant sediment systems the model results showed that pe mps have a direct impact on environmental conditions and biological individuals the pls pm model showed that pe mps had a negative effect on aboveground organs path coefficients 0 8175 p 0 03 water properties path coefficients 0 6575 p 0 001 and sediment enzymes path coefficients 0 7629 p 0 001 additionally pe mps showed a positive effect on sediment properties path coefficients 0 5944 p 0 002 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 phenotypic plasticity of v natans in response to pe mps mps contamination of sediment changes aquatic plant growth traits as evident by the plastic exposed decrease in nutrient allocation and biomass production figs 2 3 the influence of mps on plant growth has primarily included the following i direct toxicity of the plastic on the plant for instance nano plastics can accumulate in plant organs and inhibit growth sun et al 2020 ii direct toxicity from contaminant carryover in the plastic for instance plastic particles serve as carriers of microbial pathogens and toxic chemicals mammo et al 2020 and iii indirect effects on plant growth via changes in environmental conditions and biological relationships lozano and rillig 2020 in this study we observed that pe mps significantly decreased the total biomass and the relative growth rate of v natans this may be because pe mps mechanically blocked root activity in particular the 1 pe mps treatment exhibited considerably lower root activity root activity directly reflects the capacity for nutrient exchange and signal transmission in underground systems and low root activity can result in low nutrient uptake yang et al 2018 2020b mps can be absorbed by plant organs and induce growth restriction resulting in changes in the main gene ontology terms sun et al 2020 mps can decrease the root activity of floating aquatic plants lemna minor and salvinia cucullate kalcíkova et al 2017 yu et al 2021 and wetland plants typha latifolia yang et al 2020b our results showed that the root system of submerged plants v natans is also affected by mps in a dose dependant manner in addition o2 can be translocated downward to the rhizosphere from where it diffuses into the sediment surrounding the rhizosphere of submerged macrophytes han et al 2019 resulting in the activation of various critical biogeochemical processes koren et al 2015 in this study the amount of o2 released by the roots was affected in the short term which also affected the nutrient flow in the sediments owing to phenotypic plasticity plants can adapt to maximise their fitness to biotic and abiotic adverse conditions puijalon et al 2008 because macrophytes adapt to anoxia rols from roots stimulates nutrient retention benelli and bartoli 2021 for instance v natans has well developed mechanisms to acclimate to an anaerobic environment and has high rols lemoine et al 2012 therefore the o2 secretion behaviour of v natans is affected by mps stress but the adaptive growth characteristics promote the adaptation of v natans to mps stress and return to normal growth compared to the control group the c and n content in v natans significantly decreased in the pe mps treatment group fig 2 c n and p are the fundamental elements associated with the chemical composition of vegetation and changes in c n and p stoichiometry at the species level have been shown to play crucial roles in biomass composition morphology and physiological function sterner and elser 2002 tang et al 2018 early studies suggested that the n p ratio of vegetation is usually used as an indicator of relative n or p limitation in response to the environment and n p 16 indicates p limitation while n p 14 indicates n limitation koerselman and meuleman 1996 our results showed that the n p ratios of v natans were 6 31 leaf and 9 43 root which may suggest that the growth of v natans was n limited when exposed to pe mps many studies have shown that mps can affect the morphological physiological reproductive and interspecific relationships of plants sun et al 2020 yang et al 2020b lozano and rillig 2020 our research further found that mps can also directly affect the distribution and accumulation traits of elements in aquatic plants 4 2 pe mps can alter nutrient cycles in water plant sediment systems mps can alter sediment microbial community function and composition for instance polyurethane foam polyvinyl chloride and polylactic acid mps change the microbial community composition of salt marsh sediment and nitrogen cycling processes seeley et al 2020 this study confirmed that the presence of pe mps residues significantly alter the bacterial community structure in freshwater sediments microorganisms drive the biogeochemical cycles in an aqueous environment and as an ecological niche they provide habitats for organisms such as diatoms heterotrophic bacteria and fungi harrison et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 microorganisms rapidly colonise plastic debris resulting in changes in the microbial community structure wright et al 2020 in addition exposure to mps increases the abundance of specialised microorganisms zhang et al 2019 microorganisms can degrade mps into carbon sources which affects carbon cycling erni cassola et al 2020 wright et al 2020b for example mps addition alters soil c and nutrient turnover by accelerating microbial biomass and activity zhou et al 2021 our experimental results suggest that mps amendment significantly p 0 05 affected purine pyrimidine and glutathione metabolism this may be because pe mps exacerbated microbial limitations mainly by directly affecting sediment properties and sediment enzymes these significantly modulated metabolites stimulate microbial growth and regulate plant growth faure et al 2009 purine and pyrimidine participate in many biochemical processes in plants stasolla et al 2003 mps pollution from different plastic mulches can have deleterious effects on key soil functions related to microbial metabolism eventually damaging plant growth zhang et al 2021 conventional or biodegradable mps residues in soil significantly change the composition of the microbial community and affect the metabolic functions of microorganisms sun et al 2022 thus pe mps can alter the metabolic function of sediments and indirectly affect the growth of v natans sanz lázaro et al 2021 found that biodegradable plastics reduce the release of inorganic nitrogen from marine sediment to the water column in this study pe mps stimulated the release of no3 from the sediment to the water column this is probably because the addition of pe mps significantly increases the activity of amo which sensitively reflects the direction and extent of soil nitrification reactions urakawa et al 2019 moreover the enhancement of nitrification leads to a considerable amount of ammonia nitrogen conversion which also explains why the addition of mps inhibits the release of nh4 in sediments similar results were reported by seeley et al 2020 and yang et al 2020b who conducted a controlled microcosm experiment to study nitrogen cycling after exposure to mps and observed that nitrogen cycling processes in plants or sediments can be significantly affected by different mps additionally mps play a barrier role in nutrient and gas exchange in sediments de souza machado et al 2018 for instance plastic pollution can disturb the metabolic pathways of sediment by o2 depletion sanz lázaro et al 2021 in addition to interfering with the nitrogen cycle our results suggest that pe mps can contribute to the inhibition of the release and distribution of phosphorus and sulphur by physical barriers and changes in biological functions in sediment thus mps not only indirectly affect the soil nutrient cycle by changing the composition of mps associated biofilms chen et al 2020 but also directly affect the nutrient cycle by altering the abundance of related functional microorganisms rong et al 2021 or directly affect the diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface 5 conclusion the increasing concentrations of pe mps in freshwater systems as a result of plastic pollution has exerted substantial stress on aquatic plants influencing the biomass and element composition and the effect of phytotoxicity on morphological and physiological functions the results of this study suggest that pe mps can significantly affect plant growth microbial structure and function and nutrient cycles in freshwater ecosystems thus mps that are intercepted by aquatic plants and then deposited in sediments may be a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems future studies should focus on how diverse ecological factors such as temperature or sediment type affects the structure and

16203,cyanobacterial blooms are always treated in exponential phase which demands high dosages of algicides e g cuso4 actually cyanobacterial blooms in late lag phase exhibit low cell density and specific physiological biochemical characteristics implying the possibility of controlling blooms in a more efficient and economical way with cuso4 treatment if cyanobacterial cells in late lag phase can be treated in this study the outbreakof a microcystis bloom was simulated and microcystis samples in late lag and exponential phases were treated with cuso4 the results showed that m aeruginosa in late lag phase had a higher ratio of dividing cells fv fm and intracellular total organic carbon content toc than that in exponential phase indicating that its metabolic activity was vigorous m aeruginosa in late lag phase could more easily be blocked since a higher decrease in chlorophyll a fv fm and membrane integrity occurred under the same dosages of cuso4 exposure compared to m aeruginosa in exponential phase meanwhile microcystin release in late lag phase was less than that in exponential phase moreover higher sensitivity in late lag phase was confirmed at the individual level as the photosynthesis related genes psab and rbcl were more down regulated than those in exponential phase in general cyanobacteria in late lag phase exhibited higher sensitivity to cuso4 indicating that cuso4 treatments in late lag phase can achieve a higher control efficiency and fewer release of microcystin with low dosages algicide hence it is a more environmentally friendly strategy to control cyanobacterial blooms than the traditional strategy applied in exponential phase graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria blooms m aeruginosa late lag phase exponential phase cellular sensitivity 1 introduction frequent outbreaks of cyanobacteria blooms are a serious problem in aquatic environments and cause public health threats and environmental hazards visser et al 2016 paerl and paul 2012 paerl et al 2011 during cyanobacterial growth a variety of cyanotoxins are produced including microcystin anatoxin and saxitoxin which can damage human skin liver and nervous system merel et al 2013 fan et al 2013b grattan et al 2016 carmichael and boyer 2016 peacock et al 2018 in addition geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib can produce offensive airborne taste and odor t o materials which are resistant to natural degradation boiling and conventional water treatments watson et al 2016 xu et al 2019 during water treatment process cell lysis induces the release of algal organic matter aom behaving as the precursors of disinfection by products dbps and becoming a potential threat to human health tomlinson et al 2016 li et al 2012 coral et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 cuso4 is a common algicide for emergency treatment of cyanobacteria blooms and it has been widely used in europe australia and many other countries e g brazil india le jeune et al 2006 levy et al 2007 xu et al 2019 to date its ecological risk has been noted for example the typically applied cuso4 dosages is 25 1000 μg l 1 which is acutely and chronically ecotoxic to many aquatic species including fish raman and cook 1988 mcknight et al 1983 in addition cu2 induces the free radical species and impairs cellular membrane leading to cyanotoxins and aom leakage into surrounding waters qian et al 2010 wu et al 2007 however it was not denied that cuso4 has the advantages of high efficiency and can block cyanobacterial blooms to some degrees in a short time jiang et al 2020 hence a scenario for proper application of cuso4 to achieve efficient control of cyanobacterial expansion is still necessary generally the whole cyanobacterial blooms have four stages including delay development maintenance and decay some previous studies noted that the physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria in different stages can vary for example li et al 2020a 2020b 2021b 2021c found that cyanobacteria at development and maintenance stages had higher photosynthetic activity than those at decay stage but their oxidative resistance became lower with kmno4 oxidation and chlorination overall these studies provided a clue that control of cyanobacterial blooms should be accurately performed depending on bloom stage among the four stages delay and development stages play key roles in the formation of a severe cyanobacterial bloom however the majority of previous studies on cyanobacterial control have only focused on development stage exponential phase due to their fast growth rate vigorous metabolism and strong activity in this phase lab studies or the large amounts of cyanobacterial cells and obvious environmental damage field studies zhou et al 2013 iwinski et al 2016 fan et al 2013a most importantly before blooming cyanobacterial cells will go through a long period of slow growth in winter and early spring characterized as delay stage mainly due to the limitations of temperature and illumination paerl and paul 2012 liu et al 2011 ma et al 2013 at delay stage lag phase cyanobacterial cells spend a relatively long time adapting to the new medium environment conditions and thus their growth rate seems limited however silencing is only superficial and these cells in delay stage are preparing for a rapid biomass increase via dramatic material and energy synthesis daniel and kishony 2013 moreover although the respiration synthesis rate of microbial cells is close to that of exponential cells at development stage they are relatively sensitive to adverse environmental conditions zhou and wang 2008 these findings suggest the possibility of controlling blooms in a more efficient and economical way with cuso4 treatments if cyanobacterial cells in delay stage can be treated to date comparative studies on cuso4 to treat cyanobacteria in lag and exponential phases are quite limited microcystis aeruginosa is the most common species in cyanobacterial blooms hence in this study the cyanobacterial bloom fig s1 was simulated at lab scale and m aeruginosa cells in late lag and exponential phases were employed to conduct experiments the variation in chlorophyll a fv fm microcystin membrane integrity and the expression of three related genes psab rbcl and mcya of m aeruginosa in late lag and exponential phases in response to cuso4 exposure was investigated chlorophyll a is usually proportional to the cell density of cyanobacteria so it can reflect the biomass i e cell number or cell density here chen et al 2016 cao et al 2005 fv fm is the optimal maximal quantum yield of ps ⅱ which can also reflect the photosynthetic capacity of cyanobacteria li et al 2020b microcystin is a metabolite during the growth of cyanobacteria and is the key factor influencing human health membrane integrity can more intuitively reflect the degree of damage to cyanobacterial cells by algicides moreover gene expression experiments were designed to explore the effect of cuso4 on cyanobacteria at the genetic level the objectives of this study are to clarify the comparative responses of m aeruginosa exposed to different concentrations of cuso4 in late lag and exponential phases with the aim of determining whether m aeruginosa in late lag phase is more sensitive to cuso4 treatments in adverse environments and to propose more environmentally friendly and effective early prevention and control measures for cyanobacteria blooms at delay stage 2 materials and methods 2 1 cyanobacterial culture a toxic strain m aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was selected as the strain used in this study it was cultured and preserved in bg 11 medium hopebio china and placed in illumination incubator at 26 c ningbo prandt china the illumination intensity of the incubator was 3000 lx and the cycle time of light dark was 12 12 h 2 2 preparing of m aeruginosa samples in late lag and exponential phases and determination of their characteristics m aeruginosa cells in exponential phase were collected and then diluted to 1 0 1 104 cells ml 1 for inoculation to simulate the delay development stages of a bloom the inoculum cell density was determined to ensure that a long and distinct lag phase could be observed this inoculum was spiked into 2 l of bg 11 medium and cultured under the conditions mentioned above samples were collected during growth to observe cell division fv fm value total organic matter toc content of individual cells and dissolved oxygen do variation in the two phases subsequently growth curve was observed and thus m aeruginosa in late lag and exponential phases for subsequent experiments was collected according to culture time cell density and cell characteristics fig 1 after 5 7 days cell density of m aeruginosa reached to 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 characterized as m aeruginosa samples in late lag phase m aeruginosa samples in exponential phase were collected at 10 12 days and their cell density was 1 7 0 5 106 cells ml 1 2 3 cuso4 treatments for cuso4 treatments 100 ml of m aeruginosa cells was harvested in late lag and exponential phases and then divided into 250 ml conical flasks to define cuso4 dosages employed in subsequent experiments a series of cuso4 concentrations i e 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 mg l 1 were tested during treatments chlorophyll a was measured at 0 2 4 8 12 24 and 48 h since it has a good correlation with cyanobacterial number density and can indicate the effect of cuso4 on growth capacity chen et al 2016 cao et al 2005 according to the effects of cuso4 treatments on chlorophyll a cuso4 at 0 0 1 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 was selected for subsequent experiments including photosynthetic activity microcystin and membrane integrity fv fm was determined at 0 2 4 8 12 24 and 48 h microcystin and membrane integrity were individually determined at 0 2 24 and 48 h to clarify the different sensitivities of m aeruginosa in the two phases to cuso4 at individual level another group of cuso4 exposure tests was performed specifically the cultures in exponential phase were diluted to the same cell density with late lag phase these cells in exponential phase were centrifuged and the supernatant remained the centrifuged cells were resuspended in the supernatant at the required concentration of 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 in this way these cells in exponential phase were diluted in original liquid environment after that chlorophyll a fv fm and the relative expression of the three genes were measured after 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 exposure 2 4 determination of the biomass and physiological biochemical parameters 2 4 1 m aeruginosa observation and

microcystin assay kit using a multimode reader bmg labtech germany before the samples were determined a standard curve was drawn according to the instructions provided by the kit fig s2 these samples were centrifuged firstly and the supernatant was taken for the measurements of extracellular microcystin ex mcs the centrifuged m aeruginosa cells were resuspended and lysed as mentioned in the toc determination for the measurement of intracellular extracellular in mcs the above supernatants and lysates were diluted according to the range of the standard curve finally the plate was read at 450 nm with a multimode reader and the concentrations of in mcs and ex mcs were calculated according to the standard curve 2 4 7 membrane integrity membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was determined using flow cytometry luminex america after staining with sytox green nucleic acid dye the dye can specifically bind to the nucleic acid of m aeruginosa with a damaged membrane and exhibit green fluorescence at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm in contrast the dye cannot penetrate the intact cell membrane and bind to nucleic acids making intact cells exhibit red fluorescence sytox green nucleic acid dye was added to the samples mixed and incubated in the dark for 10 min approximately 5000 algal cells were recorded by a flow cytometry and the ratio of cells with green fluorescence was calculated to quantify the loss of membrane integrity 2 4 8 rna extraction reverse transcription and qpcr analysis rt qpcr m aeruginosa samples were collected and centrifuged at 8000 g at 4 c for 3 min and then washed with pbs twice after that they were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until rna extraction m aeruginosa cells were frozen and ground to powder in liquid nitrogen and a spin column plant total rna purification kit sangon biotech was used for total rna extraction li et al 2019 cdna was synthesized immediately after extraction by reverse transcription using transscript one step gdna removal and cdna synthesis supermix transgen biotech china rt qpcr was carried out using a quantstudio 3 abi america the following pcr protocol was used with two steps one denaturation step at 95 c for 5 mins and 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s followed by 60 c for 50 s photosynthesis and microcystin relevant genes psab rbcl and mcya were selected and the primer sequences are presented in table s3 shao et al 2009 yu et al 2019 16s rrna was used as the housekeeping gene to regulate the changes in gene expression and the 2 δδct method was used to quantify the relative expression of different genes between each treatment group where δδct ct target gene ct 16s stress ct target gene ct16s control shao et al 2009 yu et al 2019 2 5 data analysis all experiments above were conducted in triplicate and error bars in the plots represent the standard deviation sd all data were statistically analyzed using student s t test by ibm spss statistics 20 0 and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of m aeruginosa in two phases characteristics of m aeruginosa including cell density ratio of dividing cells photosynthetic activity and toc content were monitored after incubation figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 cell density increased continuously and reached to 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 in late lag phase after 5 7 days of inoculation then cyanobacterial growth experienced an evident break point and entered into exponential phase in addition the ratio of dividing cells was monitored throughout these growth phases fig 2a which fluctuated between 33 3 and 42 9 in late lag phase and decreased to 5 7 in exponential phase similar to the ratio of dividing cells the photosynthetic activity and toc content of m aeruginosa were also significantly higher in late lag phase fv fm 0 46 0 5 toc 0 50 pg cell 1 than in exponential phase fv fm 0 25 0 33 toc 0 10 0 19 pg cell 1 fig 2b and c p 0 01 table s4 cell density in late lag phase was much lower than that in exponential phase but these cells in the former phase had a higher toc content photosynthetic activity and ratio of dividing cells indicating that their metabolic activity was vigorous it was necessary to ask the following questions do these cells have a higher sensitivity as mentioned in the introduction section if so could they be removed more easily by cuso4 treatment 3 2 cell inactivation of m aeruginosa in two phases after dosing with different concentrations of cuso4 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 0 mg l 1 chlorophyll a of m aeruginosa in late lag phase and exponential phases was measured to characterize cyanobacterial biomass fig 3 a and b when these samples were exposed to 0 05 mg l 1 cuso4 the growth of m aeruginosa in both phases was not affected fig 3 chlorophyll a continued to increase over time and the growth trend was consistent with the control group however m aeruginosa in the two phases exhibited very different responses to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 for m aeruginosa in late lag phase cyanobacterial growth was inhibited and chlorophyll a level was 0 25 μg l 1 at 48 h with a decrease of 77 compared to 0 h for m aeruginosa in exponential phase chlorophyll a showed an increasing trend and reached 3 36 μg l 1 at 48 h which was 1 44 folds higher than that at 0 h when samples were exposed to 0 2 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 chlorophyll a in both phases was gradually reduced to about zero at 48 h and the inhibition was even more significant with higher exposure dosage fig 3a and b it was also shown that normalized chlorophyll a decreased more in late lag phase than in the exponential phase when exposed to the same concentration of cuso4 fig 3c and d these findings suggested that cuso4 at 0 1 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 could be selected for photosynthetic activity tests fv fm of m aeruginosa in late lag phase significantly declined when the cells were exposed to three concentrations of cuso4 for a 48 h period p 0 01 table s4 fig 4 specifically fv fm increased slightly in the first 2 h under the effect of 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 and then it decreased gradually to 0 08 which is 19 of 0 h after 48 h table 1 after exposure to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 fv fm decreased significantly to 0 13 and 0 04 approximately 30 and 11 of 0 h in 2 h p 0 01 table s4 and then it became zero indicating that photosynthetic activity totally disappeared during 2 48 h fig 4a for m aeruginosa in exponential phase 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 exhibited no inhibition but instead of a slight promotion and fv fm was 0 38 at 48 h which was 1 25 folds than that at 0 h in addition fv fm could still be detected at 8 h under 0 4 mg l 1 cuso4 treatment while it could not be detected at 12 48 h with cuso4 at 1 0 mg l 1 fv fm could not be detected after 4 h fig 4b it is clear that cu2 can kill or inhibit the activity of cyanobacterial cells cu2 can destroy the structure of chlorophyll by entering cells and then it can competitively replace mg2 in the active site of chlorophyll molecules francis and thomas 1977 chillappagari et al 2009 waldron and robinson 2009 jančula and maršálek 2011 chlorophyll is the core pigment of illumination absorption in photosynthesis and thus chlorophyll destruction will severely weaken photosynthetic activity qian et al 2010 jančula and maršálek 2011 liu and blankenship 2019 in this section these results showed that m aeruginosa in both phases was inactivated by cuso4 with increasing dosages however m aeruginosa in late lag phase presented obviously higher sensitivity than that in exponential phase including biomass and photosynthetic activity fv fm indicated photosynthetic activity that was independent of cell density but chlorophyll a was evidently a variable dependent on biomass it is well known that the biomass in these two phases is much different and some studies agreed that algal inactivation by algicides is density dependent moreno garrido et al 2000 franklin et al 2002 de schamphelaere et al 2005 li et al 2021b for example li et al 2021b pointed out that higher cell density at maintenance stage led to lower oxidant exposure in each m aeruginosa cell therefore the lower cell density in late lag phase than in exponential phase may have led to this observation when cells are exposed to cuso4 at the same concentration the amount of cu2 absorbed in a single cell in late lag phase may be greater than that in exponential phase and thus it causes more serious damage to m aeruginosa in this phase in other words these results could not provide enough evidence that m aeruginosa in late lag phase was more sensitive to cuso4 further evidence was necessary to discriminate the sensitivity of m aeruginosa at two phases at the individual level 3 3 higher sensitivity of m aeruginosa in late lag phase at the individual level to address this question m aeruginosa in the two phases was adjusted to the same cell density and then it was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 these results can be seen in figs 5 and 6 in fact the trends were similar to those in figs 3 and 4 after exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 chlorophyll a of the late lag phase showed an increasing trend at the beginning hours and then decreased slowly to approximately 23 of the initial level however in exponential phase chlorophyll a presented an increasing inhibited regrowing trend and then it was restored to the starting level fig 5a the fv fm values of late lag phase and exponential phase with the same cell density after exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 were also measured fig 5b similar to the chlorophyll a results 0 1 mg l 1cuso4 significantly inhibited photosynthetic activity in the late lag phase p 0 01 table s4 and fv fm decreased to 0 1 after 24 h fig 5b however there was no inhibitory effect on photosynthetic activity in exponential phase and its fv fm was 0 36 after 24 h genes associated with photosynthesis psab and rbcl also differed in gene expression when m aeruginosa in the two phases was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 fig 6a and b the gene expression of psab and rbcl was down regulated at 2 h and 12 h when exposed to cuso4 for both phases but down regulated percentages were higher for late lag phase than for exponential phase for example the psab gene was down regulated 0 51 and 0 98 folds at 12 h in two phases respectively photosynthesis is the main energy metabolism pathway of cyanobacteria and the expression of related genes in this process is of great significance the psab and rbcl genes encode key proteins involved in ps ӏ and carbon assimilation respectively shao et al 2009 photosynthesis related genes down regulated under stress were consistent with previous studies for example qian et al 2010 found that psab rbcl and psbd1 genes of m aeruginosa were down regulated to varying degrees under cuso4 exposure the higher the exposure concentration was the more down regulated qian et al 2010 lu et al 2014 in this study the down regulated levels of psab and rbcl were greater in late lag phase than in exponential phase indicating a greater inhibition of the photosynthesis process correspondingly strong inhibition of photosynthetic activity in this phase also supported this finding fig 5b when m aeruginosa in two phases with the same cell density was exposed to cuso4 the possible influence of cell density on cuso4 was eliminated whereas different sensitivities of the two phases at the individual level were enlightened in other words exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 was more effective inactivating m aeruginosa in late lag phase than in exponential phase figs 5 and 6 it was determined that m aeruginosa in late lag phase did have a higher sensitivity at the individual level in late lag phase cyanobacterial cells have completed adaptation to new medium or the natural environment with the aim to prepare their bloom proliferation bacteria in late lag phase are known to have high metabolic activity large cytoplasmic rna content high respiratory rate nucleic acid protein synthesis rate and high sensitivity to environmental conditions zhou and wang 2008 which is commonly taught in textbooks m aeruginosa belongs to gram negative bacteria springstein et al 2020 and thus it has similar cellular characteristics which were also found in this study including higher intracellular toc content photosynthetic activity and the ratio of dividing cells in late lag phase fig 2 more importantly cyanobacteria in this phase had higher sensitivity which was beneficial to its control iron is an essential mineral for bacterial growth salmonella gram negative bacteria accumulates iron and calcium plasma during the late lag phase for subsequent growth rolfe et al 2012 however this process may stimulate the fenton reaction in cells making them more sensitive to oxidative stress and more vulnerable to damage touati 2000 cellular sensitivity has been observed in cyanobacteria or bacteria in their late lag phase however the underlying causes were speculative and need further exploration in the future for example the transport and binding of copper in cyanobacterial cells affect the bioavailability of copper li et al 2021a which may lead to differences in sensitivity to investigate the genes regulation related to copper transport and binding such as two p type atpases ctaa and pacs burkhead et al 2009 in future studies is necessary to explain the high sensitivity of cyanobacterial cells in late lag phase 3 4 much lower release of microcystin in late lag phase the release of intracellular materials microcystin was also determined during cuso4 exposure as shown in fig 7 the content of in mcs in both phases decreased when exposed to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 when the samples were exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 for 48 h the content of in mcs in exponential phase was 1 19 folds at 0 h however in late lag phase in mcs decreased to 1 65 μg l 1 at 48 h and only 31 at 0 h the ex mcs contents in exponential phase after exposure to cuso4 increased rapidly over time after exposure to three concentrations of cuso4 for 48 h the contents were 2 49 2 73 and 2 74 times those of the original contents respectively in late lag phase ex mcs content increased with a much slower trend during 0 24 h but a slight decrease occurred during 24 48 h in addition in ex mcs in late lag phase were dramatically lower than those in exponential phase approximately one order of magnitude membrane integrity was also observed after cuso4 exposure fig 8 before being exposed to cuso4 m aeruginosa cells in both phases showed a small amount of green fluorescence after staining after exposure to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 cells in both phases were damaged to a greater extent in late lag phase membrane damage reached 98 at 2 h which showed no significant difference from that at 48 h p 0 05 table s4 fig 8a in exponential phase it reached 76 16 81 16 at 2 h and then increased up to 91 49 95 93 at 48 h when exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 membrane damage in late lag phase ranged from 57 to 76 during the following hours however membrane damage in exponential phase was only 25 64 at 2 h and then decreased to less than 10 at 24 h and 48 h fig 8b cu2 not only affects chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis processes but also produce reactive oxygen species ros destroying cell membrane integrity qian et al 2010 wu et al 2007 furthermore cu2 can bind to noncopper proteins to cause protein denaturation and disorder normal physiological activities stevenson et al 2013 stauber and florence 1987 gledhill et al 1997 therefore the decrease in cellular membrane integrity after cuso4 exposure observed in this study resulted in changes in in mcs and ex mcs i e in mcs were released and then ex mcs increased due to damaged membrane integrity figs 7 and 8 because of the higher sensitivity in late lag phase than that in exponential phase more severe membrane integrity damage was observed in cyanobacterial cells in this phase suggesting that more intracellular materials would be released into the environment from an individual cell however the concentration of the released microcystin in late lag phase was still much lower than that in exponential phase which was mainly due to their low cell density notably ex mcs decreased by approximately 0 5 0 6 μg l 1after cuso4 exposure for 24 48 h in late lag phase fig 7b similar and opposite phenomena were observed in previous studies tsai 2015 found an increased decreased trend of microcystin when m aeruginosa was exposed to cuso4 and copper ethanolamine zhou et al 2018 found that there was no degradation when microcystin was directly exposed to cuso4 but microcystin decreased by approximately 80 when ascorbic acid was present in the system since active species oh was produced in actual water the presence of microcystin might not persist as related studies have shown that the half life period of microcystin in an actual pond was approximately 1 1 9 d kinley et al 2018 this study observed that total and extracellular microcystin were present at lower concentrations in late lag phase than in exponential phase therefore the risk of microcystin in late lag phase was much lower than that in exponential phase after cuso4 treatments on the other hand the biological synthesis of microcystin in two phases can further support the above conclusion when m aeruginosa in two phases was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 the gene expression of mcya in two phases was measured the expression of mcya in exponential phase was significantly up regulated at 2 and 12 h p 0 01 table s4 fig 6c indicating that cuso4 promoted the synthesis of microcystin which may be a stress response of m aeruginosa or the so called hormesis effect gan et al 2012 yu et al 2021 other studies also showed that the application of benzalkonium chlorides uv b polystyrene plastics and h2o2 on m aeruginosa in exponential phase induced mcya mcyb mcyd and mcyh encoding microcystin synthesis and transport up regulated qian et al 2022 cordeiro araujo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 ross et al 2006 in fact the synthesis and release of cyanotoxin is a survival strategy of toxic cyanobacteria and it was helpful to compete with other aquatic organisms against grazing by predators and act as signaling molecules hu and rzymski 2019 in this study the inactivation effect of 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 on m aeruginosa was limited and caused the stress response for exponential phase however the concentration of cuso4 was sufficiently to inactive cyanobacteria in late lag phase since its growth and activity were effectively inhibited moreover the expression of mcya was down regulated in this phase which was consistent with the decrease in total microcystin content fig 7a and b indicating that microcystin synthesis was also inhibited cyanobacterial biomass is usually high during blooms leading to the stress response of cyanobacteria and increasing the risk of cyanotoxin synthesis release if the dosages of algicides are not high enough which is detrimental to the safety of drinking water 3 5 environmental implications current studies mostly focused on the control of cyanobacterial blooms at development stage during this period the cell density of cyanobacteria is high and scum can be formed on the water surface posing a substantial threat to water safety high dosage algicides will cause the release of cyanotoxins and aom posing a high threaten to the safety of drinking water and human health this study proposes a new idea to achieve high efficiency and safe control with low dosage algicides for cyanobacteria at delay stage attributed to the characteristics of higher sensitivity and lower cell density in late lag phase of m aeruginosa than at development stage compared with the simple components of bg 11 medium the toxicity and bioavailability of cuso4 in actual water may be affected by ph redox potential alkalinity organic and inorganic ligand concentrations van hullebusch et al 2002 some studies have shown that copper rapidly transforms from dissolved to granular after addition e g 2h 80 transformation haughey et al 2000 van hullebusch et al 2003 which facilitates copper transfer from water column to sediment but also makes the addition of cuso4 must be repeated to ensure effective algicidal effect le jeune et al 2006 song and wang 2015 for example song et al 2015 added 2mg l 1 cuso4 into a lake for 4 times and the detected concentration was only 6 02 0 20 μg l 1 after 20 days due to the complexing sorption with organic inorganic compounds the exchange and accumulation between water body and sediment etc in this study it was suggested that take measures in late lag phase was beneficial to avoid cyanobacterial blooms for actual blooms control cuso4 is generally carried out in small and medium lakes reservoirs by sprinkling crystal particles or high concentration solutions there are abundant engineering application cases for references however due to the ideal conditions in lab scale and the subjectivity of cuso4 concentration sets the effective concentration 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 only can be used as reference in practice the concentration is likely to change as a result of the influence of natural organic matter and other physical and chemical parameters of actual water therefore this study can provide a more environmentally friendly strategy of blooms control to greatly reduce the amount of chemicals in practice suitable dosing mode and dosage of algicide can be determined by simple field experiment when the condition is permitted of course the application of cuso4 still need be cautious as it can adversely affect non target organisms such as bacteria phytoplankton zooplankton etc jančula and maršálek 2011 the sensitivity of algae to copper often depends on species differences for example m aeruginosa cyanobacteria is more sensitive than pseudokirchneriella subcapitata green algae m aeruginosa m wesenbergii m flos aquae and m viridis belonging to microcystis and the ec50 were 0 16 0 09 0 49 and 0 45 mg l 1 respectively tsai 2015 wu et al 2017 some studies have shown that cyanobacteria are the most sensitive phytoplankton to copper le jeune et al 2006 gregor et al 2008 however frequent repeated dosing resulted in increased resistance jančula and maršálek 2011 considering the irreplaceability of cuso4 in short term dosing in late lag phase can significantly reduce the dosage when it was used in blooms making it a good choice this study revealed that the delay stage was the most important time point to control cyanobacterial blooms but how we can certify this point of blooms was quite important in practice continuous monitoring of chlorophyll in bloom prone periods is certainly helpful in finding sudden cyanobacterial growth in addition when cyanobacteria enter late lag phase the do difference between adjacent time intervals during a day will significantly increase due to their increasing photosynthesis activities in our ongoing study δdo the average of the absolute do difference value between all adjacent time intervals in a day reached approximately 400 fig s4 and table s5 hence do variation can also provide an early warning of blooms however considering the specific situation of different countries and regions the difficulty of this warning method is related to the availability of automatic monitoring equipment this is an optional approach but its application may need more practical validation in summary this study proposed more environmentally friendly and effective cuso4 treatments to control cyanobacterial blooms at delay stage enlightening the protection of water sources severely affected by cyanobacterial blooms with a new reference 4 conclusions this study observed a better control of cyanobacteria with cuso4 exposure at delay stage than at development stage of a bloom due to its higher sensitivity at both the population and individual levels the main conclusions were as follows 1 m aeruginosa in late lag phase had higher vigorous metabolic activity than in exponential phase including the ratio of dividing cells fv fm and intracellular toc 2 m aeruginosa in late lag phase could be more effective at inactivation since their chlorophyll a fv fm and membrane integrity decreased more seriously with equal dosages of cuso4 exposure 3 the low cell density of m aeruginosa in late lag phase was partially responsible for the lower resistance to cu2 exposure 4 cell sensitivity in late lag phase at individual level exacerbated the damage caused of cu2 exposure 5 the risk of microcystin to drinking water was lower in late lag phase than in exponential phase as the total and released microcystin was much lower due to down regulation of the microcystin synthesis gene mcya under cu2 exposure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16203,cyanobacterial blooms are always treated in exponential phase which demands high dosages of algicides e g cuso4 actually cyanobacterial blooms in late lag phase exhibit low cell density and specific physiological biochemical characteristics implying the possibility of controlling blooms in a more efficient and economical way with cuso4 treatment if cyanobacterial cells in late lag phase can be treated in this study the outbreakof a microcystis bloom was simulated and microcystis samples in late lag and exponential phases were treated with cuso4 the results showed that m aeruginosa in late lag phase had a higher ratio of dividing cells fv fm and intracellular total organic carbon content toc than that in exponential phase indicating that its metabolic activity was vigorous m aeruginosa in late lag phase could more easily be blocked since a higher decrease in chlorophyll a fv fm and membrane integrity occurred under the same dosages of cuso4 exposure compared to m aeruginosa in exponential phase meanwhile microcystin release in late lag phase was less than that in exponential phase moreover higher sensitivity in late lag phase was confirmed at the individual level as the photosynthesis related genes psab and rbcl were more down regulated than those in exponential phase in general cyanobacteria in late lag phase exhibited higher sensitivity to cuso4 indicating that cuso4 treatments in late lag phase can achieve a higher control efficiency and fewer release of microcystin with low dosages algicide hence it is a more environmentally friendly strategy to control cyanobacterial blooms than the traditional strategy applied in exponential phase graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria blooms m aeruginosa late lag phase exponential phase cellular sensitivity 1 introduction frequent outbreaks of cyanobacteria blooms are a serious problem in aquatic environments and cause public health threats and environmental hazards visser et al 2016 paerl and paul 2012 paerl et al 2011 during cyanobacterial growth a variety of cyanotoxins are produced including microcystin anatoxin and saxitoxin which can damage human skin liver and nervous system merel et al 2013 fan et al 2013b grattan et al 2016 carmichael and boyer 2016 peacock et al 2018 in addition geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib can produce offensive airborne taste and odor t o materials which are resistant to natural degradation boiling and conventional water treatments watson et al 2016 xu et al 2019 during water treatment process cell lysis induces the release of algal organic matter aom behaving as the precursors of disinfection by products dbps and becoming a potential threat to human health tomlinson et al 2016 li et al 2012 coral et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 cuso4 is a common algicide for emergency treatment of cyanobacteria blooms and it has been widely used in europe australia and many other countries e g brazil india le jeune et al 2006 levy et al 2007 xu et al 2019 to date its ecological risk has been noted for example the typically applied cuso4 dosages is 25 1000 μg l 1 which is acutely and chronically ecotoxic to many aquatic species including fish raman and cook 1988 mcknight et al 1983 in addition cu2 induces the free radical species and impairs cellular membrane leading to cyanotoxins and aom leakage into surrounding waters qian et al 2010 wu et al 2007 however it was not denied that cuso4 has the advantages of high efficiency and can block cyanobacterial blooms to some degrees in a short time jiang et al 2020 hence a scenario for proper application of cuso4 to achieve efficient control of cyanobacterial expansion is still necessary generally the whole cyanobacterial blooms have four stages including delay development maintenance and decay some previous studies noted that the physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria in different stages can vary for example li et al 2020a 2020b 2021b 2021c found that cyanobacteria at development and maintenance stages had higher photosynthetic activity than those at decay stage but their oxidative resistance became lower with kmno4 oxidation and chlorination overall these studies provided a clue that control of cyanobacterial blooms should be accurately performed depending on bloom stage among the four stages delay and development stages play key roles in the formation of a severe cyanobacterial bloom however the majority of previous studies on cyanobacterial control have only focused on development stage exponential phase due to their fast growth rate vigorous metabolism and strong activity in this phase lab studies or the large amounts of cyanobacterial cells and obvious environmental damage field studies zhou et al 2013 iwinski et al 2016 fan et al 2013a most importantly before blooming cyanobacterial cells will go through a long period of slow growth in winter and early spring characterized as delay stage mainly due to the limitations of temperature and illumination paerl and paul 2012 liu et al 2011 ma et al 2013 at delay stage lag phase cyanobacterial cells spend a relatively long time adapting to the new medium environment conditions and thus their growth rate seems limited however silencing is only superficial and these cells in delay stage are preparing for a rapid biomass increase via dramatic material and energy synthesis daniel and kishony 2013 moreover although the respiration synthesis rate of microbial cells is close to that of exponential cells at development stage they are relatively sensitive to adverse environmental conditions zhou and wang 2008 these findings suggest the possibility of controlling blooms in a more efficient and economical way with cuso4 treatments if cyanobacterial cells in delay stage can be treated to date comparative studies on cuso4 to treat cyanobacteria in lag and exponential phases are quite limited microcystis aeruginosa is the most common species in cyanobacterial blooms hence in this study the cyanobacterial bloom fig s1 was simulated at lab scale and m aeruginosa cells in late lag and exponential phases were employed to conduct experiments the variation in chlorophyll a fv fm microcystin membrane integrity and the expression of three related genes psab rbcl and mcya of m aeruginosa in late lag and exponential phases in response to cuso4 exposure was investigated chlorophyll a is usually proportional to the cell density of cyanobacteria so it can reflect the biomass i e cell number or cell density here chen et al 2016 cao et al 2005 fv fm is the optimal maximal quantum yield of ps ⅱ which can also reflect the photosynthetic capacity of cyanobacteria li et al 2020b microcystin is a metabolite during the growth of cyanobacteria and is the key factor influencing human health membrane integrity can more intuitively reflect the degree of damage to cyanobacterial cells by algicides moreover gene expression experiments were designed to explore the effect of cuso4 on cyanobacteria at the genetic level the objectives of this study are to clarify the comparative responses of m aeruginosa exposed to different concentrations of cuso4 in late lag and exponential phases with the aim of determining whether m aeruginosa in late lag phase is more sensitive to cuso4 treatments in adverse environments and to propose more environmentally friendly and effective early prevention and control measures for cyanobacteria blooms at delay stage 2 materials and methods 2 1 cyanobacterial culture a toxic strain m aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was selected as the strain used in this study it was cultured and preserved in bg 11 medium hopebio china and placed in illumination incubator at 26 c ningbo prandt china the illumination intensity of the incubator was 3000 lx and the cycle time of light dark was 12 12 h 2 2 preparing of m aeruginosa samples in late lag and exponential phases and determination of their characteristics m aeruginosa cells in exponential phase were collected and then diluted to 1 0 1 104 cells ml 1 for inoculation to simulate the delay development stages of a bloom the inoculum cell density was determined to ensure that a long and distinct lag phase could be observed this inoculum was spiked into 2 l of bg 11 medium and cultured under the conditions mentioned above samples were collected during growth to observe cell division fv fm value total organic matter toc content of individual cells and dissolved oxygen do variation in the two phases subsequently growth curve was observed and thus m aeruginosa in late lag and exponential phases for subsequent experiments was collected according to culture time cell density and cell characteristics fig 1 after 5 7 days cell density of m aeruginosa reached to 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 characterized as m aeruginosa samples in late lag phase m aeruginosa samples in exponential phase were collected at 10 12 days and their cell density was 1 7 0 5 106 cells ml 1 2 3 cuso4 treatments for cuso4 treatments 100 ml of m aeruginosa cells was harvested in late lag and exponential phases and then divided into 250 ml conical flasks to define cuso4 dosages employed in subsequent experiments a series of cuso4 concentrations i e 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 mg l 1 were tested during treatments chlorophyll a was measured at 0 2 4 8 12 24 and 48 h since it has a good correlation with cyanobacterial number density and can indicate the effect of cuso4 on growth capacity chen et al 2016 cao et al 2005 according to the effects of cuso4 treatments on chlorophyll a cuso4 at 0 0 1 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 was selected for subsequent experiments including photosynthetic activity microcystin and membrane integrity fv fm was determined at 0 2 4 8 12 24 and 48 h microcystin and membrane integrity were individually determined at 0 2 24 and 48 h to clarify the different sensitivities of m aeruginosa in the two phases to cuso4 at individual level another group of cuso4 exposure tests was performed specifically the cultures in exponential phase were diluted to the same cell density with late lag phase these cells in exponential phase were centrifuged and the supernatant remained the centrifuged cells were resuspended in the supernatant at the required concentration of 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 in this way these cells in exponential phase were diluted in original liquid environment after that chlorophyll a fv fm and the relative expression of the three genes were measured after 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 exposure 2 4 determination of the biomass and physiological biochemical parameters 2 4 1 m aeruginosa observation and counting the cells were observed and counted using a microscope nikon japan at a magnification of 400 after m aeruginosa cells were collected 1 2 drops of lugo reagent were added to count the number of single cells divided cells and total cells through a blood counting chamber 2 4 2 toc content toc content of individual cells was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan cells were centrifuged and washed with ultrapure water 1 2 times and then transferred to 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes m aeruginosa cells were frozen at 80 c for 5 min and placed in a metal bath at 55 c for 5 min the treatments were repeated 5 times these treated cellular mixtures were passed through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and the filtrate was collected for measurements of toc content the toc content of individual cells was estimated via the eq 1 1 t o c c o n t e n t p g c m g l 1 v 1 m l v 2 m l d c e l l s m l 1 10 9 where c toc concentration measured using the toc analyzer v1 filtrate volume for

instructions these samples were placed in darkness for 10 mins before fv fm was determined 2 4 5 do and chlorophyll a do was measured using a multiparameter water quality analyzer hach usa the chlorophyll a content was measured directly using chlorophyll a fluorescence analyzer fluoroquik america 2 4 6 microcystin intracellular and extracellular microcystin were qualified by the beacon microcystin assay kit using a multimode reader bmg labtech germany before the samples were determined a standard curve was drawn according to the instructions provided by the kit fig s2 these samples were centrifuged firstly and the supernatant was taken for the measurements of extracellular microcystin ex mcs the centrifuged m aeruginosa cells were resuspended and lysed as mentioned in the toc determination for the measurement of intracellular extracellular in mcs the above supernatants and lysates were diluted according to the range of the standard curve finally the plate was read at 450 nm with a multimode reader and the concentrations of in mcs and ex mcs were calculated according to the standard curve 2 4 7 membrane integrity membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was determined using flow cytometry luminex america after staining with sytox green nucleic acid dye the dye can specifically bind to the nucleic acid of m aeruginosa with a damaged membrane and exhibit green fluorescence at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm in contrast the dye cannot penetrate the intact cell membrane and bind to nucleic acids making intact cells exhibit red fluorescence sytox green nucleic acid dye was added to the samples mixed and incubated in the dark for 10 min approximately 5000 algal cells were recorded by a flow cytometry and the ratio of cells with green fluorescence was calculated to quantify the loss of membrane integrity 2 4 8 rna extraction reverse transcription and qpcr analysis rt qpcr m aeruginosa samples were collected and centrifuged at 8000 g at 4 c for 3 min and then washed with pbs twice after that they were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until rna extraction m aeruginosa cells were frozen and ground to powder in liquid nitrogen and a spin column plant total rna purification kit sangon biotech was used for total rna extraction li et al 2019 cdna was synthesized immediately after extraction by reverse transcription using transscript one

in triplicate and error bars in the plots represent the standard deviation sd all data were statistically analyzed using student s t test by ibm spss statistics 20 0 and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of m aeruginosa in two phases characteristics of m aeruginosa including cell density ratio of dividing cells photosynthetic activity and toc content were monitored after incubation figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 cell density increased continuously and reached to 1 7 0 5 105 cells ml 1 in late lag phase after 5 7 days of inoculation then cyanobacterial growth experienced an evident break point and entered into exponential phase in addition the ratio of dividing cells was monitored throughout these growth phases fig 2a which fluctuated between 33 3 and 42 9 in late lag phase and decreased to 5 7 in exponential phase similar to the ratio of dividing cells the photosynthetic activity and toc content of m aeruginosa were also significantly higher in late lag phase fv fm 0 46 0 5 toc 0 50 pg cell 1 than in exponential phase fv fm 0 25 0 33 toc 0 10 0 19 pg cell 1 fig 2b and c p 0 01 table s4 cell density in late lag phase was much lower than that in exponential phase but these cells in the former phase had a higher toc content photosynthetic activity and ratio of dividing cells indicating that their metabolic activity was vigorous it was necessary to ask the following questions do these cells have a higher sensitivity as mentioned in the introduction section if so could they be removed more easily by cuso4 treatment 3 2 cell inactivation of m aeruginosa in two phases after dosing with different concentrations of cuso4 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 0 mg l 1 chlorophyll a of m aeruginosa in late lag phase and exponential phases was measured to characterize cyanobacterial biomass fig 3 a and b when these samples were exposed to 0 05 mg l 1 cuso4 the growth of m aeruginosa in both phases was not affected fig 3 chlorophyll a continued to increase over time and the growth trend was consistent with the control group however m aeruginosa in the two phases exhibited very different responses to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 for m aeruginosa in late lag phase cyanobacterial growth was inhibited and chlorophyll a level was 0 25 μg l 1 at 48 h with a decrease of 77 compared to 0 h for m aeruginosa in exponential phase chlorophyll a showed an increasing trend and reached 3 36 μg l 1 at 48 h which was 1 44 folds higher than that at 0 h when samples were exposed to 0 2 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 chlorophyll a in both phases was gradually reduced to about zero at 48 h and the inhibition was even more significant with higher exposure dosage fig 3a and b it was also shown that normalized chlorophyll a decreased more in late lag phase than in the exponential phase when exposed to the same concentration of cuso4 fig 3c and d these findings suggested that cuso4 at 0 1 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 could be selected for photosynthetic activity tests fv fm of m aeruginosa in late lag phase significantly declined when the cells were exposed to three concentrations of cuso4 for a 48 h period p 0 01 table s4 fig 4 specifically fv fm increased slightly in the first 2 h under the effect of 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 and then it decreased gradually to 0 08 which is 19 of 0 h after 48 h table 1 after exposure to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 fv fm decreased significantly to 0 13 and 0 04 approximately 30 and 11 of 0 h in 2 h p 0 01 table s4 and then it became zero indicating that photosynthetic activity totally disappeared during 2 48 h fig 4a for m aeruginosa in exponential phase 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 exhibited no inhibition but instead of a slight promotion and fv fm was 0 38 at 48 h which was 1 25 folds than that at 0 h in addition fv fm could still be detected at 8 h under 0 4 mg l 1 cuso4 treatment while it could not be detected at 12 48 h with cuso4 at 1 0 mg l 1 fv fm could not be detected after 4 h fig 4b it is clear that cu2 can kill or inhibit the activity of cyanobacterial cells cu2 can destroy the structure of chlorophyll by entering cells and then it can competitively replace mg2 in the active site of chlorophyll molecules francis and thomas 1977 chillappagari et al 2009 waldron and robinson 2009 jančula and maršálek 2011 chlorophyll is the core pigment of illumination absorption in photosynthesis and thus chlorophyll destruction will severely weaken photosynthetic activity qian et al 2010 jančula and maršálek 2011 liu and blankenship 2019 in this section these results showed that m aeruginosa in both phases was inactivated by cuso4 with increasing dosages however m aeruginosa in late lag phase presented obviously higher sensitivity than that in exponential phase including biomass and photosynthetic activity fv fm indicated photosynthetic activity that was independent of cell density but chlorophyll a was evidently a variable dependent on biomass it is well known that the biomass in these two phases is much different and some studies agreed that algal inactivation by algicides is density dependent moreno garrido et al 2000 franklin et al 2002 de schamphelaere et al 2005 li et al 2021b for example li et al 2021b pointed out that higher cell density at maintenance stage led to lower oxidant exposure in each m aeruginosa cell therefore the lower cell density in late lag phase than in exponential phase may have led to this observation when cells are exposed to cuso4 at the same concentration the amount of cu2 absorbed in a single cell in late lag phase may be greater than that in exponential phase and thus it causes more serious damage to m aeruginosa in this phase in other words these results could not provide enough evidence that m aeruginosa in late lag phase was more sensitive to cuso4 further evidence was necessary to discriminate the sensitivity of m aeruginosa at two phases at the individual level 3 3 higher sensitivity of m aeruginosa in late lag phase at the individual level to address this question m aeruginosa in the two phases was adjusted to the same cell density and then it was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 these results can be seen in figs 5 and 6 in fact the trends were similar to those in figs 3 and 4 after exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 chlorophyll a of the late lag phase showed an increasing trend at the beginning hours and then decreased slowly to approximately 23 of the initial level however in exponential phase chlorophyll a presented an increasing inhibited regrowing trend and then it was restored to the starting level fig 5a the fv fm values of late lag phase and exponential phase with the same cell density after exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 were also measured fig 5b similar to the chlorophyll a results 0 1 mg l 1cuso4 significantly inhibited photosynthetic activity in the late lag phase p 0 01 table s4 and fv fm decreased to 0 1 after 24 h fig 5b however there was no inhibitory effect on photosynthetic activity in exponential phase and its fv fm was 0 36 after 24 h genes associated with photosynthesis psab and rbcl also differed in gene expression when m aeruginosa in the two phases was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 fig 6a and b the gene expression of psab and rbcl was down regulated at 2 h and 12 h when exposed to cuso4 for both phases but down regulated percentages were higher for late lag phase than for exponential phase for example the psab gene was down regulated 0 51 and 0 98 folds at 12 h in two phases respectively photosynthesis is the main energy metabolism pathway of cyanobacteria and the expression of related genes in this process is of great significance the psab and rbcl genes encode key proteins involved in ps ӏ and carbon assimilation respectively shao et al 2009 photosynthesis related genes down regulated under stress were consistent with previous studies for example qian et al 2010 found that psab rbcl and psbd1 genes of m aeruginosa were down regulated to varying degrees under cuso4 exposure the higher the exposure concentration was the more down regulated qian et al 2010 lu et al 2014 in this study the down regulated levels of psab and rbcl were greater in late lag phase than in exponential phase indicating a greater inhibition of the photosynthesis process correspondingly strong inhibition of photosynthetic activity in this phase also supported this finding fig 5b when m aeruginosa in two phases with the same cell density was exposed to cuso4 the possible influence of cell density on cuso4 was eliminated whereas different sensitivities of the two phases at the individual level were enlightened in other words exposure to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 was more effective inactivating m aeruginosa in late lag phase than in exponential phase figs 5 and 6 it was determined that m aeruginosa in late lag phase did have a higher sensitivity at the individual level in late lag phase cyanobacterial cells have completed adaptation to new medium or the natural environment with the aim to prepare their bloom proliferation bacteria in late lag phase are known to have high metabolic activity large cytoplasmic rna content high respiratory rate nucleic acid protein synthesis rate and high sensitivity to environmental conditions zhou and wang 2008 which is commonly taught in textbooks m aeruginosa belongs to gram negative bacteria springstein et al 2020 and thus it has similar cellular characteristics which were also found in this study including higher intracellular toc content photosynthetic activity and the ratio of dividing cells in late lag phase fig 2 more importantly cyanobacteria in this phase had higher sensitivity which was beneficial to its control iron is an essential mineral for bacterial growth salmonella gram negative bacteria accumulates iron and calcium plasma during the late lag phase for subsequent growth rolfe et al 2012 however this process may stimulate the fenton reaction in cells making them more sensitive to oxidative stress and more vulnerable to damage touati 2000 cellular sensitivity has been observed in cyanobacteria or bacteria in their late lag phase however the underlying causes were speculative and need further exploration in the future for example the transport and binding of copper in cyanobacterial cells affect the bioavailability of copper li et al 2021a which may lead to differences in sensitivity to investigate the genes regulation related to copper transport and binding such as two p type atpases ctaa and pacs burkhead et al 2009 in future studies is necessary to explain the high sensitivity of cyanobacterial cells in late lag phase 3 4 much lower release of microcystin in late lag phase the release of intracellular materials microcystin was also determined during cuso4 exposure as shown in fig 7 the content of in mcs in both phases decreased when exposed to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 when the samples were exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 for 48 h the content of in mcs in exponential phase was 1 19 folds at 0 h however in late lag phase in mcs decreased to 1 65 μg l 1 at 48 h and only 31 at 0 h the ex mcs contents in exponential phase after exposure to cuso4 increased rapidly over time after exposure to three concentrations of cuso4 for 48 h the contents were 2 49 2 73 and 2 74 times those of the original contents respectively in late lag phase ex mcs content increased with a much slower trend during 0 24 h but a slight decrease occurred during 24 48 h in addition in ex mcs in late lag phase were dramatically lower than those in exponential phase approximately one order of magnitude membrane integrity was also observed after cuso4 exposure fig 8 before being exposed to cuso4 m aeruginosa cells in both phases showed a small amount of green fluorescence after staining after exposure to 0 4 and 1 0 mg l 1 cuso4 cells in both phases were damaged to a greater extent in late lag phase membrane damage reached 98 at 2 h which showed no significant difference from that at 48 h p 0 05 table s4 fig 8a in exponential phase it reached 76 16 81 16 at 2 h and then increased up to 91 49 95 93 at 48 h when exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 membrane damage in late lag phase ranged from 57 to 76 during the following hours however membrane damage in exponential phase was only 25 64 at 2 h and then decreased to less than 10 at 24 h and 48 h fig 8b cu2 not only affects chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis processes but also produce reactive oxygen species ros destroying cell membrane integrity qian et al 2010 wu et al 2007 furthermore cu2 can bind to noncopper proteins to cause protein denaturation and disorder normal physiological activities stevenson et al 2013 stauber and florence 1987 gledhill et al 1997 therefore the decrease in cellular membrane integrity after cuso4 exposure observed in this study resulted in changes in in mcs and ex mcs i e in mcs were released and then ex mcs increased due to damaged membrane integrity figs 7 and 8 because of the higher sensitivity in late lag phase than that in exponential phase more severe membrane integrity damage was observed in cyanobacterial cells in this phase suggesting that more intracellular materials would be released into the environment from an individual cell however the concentration of the released microcystin in late lag phase was still much lower than that in exponential phase which was mainly due to their low cell density notably ex mcs decreased by approximately 0 5 0 6 μg l 1after cuso4 exposure for 24 48 h in late lag phase fig 7b similar and opposite phenomena were observed in previous studies tsai 2015 found an increased decreased trend of microcystin when m aeruginosa was exposed to cuso4 and copper ethanolamine zhou et al 2018 found that there was no degradation when microcystin was directly exposed to cuso4 but microcystin decreased by approximately 80 when ascorbic acid was present in the system since active species oh was produced in actual water the presence of microcystin might not persist as related studies have shown that the half life period of microcystin in an actual pond was approximately 1 1 9 d kinley et al 2018 this study observed that total and extracellular microcystin were present at lower concentrations in late lag phase than in exponential phase therefore the risk of microcystin in late lag phase was much lower than that in exponential phase after cuso4 treatments on the other hand the biological synthesis of microcystin in two phases can further support the above conclusion when m aeruginosa in two phases was exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 the gene expression of mcya in two phases was measured the expression of mcya in exponential phase was significantly up regulated at 2 and 12 h p 0 01 table s4 fig 6c indicating that cuso4 promoted the synthesis of microcystin which may be a stress response of m aeruginosa or the so called hormesis effect gan et al 2012 yu et al 2021 other studies also showed that the application of benzalkonium chlorides uv b polystyrene plastics and h2o2 on m aeruginosa in exponential phase induced mcya mcyb mcyd and mcyh encoding microcystin synthesis and transport up regulated qian et al 2022 cordeiro araujo et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 ross et al 2006 in fact the synthesis and release of cyanotoxin is a survival strategy of toxic cyanobacteria and it was helpful to compete with other aquatic organisms against grazing by predators and act as signaling molecules hu and rzymski 2019 in this study the inactivation effect of 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 on m aeruginosa was limited and caused the stress response for exponential phase however the concentration of cuso4 was sufficiently to inactive cyanobacteria in late lag phase since its growth and activity were effectively inhibited moreover the expression of mcya was down regulated in this phase which was consistent with the decrease in total microcystin content fig 7a and b indicating that microcystin synthesis was also inhibited cyanobacterial biomass is usually high during blooms leading to the stress response of cyanobacteria and increasing the risk of cyanotoxin synthesis release if the dosages of algicides are not high enough which is detrimental to the safety of drinking water 3 5 environmental implications current studies mostly focused on the control of cyanobacterial blooms at development stage during this period the cell density of cyanobacteria is high and scum can be formed on the water surface posing a substantial threat to water safety high dosage algicides will cause the release of cyanotoxins and aom posing a high threaten to the safety of drinking water and human health this study proposes a new idea to achieve high efficiency and safe control with low dosage algicides for cyanobacteria at delay stage attributed to the characteristics of higher sensitivity and lower cell density in late lag phase of m aeruginosa than at development stage compared with the simple components of bg 11 medium the toxicity and bioavailability of cuso4 in actual water may be affected by ph redox potential alkalinity organic and inorganic ligand concentrations van hullebusch et al 2002 some studies have shown that copper rapidly transforms from dissolved to granular after addition e g 2h 80 transformation haughey et al 2000 van hullebusch et al 2003 which facilitates copper transfer from water column to sediment but also makes the addition of cuso4 must be repeated to ensure effective algicidal effect le jeune et al 2006 song and wang 2015 for example song et al 2015 added 2mg l 1 cuso4 into a lake for 4 times and the detected concentration was only 6 02 0 20 μg l 1 after 20 days due to the complexing sorption with organic inorganic compounds the exchange and accumulation between water body and sediment etc in this study it was suggested that take measures in late lag phase was beneficial to avoid cyanobacterial blooms for actual blooms control cuso4 is generally carried out in small and medium lakes reservoirs by sprinkling crystal particles or high concentration solutions there are abundant engineering application cases for references however due to the ideal conditions in lab scale and the subjectivity of cuso4 concentration sets the effective concentration 0 1 mg l 1 cuso4 only can be used as reference in practice the concentration is likely to change as a result of the influence of natural organic matter and other physical and chemical parameters of actual water therefore this study can provide a more environmentally friendly strategy of blooms control to greatly reduce the amount of chemicals in practice suitable dosing mode and dosage of algicide can be determined by simple field experiment when the condition is permitted of course the application of cuso4 still need be cautious as it can adversely affect non target organisms such as bacteria phytoplankton zooplankton etc jančula and maršálek 2011 the sensitivity of algae to copper often depends on species differences for example m aeruginosa cyanobacteria is more sensitive than pseudokirchneriella subcapitata green algae m aeruginosa m wesenbergii m flos aquae and m viridis belonging to microcystis and the ec50 were 0 16 0 09 0 49 and 0 45 mg l 1 respectively tsai 2015 wu et al 2017 some studies have shown that cyanobacteria are the most sensitive phytoplankton to copper le jeune et al 2006 gregor et al 2008 however frequent repeated dosing resulted in increased resistance jančula and maršálek 2011 considering the irreplaceability of cuso4 in short term dosing in late lag phase can significantly reduce the dosage when it was used in blooms making it a good choice this study revealed that the delay stage was the most important time point to control cyanobacterial blooms but how we can certify this point of blooms was quite important in practice continuous monitoring of chlorophyll in bloom prone periods is certainly helpful in finding sudden cyanobacterial growth in addition when cyanobacteria enter late lag phase the do difference between adjacent time intervals during a day will significantly increase due to their increasing photosynthesis activities in our ongoing study δdo the average of the absolute do difference value between all adjacent time intervals in a day reached approximately 400 fig s4 and table s5 hence do variation can also provide an early warning of blooms however considering the specific situation of different countries and regions the difficulty of this warning method is related to the availability of automatic monitoring equipment this is an optional approach but its application may need more practical validation in summary this study proposed more environmentally friendly and effective cuso4 treatments to control cyanobacterial blooms at delay stage enlightening the protection of water sources severely affected by cyanobacterial blooms with a new reference 4 conclusions this study observed a better control of cyanobacteria with cuso4 exposure at delay stage than at development stage of a bloom due to its higher sensitivity at both the population and individual levels the main conclusions were as follows 1 m aeruginosa in late lag phase had higher vigorous metabolic activity than in exponential phase including the ratio of dividing cells fv fm and intracellular toc 2 m aeruginosa in late lag phase could be more effective at inactivation since their chlorophyll a fv fm and membrane integrity decreased more seriously with equal dosages of cuso4 exposure 3 the low cell density of m aeruginosa in late lag phase was partially responsible for the lower resistance to cu2 exposure 4 cell sensitivity in late lag phase at individual level exacerbated the damage caused of cu2 exposure 5 the risk of microcystin to drinking water was lower in late lag phase than in exponential phase as the total and released microcystin was much lower due to down regulation of the microcystin synthesis gene mcya under cu2 exposure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16204,the long term decline in dissolved oxygen do levels in freshwater systems including rivers and lakes has become a worldwide concern which can threaten biodiversity nutrient biogeochemistry water quality and ultimately human health herein we report a sustainable restoration strategy for anoxic freshwater using local sediment based biochar as novel oxygen nanobubble carriers column incubation experiments were conducted with water and sediment samples from an urban tributary of the yangtze river the oxygen carrying sediment based biochar o sbc showed long lasting re oxygenation performance for anoxic river waters during 28 day period in which do was rapidly elevated from 0 14 to 7 87 mg l and gradually maintained at 4 78 mg l until the end o sbc with multiple functions switched the sediments from a source to a sink of nutrients and its release of oxygen nanobubbles contributed further decrements of 66 3 nh4 n and 142 9 po4 3 p except for physical blocking and physicochemical adsorption notably a comprehensive focus on restoration mechanism was explored in view of microbial community response the re oxygenation was followed by a 5 05 increase of bacterial diversity shannon index in water but a 2 40 decrease in sediments a proliferation of some specific aerobic populations was observed of which the nitrifying nitrospira abundances were 10 fold higher in the water from o sbc than the control additionally functional genes involved in nitrous oxide reduction polyphosphate synthesis degradation and thiosulfate oxidation were also enriched taken together our findings can not only expand the promising candidates for oxygen nanobubble carriers based on sediment recycling but also highlight the microbial molecular mechanisms for anoxic freshwater restoration based on nutrient cycle regulation graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anoxic freshwater restoration sediment based biochar oxygen nanobubbles nutrient cycle regulation 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is fundamental to biological processes in aquatic systems and its decline can induce major changes in productivity biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles breitburg et al 2018 unfortunately the long term decline of do levels has been observed not only in the ocean fennel and testa 2019 but also in the freshwater which is 2 75 to 9 30 times greater jane et al 2021 also do levels have been frequently reported to not meet environmental quality standards for surface water even in some important rivers in china including the yangtze and pearl river cnemc 2020a b the oxygen depletion as a major threat to freshwater has been first attributed to excessive nutrient availability and thus eutrophication along with harmful algal blooms jenny et al 2016 this could increase both the mortality of aquatic organisms and the overflow of accumulated nutrients from sediments into water thereby aggravating endogenous pollution wetzel 2001 once water becomes anoxic a return to higher oxygen levels will be hindered by natural biogeochemical feedbacks bush et al 2017 hence artificial interventions for anoxia average do 0 5 mg l remediation are imperatively required to achieve nutrient cycle regulation and ecological restoration jane et al 2021 conventionally artificial mixing and mechanical aeration have been widely used to increase do levels in freshwater harris et al 2015 ma et al 2015 but with inherent limitations in energy efficiency infrastructure investments and device maintenance more worrying is that the resuspended sediments may intensify endogenous pollution liu et al 2019 chemical addition using oxygen releasing compounds has also been employed to improve do levels such as h2o2 cao2 and mgo2 cao et al 2020 li et al 2020b however either rapid consumption of chemical reagents or significant increase of local ph is not expected for sustainable anoxia restoration gholami et al 2019 there is therefore an urgent and challenging task to explore high efficient cost effective easy operation and eco friendly alternatives for do manipulation in anoxic freshwater of particular interest is the use of green oxygen carrying materials which possess multi porous structures for delivering oxygen nanobubbles onb to the target anoxic areas specifically porous clay minerals including volcanic stones zeolites and their modifications were selected as oxygen carriers and successfully utilized to increase do levels reduce nutrient loading mitigate ch4 emission and methylmercury production ji et al 2020 liu et al 2019 shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 notably instead of the apparent improvement in water quality a permanent restoration of anoxic areas is considered to depend on the underlying response of in situ microbial communities which play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic systems broman et al 2017b forth et al 2015 although several studies have confirmed that oxygen carrying materials are effective for anoxic water restoration detalis on the microbial mechanisms including both community structural and metabolic dynamics through treatment remain largely unexplored as a result the development in this emerging field is at an early stage and calls for more research considering that the carriers of onb are essential and important in the anoxia restoration process in addition to clay minerals more carrier types with features of proper porosity earth abundance easy availability and green nature are needed to be explored herein a novel onb carrier namely sediment based biochar sbc was developed with great potential to achieve sustainable restoration of anoxic freshwater through coupling of physical blocking physicochemical adsorption and onb release specially biochar here was prepared from local polluted freshwater sediments which possess high carbon content up to 67 6 wt as well as high nutrient content sui et al 2021 a large quantity of contaminanted sediments are produced from dredging activities annually worldwide such as 150 million m3 in the usa and 200 million m3 in europe posing serious treatment and disposal problems that how to manage them as natural resources rather than as wastes bates et al 2015 mattei et al 2017 sbc production can be an alternative to landfill disposal for treating dredged sediments thus reducing land occupation and avoiding secondary pollution hossain et al 2020 also it is taken from solid wastes of polluted freshwater systems and used for pollution remediation of the same systems consistently in line with the concept of environmental compatibility and sustainable development to our best knowledge this is the first attempt to investigate how oxygen carrying sediment based biochar o sbc regulates nutrient concentrations with insights on microbial community response specifically ours aims were to 1 check the apparent performance of sbc as oxygen carrying materials 2 explore the joint effects of sbc and onb on nutrient reduction and 3 elucidate the underlying mechanisms of nutrient cycle regulation during anoxia restoration in view of microbial community structure and metabolic profiles the research here sought to provide a novel approach for anoxic freshwater restoration and shed new light on the microbial mechanism under o sbc treatment which can provide useful information for applying oxygen carrying materials in sustainable anoxia remediation practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication and characterization of sbc surface river sediments were sampled in an urban tributary of the yangtze river namely qinhuai river 32 06 n 118 75 e nanjing jiangsu province china at a depth of 0 10 cm a portion of the sediment samples was dried at 20 c to prepare sbc the dried sediment samples were placed into a high temperature furnace under nitrogen gas n2 and heated to a set temperature 400 600 800 1000 c at a heating rate of 8 c min followed by a holding stage for 4 h at the set temperature the carbon products obtained by pyrolysis in the furnace were ground to 1 3 mm particles samples were denoted as sbcx where x equals the pyrolysis temperatures of individual samples the surface morphologies of the obtained biochar were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma 300 carl zeiss the brunauer emmett teller bet asap 2460 micromeritics method was employed to determine the specific surface area pore volumes and pore size distribution of the sbc samples from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the major components of the materials were further determined by fourier transform infrared ftir thermo scientific nicolet is5 thermo fisher scientific and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha thermo fisher scientific 2 2 preparation of o sbc the sbc samples with different pyrolysis temperatures were used as oxygen carrying materials and the common commercially available zeolites ø 1 3 mm were selected as reference materials these materials were washed with ultrapure water and then dried at 90 c and then placed in a pressure resistant airtight container to load oxygen the detailed preparation procedures are shown in supplementary information 2 3 measurements of oxygen carrying capacities the oxygen carrying capacities of the porous materials were determined by the o2 adsorption isotherms using h sorb 2600 high pressure volumetric adsorption analyzer gold app instrument corporation china micromeritics asap 2460 and autochem 2920 micromeritics usa the oxygen amounts adsorbed by the materials were recorded under a dynamic relative pressure ranging from 0 0 to 0 2 mpa at 77 k 2 4 incubation procedures 2 4 1 determination of oxygenation performance sediment and water samples were collected from the same location at a depth of 0 50 cm and transported to the laboratory under dark conditions in the initial incubation experiment both the sediments and water were respectively homogenized and filled into 12 plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 10 cm and height of 100 cm fig s1 the cylinders were then divided into six groups the two cylinders containing only water and sediments were used as the control and the sediments in the remaining cylinders were capped with sbc400 sbc600 sbc800 sbc1000 and zeolite respectively with a dose of 50 g and a height of 1 cm each group had two identical microcosms the most effective oxygen carrying material was determined by do dynamics in the overlying water following the 10 day experiment 2 4 2 evaluation of water quality the long term effects of the most effective oxygen carrying material i e sbc600 on oxygen modulation and nutrient reduction were then assessed six plexiglass cylinders filled with the same amounts of sediments and water as the first experiment were divided into three groups namely control sbc600 and o sbc600 the experiment lasted for 28 days to simulate the long term dynamic changes of the river water sediment system environmental parameters including do and redox potential orp in water high resolution profiles of oxygen and orp around the swi total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p and sulfate so4 2 within the water phase and sediments were determined at intervals the nutrient fluxes were calculated based on the mass balance method zhang et al 2021 more details about the methods for nutrient concentration determination and flux calculation are provided in supplementary information 2 5 microbiological investigations 2 5 1 sampling dna extraction and high throughput sequencing once the experiment was finished approximately 0 5 g of sediments top 5 cm layer and 1000 ml of water 5 cm above the sediment surface were collected in each cylinder for microbial analysis samples from the same group were mixed separately to reduce sample heterogeneity water samples were filtrated through a 0 45 μm pore size nylon filter via a vacuum pump vp 10 l joanlab china all filters and sediment samples were stored at 80 c prior to analysis dna from each sample was extracted using a ezna kit omega bio tek inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis illumina hiseq sequencing was conducted at shanghai biozeron biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china the v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were targeted by 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 primers the raw sequencing data is available through ncbi sequence read archive database under the accession number prjna767484 2 5 2 bioinformatic analysis the amplicon sequencing results were analyzed using qiime 2 bolyen et al 2019 details of the analysis including read quality checking paired end reads truncating operational taxonomic unit otu picking alpha diversity analysis etc can be found in previous research from our group lu et al 2021 the functional properties of the bacterial communities were predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust v1 1 4 langille et al 2013 following the procedure detailed in li et al 2020a bacterial metagenome content predictions were performed by importing the generated feature table based on normalized 16s rrna gene sequences to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg the metabolic function prediction was achieved by referencing the kegg orthology ko database and nearest sequenced taxon index nsti value was determined to estimate the accuracy of prediction results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of environmentally compatible biochar the morphologies and pore structures of environmentally compatible biochar were evaluated using sem fig 1 a sbc pyrolyzed at low temperatures presented loose and layered structures while the lamellar structure exhibited collapse with the temperature exceeding 800 c each biochar sample exhibited a type iv n2 adsorption desorption isotherm fig 1b indicating the production of mesoporous structures a common feature in adsorbent materials and the type h4 hysteresis loops observed in the isotherms are associated with the formation of narrow slit like pores which is typical for activated carbon type solids moreover the bjh pore size distribution of sbc depicted in fig 1c demonstrates prevalent distribution of mesopores 2 20 nm especially for sbc600 as expected the obtained sbc possessed high surface area porosity and well developed mesoporous structure table 1 which may facilitate the uptake and release of onb liu et al 2019 in ftir spectra the surface functional groups of sbc under different pyrolysis temperature have been found to be changed fig 1d specifically the broad adsorption band at approximately 1036 cm 1 decreased with the elevated treated temperature which may be attributed to the thermolability of carboxylate cooh groups the decreasing trend is also observed for the peaks at around 800 500 cm 1 which is associated with ch wagging vibrations indicating a reduced stability and cyclization of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds sui et al 2021 in the xps spectra it was noted that several metal atoms were observed to be embedded in the biochar which may have a beneficial effect on the adsorption capacities fig 1e the gradual increase of sp2 hybridized carbon with temperature reveals an enhancement in the carbonization degree while the gradual decrease in the peak intensity of o1s from sbc400 to sbc800 may be ascribed to the fracturing of relevant weak bonds within the carbon structure fig 1g as expected the ftir and xps spectra of sbc are consistent with those previously reported carbon materials obtained from sediments and sludge wang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2018 also claiming that the eco friendly biochar was successfully prepared 3 2 oxygenation performance of oxygen carrying materials 3 2 1 oxygen carrying capacities the oxygen adsorption curves displayed in fig 2 a clearly exhibited a constant increase in the oxygen adsorbing capacity with pressure for each material sample a significantly higher adsorption capacity was observed for the environmentally compatible biochar compared to that of natural zeolite more specifically the oxygen uptake amount under 0 2 mpa was maximized with sbc800 2 66 cm3 o2 g followed by sbc600 2 51 cm3 o2 g sbc400 1 96 cm3 o2 g sbc1000 1 32 cm3 o2 g and natural zeolite 0 21 cm3 o2 g note that sbc600 and sbc800 appear to have the greatest potential to serve as oxygen carrying materials due to their high adsorption capacities whereas their actual oxygenation performances at the swi are considered for comprehensive assessment later with more details in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 real time do dynamics do concentrations in overlying water during the 10 day experiment were plotted in fig 3 b in the control groups the do levels remained at approximately 0 00 0 12 mg l throughout the incubation sbc400 sbc1000 and natural zeolite were observed to improve the oxygen level maximum to 4 67 4 65 and 3 81 mg l respectively while the do showed a dramatic decline and eventually fell below 2 mg l in contrast to the oxygen carrying capacity test results sbc600 with onb was observed to perform better in the overlying water compared to sbc800 although the latter drastically increased do to 7 51 mg l this was followed by a rapid reduction with a final concentration reaching approximately 3 50 mg l at the end of the experiment however in the groups capped with oxygen carrying sbc600 the do within the water columns not only increased to the maximum level 8 06 mg l among treatment groups but was also maintained at around 6 26 mg l since day 10 this indicates sbc600 offers exciting opportunities in the slow release of carried oxygen nanobubbles to achieve sustainable oxygen modulation based on these results sbc600 has been chosen for the subsequent experiments to further verify its long term oxygenation performance and nutrient reduction effect 3 2 3 pore size distribution determines the oxygenation performance the improvement in oxygen levels at the end of the experiment fellow the order sbc600 sbc800 sbc400 zeolite sbc1000 which was quite distinct from the oxygen carrying capacity test results fig 2b oxygen uptake capabilities exhibited a strong positive correlation with surface area and pore volume of prepared porous materials but the difference in oxygenation performance may be attributed to the pore size distribution and in particular the existence of mesopores previous research demonstrates that porous materials possessing a predominance of mid sized mesopores 2 20 nm can facilitate the moderate release of onb for reasons that larger pores 20 nm can aid a fast oxygen transfer and smaller pores 2 nm can lock the oxygen liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 consequently sbc600 which possessed the highest surface area pore volume table 1 and the prevalence of mid sized mesopores fig 1c was able to carry large amounts of onb and deliver them slowly into the swi resulting in the persistent anoxia remediation unexpectedly despite its relatively small specific surface area and pore volume sbc800 demonstrated a perfect oxygen carrying capability a possible explanation is that heteroatom doping which favors the charge delocalization on c atoms can supply active oxygen adsorption sites and weaken the oo bonding connection gao et al 2015 it has also been indicated that oxygen molecules have affinities for specific adsorbents thereby affecting the oxygen carrying capacities and releasing rates the oxygen transfer efficiency mechanism via oxygen carrying materials to water column merits a detailed investigation and is reserved for future work nevertheless our findings expand the potential candidates of effective oxygen carrying materials and offer strategies for the preparation of them 3 3 variations of water quality parameters 3 3 1 long term do and orp levels at the swi do and orp levels in the overlying water from three different treatments of the 28 day experiment were illustrated in fig 3 as expected do and orp were maintained at around 0 05 mg l and 105 mv respectively fig 3a and b capping sediments with pure sbc600 slightly enhanced the oxygen and orp levels to 1 5 mg l and 50 mv respectively which may be attributed to the nutrient removal effect of biochar lu et al 2021 reducing the oxygen consumption conversely abrupt increases in do were observed in the groups capped with o sbc600 with a maximum level of 7 87 mg l although this was followed by a slow reduction to 4 78 mg l in 20 days for the depletion of carried oxygen the oxygen level subsequently remained stable until the end of the incubation a similar trend occurred in orp levels which instantly increased from 88 88 mv to 151 35 mv in the first 11 days followed by a reduction to 99 64 mv oxygenation of anaerobic surface sediments was further observed through do and orp profiles fig 3c and d do ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l in the aqueous phase 0 5 cm above the sediments of control groups throughout the 28 day incubation moreover the oxygen penetration depth was measured to drop off 1 2 cm compared to the initial value indicating significant oxygen consumption in the surface sediments when capping with sbc600 the penetration depth remained constant on day 28 compared to day 0 with a slight increment in the do level from 0 79 mg l to 1 92 mg l the groups capped with o sbc600 exhibited significantly higher do levels across the swi 6 50 mg l at day 28 accompanied by an oxygen penetration depth of 2 cm which was notably deeper than the initial depth our results demonstrate the ability of onb released from o sbc600 to effectively remediate the anaerobic zone around the swi with not only a substantially higher oxygen concentration in the overlying water but also a deeper oxygen supply into the surface sediments this is also consistent with the observations from the orp profile distribution across the sediments 3 3 2 nutrient parameters in water and sediments to reconfirm the nutrient reduction capability of oxygen carrying environmentally compatible biochar on the swi more chemical parameters within the water phase and sediments were measured figs 4 and s3 for the control groups ever rising concentrations of tn from 1 72 to 2 15 mg l nh4 n from 1 48 to 2 01 mg l tp from 0 21 to 0 31 mg l and po4 3 p from 0 11 to 0 14 mg l were observed in the overlying water which were likely to be linked to the longer periods of anoxia fig 4a and b as reduced species continue to diffuse out of the sediments and enter the water column gantzer et al 2009 this was also supported by the gradually decreasing content of nutrients from the control sediments indicating a certain degree of diffusion among them fig s3 both sbc600 and o sbc600 functioned to reduce tn and nh4 n concentrations in the water column among which the sbc600 capping reduced tn to 0 97 mg l and nh4 n to 0 89 mg l on day 28 and yielded a negative cumulative nh4 n flux 9 31 mg m2 d figs 4a b and s2a this may have been due to on the one hand the interfacial layer formed by the biochar could reduce the upward diffusion of the nutrient fluxes through the upper layer sediments and on the other hand owing to the flourishing hole structure of the biochar resulted in cation exchange dominating the adsorption of nutrients zhu et al 2019 in comparison tn and nh4 n concentrations in the o sbc600 treated groups reached 0 74 and 0 36 mg l respectively on day 28 we suspected that the aerobic conditions caused by onb could facilitate the nitrification reaction converting nh4 n to no3 n which was supported by the significant reduction in nh4 n 76 92 moreover the cumulative nh4 n flux through the swi was determined as 27 19 mg m2 d revealing the joint effects of porous materials and onb on combating nh4 n release from the sediments to the overlying water extremely lower concentrations of tp and po4 3 p in the overlying water were observed in the o sbc600 treatment groups 0 07 and 0 05 mg l respectively compared with those from the sbc600 groups 0 12 and 0 09 mg l respectively fig 4c and d the addition of sbc600 without onb effectively controlled the tp and po4 3 p flux maximums of 12 26 mg m2 d and 6 43 mg m2 d respectively in the first 10 days of the experiment fig s2c and d owing to the physical capping and adsorption functionalities of biochar as previously mentioned despite this the adsorption capabilities of sbc600 were not able to afford excessive p release under anoxic conditions over time tp and po4 3 p concentrations appeared to rebound to higher levels and the accumulated flux tended to or attained positive values in contrast there was only a slight bounce of tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the o sbc600 group and the values reached a plateau after 10 days of incubation concomitantly the cumulative fluxes of p exhibited negative values tp 26 60 to 3 70 mg m2 d po4 3 p 17 32 to 1 45 mg m2 d throughout the incubation period this may be linked to the precipitation of po4 3 p coupled to fe3 whereby the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 contributed to the generation of fe bound non soluble po4 3 during the continuous release of onb at the swi by o sbc600 the dynamics of toc in the overlying water were generally similar to those for n and p and follow the trend o sbc600 sbc600 control in particular the o sbc600 capping markedly decreased concentrations from 29 87 to 7 67 mg l 74 3 reduction implying the occurrence of the possible remineralization of organic matter under aerobic conditions in contrast so4 2 concentrations in the water column from the o sbc600 groups 238 28 mg l far exceeded those from the sbc600 107 94 mg l and control groups 39 76 mg l indicating the replacement of anaerobic sulfate reduction by oxygen reduction with the conversion of the anoxic to oxic state 3 3 3 o sbc combines multiple functions to give a more direct investigation into the respective contributions of the biochar capping treatments and onb delivery on endogenous pollution control we performed quantitative analysis using the cumulative nutrients fluxes fig 5 in the control systems the total release amounts of nh4 n fig 5a1 and po4 3 p fig 5b1 from sediments throughout the 28 day incubation were 5 23 mg and 0 35 mg these values are markedly higher than those of the other two groups the addition of sbc600 reduced the values to 5 28 mg nh4 n fig 5a2 and 0 37 mg po4 3 p fig 5b2 inverting the sediments from a nutrient source to a nutrient sink the results indicate that the sbc600 capping treatment could reduce the release of nh4 n and po4 3 p by 200 9 and 205 7 respectively moreover the total release amounts of nh4 n and po4 3 p were further limited in the o sbc600 with values of 8 75 mg fig 5a3 and 0 87 mg fig 5b3 respectively the onb delivery was determined to further reduce nh4 n and po4 3 p by 66 3 and 142 9 respectively after subtracting the efforts of capping alone compared with the control groups the o sbc materials with multiple functions have been found here to trigger various ecological reactions around the swi including the sustainable modulation of oxygen levels in the benthic water meanwhile improving the redox environment around the swi the suppression of reductive pollutants released from sediments thereby reducing nutrient concentrations in the water column and the acceleration of organic matter remineralization our results reveal sbc as an excellent candidate for oxygen carrying materials for the joint effects of the biochar s capacity to adsorb pollutants and the ability of the carried onb to restore reductive benthic habitat furthermore the prepared sbc taken from solid wastes in polluted freshwater systems are utilized to restore the same systems providing a promising strategy to achieve environmental compatibility and sustainable development in the following section more efforts have been underway to shed light on the mechanisms investigate the mechanisms between these multiple processes particularly in terms of microbial community response 3 4 changes in functional microbial communities 3 4 1 succession of microbial communities the bacterial composition and diversity were obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing the α diversity indexes of each group indicates significant variations among the control and treatments table s1 in the water phase indexes including chao 1 richness shannon and simpson were much lower in the control group than in the sbc600 and o sbc600 groups revealing a relatively lower abundance and diversity of species present before treatments in contrast the three indexes exhibited different trends for sediment samples possibly due to the selectivity for sediment microorganisms after sbc treatments the taxonomy classification levels and relative abundances were shown in fig 6 specifically proteobacteria bacteroidetes and elusimicrobia were the most abundant phyla fig 6a firmicutes exhibited a contrasting trend between water from 3 65 to 1 84 and sediments from 5 38 to 10 47 suggesting that sbc capping could alter the specific microbial activity to affect the nutrients transmission between water and sediments lu et al 2021 in addition different phases exhibited distinctive dominant groups verrucomicrobia 5 94 0 83 and actinobacteria 1 92 0 48 were predominant taxa in water while sediments were affiliated with elusimicrobia 7 80 2 83 and acidobacteria 3 93 2 93 moreover the dominant genera were observed to vary significantly among three systems fig 6b genera such as hydrogenophaga aquabacterium and candidatus aquirestis usually present in aerobic conditions abounded in the o sbc600 treated water in contrast genera such as malikia and azospirillum always found to be abundant in polluted water were significantly reduced in the o sbc600 treated system compared to the control as expected the variation of bacterial genus compositions indicated the improved water quality treated by o sbc600 the results reveal that coupling sbc with onb may promote the growth of aerobic bacteria while their metabolic activity contributed to the degradation of contaminants on the one hand the predominance of anti stress bacteria observed in the control group and oligotrophic bacteria observed in the treatment groups confirmed the improved water quality on the other hand the varying existence and abundance of functional bacteria that participated in biogeochemical cycles e g c n p and s confirmed that the o sbc treatment of anoxic freshwater was mediated by microorganisms further investigation of the mechanisms from a perspective of microbial community response particularly involving the n p and s metabolism will be discussed in section 3 4 2 along with the prediction of metabolic pathways 3 4 2 alteration of major metabolic pathways to further elucidate the function of bacterial communities in river water sediment systems during nutrient reduction the metabolic pathways of the microbial composition were predicted according to inferred metagenomes using picrust2 fig s4 however it should be clarified that picrust2 provides a relatively coarse overview of the potential function profile within the bacterial community a typical limitation is that it can only differentiate the amplified marker gene sequence rather than distinguishing the strain specific functionality same with any other amplicon based analysis gavin et al 2020 this could lead to the consequence that some ko groups predicted to participate in pathways are missing or not functioning in bacteria li et al 2020a as a result the prediction results should be interpreted cautiously with adequate nsti values and actual environmental dynamics here weighted nsti values were ranged from 0 084 to 0 178 with a mean value of 0 125 suggesting the acceptable accuracy of the results li et al 2020a key genes that regulate n p and s metabolic pathways were quantified revealing the bacterial metabolic dynamics under various circumstances the pathways were divided into five groups with respect to the n metabolism namely assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification n fixation and n regulatory fig 7 a in the water phase the n fixation related genes were observed to decline after the addition of sbc600 or o sbc600 which may be attributed to the inactivation of nitrogenases following oxygen exposure kuypers et al 2018 however the sediments exhibited an opposite trend indicating the ability of biochar capping to increase n fixation in sediments thus contributing to the n inputs and promoting the biochemical cycle of n in contrast genes encoding nitrate and nitrite reductase were much more abundant in the o sbc600 treated overlying water suggesting that onb facilitated the availability of inorganic n the denitrification processes generally occurred when treated with o sbc600 as demonstrated by the enrichment of the nitric oxide reductase norb c d and nitrous oxide reductase nosz this further supported the improved n removal processes coinciding with the reduced n concentration fig 4 five main pathways were observed for the p cycle including polyphosphate polyp synthesis polyp degradation phosphate transport system phosphonate transport system and pentose phosphate pathway fig 7b in the water column inorganic phosphate transport was elevated following the sbc600 treatment as evidenced by the expression of genes involved in the pi transporter phou and psta b c s suggesting the enhanced bacterial activities of phosphate assimilation however genes responsible for polyp synthesis e g ppgk and degradation e g ppx1 were enriched in the o sbc600 group along with the phn family genes involving the phosphonate transport system phnc d e f and encoding alpha d ribose 1 methylphosphonate 5 triphosphate synthase phng h i j l m among them polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk and polyphosphate kinase ppk1 which catalyzed the phosphorylation of glucose and the formation of polyp respectively played an important role in the bacterial removal process of p furthermore the phn family which participated in the pentose phosphate pathway was reported to generate a large amount of nadph and provide reductants for cell synthesis reactions the abundance of this family also demonstrate the extensive p scavenging mechanisms in heterotrophic bacteria utilizing organic p li et al 2020a analysis of the s cycle identified pathways for assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation by sox complex fig 7c interestingly genes encoding assimilatory sulfate reduction were more enriched in the water of the control and o sbc600 compared to sbc600 this may be related to the impact of biochar on metabolic activities it seemed that sbc was able to suppress the impression of genes involved in sulfide assimilation whereas this effect was offset by onb in the o sbc600 group the abundance of apra b adenylylsulfate reductase and dsra b dissimilatory sulfite reductase in the sediments were much more elevated in the sbc600 group this reveals the enhancement of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways via sbc in contrast the gene soxb sarcosine oxidase was overrepresented after the treatment of o sbc600 indicating frequent occurrence of reduced s oxidization in oxic conditions which was also an important pathway for the energy metabolism broman et al 2017a zhou et al 2020 3 4 3 microbial populations regulate nutrient cycles the complex transformations of nutrients both for chemical species transition or the sediment water exchange are linked to the strong amazing diversity of microbial populations and genes related to the metabolic processes to gain more direct insight the potential evolution of nutrient transforming networks during the in situ oxygenation processes were depicted with a combination of lab results interpretation fig 8 in eutrophication aquatic ecosystems dominated by phytoplankton the frequent collapse of algal blooms and associated oxygen deficit result in the mass mortality of aerobic metabolism organisms e g fishes and zooplanktons which may drastically alter food webs baxa et al 2021 furthermore significant quantities of nutrients e g n p and s held in sediment organic matter are transformed into soluble inorganic matter by heterotrophic microbes under anaerobic circumstances whereas in a habitable environment treated with o sbc600 physical blocking formed by materials can prevent resuspension of contaminated sediments temporarily further re oxygenation can facilitate the reconstruction of benthic micro and macro organisms thereby permanently contributing to achieve nearly nutrient balanced owing to extensive nutrient recycling more specifically in the anoxia remediation scenario with the o sbc600 the oxygenation of the benthic water and surface sediments was followed by the substantial growth of bacterial populations affiliated with the nitrospirae phyla fig 6a which belong to representative aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria encoding nitrite oxidoreductase nxr in addition a substantial reduction in nitrous oxide release was suggested by higher amounts of nitrous oxide reductase nos the only known enzyme that catalyze nitrous oxide reduction to n2 fig 7a kuypers et al 2018 the nos present in organisms contributed to the inhibition of nitrous oxide emissions a powerful greenhouse gas that is 310 times more potent than carbon dioxide as the release of methane is limited by onb shi et al 2018 o sbc capping can serve as an effective strategy for greenhouse gas emission control the re oxygenation of anoxic swi was observed to reduce p pollution by activating freshwater polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that store p intracellularly as polyp under oxic conditions saia et al 2021 this was also indicated by higher amounts of polyphosphate kinases ppk1 coded for by ppk1 exopolyphosphatase ppx1 and ppx2 gppa coded for by ppx1 and ppx2 gppa respectively compared to the control samples it is generally recognized that microbes prefer orthophosphate and other phosphate esters and diesters as a source of p compared to phosphonates mcmahon and read 2013 p limiting conditions following oxygenation were further demonstrated by high expression levels of phn family genes implying enhanced phosphonate transport and pentose phosphate pathways moreover the oxygenation of anoxic sediments may have enhanced the abundance of genes attributed to the reduced s oxidation fig 7c possibly preventing the formation of toxic h2s and inhibiting its diffusion into overlying water in conclusion the unique properties of sbc including multi porous structure large specific surface area and tunable surface functionality render it as an ideal carrier for attachment and growth of microorganisms additionally the deeper oxygen penetration depth induced by o sbc 2 cm than that induced by aeration 0 5 cm could be more beneficial for the reconstruction of microbial communities in surface sediments liu et al 2021 apart from the potential removal of greenhouse gas and toxic h2s this will also promote the decomposition of organic pollutants via aerobic respiration therefore o sbc has great potential to help re establish micro and even macro organism communities in surface sediments and benthic water through the synergistic coupling of sbc and onb yet the deeper mechanisms linking o sbc and biogeochemical responses in anoxic freshwater including community diversity dynamics complex interspecific relationships and their roles in nutrient reduction along with o sbc treatment require further study 3 5 implications for anoxic freshwater restoration using o sbc through the simulation of sediment water microcosms in this study sbc was demonstrated to enhance oxygen levels both in water and surface sediments leading to the nutrient reduction concomitantly from the perspective of engineering practice the dosage of sbc was estimated to be approximately 5 kg m2 with an average cost of 1 00 2 95 million per km2 under common laboratory preparation conditions khan et al 2014 for the recycling of dredged sediments not only does it save the cost of raw materials but also present a solution to this harmful waste being disposed to land additionally compared with traditional aeration capital construction and maintenance costs are largely saved and the material preparation costs will be reduced through large scale industrial production in the future it should also be pointed out that the development of oxygen carrying material is still at an early stage calling for more research into material development oxygen release mechanism and relevant microbial mechanism through the treatment consequently more oxygen carrying materials such as biochar with diverse properties and functions derived from various feedstocks e g agricultural waste and forest residues are highly encouraged moreover our findings have demonstrated that sbc with different porosity have distinctive oxygenation performances but it is worth mentioning that the effects of the other physicochemical and surface properties such as electron transfer and abundant functional groups need to be further studied in addition considering the limitations of gene expression pathway analyses metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing analyses are recommended in order to comprehensively and deeply understand the dynamics of microbial metabolic activities through the treatment 4 conclusion the current study provides a promising strategy for sustainable anoxic freshwater restoration using environmentally compatible biochar derived from local sediments as novel onb carriers among the five investigated porous materials the sbc600 proved to be most effective in improving do due to its highest surface area and pore volume as well as the prevalence of mid sized mesopores capping the anoxic sediments with o sbc600 successfully combated anoxia and reduced nutrient concentrations through synergistic functions including physical blocking physicochemical adsorption and onb release all these functions contributed to the transformation of the role of sediments from a source to a sink of nutrients furthermore following the o sbc600 treatment bacterial diversity and richness were improved compared with anoxic controls while the proliferation of several specific functional bacterial populations was also observed genetic expression predictions were used to identify key molecular mechanisms that regulate biogeochemical nutrient cycles under re oxygenation conditions these findings can not only expand the possible candidates for eco friendly oxygen carrying materials but can also support further research on the long term anoxia restoration towards nutrient cycle regulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16204,the long term decline in dissolved oxygen do levels in freshwater systems including rivers and lakes has become a worldwide concern which can threaten biodiversity nutrient biogeochemistry water quality and ultimately human health herein we report a sustainable restoration strategy for anoxic freshwater using local sediment based biochar as novel oxygen nanobubble carriers column incubation experiments were conducted with water and sediment samples from an urban tributary of the yangtze river the oxygen carrying sediment based biochar o sbc showed long lasting re oxygenation performance for anoxic river waters during 28 day period in which do was rapidly elevated from 0 14 to 7 87 mg l and gradually maintained at 4 78 mg l until the end o sbc with multiple functions switched the sediments from a source to a sink of nutrients and its release of oxygen nanobubbles contributed further decrements of 66 3 nh4 n and 142 9 po4 3 p except for physical blocking and physicochemical adsorption notably a comprehensive focus on restoration mechanism was explored in view of microbial community response the re oxygenation was followed by a 5 05 increase of bacterial diversity shannon index in water but a 2 40 decrease in sediments a proliferation of some specific aerobic populations was observed of which the nitrifying nitrospira abundances were 10 fold higher in the water from o sbc than the control additionally functional genes involved in nitrous oxide reduction polyphosphate synthesis degradation and thiosulfate oxidation were also enriched taken together our findings can not only expand the promising candidates for oxygen nanobubble carriers based on sediment recycling but also highlight the microbial molecular mechanisms for anoxic freshwater restoration based on nutrient cycle regulation graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anoxic freshwater restoration sediment based biochar oxygen nanobubbles nutrient cycle regulation 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is fundamental to biological processes in aquatic systems and its decline can induce major changes in productivity biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles breitburg et al 2018 unfortunately the long term decline of do levels has been observed not only in the ocean fennel and testa 2019 but also in the freshwater which is 2 75 to 9 30 times greater jane et al 2021 also do levels have been frequently reported to not meet environmental quality standards for surface water even in some important rivers in china including the yangtze and pearl river cnemc 2020a b the oxygen depletion as a major threat to freshwater has been first attributed to excessive nutrient availability and thus eutrophication along with harmful algal blooms jenny et al 2016 this could increase both the mortality of aquatic organisms and the overflow of accumulated nutrients from sediments into water thereby aggravating endogenous pollution wetzel 2001 once water becomes anoxic a return to higher oxygen levels will be hindered by natural biogeochemical feedbacks bush et al 2017 hence artificial interventions for anoxia average do 0 5 mg l remediation are imperatively required to achieve nutrient cycle regulation and ecological restoration jane et al 2021 conventionally artificial mixing and mechanical aeration have been widely used to increase do levels in freshwater harris et al 2015 ma et al 2015 but with inherent limitations in energy efficiency infrastructure investments and device maintenance more worrying is that the resuspended sediments may intensify endogenous pollution liu et al 2019 chemical addition using oxygen releasing compounds has also been employed to improve do levels such as h2o2 cao2 and mgo2 cao et al 2020 li et al 2020b however either rapid consumption of chemical reagents or significant increase of local ph is not expected for sustainable anoxia restoration gholami et al 2019 there is therefore an urgent and challenging task to explore high efficient cost effective easy operation and eco friendly alternatives for do manipulation in anoxic freshwater of particular interest is the use of green oxygen carrying materials which possess multi porous structures for delivering oxygen nanobubbles onb to the target anoxic areas specifically porous clay minerals including volcanic stones zeolites and their modifications were selected as oxygen carriers and successfully utilized to increase do levels reduce nutrient loading mitigate ch4 emission and methylmercury production ji et al 2020 liu et al 2019 shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 notably instead of the apparent improvement in water quality a permanent restoration of anoxic areas is considered to depend on the underlying response of in situ microbial communities which play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic systems broman et al 2017b forth et al 2015 although several studies have confirmed that oxygen carrying materials are effective for anoxic water restoration detalis on the microbial mechanisms including both community structural and metabolic dynamics through treatment remain largely unexplored as a result the development in this emerging field is at an early stage and calls for more research considering that the carriers of onb are essential and important in the anoxia restoration process in addition to clay minerals more carrier types with features of proper porosity earth abundance easy availability and green nature are needed to be explored herein a novel onb carrier namely sediment based biochar sbc was developed with great potential to achieve sustainable restoration of anoxic freshwater through coupling of physical blocking physicochemical adsorption and onb release specially biochar here was prepared from local polluted freshwater sediments which possess high carbon content up to 67 6 wt as well as high nutrient content sui et al 2021 a large quantity of contaminanted sediments are produced from dredging activities annually worldwide such as 150 million m3 in the usa and 200 million m3 in europe posing serious treatment and disposal problems that how to manage them as natural resources rather than as wastes bates et al 2015 mattei et al 2017 sbc production can be an alternative to landfill disposal for treating dredged sediments thus reducing land occupation and avoiding secondary pollution hossain et al 2020 also it is taken from solid wastes of polluted freshwater systems and used for pollution remediation of the same systems consistently in line with the concept of environmental compatibility and sustainable development to our best knowledge this is the first attempt to investigate how oxygen carrying sediment based biochar o sbc regulates nutrient concentrations with insights on microbial community response specifically ours aims were to 1 check the apparent performance of sbc as oxygen carrying materials 2 explore the joint effects of sbc and onb on nutrient reduction and 3 elucidate the underlying mechanisms of nutrient cycle regulation during anoxia restoration in view of microbial community structure and metabolic profiles the research here sought to provide a novel approach for anoxic freshwater restoration and shed new light on the microbial mechanism under o sbc treatment which can provide useful information for applying oxygen carrying materials in sustainable anoxia remediation practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication and characterization of sbc surface river sediments were sampled in an urban tributary of the yangtze river namely qinhuai river 32 06 n 118 75 e nanjing jiangsu province china at a depth of 0 10 cm a portion of the sediment samples was dried at 20 c to prepare sbc the dried sediment samples were placed into a high temperature furnace under nitrogen gas n2 and heated to a set temperature 400 600 800 1000 c at a heating rate of 8 c min followed by a holding stage for 4 h at the set temperature the carbon products obtained by pyrolysis in the furnace were ground to 1 3 mm particles samples were denoted as sbcx where x equals the pyrolysis temperatures of individual samples the surface morphologies of the obtained biochar were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma 300 carl zeiss the brunauer emmett teller bet asap 2460 micromeritics method was employed to determine the specific surface area pore volumes and pore size distribution of the sbc samples from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the major components of the materials were further determined by fourier transform infrared ftir thermo scientific nicolet is5 thermo fisher scientific and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha thermo fisher scientific 2 2 preparation of o sbc the sbc samples with different pyrolysis temperatures were used as oxygen carrying materials and the common commercially available zeolites ø 1 3 mm were selected as reference materials these materials were washed with ultrapure water and then dried at 90 c and then placed in a pressure resistant airtight container to load oxygen the detailed preparation procedures are shown in supplementary information 2 3 measurements of oxygen carrying capacities the oxygen carrying capacities of the porous materials were determined by the o2 adsorption isotherms using h sorb 2600 high pressure volumetric adsorption analyzer gold app instrument corporation china micromeritics asap 2460 and autochem 2920 micromeritics usa the oxygen amounts adsorbed by the materials were recorded under a dynamic relative pressure ranging from 0 0 to 0 2 mpa at 77 k 2 4 incubation procedures 2 4 1 determination of oxygenation performance sediment and water samples were collected from the same location at a depth of 0 50 cm and transported to the laboratory under dark conditions in the initial incubation experiment both the sediments and water were respectively homogenized and filled into 12 plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 10 cm and height of 100 cm fig s1 the cylinders were then divided into six groups the two cylinders containing only water and sediments were used as the control and the sediments in the remaining cylinders were capped with sbc400 sbc600 sbc800 sbc1000 and zeolite respectively with a dose of 50 g and a height of 1 cm each group had two identical microcosms the most effective oxygen carrying material was determined by do dynamics in the overlying water following the 10 day experiment 2 4 2 evaluation of water quality the long term effects of the most effective oxygen carrying material i e sbc600 on oxygen modulation and nutrient reduction were then assessed six plexiglass cylinders filled with the same amounts of sediments and water as the first experiment were divided into three groups namely control sbc600 and o sbc600 the experiment lasted for 28 days to simulate the long term dynamic changes of the river water sediment system environmental parameters including do and redox potential orp in water high resolution profiles of oxygen and orp around the swi total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 3 p and sulfate so4 2 within the water phase and sediments were determined at intervals the nutrient fluxes were calculated based on the mass balance method zhang et al 2021 more details about the methods for nutrient concentration determination and flux calculation are provided in supplementary information 2 5 microbiological investigations 2 5 1 sampling dna extraction and high throughput sequencing once the experiment was finished approximately 0 5 g of sediments top 5 cm layer and 1000 ml of water 5 cm above the sediment surface were collected in each cylinder for microbial analysis samples from the same group were mixed separately to reduce sample heterogeneity water samples were filtrated through a 0 45 μm pore size nylon filter via a vacuum pump vp 10 l joanlab china all filters and sediment samples were stored at 80 c prior to analysis dna from each sample was extracted using a ezna kit omega bio tek inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis illumina hiseq sequencing was conducted at shanghai biozeron biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china the v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were targeted by 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 primers the raw sequencing data is available through ncbi sequence read archive database under the accession number prjna767484 2 5 2 bioinformatic analysis the amplicon sequencing results were analyzed using qiime 2 bolyen et al 2019 details of the analysis including read quality checking paired end reads truncating operational taxonomic unit otu picking alpha diversity analysis etc can be found in previous research from our group lu et al 2021 the functional properties of the bacterial communities were predicted using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust v1 1 4 langille et al 2013 following the procedure detailed in li et al 2020a bacterial metagenome content predictions were performed by importing the generated feature table based on normalized 16s rrna gene sequences to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg the metabolic function prediction was achieved by referencing the kegg orthology ko database and nearest sequenced taxon index nsti value was determined to estimate the accuracy of prediction results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of environmentally compatible biochar the morphologies and pore structures of environmentally compatible biochar were evaluated using sem fig 1 a sbc pyrolyzed at low temperatures presented loose and layered structures while the lamellar structure exhibited collapse with the temperature exceeding 800 c each biochar sample exhibited a type iv n2 adsorption desorption isotherm fig 1b indicating the production of mesoporous structures a common feature in adsorbent materials and the type h4 hysteresis loops observed in the isotherms are associated with the formation of narrow slit like pores which is typical for activated carbon type solids moreover the bjh pore size distribution of sbc depicted in fig 1c demonstrates prevalent distribution of mesopores 2 20 nm especially for sbc600 as expected the obtained sbc possessed high surface area porosity and well developed mesoporous structure table 1 which may facilitate the uptake and release of onb liu et al 2019 in ftir spectra the surface functional groups of sbc under different pyrolysis temperature have been found to be changed fig 1d specifically the broad adsorption band at approximately 1036 cm 1 decreased with the elevated treated temperature which may be attributed to the thermolability of carboxylate cooh groups the decreasing trend is also observed for the peaks at around 800 500 cm 1 which is associated with ch wagging vibrations indicating a reduced stability and cyclization of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds sui et al 2021 in the xps spectra it was noted that several metal atoms were observed to be embedded in the biochar which may have a beneficial effect on the adsorption capacities fig 1e the gradual increase of sp2 hybridized carbon with temperature reveals an enhancement in the carbonization degree while the gradual decrease in the peak intensity of o1s from sbc400 to sbc800 may be ascribed to the fracturing of relevant weak bonds within the carbon structure fig 1g as expected the ftir and xps spectra of sbc are consistent with those previously reported carbon materials obtained from sediments and sludge wang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2018 also claiming that the eco friendly biochar was successfully prepared 3 2 oxygenation performance of oxygen carrying materials 3 2 1 oxygen carrying capacities the oxygen adsorption curves displayed in fig 2 a clearly exhibited a constant increase in the oxygen adsorbing capacity with pressure for each material sample a significantly higher adsorption capacity was observed for the environmentally compatible biochar compared to that of natural zeolite more specifically the oxygen uptake amount under 0 2 mpa was maximized with sbc800 2 66 cm3 o2 g followed by sbc600 2 51 cm3 o2 g sbc400 1 96 cm3 o2 g sbc1000 1 32 cm3 o2 g and natural zeolite 0 21 cm3 o2 g note that sbc600 and sbc800 appear to have the greatest potential to serve as oxygen carrying materials due to their high adsorption capacities whereas their actual oxygenation performances at the swi are considered for comprehensive assessment later with more details in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 real time do dynamics do concentrations in overlying water during the 10 day experiment were plotted in fig 3 b in the control groups the do levels remained at approximately 0 00 0 12 mg l throughout the incubation sbc400 sbc1000 and natural zeolite were observed to improve the oxygen level maximum to 4 67 4 65 and 3 81 mg l respectively while the do showed a dramatic decline and eventually fell below 2 mg l in contrast to the oxygen carrying capacity test results sbc600 with onb was observed to perform better in the overlying water compared to sbc800 although the latter drastically increased do to 7 51 mg l this was followed by a rapid reduction with a final concentration reaching approximately 3 50 mg l at the end of the experiment however in the groups capped with oxygen carrying sbc600 the do within the water columns not only increased to the maximum level 8 06 mg l among treatment groups but was also maintained at around 6 26 mg l since day 10 this indicates sbc600 offers exciting opportunities in the slow release of carried oxygen nanobubbles to achieve sustainable oxygen modulation based on these results sbc600 has been chosen for the subsequent experiments to further verify its long term oxygenation performance and nutrient reduction effect 3 2 3 pore size distribution determines the oxygenation performance the improvement in oxygen levels at the end of the experiment fellow the order sbc600 sbc800 sbc400 zeolite sbc1000 which was quite distinct from the oxygen carrying capacity test results fig 2b oxygen uptake capabilities exhibited a strong positive correlation with surface area and pore volume of prepared porous materials but the difference in oxygenation performance may be attributed to the pore size distribution and in particular the existence of mesopores previous research demonstrates that porous materials possessing a predominance of mid sized mesopores 2 20 nm can facilitate the moderate release of onb for reasons that larger pores 20 nm can aid a fast oxygen transfer and smaller pores 2 nm can lock the oxygen liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 consequently sbc600 which possessed the highest surface area pore volume table 1 and the prevalence of mid sized mesopores fig 1c was able to carry large amounts of onb and deliver them slowly into the swi resulting in the persistent anoxia remediation unexpectedly despite its relatively small specific surface area and pore volume sbc800 demonstrated a perfect oxygen carrying capability a possible explanation is that heteroatom doping which favors the charge delocalization on c atoms can supply active oxygen adsorption sites and weaken the oo bonding connection gao et al 2015 it has also been indicated that oxygen molecules have affinities for specific adsorbents thereby affecting the oxygen carrying capacities and releasing rates the oxygen transfer efficiency mechanism via oxygen carrying materials to water column merits a detailed investigation and is reserved for future work nevertheless our findings expand the potential candidates of effective oxygen carrying materials and offer strategies for the preparation of them 3 3 variations of water quality parameters 3 3 1 long term do and orp levels at the swi do and orp levels in the overlying water from three different treatments of the 28 day experiment were illustrated in fig 3 as expected do and orp were maintained at around 0 05 mg l and 105 mv respectively fig 3a and b capping sediments with pure sbc600 slightly enhanced the oxygen and orp levels to 1 5 mg l and 50 mv respectively which may be attributed to the nutrient removal effect of biochar lu et al 2021 reducing the oxygen consumption conversely abrupt increases in do were observed in the groups capped with o sbc600 with a maximum level of 7 87 mg l although this was followed by a slow reduction to 4 78 mg l in 20 days for the depletion of carried oxygen the oxygen level subsequently remained stable until the end of the incubation a similar trend occurred in orp levels which instantly increased from 88 88 mv to 151 35 mv in the first 11 days followed by a reduction to 99 64 mv oxygenation of anaerobic surface sediments was further observed through do and orp profiles fig 3c and d do ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l in the aqueous phase 0 5 cm above the sediments of control groups throughout the 28 day incubation moreover the oxygen penetration depth was measured to drop off 1 2 cm compared to the initial value indicating significant oxygen consumption in the surface sediments when capping with sbc600 the penetration depth remained constant on day 28 compared to day 0 with a slight increment in the do level from 0 79 mg l to 1 92 mg l the groups capped with o sbc600 exhibited significantly higher do levels across the swi 6 50 mg l at day 28 accompanied by an oxygen penetration depth of 2 cm which was notably deeper than the initial depth our results demonstrate the ability of onb released from o sbc600 to effectively remediate the anaerobic zone around the swi with not only a substantially higher oxygen concentration in the overlying water but also a deeper oxygen supply into the surface sediments this is also consistent with the observations from the orp profile distribution across the sediments 3 3 2 nutrient parameters in water and sediments to reconfirm the nutrient reduction capability of oxygen carrying environmentally compatible biochar on the swi more chemical parameters within the water phase and sediments were measured figs 4 and s3 for the control groups ever rising concentrations of tn from 1 72 to 2 15 mg l nh4 n from 1 48 to 2 01 mg l tp from 0 21 to 0 31 mg l and po4 3 p from 0 11 to 0 14 mg l were observed in the overlying water which were likely to be linked to the longer periods of anoxia fig 4a and b as reduced species continue to diffuse out of the sediments and enter the water column gantzer et al 2009 this was also supported by the gradually decreasing content of nutrients from the control sediments indicating a certain degree of diffusion among them fig s3 both sbc600 and o sbc600 functioned to reduce tn and nh4 n concentrations in the water column among which the sbc600 capping reduced tn to 0 97 mg l and nh4 n to 0 89 mg l on day 28 and yielded a negative cumulative nh4 n flux 9 31 mg m2 d figs 4a b and s2a this may have been due to on the one hand the interfacial layer formed by the biochar could reduce the upward diffusion of the nutrient fluxes through the upper layer sediments and on the other hand owing to the flourishing hole structure of the biochar resulted in cation exchange dominating the adsorption of nutrients zhu et al 2019 in comparison tn and nh4 n concentrations in the o sbc600 treated groups reached 0 74 and 0 36 mg l respectively on day 28 we suspected that the aerobic conditions caused by onb could facilitate the nitrification reaction converting nh4 n to no3 n which was supported by the significant reduction in nh4 n 76 92 moreover the cumulative nh4 n flux through the swi was determined as 27 19 mg m2 d revealing the joint effects of porous materials and onb on combating nh4 n release from the sediments to the overlying water extremely lower concentrations of tp and po4 3 p in the overlying water were observed in the o sbc600 treatment groups 0 07 and 0 05 mg l respectively compared with those from the sbc600 groups 0 12 and 0 09 mg l respectively fig 4c and d the addition of sbc600 without onb effectively controlled the tp and po4 3 p flux maximums of 12 26 mg m2 d and 6 43 mg m2 d respectively in the first 10 days of the experiment fig s2c and d owing to the physical capping and adsorption functionalities of biochar as previously mentioned despite this the adsorption capabilities of sbc600 were not able to afford excessive p release under anoxic conditions over time tp and po4 3 p concentrations appeared to rebound to higher levels and the accumulated flux tended to or attained positive values in contrast there was only a slight bounce of tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the o sbc600 group and the values reached a plateau after 10 days of incubation concomitantly the cumulative fluxes of p exhibited negative values tp 26 60 to 3 70 mg m2 d po4 3 p 17 32 to 1 45 mg m2 d throughout the incubation period this may be linked to the precipitation of po4 3 p coupled to fe3 whereby the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 contributed to the generation of fe bound non soluble po4 3 during the continuous release of onb at the swi by o sbc600 the dynamics of toc in the overlying water were generally similar to those for n and p and follow the trend o sbc600 sbc600 control in particular the o sbc600 capping markedly decreased concentrations from 29 87 to 7 67 mg l 74 3 reduction implying the occurrence of the possible remineralization of organic matter under aerobic conditions in contrast so4 2 concentrations in the water column from the o sbc600 groups 238 28 mg l far exceeded those from the sbc600 107 94 mg l and control groups 39 76 mg l indicating the replacement of anaerobic sulfate reduction by oxygen reduction with the conversion of the anoxic to oxic state 3 3 3 o sbc combines multiple functions to give a more direct investigation into the respective contributions of the biochar capping treatments and onb delivery on endogenous pollution control we performed quantitative analysis using the cumulative nutrients fluxes fig 5 in the control systems the total release amounts of nh4 n fig 5a1 and po4 3 p fig 5b1 from sediments throughout the 28 day incubation were 5 23 mg and 0 35 mg these values are markedly higher than those of the other two groups the addition of sbc600 reduced the values to 5 28 mg nh4 n fig 5a2 and 0 37 mg po4 3 p fig 5b2 inverting the sediments from a nutrient source to a nutrient sink the results indicate that the sbc600 capping treatment could reduce the release of nh4 n and po4 3 p by 200 9 and 205 7 respectively moreover the total release amounts of nh4 n and po4 3 p were further limited in the o sbc600 with values of 8 75 mg fig 5a3 and 0 87 mg fig 5b3 respectively the onb delivery was determined to further reduce nh4 n and po4 3 p by 66 3 and 142 9 respectively after subtracting the efforts of capping alone compared with the control groups the o sbc materials with multiple functions have been found here to trigger various ecological reactions around the swi including the sustainable modulation of oxygen levels in the benthic water meanwhile improving the redox environment around the swi the suppression of reductive pollutants released from sediments thereby reducing nutrient concentrations in the water column and the acceleration of organic matter remineralization our results reveal sbc as an excellent candidate for oxygen carrying materials for the joint effects of the biochar s capacity to adsorb pollutants and the ability of the carried onb to restore reductive benthic habitat furthermore the prepared sbc taken from solid wastes in polluted freshwater systems are utilized to restore the same systems providing a promising strategy to achieve environmental compatibility and sustainable development in the following section more efforts have been underway to shed light on the mechanisms investigate the mechanisms between these multiple processes particularly in terms of microbial community response 3 4 changes in functional microbial communities 3 4 1 succession of microbial communities the bacterial composition and diversity were obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing the α diversity indexes of each group indicates significant variations among the control and treatments table s1 in the water phase indexes including chao 1 richness shannon and simpson were much lower in the control group than in the sbc600 and o sbc600 groups revealing a relatively lower abundance and diversity of species present before treatments in contrast the three indexes exhibited different trends for sediment samples possibly due to the selectivity for sediment microorganisms after sbc treatments the taxonomy classification levels and relative abundances were shown in fig 6 specifically proteobacteria bacteroidetes and elusimicrobia were the most abundant phyla fig 6a firmicutes exhibited a contrasting trend between water from 3 65 to 1 84 and sediments from 5 38 to 10 47 suggesting that sbc capping could alter the specific microbial activity to affect the nutrients transmission between water and sediments lu et al 2021 in addition different phases exhibited distinctive dominant groups verrucomicrobia 5 94 0 83 and actinobacteria 1 92 0 48 were predominant taxa in water while sediments were affiliated with elusimicrobia 7 80 2 83 and acidobacteria 3 93 2 93 moreover the dominant genera were observed to vary significantly among three systems fig 6b genera such as hydrogenophaga aquabacterium and candidatus aquirestis usually present in aerobic conditions abounded in the o sbc600 treated water in contrast genera such as malikia and azospirillum always found to be abundant in polluted water were significantly reduced in the o sbc600 treated system compared to the control as expected the variation of bacterial genus compositions indicated the improved water quality treated by o sbc600 the results reveal that coupling sbc with onb may promote the growth of aerobic bacteria while their metabolic activity contributed to the degradation of contaminants on the one hand the predominance of anti stress bacteria observed in the control group and oligotrophic bacteria observed in the treatment groups confirmed the improved water quality on the other hand the varying existence and abundance of functional bacteria that participated in biogeochemical cycles e g c n p and s confirmed that the o sbc treatment of anoxic freshwater was mediated by microorganisms further investigation of the mechanisms from a perspective of microbial community response particularly involving the n p and s metabolism will be discussed in section 3 4 2 along with the prediction of metabolic pathways 3 4 2 alteration of major metabolic pathways to further elucidate the function of bacterial communities in river water sediment systems during nutrient reduction the metabolic pathways of the microbial composition were predicted according to inferred metagenomes using picrust2 fig s4 however it should be clarified that picrust2 provides a relatively coarse overview of the potential function profile within the bacterial community a typical limitation is that it can only differentiate the amplified marker gene sequence rather than distinguishing the strain specific functionality same with any other amplicon based analysis gavin et al 2020 this could lead to the consequence that some ko groups predicted to participate in pathways are missing or not functioning in bacteria li et al 2020a as a result the prediction results should be interpreted cautiously with adequate nsti values and actual environmental dynamics here weighted nsti values were ranged from 0 084 to 0 178 with a mean value of 0 125 suggesting the acceptable accuracy of the results li et al 2020a key genes that regulate n p and s metabolic pathways were quantified revealing the bacterial metabolic dynamics under various circumstances the pathways were divided into five groups with respect to the n metabolism namely assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification n fixation and n regulatory fig 7 a in the water phase the n fixation related genes were observed to decline after the addition of sbc600 or o sbc600 which may be attributed to the inactivation of nitrogenases following oxygen exposure kuypers et al 2018 however the sediments exhibited an opposite trend indicating the ability of biochar capping to increase n fixation in sediments thus contributing to the n inputs and promoting the biochemical cycle of n in contrast genes encoding nitrate and nitrite reductase were much more abundant in the o sbc600 treated overlying water suggesting that onb facilitated the availability of inorganic n the denitrification processes generally occurred when treated with o sbc600 as demonstrated by the enrichment of the nitric oxide reductase norb c d and nitrous oxide reductase nosz this further supported the improved n removal processes coinciding with the reduced n concentration fig 4 five main pathways were observed for the p cycle including polyphosphate polyp synthesis polyp degradation phosphate transport system phosphonate transport system and pentose phosphate pathway fig 7b in the water column inorganic phosphate transport was elevated following the sbc600 treatment as evidenced by the expression of genes involved in the pi transporter phou and psta b c s suggesting the enhanced bacterial activities of phosphate assimilation however genes responsible for polyp synthesis e g ppgk and degradation e g ppx1 were enriched in the o sbc600 group along with the phn family genes involving the phosphonate transport system phnc d e f and encoding alpha d ribose 1 methylphosphonate 5 triphosphate synthase phng h i j l m among them polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk and polyphosphate kinase ppk1 which catalyzed the phosphorylation of glucose and the formation of polyp respectively played an important role in the bacterial removal process of p furthermore the phn family which participated in the pentose phosphate pathway was reported to generate a large amount of nadph and provide reductants for cell synthesis reactions the abundance of this family also demonstrate the extensive p scavenging mechanisms in heterotrophic bacteria utilizing organic p li et al 2020a analysis of the s cycle identified pathways for assimilatory sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reduction and thiosulfate oxidation by sox complex fig 7c interestingly genes encoding assimilatory sulfate reduction were more enriched in the water of the control and o sbc600 compared to sbc600 this may be related to the impact of biochar on metabolic activities it seemed that sbc was able to suppress the impression of genes involved in sulfide assimilation whereas this effect was offset by onb in the o sbc600 group the abundance of apra b adenylylsulfate reductase and dsra b dissimilatory sulfite reductase in the sediments were much more elevated in the sbc600 group this reveals the enhancement of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways via sbc in contrast the gene soxb sarcosine oxidase was overrepresented after the treatment of o sbc600 indicating frequent occurrence of reduced s oxidization in oxic conditions which was also an important pathway for the energy metabolism broman et al 2017a zhou et al 2020 3 4 3 microbial populations regulate nutrient cycles the complex transformations of nutrients both for chemical species transition or the sediment water exchange are linked to the strong amazing diversity of microbial populations and genes related to the metabolic processes to gain more direct insight the potential evolution of nutrient transforming networks during the in situ oxygenation processes were depicted with a combination of lab results interpretation fig 8 in eutrophication aquatic ecosystems dominated by phytoplankton the frequent collapse of algal blooms and associated oxygen deficit result in the mass mortality of aerobic metabolism organisms e g fishes and zooplanktons which may drastically alter food webs baxa et al 2021 furthermore significant quantities of nutrients e g n p and s held in sediment organic matter are transformed into soluble inorganic matter by heterotrophic microbes under anaerobic circumstances whereas in a habitable environment treated with o sbc600 physical blocking formed by materials can prevent resuspension of contaminated sediments temporarily further re oxygenation can facilitate the reconstruction of benthic micro and macro organisms thereby permanently contributing to achieve nearly nutrient balanced owing to extensive nutrient recycling more specifically in the anoxia remediation scenario with the o sbc600 the oxygenation of the benthic water and surface sediments was followed by the substantial growth of bacterial populations affiliated with the nitrospirae phyla fig 6a which belong to representative aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria encoding nitrite oxidoreductase nxr in addition a substantial reduction in nitrous oxide release was suggested by higher amounts of nitrous oxide reductase nos the only known enzyme that catalyze nitrous oxide reduction to n2 fig 7a kuypers et al 2018 the nos present in organisms contributed to the inhibition of nitrous oxide emissions a powerful greenhouse gas that is 310 times more potent than carbon dioxide as the release of methane is limited by onb shi et al 2018 o sbc capping can serve as an effective strategy for greenhouse gas emission control the re oxygenation of anoxic swi was observed to reduce p pollution by activating freshwater polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that store p intracellularly as polyp under oxic conditions saia et al 2021 this was also indicated by higher amounts of polyphosphate kinases ppk1 coded for by ppk1 exopolyphosphatase ppx1 and ppx2 gppa coded for by ppx1 and ppx2 gppa respectively compared to the control samples it is generally recognized that microbes prefer orthophosphate and other phosphate esters and diesters as a source of p compared to phosphonates mcmahon and read 2013 p limiting conditions following oxygenation were further demonstrated by high expression levels of phn family genes implying enhanced phosphonate transport and pentose phosphate pathways moreover the oxygenation of anoxic sediments may have enhanced the abundance of genes attributed to the reduced s oxidation fig 7c possibly preventing the formation of toxic h2s and inhibiting its diffusion into overlying water in conclusion the unique properties of sbc including multi porous structure large specific surface area and tunable surface functionality render it as an ideal carrier for attachment and growth of microorganisms additionally the deeper oxygen penetration depth induced by o sbc 2 cm than that induced by aeration 0 5 cm could be more beneficial for the reconstruction of microbial communities in surface sediments liu et al 2021 apart from the potential removal of greenhouse gas and toxic h2s this will also promote the decomposition of organic pollutants via aerobic respiration therefore o sbc has great potential to help re establish micro and even macro organism communities in surface sediments and benthic water through the synergistic coupling of sbc and onb yet the deeper mechanisms linking o sbc and biogeochemical responses in anoxic freshwater including community diversity dynamics complex interspecific relationships and their roles in nutrient reduction along with o sbc treatment require further study 3 5 implications for anoxic freshwater restoration using o sbc through the simulation of sediment water microcosms in this study sbc was demonstrated to enhance oxygen levels both in water and surface sediments leading to the nutrient reduction concomitantly from the perspective of engineering practice the dosage of sbc was estimated to be approximately 5 kg m2 with an average cost of 1 00 2 95 million per km2 under common laboratory preparation conditions khan et al 2014 for the recycling of dredged sediments not only does it save the cost of raw materials but also present a solution to this harmful waste being disposed to land additionally compared with traditional aeration capital construction and maintenance costs are largely saved and the material preparation costs will be reduced through large scale industrial production in the future it should also be pointed out that the development of oxygen carrying material is still at an early stage calling for more research into material development oxygen release mechanism and relevant microbial mechanism through the treatment consequently more oxygen carrying materials such as biochar with diverse properties and functions derived from various feedstocks e g agricultural waste and forest residues are highly encouraged moreover our findings have demonstrated that sbc with different porosity have distinctive oxygenation performances but it is worth mentioning that the effects of the other physicochemical and surface properties such as electron transfer and abundant functional groups need to be further studied in addition considering the limitations of gene expression pathway analyses metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing analyses are recommended in order to comprehensively and deeply understand the dynamics of microbial metabolic activities through the treatment 4 conclusion the current study provides a promising strategy for sustainable anoxic freshwater restoration using environmentally compatible biochar derived from local sediments as novel onb carriers among the five investigated porous materials the sbc600 proved to be most effective in improving do due to its highest surface area and pore volume as well as the prevalence of mid sized mesopores capping the anoxic sediments with o sbc600 successfully combated anoxia and reduced nutrient concentrations through synergistic functions including physical blocking physicochemical adsorption and onb release all these functions contributed to the transformation of the role of sediments from a source to a sink of nutrients furthermore following the o sbc600 treatment bacterial diversity and richness were improved compared with anoxic controls while the proliferation of several specific functional bacterial populations was also observed genetic expression predictions were used to identify key molecular mechanisms that regulate biogeochemical nutrient cycles under re oxygenation conditions these findings can not only expand the possible candidates for eco friendly oxygen carrying materials but can also support further research on the long term anoxia restoration towards nutrient cycle regulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
