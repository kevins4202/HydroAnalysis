15525,riverine ecosystem management along an urban stretch mostly depends on high frequent daily scale monitoring of water quality at finer spatial resolutions however with the decrease in the number of in situ monitoring stations owing to their expensive maintenance cost there is a need to develop the next generation remote sensing rs tools as an alternate approach with better synoptic coverage of river water quality assessment this study advocates three novel model variants to estimate the total suspended solids tss concentration at daily scale using the public domain modis and landsat satellite datasets the modt model variant uses the 1 day 250 m modis public domain datasets and the fust model is based on the 1 day 30 m modis landsat fusion datasets whereas the cfust model integrates the frank copula with the fust model these hierarchical model variants are assessed in the urban waste dominated lower ganges namely the hooghly river and the brahmani river in eastern india using the measured in situ tss datasets at multiple monitoring stations from 2016 to 2019 the results reveal that the cfust is the best tss estimation model variant that performs with the average coefficient of determination of 0 88 0 93 mean absolute error of 0 17 0 19 and normal root mean square error of 0 05 0 09 conclusively the proposed cfust and cfustu stochastic models can be used as potential tools for tss and turbidity assessment along the dynamic river systems respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords frank copula fusion landsat modis suspended solids turbidity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the ever degrading water quality in many rivers worldwide attributed to the interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors rutledge and chow fraser 2019 wu and lu 2021 its monitoring at finer spatiotemporal intervals is very important for basin scale water management for instance the river ganges the largest river in india in terms of the catchment area and utilizable surface water potential is one such river that has attracted substantial efforts for its rejuvenation the ganges pass through the highly industrialized and urbanized floodplains having 764 industries in the main stem generating nearly 501 million litres per day mld of wastewater misra 2011 nmcg 2016 over 200 million dollars are earmarked annually by the government of india for the namami gange programme through the national mission for clean ganga nmcg similar water quality scenarios are also available in many world rivers the monitoring of river water quality through traditional means is time consuming and expensive however sufficient and detailed water quality data at varied spatial and temporal scales is necessary to monitor river health furthermore the total suspended solids tss present in the river water has been recognized as the prime suspect for the transport of various pollutants such as pharmaceuticals boulard et al 2020 and heavy metals swain and sahoo 2017a 2017b 2021 in addition the suspended sediments obstruct the transmission of light in the water leading to turbidity which alters the nutrient concentration with reduced dissolved oxygen he et al 2017 tss is also used in sediment flux and transport applications peterson et al 2018 therefore monitoring tss and the associated turbidity is critical for analyzing the river dynamics and quantifying the tss distribution along the river reach should be an essential part of the pollution monitoring in the world rivers generally laboratory analysis and digital in situ sensing based methods are the widely adopted methods for water quality assessment these popular methods are highly reliable for any water quality model development however these approaches have limited applications in the river systems due to tediousness in careful sampling the requirement of high cost sensing devices and or laboratory facilities potential changes in the water quality parameters during transportation and storage need for sufficient technical expertise difficulty in sampling from remote areas especially during high flood events time consuming methods and high cost involvement these challenges coupled with an expensive maintenance cost have led to declining river water quality monitoring stations worldwide bende michl et al 2011 swain and sahoo 2017b furthermore conventional sampling techniques often fail to characterize the pollutant dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales along the river this has led the scientific community to explore alternatives and remote sensing rs based methods have appeared promising for monitoring water quality especially for the inland waters lakes and estuaries the rs based methods have proven their efficiency in characterizing the optical and bio optical properties of the inland waters and the associated water quality parameters such as tss turbidity and chlorophyll content mishra and mishra 2012 mishra et al 2013 dogliotti et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 these techniques are also popular for monitoring water quality at varying spatial and temporal scales with no physical sampling and cumbersome laboratory analysis requirements ritchie et al 2003 these rs based algorithms use the satellite remote sensing products of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and landsat tm etm etm miller and mckee 2004 nechad et al 2009 over the last decade several rs based models were proposed to retrieve tss information in inland waters and these models are broadly categorized as i analytical bio optical and ii empirical both of these models used the rs reflectance rrs λ acquired by the satellites at several wavelengths available in the form of a single band or combination of bands the aforementioned classification was done based on the algorithm s formulation accompanied by the governing principle for instance the bio optical modeling approach was also considered as the analytical model which primarily solves the radiative transfer equation to estimate the optically active constituents oac such as tss bernardo et al 2019 sagan et al 2020 with the implementations of the radiative transfer equation the oac of the water columns was derived from the water leaving radiance during this process the tss was derived from two specific parameters i using particulate absorption coefficient a p babin et al 2003 zheng and digiacomo 2017 by estimating mass specific particulate absorption a p and ii using the backscattering b b p volpe et al 2011 woźniak et al 2010 by computing backscattering coefficients b b p interestingly all these models parameters a p and b b p could be computed using the inversion models viz quasi analytical algorithm qaa lee et al 2002 mishra et al 2013 and generalized ocean color inversion model werdell et al 2013 furthermore the past studies e g shanmugam et al 2010 zheng and digiacomo 2017 also claimed that the inversion models are less accurate to compute b b p at high turbid regions especially over the coastal areas several research investigations also reported that the presence of phytoplankton influences b b p at 600 nm λ 800 nm binding et al 2010 shi et al 2018 therefore the tss estimation models developed in the absence of phytoplankton concentration may not be suitable for the region highly affected by phytoplankton and vice versa balasubramanian et al 2020 therefore implementation of these models for tss estimation needs comprehensive spectral information of the oac in inland waters which demands high cost and time involvement similarly the empirical models for tss estimation were developed using the statistical relationship between the in situ tss observations and the reflectance of the bands acquired by the satellite sensors a unique potential to the empirical models is that there is no need for the prior understanding of the often complex water and light interactions as in the case of semi analytical models which make the empirical models desirable for effective and easy implementation sagan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 among these empirical models few models were developed based on the prior information and behavior of the oac at the certain bands acquired at a specific wavelength thus these models were considered semi empirical models ogashawara et al 2017 for instance the presence of suspended sediments in the water bodies is known to amplify the spectral reflectance and this phenomenon is more pronounced in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum ritchie et al 1976 ritchie and cooper 1988 feng et al 2012 dogliotti et al 2015 shi et al 2015 based on these properties the rs based semi empirical models have been developed for tss and turbidity estimation in static water bodies viz lakes estuaries reservoirs and lagoons cao et al 2017 he et al 2013 among the empirical approaches of rs applications in static water bodies using landsat images ouillon et al 2004 used linear regression analysis whereas ondrusek et al 2012 and kumar et al 2016 used higher order polynomials to estimate tss concentrations miller and mckee 2004 also estimated tss in the mississippi river delta for tss estimation the meris satellite based red band was used by shi et al 2014 in static water bodies and wu et al 2013 also employed the red band λ 645 nm of modis to retrieve tss information in a lake similarly for tss retrieval in inland waters many previous studies were also used modis red band to execute linear e g miller and mckee 2004 sipelgas et al 2006 liu and rossiter 2008 ondrusek et al 2012 exponential e g zhao et al 2011 jiang and liu 2011 shi et al 2015 polynomial e g cui et al 2013 and cubic e g wu et al 2013 models these studies emphasize for using the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum for enhanced accuracy in the rs based tss estimation conversely near infrared nir based single band studies han et al 2016 suggested that it fails to capture the low to moderate tss concentration due to water absorption properties tarpanelli et al 2013 sahoo et al 2020b 2021 2022 and negligible contribution of particulate backscattering in this spectral region doxaran et al 2012 balasubramanian et al 2020 due to these reasons the nir based single band studies for tss estimation have limited applications in river systems where tss is substantially varied throughout the reach due to dynamic flow conditions and rapid mixing that result in low tss concentrations at many river sections as an improvement over these single band based studies a few studies were designed to consider the ratio of red and nir bands of modis e g hu et al 2004 tarrant et al 2010 however these models are more suitable for chlorophyll assessment in optically complex waters exclusively in coastal areas and estuaries moses et al 2009 as phytoplankton growth in the water bodies may impact the rs based model hannouche et al 2017 all these empirical models need recalibration while setting up for any given condition of inland waters in different geographical regions sagan et al 2020 balasubramanian et al 2020 it can be surmised from the past studies that in river and near river environments the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used as the reference for rs based tss estimation due to its inherent reflectance behavior of amplification in the presence of suspended solids at variable concentrations as these studies are limited to the specific ranges of tss found in static water bodies the developed algorithms may not perform well for rivers where tss concentrations vary substantially both spatially and temporally conversely the sediment dynamics in the rivers are completely different from that in the static water bodies such as the lake and lagoons further most of these studies have used modis satellite data due to its high temporal resolution of one day although the modis data based algorithms are also used for tss monitoring in the large width amazon river e g park and latrubesse 2014 fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 the low spatial 250 m resolution of this rs data limits its application in narrow width rivers even for the moderate width rivers as the river width is covered by only a few pixels and the individual pixels extend laterally across a large part of the total river width mertes and magadzire 2007 examining the transverse mixing is difficult with the modis data the landsat or sentinel 2 satellite images with finer spatial resolutions could address this issue but because of their lower temporal resolutions these images cannot be used directly for daily scale water quality assessment the various fusion algorithms viz spatio temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 swain and sahoo 2017a 2017b 2021 spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reflectance change staarch hilker et al 2009 enhanced spatio temporal adaptive fusion algorithm estarfm zhu et al 2010 flexible spatiotemporal data fusion fsdaf zhu et al 2016 and robust adaptive spatial and temporal fusion model rastfm zhao et al 2018 can be used for the trade off scenarios of temporal resolutions in modis and landsat satellites by generating the daily synthetic landsat images through the fusion of landsat and modis images in all these models the spatial information is abstracted from the finer resolution images and the temporal information is from the coarser resolution images starfm assumes that the changes in reflectance is consistent and comparable at finer and coarser resolutions although starfm performed well for homogenous landscapes it failed to capture the reflectance changes in heterogeneous landscapes song and huang 2012 to address this limitation staarch and estarfm were developed using the linear dependence between the finer and coarser resolution pixels for disturbed landscapes and heterogeneous landscapes respectively although staarch performs well in disturbed forest areas it failed in non forest areas sensitive to surface heterogeneity zhu et al 2010 and this issue is well addressed in the estarfm similarly the fsdaf hybrid model which was developed for addressing the problems of frequent cloud scenes in landsat images worked well for heterogeneous landscapes and failed to capture the land use spatial information over time as the model does not have the optimization module to handle the land cover changes guo et al 2020 among all these fusion algorithms estarfm is endorsed for a higher prediction accuracy with the modis and landsat images for the homogenous and heterogeneous pixels in the river and near river environments emelyanova et al 2013 jarihani et al 2014 sahoo et al 2020b moreover estarfm could also address the inter annual and inter seasonal changes of land use at the river and near river environments through the multiple numbers of base pair inputs in a year sahoo et al 2020b however the development of the tss and turbidity monitoring algorithms for a dynamic river system is still in the experimental stage with the uncertainties over the linear or nonlinear dependence between the reflectance and tss or turbidity albanakis 1990 baker and lavelle 1984 bhargava and mariam 1991 doxaran et al 2002 sagan et al 2020 as a result of these challenges the rs techniques for water quality monitoring in rivers and small width streams are still in infancy sahoo et al 2020b endorsed a copula based joint distribution to estimate the river streamflow using the near infrared nir band images to address the nonlinearity and randomness in reflectance datasets the copulas are the cumulative distribution functions that integrate the marginal distribution of any two or more random variables to obtain the joint probability distribution and the dependence structure of randomly distributed dependent variables nelsen 2006 the use of copula functions for developing joint distribution functions makes it distinct due to their ability to model the complete dependence structure with a few parameters pal et al 2017 capability to capture the nonlinearity and randomness between the random variables sahoo et al 2020b and ability to derive the joint distribution irrespective of the type of marginal distribution of the individual variables maity and kumar 2008 in addition the application of bivariate is mostly preferred due to its simplicity klein et al 2011 hence the effectiveness of the copula functions to retrieve the river water quality needs to be explored recently the emerged drone based water quality motoring has also been experimented with however upscaling these methods for the entire river reach is still a major challenge larson et al 2018 therefore this study has been framed to address the specific research questions namely i is it possible to develop a daily scale tss and turbidity estimation framework for a dynamic river reach that could address the trade offs between the spatial and temporal resolutions of available remote sensing images and ii how reliable would this framework be for its application in a narrow width urban waste dominated river i e the hooghly river and the brahmani river in this study characterized with the linear and nonlinear dynamism of the sediment concentrations for advancing the understanding of the potential of rs based methods for riverine tss and turbidity monitoring this study aims i to develop simple single band empirical algorithms for tss and turbidity estimation at coarser spatial 250 m and daily temporal scales in a dynamic river system using modis images hereafter termed as the modt model ii to develop tss and turbidity estimation algorithms at finer spatial 30 m and daily temporal scales using the real landsat and estarfm derived synthetic landsat images generated from the modis images henceforth termed as the fust model iii to develop a copula based joint probability distribution integrated with the fust model for estimating the tss and turbidity concentrations in the river at 30 m spatial and daily temporal scales hereafter termed as the cfust model and iv to identify the best model variant for tss and turbidity estimation 2 study area and remote sensing datasets 2 1 study area the hooghly river a tributary of the river ganges is located at the lowest stretch of the gangetic delta in the indian province of west bengal fig 1 the major stretch of the river is covered with high density urban agglomeration on both sides and serves as the primary source of surface water for the people living in the kolkata metropolitan city and the nearby urban areas in addition the river also provides a permanent source of surface water to west bengal for irrigation navigation boating and domestic and industrial water consumption throughout the year the river also receives wastewater from several municipal sewage canals and industrial effluent streams the west bengal pollution control board monitors the water quality on monthly basis using the conventional methods at a few locations along the river stretch as illustrated in fig 1 the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp model h adcp cm1200 based river width and bathymetry surveys carried out in the selected 40 km long river reach reveals that the river flow width varies from 168 4 m to 732 0 m the four years 2016 2019 timeseries of modis tile no h26v 06 and landsat imageries for the study area were downloaded from https reverb echo nasa gov reverb and https earthexplorer usgs gov respectively the aqua modis myd09gq version 6 product provided the atmospheric gas aerosols and rayleigh scattering corrected surface reflectance estimates at the spatiotemporal resolution of 250 m 1 day vermote 2011 the landsat oli operational land imager or landsat 8 collection 2 level 2 products at the spatiotemporal resolution of 30 m 16 days with the path and row numbers of 138 and 40 were used in this study respectively the surface reflectance of the landsat 8 collection 2 level 2 products were generated using the land surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 which were radiometrically and geometrically corrected the level 2 products were processed from the level 1 products which were generated by the united states geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros on demand processing system additionally in these products corrections for atmospheric aerosol ozone and water vapor concentrations were implemented pinto et al 2020 this study also used the landsat oli operational land imager or landsat 8 path 138 row 40 images with a finer spatiotemporal resolution of 30 m 16 days the surface reflectance product myd09gq tile no h26v 06 was used in this study the acquired images correspond to the local satellite passage time of 11 00 14 00 indian standard time ist equivalent to 5 30 8 30 greenwich standard time gst for calibrating and validating the developed rs based algorithms in this study periodical in situ water samplings were carried out to measure the tss concentrations and turbidity at fixed typical locations in the river as shown in figs 1 and 2 these sampling times coincide with the local satellite passage time of 11 00 14 00 ist with a 16 days interval matching the landsat revisit period as modis data is available daily in situ sampling schedule was framed as per the coincident passage time of both the satellites facilitating the reflectance response of the tss in between the coarser and the finer resolutions of the water pixels to avoid the hindrance of the riparian habitat reflectance sampling was carried out in the near mid reach of the river with the help of a boat from each grid location 500 ml of river water samples were collected using the wide mouthed polypropylene bottles which were brought to the laboratory for estimating the turbidity with the turbidity meter model hach 2100q for tss estimation the standard method 2540 d of american public health association apha 2017 rice et al 2017 was followed where the collected samples were properly filtered using the membrane nylon filter paper with the pore size diameter of 0 47 µm the filter paper along with the filtered suspended solids were kept in the hot air oven for 24 h at 104 5ºc commonly known as gravimetric analysis subsequently the dry weight of the collected sample was measured to obtain the tss in each sample note that the measured tss concentrations in the river during the local satellite passage times are the instantaneous value representing the daily information and not daily average information in practice the river engineers also measure the daily scale water quality parameters which are measured at a specific time and not the daily average value as discussed in section 3 the developed models were calibrated using three years 2016 2018 of observed datasets and validated using one year 2019 of observed datasets for estarfm the spectrally similar red band images of landsat 8 band 4 bandwidth 636 673 nm and aqua modis band 1 bandwidth 620 670 nm were used to generate synthetic landsat images for analysis the cloud contaminated images were excluded 3 methodology the developed methodology deals with the following concepts i the presence of suspended particles in river water increases the backscattering radiation which in turn increases the surface reflectance of the water body in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum e g kirk 1994 kilham and roberts 2011 ii the suspended solid concentration directly affects the turbidity of the water body thus tss can be used as a proxy for the turbidity in the river water wass et al 1997 rügner et al 2013 chawla et al 2020 sagan et al 2020 swain and sahoo 2021 iii the atmospheric noise associated with the remote sensing images could be normalized with the help of pixel ratios one for the water pixel and the other for the land pixel over an area of 50 km2 brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 sahoo et al 2020b 2022 embracing the aforementioned concepts the present study proposed three rs based algorithms for tss estimation along the river which were developed using i modis images modt model ii landsat and synthetic landsat images fust model and iii copula integrated fust model cfust the comprehensive methodological framework is illustrated in fig 3 3 1 development of aqua modis image based algorithm for tss estimation modt model for the development of the aqua modis based spectral model modt model the red band images that are influenced by the presence of suspended solids were used the reflectance registered in the red band at a particular pixel is a function of the concentration of the riverine suspended solids within that pixel the major concern for developing spectral relationships is to reduce the atmospheric noise associated with these surface reflectance values this problem can be addressed by considering the ratio of the surface reflectance of a water pixel s located at the predetermined sampling site in the river to a land pixel c located in the river riparian zone preferably in the urban area to avoid any water submergence tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 2019 2020 li et al 2019 shi et al 2020 sahoo et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2021 2022 following the s c pixel ratio concept the river reach was segmented into three rs based virtual monitoring stations vs as illustrated in fig 3 these virtual stations were fitted with three different box matrices each having a boundary area of 50 km2 let the land pixels present within the box matrix be denoted as c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn whereas the water pixels present at the river gaging section be denoted as s 1 s 2 and sm for example vs1 has two in situ sampling locations within the fitted box matrix namely palta s 1 and sreerampore s 2 surrounded with the c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn land pixels similarly the other sampling locations within the fitted box matrices of the vs2 and vs3 are illustrated in fig 4 the development of the modt model involves a image processing b checking for the cloud interference c identification of the best c pixel using correlation analysis d model calibration and e model validation the downloaded aqua modis images were processed in the arcgis environment with reprojection clipping the area of interest aoi and resampling to 30 m resolution so as to match with the resolution of landsat for fusion subsequently all the three box matrices were checked for their alignment along the river reach although the water samplings were carried out in non cloudy days the processed image pixels were checked for cloud and smog contaminations against a user defined reflectance threshold of r1 0 35 this user defined reflectance threshold was determined based on the pixel information during the non cloudy sampling days the red band reflectances of all the water pixels during the non cloudy in situ sampling days were analyzed and it was observed that all these reflectance values were less than 0 35 this type of threshold criterion was also adopted in several rs based studies chen et al 2009 park and latrubesse 2017 tarpanelli et al 2013 2020 fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 sahoo et al 2020b to remove the cloudy pixels from the analysis for identifying the best land pixel in a fitted box matrix all the land pixels c i within the box are used to estimate the s c i j timeseries where i denotes the location of the specific land pixel j denotes the sampling day and s is the fixed sampling water pixel subsequently this s c i j timeseries is correlated with the concurrent observed t s s j timeseries during the calibration period the land pixel within this box matrix for which the maximum correlation coefficient is obtained is considered as the best land pixel c b the fitted box matrix for each vs has the row column dimension of x y with a total of x y k number of c pixels where k represents the number of sampling pixels the images acquired on all the sampling days were processed which resulted in x y k t number of c pixels where t is the number of sampling days for brevity the model set up only for the vs1 is illustrated in fig 4 the fitted box matrix at vs1 has a total number of 2508 38 66 pixels with two s pixels from modis images and the rest are 2506 numbers of c pixels these c pixels were named as c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn whereas the water pixels at the river gaging section were denoted as s 1 and s 2 similarly with the sampling dates of d 1 d 2 d 3 and d t let the observed in situ tss concentrations at s 1 water pixel be represented as t s s s 1 d 1 t s s s 1 d 2 t s s s 1 d 3 and t s s s 1 d t respectively a similar approach was followed for the other two vss for correlation analysis using the correlation analysis the best common c pixel was obtained as c b with the maximum correlation coefficient among the time series of sampling pixels s 1 cb and s 2 cb and the corresponding observed tss concentrations although the pixel ratio normalizes the atmospheric noises the signals received by the satellite sensors are generally affected by the noise due to geometric misregistration anisotropic reflectance effects electronic errors and artefacts due to data resampling cai et al 2017 these short term and observational noises can be smoothened using the time sensitive recursive exponential smoothing tres filters stroud 1999 jönsson and eklundh 2002 cai et al 2017 since this study uses four years of time series data of normalized reflectances pixel ratios the tres filter was used to handle the effect of seasonal and interannual variability in the data stream albergel et al 2008 wagner et al 1999 tarpanelli et al 2013 sahoo et al 2020b 2022 the tres filter can be expressed as stroud 1999 1 s x c b t n 1 s x c b t n k t n 1 s x c b t n 1 s x c b t n where sx denotes the sampling pixels with the subscript x representing the sequence of sampling pixel number s 1 s 2 and s 3 s x c b t n 1 is the pixel ratio at tn 1 time step s x c b t n is the filtered pixel ratio at the previous tn time step and k is the gain factor ranging from 0 to 1 expressed as 2 k t n 1 k t n k t n e x p t n t n 1 t where t is the characteristic time length used to reduce the error associated with the alignment of sun and modis sensors considered the same as the local revisit cycle of 16 days of the modis sensor for initiating the filter k t 1 and s x c b t 1 were set as 1 the tres filter was applied to each pixel ratio viz s 1 cb and s 2 cb time series as derived from the modis images to obtain the corresponding filtered pixel ratios fpr time series s x c b m these fpr and the corresponding observed tss time series were used to develop the modt model coded with python 3 4 the detailed workflow of the model development is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 development of modis landsat fusion based enhanced algorithm for tss estimation fust model to enhance the spatial resolution of the modt model derived tss estimates the aqua modis m pixels of 250 m 1 day spatiotemporal resolution can suitably be fused with the corresponding landsat l pixels of 30 m 16 days resolution by the estarfm algorithm zhu et al 2010 generating synthetic landsat sl pixels of 30 m 1 day resolution understanding the potential of estarfm for the river and near river environments with mixed land uses emelyanova et al 2013 jarihani et al 2014 sahoo et al 2020b this fusion model was chosen over the other models subsequently following the same framework as the modt model these synthetic landsat pixels can be used to develop the enhanced tss estimation algorithm named as the fust model the fusion algorithm can be used in the case of two spectrally similar pixels one from the finer resolution landsat and the other from the coarser resolution modis images with proper radiometric calibration and geometric rectification at any given time and location gao et al 2006 roy et al 2008 hilker et al 2009 generally the satellite signals of the water pixels adjacent to the land pixels are always contaminated by the surface reflectance generated from the nearby lands santer and schmeching 2000 sterckx et al 2010 2015 for addressing the issue of land adjacency effect in the red band wavelength region one pixel near to the river boundary can be removed as advocated by feng et al 2012 and hou et al 2017 before applying the estarfm the estarfm was set up based on this concept for the homogenous and heterogeneous pixels in the modis and landsat images following the principle of collinearity the homogenous pixels in these images were chosen considering their land use characteristics viz urban or water pixels subsequently the surface reflectance of the synthetic landsat pixel sl for the i th sampling location at a prediction time t p was determined by comparing the concurrent aqua modis and landsat pixels at a base time t o for the coincident location as zhu et al 2010 3 s l i t p l i t o a m i t p m i t o where m i t o and l i t o are the surface reflectances of the concurrent aqua modis and landsat pixels at the i th location during the t o base time respectively m i t p and s l i t p are the surface reflectances of the aqua modis and synthetic landsat pixels at the same i th location during the prediction time t p respectively and a is the coefficient of relative calibration between the aqua modis and landsat images the presence of multiple land cover types within a single pixel of the aqua modis image and the sudden land use change during the times t o to t p is recognized as a heterogeneous pixel in these cases the estrafm algorithm relies on the weightage function α gao et al 2006 and the conversion coefficient ɸ adams et al 1985 the application of these functions depends on i the surface reflectance values of modis landsat pairs during the base time t o ii the surface reflectances of modis images in between t o and t p iii identification of spectrally similar pixels using a moving window and iv euclidian spatial distance between the central and neighbouring pixels the governing equation for deriving the synthetic landsat reflectance can be expressed as zhu et al 2010 4 s l x 0 5 w y 0 5 w t p r e d l x 0 5 w y 0 5 w t o r e d i 1 n α i ϕ i m x i y i t p r e d m x i y i t o r e d where sl is the reflectance of the synthetic landsat image on the t p day l is the reflectance of the landsat image of the base period t o m is the reflectance of the aqua modis images having a consistent spatial resolution red is the selected spectral band x i y i is the geographical coordinate of each similar pixel x 0 5 w y 0 5 w is the geographical coordinate of the center pixel in the moving window of length w n is the total number of similar pixels within the moving window ɸ is the conversion coefficient of these similar pixels and α is the weightage function which is derived from the weight of the ith similar pixel contributing to the center pixel in a moving window the estarfm algorithm was established using two cloud free modis landsat concurrent pairs called the base pairs this study involved four years of daily timeseries data of real synthetic landsat images each year two sets of base pair images namely pair i and pair ii available exactly on the in situ water quality sampling days were used to set up the estarfm algorithm as given in table 1 subsequently the concurrent synthetic landsat images were generated for the study period 2016 2019 as the in situ samplings were carried out on the concurrent modis landsat satellite passing days the fust model setup involved the combination of both the real and synthetic landsat images based on their availability then a box matrix similar to the case of the modt model was fitted for each virtual station to obtain the downscaled finer 30 m water pixels of the landsat s s l and the land pixels of synthetic landsat c s l images subsequently correlation analysis was carried out between the observed tss time series and the corresponding s c s l pixel ratio timeseries to obtain the best c pixel namely c b s l tres filter was applied on s c b s l timeseries to get the best filtered pixel ratio timeseries denoted as s c b s l after that using the s c b s l t s s datasets the modis landsat fusion fust model was set up as illustrated in fig 3 3 3 development of copula based enhanced nonlinear algorithm for tss estimation cfust model the modt and fust models developed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 are based on the linear association between s c b and observed tss concentration timeseries however this association between these variables could be nonlinear at times especially for the dynamic river systems with unsteady flow conditions and the pearson correlation coefficient may not capture the exact dependence structure therefore a copula function was integrated with the fust model to address the randomness and nonlinearity in the tss dynamics at 30 m 1 day spatiotemporal scale and this enhanced algorithm is named as the cfust model this cfust model was set up using the joint probability distribution between the filtered synthetic landsat pixel ratios s c b s l and the corresponding total suspended concentration t s s time series following sklar s theorem the bivariate copula joint probability distribution can be established as sklar 1959 5 f x y x y c θ f x x f y y c θ u v where f x y x y is the joint cumulative distribution function c θ is the copula function with the parameter θ u f x x and v f y y are the marginal distributions of random variables x and y respectively for the continuous marginal distribution of u and v the copula function c θ can be established as 6 c θ u v f x y f x 1 u f y 1 v adopting the concept of the copula development the cfust model is based on the paired variables s c b s l t s s at a time to derive the joint distribution function f s c b s l t s s as 7 f s c b s l t s s c θ f s c b s l f t s s where f s c b s l and f t s s are the continuous and cumulative distribution function cdf of s c b s l and tss respectively and c θ is the copula function the archimedean copulas were adopted herein for the tss estimation along the dynamic hooghly river reach as these are proven for their better efficiency in various field applications with better simplicity and flexibility e g daneshkhah et al 2016 pal et al 2017 sahoo et al 2020b for fitting the archimedean copulas the association and dependence structure between the filtered pixel ratios s c b s l and tss was measured using kendall s tau τ estimated using the concordance and discordance pair of s c b s l t s s as 8 τ c f u s t p s c b s l t s c b s l t t s s t t s s t 0 p s c b s l t s c b s l t t s s t t s s t 0 where p is the pair function of s c b s l t s s pair at any two time steps with t t and τ ϵ 1 1 0 subsequently for the bivariate copula function the dependence parameter θ was calculated using the τ value favre et al 2004 which was further used for formulating the archimedean copulas after obtaining both the essential parameters i e τ and θ for the copula formation the archimedean copula family followed a unique mathematical property for continuous random variables in the form of a generator function e g zhang and singh 2006 given by 9 c c f u s t s c b s l t s s φ 1 φ s c b s l φ t s s where φ k is the generator function k is the dummy variable for the pair s c b s l t s s and φ 1 k is the pseudo inverse function of φ k given as 10 φ 1 k φ 1 k 0 k φ 0 0 φ 0 k further with the help of the obtained parameters for the archimedean copula family the clayton frank ali mikhail haq amh and gumble hougaard gh copulas were formulated as described in table 2 all the above mentioned copula functions were formulated and coded in matlab version 2016a using the mvcat toolbox and subsequently parameterized using the observed tss and corresponding s c b s l timeseries for the period of 2016 2018 to obtain the best fit copula for this study the performances of the formulated copulas were evaluated using three criteria as advocated by sadegh et al 2017 i lowest bayesian information criteria bic vrieze 2012 suman et al 2021 ii lowest root mean square error rmse dey et al 2022 and iii lowest alkaike s information criterion aic alkaike 1974 vrieze 2012 the aic and bic are given as 11 a i c 2 k 2 0 5 n log m s e 12 b i c k l n n 2 0 5 n log m s e where n number of observation points k number of model parameters mse mean square error and 0 5 n log m s e log likelihood function the best identified copula with the fust model was used in the enhanced cfust model for estimating the tss concentrations at finer spatiotemporal scale 3 4 development of turbidity estimation algorithm the turbidity algorithm s development relies on the basic principle that the suspended sediment concentration directly correlates with the turbidity of the river hence the modt fust and cfust model derived tss concentrations at any river water pixel along with the coincident in situ turbidity observations were used to establish the regression equations of the three proposed models for tss estimations in the river the best performing tss model was used as the base model for the turbidity estimation 3 5 evaluation of model performance all the developed algorithms for tss and turbidity estimation were tested using the performance measures of root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean absolute relative error mare coefficient of determination r 2 percentage

variant was selected based on the maximum determination efficiency measured by the maximum r2 estimate and minimum bias measured by the minimum rmse and mae estimates 4 results for daily scale tss estimation in the selected hooghly river reach using the satellite data it was observed that a poor correlation pearson coefficient r of 0 33 0 49 exists between the red band reflectance of the aqua modis images and the in situ tss observations at the five monitoring locations the highest r 0 49 being obtained at dakshineswar this reveals that unlike the static water bodies a direct relationship between the satellite data and tss would have been less effective for dynamic water bodies which was addressed in this study by developing the pixel ratio based modt fust and cfust model variants the core structure of the fust and cfust models depend on the performance of the estarfm while generating the synthetic landsat images in this case the accuracy of the fused 30 m synthetic landsat datasets was evaluated against the real landsat reflectances on some typical landsat passing dates for both the land and water this evaluation was carried out based on the structural similarity ssim index a visual interpretation approach rmse and correlation coefficients for the water pixels r w and land pixels r l the structural similarity between the real and synthetic landsat images is expressed as wang et al 2004 18 s s i m 2 μ r μ s j 1 2 σ r s j 2 μ r 2 μ s 2 j 1 σ s σ r j 2 where μ r and μ s are the means and σ r and σ s are the variances of real landsat and fused 30 m images respectively σ rs is the covariance of the real landsat and fused 30 m pairs and j 1 and j 2 are the constants 0 0001 to stabilize the denominator of eq 18 when it tends to zero an ssim estimate closer to 1 shows more similarity between the real landsat and fused 30 m images it can be envisaged from table 3 showing the accuracy evaluation measures of the fused synthetic landsat images for all the virtual stations that the ranges of rmse ssim r l and r w estimates are 0 011 0 026 sr 1 mean 0 016 sr 1 0 890 0 950 mean 0 924 0 900 0 980 mean 0 931 and 0 850 0 940 mean 0 885 respectively these results reveal that the estarfm can be successfully used for water quality inversion studies dealing with the fust model fig 5 illustrates the extent of noise reduction in the modis and landsat pixel ratios by the tres filter at palta dakshineswar and shivpur virtual stations as compared to the non filtered ratios this has resulted in enhanced correlations from 0 62 0 57 0 68 0 56 and 0 58 to 0 73 0 69 0 81 0 64 and 0 67 between the observed tss concentrations and the filtered pixel ratios at palta sreerampur dakshineswar shivpur and garden reach sampling stations respectively the best reference land pixel cb locations for all the virtual stations were found in the urban paved area present within the box matrix see fig s1 supplementary data generally the performance of the existing atmospheric correction ac algorithms varies significantly over the regions for which one cannot rely on a particular ac algorithm moses et al 2017 therefore before implementing the tres filter for water color inversion studies its performance was evaluated against the other existing ac algorithms specially designed for waters viz seadas l2gen provided by 9 5 0 v2019 3 git clone dated 2020 07 28 snap c2rcc ensembled in snap 7 0 and acolite designed by vanhellemont and ruddick 2018 with the absence of in situ spectral measurements the reflectance derived from these aforementioned ac algorithms were utilized as the reference reflectance for performance evaluation of tres therefore several experiments were carried out at the three vs along the hooghly river where comparative assessment of the ac algorithms was conducted using the real landsat images during these experiments the aforementioned ac algorithms were first applied on the real landsat images subsequently the corrected pixel reflectances of the red band images were extracted fig 6 illustrates the comparative performance of the tres filter while conducting the exercise over the three virtual stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 the results reveal that the tres derived pixel ratios were highly correlated with the acolite derived pixel ratios with the correlation coefficients r of 0 97 0 89 and 0 87 for vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively similarly as illustrated in the scattered plots in fig 6 the tres derived pixel ratios well correlate with the seadas l2gen r 0 86 followed by cr2cc derived pixel ratios r 0 78 at 95 confidence interval thus availing the reminiscent behavior of the tres with other existing ac algorithms the tres based filtered signals could be used for further analysis hence using the filtered signals the proposed models were calibrated for three years 2016 2019 and validated for one year 2019 of observed data as detailed in table 4 4 1 performance of modt model for estimating riverine tss concentrations using the calibration datasets in the framework of the modt model refer fig 5 the following three sets of regression equations were developed for the rs based virtual monitoring stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 as 19 t s s 130 14 s c b m 33 94 f o r v s 1 95 7 s c b m 24 88 f o r v s 2 118 51 s c b m 9 90 f o r v s 3 the observed in situ tss concentrations and the modt model estimated tss timeseries and scatter plots at all the virtual stations are shown in fig 7 the results illustrated in fig 8 reveal that the modt model could estimate the tss concentrations with the rmse estimate of 42 8 49 85 mg l nrmse of 0 14 0 15 mare of 0 33 0 35 and r2 of 0 65 0 72 with the best performance in the vs2 with the rmse mare r2 and mae estimates of 42 8 mg l 0 33 0 78 and 0 43 respectively 4 2 performance evaluation of the fust model for estimating riverine tss concentrations using the calibration datasets in the framework of the fust model the following sets of regression equations were developed for the rs based virtual monitoring stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 as 20 t s s 101 05 s c b s l 4 43 f o r v s 1 104 70 s c b s l 25 77 f o r v s 2 104 20 s c b s l 1 09 f o r v s 3 the number of real and synthetic landsat images used to develop the fust model and the number of training n c and testing n t datasets are given in table 4 fig 7 also illustrates the derivation of discrete in situ observed tss concentrations by the fust model during the validation period at all the five sampling stations along the hooghly river reach which is also shown in the form of scatter plots a comparative analysis between the modt and fust models reveals that the later model performed better with the lower rmse estimates of 20 mg l 27 mg l and 23 5 mg l and higher r2 estimates of 0 86 0 89 and 0 85 for the vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively 4 3 performance evaluation of the cfust model for estimating riverine tss concentrations the cfust model was upgraded from the fust model which is based on the correlation established with a suitable copula function against the linear regression in the fust model following the procedure discussed in section 3 3 the dependence parameter θ was computed as 10 1 12 23 and 9 25 for vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively while the corresponding kendal s τ was computed as 0 78 0 89 and 0 82 respectively among the archimedean copula functions tested herein the frank copula outperformed the other three copula functions based on the lowest rmse along with aic and bic rankings for all the three virtual stations see table 5 fig 7 illustrates the best derivation of the discrete in situ observed tss concentrations by the frank copula based cfust model compared to the modt and fust model variants during the validation period at all the five sampling stations which is also shown in the form of scatter plots the best fit frank copula based cfust model as developed herein can be expressed as 21 c c f u s t s c b s l t s s f r a n k 1 10 1 l n 1 exp

o r v s 3 for testing the supremacy of the developed cfust model framework the performance of this model was again compared with some existing tss prediction algorithms as given in table 6 for this comparative analysis the existing algorithms were selected on the basis of i bands used for formulation exclusively used red and nir bands and ii nature of the algorithms prioritized empirical algorithms for establishing the empirical algorithms in the hooghly river the prescribed methodologies in the literature were followed and model coefficients were adjusted accordingly the comparative results presented in table 6 reveal that the cfust model outperformed all the existing models for tss estimation that utilizes the red band as the reference in the river environment further for testing the portability of the comparative assessment of tres filter with the exiting atmospheric correction algorithms for simulating the real landsat images framework this model was also applied for tss estimation in the brahmani river in eastern india wherein this model was calibrated for three years 2015 2017 and validated for one year 2018 datasets the four years 2015 2018 of in situ tss datasets in the brahmani river was procured from the state pollution control board scpb odisha the results as illustrated in fig 9 reveal that the proposed cfust model performed very well in reproducing the observed discrete tss concentrations at talcher s1 and talcher s2 sampling stations on the brahmani river with the estimates of r2 0 88 mare 0 12 mae 0 19 and nrmse 0 09 4 4 accuracy assessment of the cfust model for deriving the turbidity the developed cfust model performed the best for tss estimation and it was used as the base model for corresponding turbidity estimation at the all three vss for this linear regression relationships were established between the in situ observations of tss and turbidity over the period 2016 2018 calibration at the three vss as illustrated in fig 10 subsequently the turbidity tu levels at 30 m 1 day spatiotemporal resolution corresponding to the cfust model estimated tss concentrations along the selected river reach were estimated as 22 t u 0 8998 1 10 1 l n 1 exp 10 1 s c b s l 1 exp 10 1 t s s 1 e x p 10 1 1 2 9966 f o r v s 1 0 895 1 12 23 l n 1 exp 12 23 s c b s l 1 exp 12 23 t s s 1 e x p 12 23 1 9 9751 f o r v s 2 0 7874 1 9 5 l

three vss illustrated in the form of scatter plots in fig 10 the performance measures given inset of fig 10d 10e reveal that eq 22 could provide reliable turbidity estimates corresponding to the rs based cfust model simulated tss concentrations at the three virtual monitoring stations along the hooghly river reach for addressing the issue of land adjacency effect in the red band wavelength region one pixel near to the river boundary was removed before simulating the cfust model for tss and the cfustu model for turbidity mapping along the hooghly river as advocated by feng et al 2012 and hou et al 2017 following this principle the spatiotemporal variability of the tss and turbidity were derived along the hooghly river as illustrated in fig 11 5 discussion in light of the aforementioned findings the study provides reliable framework to develop semi empirical models to monitor the tss and turbidity along the dynamic river system using the public domain satellite datasets in this regard the proposed pixel ratio based semi empirical model used the red band spectral reflectance of aqua modis is proven for its best correlation with the tss concentrations for which it is used directly or in combination with the nir band reflectance to map the tss in the static lakes as well as dynamic river systems e g miller and mckee 2004 shi and wang 2009 kilham and roberts 2011 espinoza villar et al 2012 r 2013 son and wang 2012 park and latrubesse 2014 as proposed by tarpanelli et al 2013 the fitted box matrix covering an area of 50 km2 along the river and near river environments is based on the homogeneity principle pertaining to the atmospheric noise contamination of the pixels within that area the same principle has also been adopted in several past studies for normalizing the atmospheric noises at the dynamic water pixel brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 li et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020b with reference to the identified relatively static land pixel c b within the area of 50 km2 that means the land pixel c b and the model parameters estimated for a specific river section are also applicable within the fitted box matrix of 50 km2 area covering about 10 12 km long river reach even in hydrometry the conventional discharge or flow depth estimation approaches using the rating curves are river section specific which is due to the change in the shape of the cross section and manning s roughness coefficient perumal et al 2007 sahoo et al 2014 therefore to ensure the consistency of the estimation results one has to fix a number of adjacent box matrices of area of 50 km2 at each 10 12 km interval along the river reach similarly while simulating the developed model along the river the consistency between two adjacent sections could be ensured by using two approaches i with more finer scale in situ samplings along the river box matrices can be fixed in a moving window concept such that two adjacent sections could be covered adequately without any boundary issue and ii with finer scale in situ samplings another box matrix centering the boundary of two adjacent box matrices can be overlapped using a moving window concept the study also demonstrated the above mentioned box matrix approach using three virtual stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 along the hooghly river the proposed framework dealing with the single band pixel ratio along with box matrix has also proven its reliability for streamflow estimation along several world rivers using the public domain satellite datasets as investigated by several researchers brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 li et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020b further the performance of the tres was evaluated with the other existing atmospheric correction ac algorithms while implementing the single band pixel ratio method and reminiscent behavior was also observed notwithstanding these findings many ac algorithms in the literature have been tested in coastal inland waters worldwide for instance vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 evaluated the performance of l2 wfr polymer cr2cc seadas l2gen and acolite algorithms using sentinel 3 olci in belgium coastal waters and found that acolite is the best ac algorithms while comparing with the in situ spectrometer observations and for deriving the turbidity and chlorophyll a using semi analytical algorithms similarly the study conducted by windle et al 2022 claimed that c2rcc is the best suitable algorithm for tss and turbidity retrieval in chesapeake bay while comparing the polymor seadas l2gen and cr2cc ac algorithms following the findings by several authors e g mograne et al 2019 gossn et al 2019 pereira sandoval et al 2019 renosh et al 2020 giannini et al 2021 the general conclusion we can get that the performance of ac algorithms varies significantly over the regions precisely till now there is no standardized ac algorithm prescribed for inland water especially for the olci products availing the reminiscent behavior of the tres with other existing ac algorithms the tres could be utilized for daily tss estimation at the hooghly river reach as demonstrated in this study however observations of this study also advocate the findings of kuhn et al 2019 while examining ac algorithms over amazon and mississippi river reaches that more rigorous analysis with the in situ spectral measurement will be needed to prescribe the standardized ac algorithm for any typical river section which will be our future investigation moreover tss mapping using the modis images although effective and preferable on the wide river floodplains like the amazon river fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 the 250 m coarser resolution of the aqua modis images limits its application in narrower river stretches as considered in this study in these narrow rivers it fails to capture the spatial heterogeneity resulting in poor model performance further the heterogeneous pixels at this lower spatial resolution results in high background noise levels the modt model uses the filtered pixel ratio s c b m of the aqua modis red band reflectance to reduce the background noise normalizing the heterogeneity in water pixels with a best correlating land pixel in this study the best correlating land pixel was observed to be the paved surfaces for all the three vss indicating that a homogeneously paved surface reflectance could be the best fit for normalizing the water pixel reflectance although the modt model was able to estimate the daily scale tss with reasonable accuracy r2 0 65 0 77 the model was further improved by the fust model using the finer 30 m resolution of the landsat modis fusion images with r2 0 85 0 89 this improvement of the fust model could be attributed to the derived 30 m resolution s c b s l signals in this study however as landsat data is limited to a 16 days temporal resolution its direct use in the earlier studies e g wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 montanher et al 2014 herrault et al 2016 could not the achieve the objective of estimating the riverine tss concentration at daily scale additionally the fust model could be implemented along the braided river reach for tss estimation even during the low flows due to the finer spatial resolutions of the derived synthetic landsat datasets adopting the prescribed framework and sampling protocols in the dynamic river systems the fust model can further be improved using the advantage of recent launch of landsat 9 satellite in the year 2022 so that an eight days window can be considered between the landsat 8 and 9 image pairs during the fusion to address the effects of nonlinearity and randomness in the used datasets in the dynamic river water characterized with the unsteady flow further integration of the frank copula function with the fust model could enhance the cfust model performance with the average rmse and r2 estimates of 20 82 mg l and 0 93 respectively the study conducted by isidro et al 2018 demonstrated the idea of the tss and turbidity mapping in small width rivers using the commercial satellite images from rapideye spot 6 and pleiades 1a conversely the present study addresses this issue using the public domain modis and landsat satellite images with virtually no cost furthermore although some recent studies have used the sentinel 2 satellite images to estimate the tss concentrations in the small rivers and inland waters e g toming et al 2016 pahlevan et al 2017 2019 saberioon et al 2020 these methods could not be used to derive tss at daily scale and also limits their applicability to retrieve the historical record of tss concentration due to the late lunch of sentinel 2 in the year 2015 note that retrieval of the historical tss record could also be an essential input to study the spatiotemporal variability of the river pollutants as demonstrated with the ten years of modis data in the amazon river by park and latrubesse 2014 as envisaged from the results the proposed cfust model could be used to estimate the historical and real time mapping of tss and turbidity with better accuracy even in the smaller width unsteady dynamic river systems similarly as the proposed framework encapsulates the semi empirical models the site specific calibration of the models is essential before implementing in any other river section which is also an inherent characteristic of empirical models sagan et al 2020 peterson et al 2018 biswal et al 2018 however the developed models have certain limitations during the cloudy days in monsoon season as the prediction highly relied on the passive rs data the integration of microwave remote sensing to the proposed models could address these limitations which is a future research plan 5 conclusions for high frequent mapping of the total suspended solids and turbidity using rs images along a narrow transverse stretch of the dynamic river reach subjected to the continuous effects of urban wastes in the form of lateral flows this study developed three model variants these progressively enhanced models for daily scale tss estimation are the 250 m spatial resolution aqua modis based modt model 30 m spatial resolution synthetic landsat based fust model and further improvised cfust model that uses the frank copula function integrated fust model based on this study the following specific conclusions could be drawn 1 the better performance of the fust model over the modt model reveals that the finer spatial resolution of satellite images is always preferable for remote sensing based tss estimation in dynamic river systems 2 the nonlinear frank copula based algorithm for correlating the spectral property with the tss could further enhance the tss prediction with the cfust model compared to the linear regression based fust model this reveals that frank copula could better describe the tss spectral reflectance dynamics in rivers than the conventionally used linear functions 3 following the advocated approach in this study remote sensing based virtual tss and turbidity monitoring stations could easily be set up in the desired river reaches for real time mapping for near no cost involvement through initial training of the model with limited discrete in situ observations therefore the advocated cfust model could be used in an operational mode for many world rivers with scanty in situ observations of tss and turbidity moreover the proposed framework can also be implemented and standardized for tss and turbidity estimations in other world rivers with the support of in situ spectral measurements which will be our future investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

15525,riverine ecosystem management along an urban stretch mostly depends on high frequent daily scale monitoring of water quality at finer spatial resolutions however with the decrease in the number of in situ monitoring stations owing to their expensive maintenance cost there is a need to develop the next generation remote sensing rs tools as an alternate approach with better synoptic coverage of river water quality assessment this study advocates three novel model variants to estimate the total suspended solids tss concentration at daily scale using the public domain modis and landsat satellite datasets the modt model variant uses the 1 day 250 m modis public domain datasets and the fust model is based on the 1 day 30 m modis landsat fusion datasets whereas the cfust model integrates the frank copula with the fust model these hierarchical model variants are assessed in the urban waste dominated lower ganges namely the hooghly river and the brahmani river in eastern india using the measured in situ tss datasets at multiple monitoring stations from 2016 to 2019 the results reveal that the cfust is the best tss estimation model variant that performs with the average coefficient of determination of 0 88 0 93 mean absolute error of 0 17 0 19 and normal root mean square error of 0 05 0 09 conclusively the proposed cfust and cfustu stochastic models can be used as potential tools for tss and turbidity assessment along the dynamic river systems respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords frank copula fusion landsat modis suspended solids turbidity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the ever degrading water quality in many rivers worldwide attributed to the interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors rutledge and chow fraser 2019 wu and lu 2021 its monitoring at finer spatiotemporal intervals is very important for basin scale water management for instance the river ganges the largest river in india in terms of the catchment area and utilizable surface water potential is one such river that has attracted substantial efforts for its rejuvenation the ganges pass through the highly industrialized and urbanized floodplains having 764 industries in the main stem generating nearly 501 million litres per day mld of wastewater misra 2011 nmcg 2016 over 200 million dollars are earmarked annually by the government of india for the namami gange programme through the national mission for clean ganga nmcg similar water quality scenarios are also available in many world rivers the monitoring of river water quality through traditional means is time consuming and expensive however sufficient and detailed water quality data at varied spatial and temporal scales is necessary to monitor river health furthermore the total suspended solids tss present in the river water has been recognized as the prime suspect for the transport of various pollutants such as pharmaceuticals boulard et al 2020 and heavy metals swain and sahoo 2017a 2017b 2021 in addition the suspended sediments obstruct the transmission of light in the water leading to turbidity which alters the nutrient concentration with reduced dissolved oxygen he et al 2017 tss is also used in sediment flux and transport applications peterson et al 2018 therefore monitoring tss and the associated turbidity is critical for analyzing the river dynamics and quantifying the tss distribution along the river reach should be an essential part of the pollution monitoring in the world rivers generally laboratory analysis and digital in situ sensing based methods are the widely adopted methods for water quality assessment these popular methods are highly reliable for any water quality model development however these approaches have limited applications in the river systems due to tediousness in careful sampling the requirement of high cost sensing devices and or laboratory facilities potential changes in the water quality parameters during transportation and storage need for sufficient technical expertise difficulty in sampling from remote areas especially during high flood events time consuming methods and high cost involvement these challenges coupled with an expensive maintenance cost have led to declining river water quality monitoring stations worldwide bende michl et al 2011 swain and sahoo 2017b furthermore conventional sampling techniques often fail to characterize the pollutant dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales along the river this has led the scientific community to explore alternatives and remote sensing rs based methods have appeared promising for monitoring water quality especially for the inland waters lakes and estuaries the rs based methods have proven their efficiency in characterizing the optical and bio optical properties of the inland waters and the associated water quality parameters such as tss turbidity and chlorophyll content mishra and mishra 2012 mishra et al 2013 dogliotti et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 these techniques are also popular for monitoring water quality at varying spatial and temporal scales with no physical sampling and cumbersome laboratory analysis requirements ritchie et al 2003 these rs based algorithms use the satellite remote sensing products of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and landsat tm etm etm miller and mckee 2004 nechad et al 2009 over the last decade several rs based models were proposed to retrieve tss information in inland waters and these models are broadly categorized as i analytical bio optical and ii empirical both of these models used the rs reflectance rrs λ acquired by the satellites at several wavelengths available in the form of a single band or combination of bands the aforementioned classification was done based on the algorithm s formulation accompanied by the governing principle for instance the bio optical modeling approach was also considered as the analytical model which primarily solves the radiative transfer equation to estimate the optically active constituents oac such as tss bernardo et al 2019 sagan et al 2020 with the implementations of the radiative transfer equation the oac of the water columns was derived from the water leaving radiance during this process the tss was derived from two specific parameters i using particulate absorption coefficient a p babin et al 2003 zheng and digiacomo 2017 by estimating mass specific particulate absorption a p and ii using the backscattering b b p volpe et al 2011 woźniak et al 2010 by computing backscattering coefficients b b p interestingly all these models parameters a p and b b p could be computed using the inversion models viz quasi analytical algorithm qaa lee et al 2002 mishra et al 2013 and generalized ocean color inversion model werdell et al 2013 furthermore the past studies e g shanmugam et al 2010 zheng and digiacomo 2017 also claimed that the inversion models are less accurate to compute b b p at high turbid regions especially over the coastal areas several research investigations also reported that the presence of phytoplankton influences b b p at 600 nm λ 800 nm binding et al 2010 shi et al 2018 therefore the tss estimation models developed in the absence of phytoplankton concentration may not be suitable for the region highly affected by phytoplankton and vice versa balasubramanian et al 2020 therefore implementation of these models for tss estimation needs comprehensive spectral information of the oac in inland waters which demands high cost and time involvement similarly the empirical models for tss estimation were developed using the statistical relationship between the in situ tss observations and the reflectance of the bands acquired by the satellite sensors a unique potential to the empirical models is that there is no need for the prior understanding of the often complex water and light interactions as in the case of semi analytical models which make the empirical models desirable for effective and easy implementation sagan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 among these empirical models few models were developed based on the prior information and behavior of the oac at the certain bands acquired at a specific wavelength thus these models were considered semi empirical models ogashawara et al 2017 for instance the presence of suspended sediments in the water bodies is known to amplify the spectral reflectance and this phenomenon is more pronounced in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum ritchie et al 1976 ritchie and cooper 1988 feng et al 2012 dogliotti et al 2015 shi et al 2015 based on these properties the rs based semi empirical models have been developed for tss and turbidity estimation in static water bodies viz lakes estuaries reservoirs and lagoons cao et al 2017 he et al 2013 among the empirical approaches of rs applications in static water bodies using landsat images ouillon et al 2004 used linear regression analysis whereas ondrusek et al 2012 and kumar et al 2016 used higher order polynomials to estimate tss concentrations miller and mckee 2004 also estimated tss in the mississippi river delta for tss estimation the meris satellite based red band was used by shi et al 2014 in static water bodies and wu et al 2013 also employed the red band λ 645 nm of modis to retrieve tss information in a lake similarly for tss retrieval in inland waters many previous studies were also used modis red band to execute linear e g miller and mckee 2004 sipelgas et al 2006 liu and rossiter 2008 ondrusek et al 2012 exponential e g zhao et al 2011 jiang and liu 2011 shi et al 2015 polynomial e g cui et al 2013 and cubic e g wu et al 2013 models these studies emphasize for using the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum for enhanced accuracy in the rs based tss estimation conversely near infrared nir based single band studies han et al 2016 suggested that it fails to capture the low to moderate tss concentration due to water absorption properties tarpanelli et al 2013 sahoo et al 2020b 2021 2022 and negligible contribution of particulate backscattering in this spectral region doxaran et al 2012 balasubramanian et al 2020 due to these reasons the nir based single band studies for tss estimation have limited applications in river systems where tss is substantially varied throughout the reach due to dynamic flow conditions and rapid mixing that result in low tss concentrations at many river sections as an improvement over these single band based studies a few studies were designed to consider the ratio of red and nir bands of modis e g hu et al 2004 tarrant et al 2010 however these models are more suitable for chlorophyll assessment in optically complex waters exclusively in coastal areas and estuaries moses et al 2009 as phytoplankton growth in the water bodies may impact the rs based model hannouche et al 2017 all these empirical models need recalibration while setting up for any given condition of inland waters in different geographical regions sagan et al 2020 balasubramanian et al 2020 it can be surmised from the past studies that in river and near river environments the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used as the reference for rs based tss estimation due to its inherent reflectance behavior of amplification in the presence of suspended solids at variable concentrations as these studies are limited to the specific ranges of tss found in static water bodies the developed algorithms may not perform well for rivers where tss concentrations vary substantially both spatially and temporally conversely the sediment dynamics in the rivers are completely different from that in the static water bodies such as the lake and lagoons further most of these studies have used modis satellite data due to its high temporal resolution of one day although the modis data based algorithms are also used for tss monitoring in the large width amazon river e g park and latrubesse 2014 fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 the low spatial 250 m resolution of this rs data limits its application in narrow width rivers even for the moderate width rivers as the river width is covered by only a few pixels and the individual pixels extend laterally across a large part of the total river width mertes and magadzire 2007 examining the transverse mixing is difficult with the modis data the landsat or sentinel 2 satellite images with finer spatial resolutions could address this issue but because of their lower temporal resolutions these images cannot be used directly for daily scale water quality assessment the various fusion algorithms viz spatio temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 swain and sahoo 2017a 2017b 2021 spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reflectance change staarch hilker et al 2009 enhanced spatio temporal adaptive fusion algorithm estarfm zhu et al 2010 flexible spatiotemporal data fusion fsdaf zhu et al 2016 and robust adaptive spatial and temporal fusion model rastfm zhao et al 2018 can be used for the trade off scenarios of temporal resolutions in modis and landsat satellites by generating the daily synthetic landsat images through the fusion of landsat and modis images in all these models the spatial information is abstracted from the finer resolution images and the temporal information is from the coarser resolution images starfm assumes that the changes in reflectance is consistent and comparable at finer and coarser resolutions although starfm performed well for homogenous landscapes it failed to capture the reflectance changes in heterogeneous landscapes song and huang 2012 to address this limitation staarch and estarfm were developed using the linear dependence between the finer and coarser resolution pixels for disturbed landscapes and heterogeneous landscapes respectively although staarch performs well in disturbed forest areas it failed in non forest areas sensitive to surface heterogeneity zhu et al 2010 and this issue is well addressed in the estarfm similarly the fsdaf hybrid model which was developed for addressing the problems of frequent cloud scenes in landsat images worked well for heterogeneous landscapes and failed to capture the land use spatial information over time as the model does not have the optimization module to handle the land cover changes guo et al 2020 among all these fusion algorithms estarfm is endorsed for a higher prediction accuracy with the modis and landsat images for the homogenous and heterogeneous pixels in the river and near river environments emelyanova et al 2013 jarihani et al 2014 sahoo et al 2020b moreover estarfm could also address the inter annual and inter seasonal changes of land use at the river and near river environments through the multiple numbers of base pair inputs in a year sahoo et al 2020b however the development of the tss and turbidity monitoring algorithms for a dynamic river system is still in the experimental stage with the uncertainties over the linear or nonlinear dependence between the reflectance and tss or turbidity albanakis 1990 baker and lavelle 1984 bhargava and mariam 1991 doxaran et al 2002 sagan et al 2020 as a result of these challenges the rs techniques for water quality monitoring in rivers and small width streams are still in infancy sahoo et al 2020b endorsed a copula based joint distribution to estimate the river streamflow using the near infrared nir band images to address the nonlinearity and randomness in reflectance datasets the copulas are the cumulative distribution functions that integrate the marginal distribution of any two or more random variables to obtain the joint probability distribution and the dependence structure of randomly distributed dependent variables nelsen 2006 the use of copula functions for developing joint distribution functions makes it distinct due to their ability to model the complete dependence structure with a few parameters pal et al 2017 capability to capture the nonlinearity and randomness between the random variables sahoo et al 2020b and ability to derive the joint distribution irrespective of the type of marginal distribution of the individual variables maity and kumar 2008 in addition the application of bivariate is mostly preferred due to its simplicity klein et al 2011 hence the effectiveness of the copula functions to retrieve the river water quality needs to be explored recently the emerged drone based water quality motoring has also been experimented with however upscaling these methods for the entire river reach is still a major challenge larson et al 2018 therefore this study has been framed to address the specific research questions namely i is it possible to develop a daily scale tss and turbidity estimation framework for a dynamic river reach that could address the trade offs between the spatial and temporal resolutions of available remote sensing images and ii how reliable would this framework be for its application in a narrow width urban waste dominated river i e the hooghly river and the brahmani river in this study characterized with the linear and nonlinear dynamism of the sediment concentrations for advancing the understanding of the potential of rs based methods for riverine tss and turbidity monitoring this study aims i to develop simple single band empirical algorithms for tss and turbidity estimation at coarser spatial 250 m and daily temporal scales in a dynamic river system using modis images hereafter termed as the modt model ii to develop tss and turbidity estimation algorithms at finer spatial 30 m and daily temporal scales using the real landsat and estarfm derived synthetic landsat images generated from the modis images henceforth termed as the fust model iii to develop a copula based joint probability distribution integrated with the fust model for estimating the tss and turbidity concentrations in the river at 30 m spatial and daily temporal scales hereafter termed as the cfust model and iv to identify the best model variant for tss and turbidity estimation 2 study area and remote sensing datasets 2 1 study area the hooghly river a tributary of the river ganges is located at the lowest stretch of the gangetic delta in the indian province of west bengal fig 1 the major stretch of the river is covered with high density urban agglomeration on both sides and serves as the primary source of surface water for the people living in the kolkata metropolitan city and the nearby urban areas in addition the river also provides a permanent source of surface water to west bengal for irrigation navigation boating and domestic and industrial water consumption throughout the year the river also receives wastewater from several municipal sewage canals and industrial effluent streams the west bengal pollution control board monitors the water quality on monthly basis using the conventional methods at a few locations along the river stretch as illustrated in fig 1 the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp model h adcp cm1200 based river width and bathymetry surveys carried out in the selected 40 km long river reach reveals that the river flow width varies from 168 4 m to 732 0 m the four years 2016 2019 timeseries of modis tile no h26v 06 and landsat imageries for the study area were downloaded from https reverb echo nasa gov reverb and https earthexplorer usgs gov respectively the aqua modis myd09gq version 6 product provided the atmospheric gas aerosols and rayleigh scattering corrected surface reflectance estimates at the spatiotemporal resolution of 250 m 1 day vermote 2011 the landsat oli operational land imager or landsat 8 collection 2 level 2 products at the spatiotemporal resolution of 30 m 16 days with the path and row numbers of 138 and 40 were used in this study respectively the surface reflectance of the landsat 8 collection 2 level 2 products were generated using the land surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 which were radiometrically and geometrically corrected the level 2 products were processed from the level 1 products which were generated by the united states geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros on demand processing system additionally in these products corrections for atmospheric aerosol ozone and water vapor concentrations were implemented pinto et al 2020 this study also used the landsat oli operational land imager or landsat 8 path 138 row 40 images with a finer spatiotemporal resolution of 30 m 16 days the surface reflectance product myd09gq tile no h26v 06 was used in this study the acquired images correspond to the local satellite passage time of 11 00 14 00 indian standard time ist equivalent to 5 30 8 30 greenwich standard time gst for calibrating and validating the developed rs based algorithms in this study periodical in situ water samplings were carried out to measure the tss concentrations and turbidity at fixed typical locations in the river as shown in figs 1 and 2 these sampling times coincide with the local satellite passage time of 11 00 14 00 ist with a 16 days interval matching the landsat revisit period as modis data is available daily in situ sampling schedule was framed as per the coincident passage time of both the satellites facilitating the reflectance response of the tss in between the coarser and the finer resolutions of the water pixels to avoid the hindrance of the riparian habitat reflectance sampling was carried out in the near mid reach of the river with the help of a boat from each grid location 500 ml of river water samples were collected using the wide mouthed polypropylene bottles which were brought to the laboratory for estimating the turbidity with the turbidity meter model hach 2100q for tss estimation the standard method 2540 d of american public health association apha 2017 rice et al 2017 was followed where the collected samples were properly filtered using the membrane nylon filter paper with the pore size diameter of 0 47 µm the filter paper along with the filtered suspended solids were kept in the hot air oven for 24 h at 104 5ºc commonly known as gravimetric analysis subsequently the dry weight of the collected sample was measured to obtain the tss in each sample note that the measured tss concentrations in the river during the local satellite passage times are the instantaneous value representing the daily information and not daily average information in practice the river engineers also measure the daily scale water quality parameters which are measured at a specific time and not the daily average value as discussed in section 3 the developed models were calibrated using three years 2016 2018 of observed datasets and validated using one year 2019 of observed datasets for estarfm the spectrally similar red band images of landsat 8 band 4 bandwidth 636 673 nm and aqua modis band 1 bandwidth 620 670 nm were used to generate synthetic landsat images for analysis the cloud contaminated images were excluded 3 methodology the developed methodology deals with the following concepts i the presence of suspended particles in river water increases the backscattering radiation which in turn increases the surface reflectance of the water body in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum e g kirk 1994 kilham and roberts 2011 ii the suspended solid concentration directly affects the turbidity of the water body thus tss can be used as a proxy for the turbidity in the river water wass et al 1997 rügner et al 2013 chawla et al 2020 sagan et al 2020 swain and sahoo 2021 iii the atmospheric noise associated with the remote sensing images could be normalized with the help of pixel ratios one for the water pixel and the other for the land pixel over an area of 50 km2 brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 sahoo et al 2020b 2022 embracing the aforementioned concepts the present study proposed three rs based algorithms for tss estimation along the river which were developed using i modis images modt model ii landsat and synthetic landsat images fust model and iii copula integrated fust model cfust the comprehensive methodological framework is illustrated in fig 3 3 1 development of aqua modis image based algorithm for tss estimation modt model for the development of the aqua modis based spectral model modt model the red band images that are influenced by the presence of suspended solids were used the reflectance registered in the red band at a particular pixel is a function of the concentration of the riverine suspended solids within that pixel the major concern for developing spectral relationships is to reduce the atmospheric noise associated with these surface reflectance values this problem can be addressed by considering the ratio of the surface reflectance of a water pixel s located at the predetermined sampling site in the river to a land pixel c located in the river riparian zone preferably in the urban area to avoid any water submergence tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 2019 2020 li et al 2019 shi et al 2020 sahoo et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2021 2022 following the s c pixel ratio concept the river reach was segmented into three rs based virtual monitoring stations vs as illustrated in fig 3 these virtual stations were fitted with three different box matrices each having a boundary area of 50 km2 let the land pixels present within the box matrix be denoted as c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn whereas the water pixels present at the river gaging section be denoted as s 1 s 2 and sm for example vs1 has two in situ sampling locations within the fitted box matrix namely palta s 1 and sreerampore s 2 surrounded with the c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn land pixels similarly the other sampling locations within the fitted box matrices of the vs2 and vs3 are illustrated in fig 4 the development of the modt model involves a image processing b checking for the cloud interference c identification of the best c pixel using correlation analysis d model calibration and e model validation the downloaded aqua modis images were processed in the arcgis environment with reprojection clipping the area of interest aoi and resampling to 30 m resolution so as to match with the resolution of landsat for fusion subsequently all the three box matrices were checked for their alignment along the river reach although the water samplings were carried out in non cloudy days the processed image pixels were checked for cloud and smog contaminations against a user defined reflectance threshold of r1 0 35 this user defined reflectance threshold was determined based on the pixel information during the non cloudy sampling days the red band reflectances of all the water pixels during the non cloudy in situ sampling days were analyzed and it was observed that all these reflectance values were less than 0 35 this type of threshold criterion was also adopted in several rs based studies chen et al 2009 park and latrubesse 2017 tarpanelli et al 2013 2020 fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 sahoo et al 2020b to remove the cloudy pixels from the analysis for identifying the best land pixel in a fitted box matrix all the land pixels c i within the box are used to estimate the s c i j timeseries where i denotes the location of the specific land pixel j denotes the sampling day and s is the fixed sampling water pixel subsequently this s c i j timeseries is correlated with the concurrent observed t s s j timeseries during the calibration period the land pixel within this box matrix for which the maximum correlation coefficient is obtained is considered as the best land pixel c b the fitted box matrix for each vs has the row column dimension of x y with a total of x y k number of c pixels where k represents the number of sampling pixels the images acquired on all the sampling days were processed which resulted in x y k t number of c pixels where t is the number of sampling days for brevity the model set up only for the vs1 is illustrated in fig 4 the fitted box matrix at vs1 has a total number of 2508 38 66 pixels with two s pixels from modis images and the rest are 2506 numbers of c pixels these c pixels were named as c 1 c 2 c 3 and cn whereas the water pixels at the river gaging section were denoted as s 1 and s 2 similarly with the sampling dates of d 1 d 2 d 3 and d t let the observed in situ tss concentrations at s 1 water pixel be represented as t s s s 1 d 1 t s s s 1 d 2 t s s s 1 d 3 and t s s s 1 d t respectively a similar approach was followed for the other two vss for correlation analysis using the correlation analysis the best common c pixel was obtained as c b with the maximum correlation coefficient among the time series of sampling pixels s 1 cb and s 2 cb and the corresponding observed tss concentrations although the pixel ratio normalizes the atmospheric noises the signals received by the satellite sensors are generally affected by the noise due to geometric misregistration anisotropic reflectance effects electronic errors and artefacts due to data resampling cai et al 2017 these short term and observational noises can be smoothened using the time sensitive recursive exponential smoothing tres filters stroud 1999 jönsson and eklundh 2002 cai et al 2017 since this study uses four years of time series data of normalized reflectances pixel ratios the tres filter was used to handle the effect of seasonal and interannual variability in the data stream albergel et al 2008 wagner et al 1999 tarpanelli et al 2013 sahoo et al 2020b 2022 the tres filter can be expressed as stroud 1999 1 s x c b t n 1 s x c b t n k t n 1 s x c b t n 1 s x c b t n where sx denotes the sampling pixels with the subscript x representing the sequence of sampling pixel number s 1 s 2 and s 3 s x c b t n 1 is the pixel ratio at tn 1 time step s x c b t n is the filtered pixel ratio at the previous tn time step and k is the gain factor ranging from 0 to 1 expressed as 2 k t n 1 k t n k t n e x p t n t n 1 t where t is the characteristic time length used to reduce the error associated with the alignment of sun and modis sensors considered the same as the local revisit cycle of 16 days of the modis sensor for initiating the filter k t 1 and s x c b t 1 were set as 1 the tres filter was applied to each pixel ratio viz s 1 cb and s 2 cb time series as derived from the modis images to obtain the corresponding filtered pixel ratios fpr time series s x c b m these fpr and the corresponding observed tss time series were used to develop the modt model coded with python 3 4 the detailed workflow of the model development is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 development of modis landsat fusion based enhanced algorithm for tss estimation fust model to enhance the spatial resolution of the modt model derived tss estimates the aqua modis m pixels of 250 m 1 day spatiotemporal resolution can suitably be fused with the corresponding landsat l pixels of 30 m 16 days resolution by the estarfm algorithm zhu et al 2010 generating synthetic landsat sl pixels of 30 m 1 day resolution understanding the potential of estarfm for the river and near river environments with mixed land uses emelyanova et al 2013 jarihani et al 2014 sahoo et al 2020b this fusion model was chosen over the other models subsequently following the same framework as the modt model these synthetic landsat pixels can be used to develop the enhanced tss estimation algorithm named as the fust model the fusion algorithm can be used in the case of two spectrally similar pixels one from the finer resolution landsat and the other from the coarser resolution modis images with proper radiometric calibration and geometric rectification at any given time and location gao et al 2006 roy et al 2008 hilker et al 2009 generally the satellite signals of the water pixels adjacent to the land pixels are always contaminated by the surface reflectance generated from the nearby lands santer and schmeching 2000 sterckx et al 2010 2015 for addressing the issue of land adjacency effect in the red band wavelength region one pixel near to the river boundary can be removed as advocated by feng et al 2012 and hou et al 2017 before applying the estarfm the estarfm was set up based on this concept for the homogenous and heterogeneous pixels in the modis and landsat images following the principle of collinearity the homogenous pixels in these images were chosen considering their land use characteristics viz urban or water pixels subsequently the surface reflectance of the synthetic landsat pixel sl for the i th sampling location at a prediction time t p was determined by comparing the concurrent aqua modis and landsat pixels at a base time t o for the coincident location as zhu et al 2010 3 s l i t p l i t o a m i t p m i t o where m i t o and l i t o are the surface reflectances of the concurrent aqua modis and landsat pixels at the i th location during the t o base time respectively m i t p and s l i t p are the surface reflectances of the aqua modis and synthetic landsat pixels at the same i th location during the prediction time t p respectively and a is the coefficient of relative calibration between the aqua modis and landsat images the presence of multiple land cover types within a single pixel of the aqua modis image and the sudden land use change during the times t o to t p is recognized as a heterogeneous pixel in these cases the estrafm algorithm relies on the weightage function α gao et al 2006 and the conversion coefficient ɸ adams et al 1985 the application of these functions depends on i the surface reflectance values of modis landsat pairs during the base time t o ii the surface reflectances of modis images in between t o and t p iii identification of spectrally similar pixels using a moving window and iv euclidian spatial distance between the central and neighbouring pixels the governing equation for deriving the synthetic landsat reflectance can be expressed as zhu et al 2010 4 s l x 0 5 w y 0 5 w t p r e d l x 0 5 w y 0 5 w t o r e d i 1 n α i ϕ i m x i y i t p r e d m x i y i t o r e d where sl is the reflectance of the synthetic landsat image on the t p day l is the reflectance of the landsat image of the base period t o m is the reflectance of the aqua modis images having a consistent spatial resolution red is the selected spectral band x i y i is the geographical coordinate of each similar pixel x 0 5 w y 0 5 w is the geographical coordinate of the center pixel in the moving window of length w n is the total number of similar pixels within the moving window ɸ is the conversion coefficient of these similar pixels and α is the weightage function which is derived from the weight of the ith similar pixel contributing to the center pixel in a moving window the estarfm algorithm was established using two cloud free modis landsat concurrent pairs called the base pairs this study involved four years of daily timeseries data of real synthetic landsat images each year two sets of base pair images namely pair i and pair ii available exactly on the in situ water quality sampling days were used to set up the estarfm algorithm as given in table 1 subsequently the concurrent synthetic landsat images were generated for the study period 2016 2019 as the in situ samplings were carried out on the concurrent modis landsat satellite passing days the fust model setup involved the combination of both the real and synthetic landsat images based on their availability then a box matrix similar to the case of the modt model was fitted for each virtual station to obtain the downscaled finer 30 m water pixels of the landsat s s l and the land pixels of synthetic landsat c s l images subsequently correlation analysis was carried out between the observed tss time series and the corresponding s c s l pixel ratio timeseries to obtain the best c pixel namely c b s l tres filter was applied on s c b s l timeseries to get the best filtered pixel ratio timeseries denoted as s c b s l after that using the s c b s l t s s datasets the modis landsat fusion fust model was set up as illustrated in fig 3 3 3 development of copula based enhanced nonlinear algorithm for tss estimation cfust model the modt and fust models developed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 are based on the linear association between s c b and observed tss concentration timeseries however this association between these variables could be nonlinear at times especially for the dynamic river systems with unsteady flow conditions and the pearson correlation coefficient may not capture the exact dependence structure therefore a copula function was integrated with the fust model to address the randomness and nonlinearity in the tss dynamics at 30 m 1 day spatiotemporal scale and this enhanced algorithm is named as the cfust model this cfust model was set up using the joint probability distribution between the filtered synthetic landsat pixel ratios s c b s l and the corresponding total suspended concentration t s s time series following sklar s theorem the bivariate copula joint probability distribution can be established as sklar 1959 5 f x y x y c θ f x x f y y c θ u v where f x y x y is the joint cumulative distribution function c θ is the copula function with the parameter θ u f x x and v f y y are the marginal distributions of random variables x and y respectively for the continuous marginal distribution of u and v the copula function c θ can be established as 6 c θ u v f x y f x 1 u f y 1 v adopting the concept of the copula development the cfust model is based on the paired variables s c b s l t s s at a time to derive the joint distribution function f s c b s l t s s as 7 f s c b s l t s s c θ f s c b s l f t s s where f s c b s l and f t s s are the continuous and cumulative distribution function cdf of s c b s l and tss respectively and c θ is the copula function the archimedean copulas were adopted herein for the tss estimation along the dynamic hooghly river reach as these are proven for their better efficiency in various field applications with better simplicity and flexibility e g daneshkhah et al 2016 pal et al 2017 sahoo et al 2020b for fitting the archimedean copulas the association and dependence structure between the filtered pixel ratios s c b s l and tss was measured using kendall s tau τ estimated using the concordance and discordance pair of s c b s l t s s as 8 τ c f u s t p s c b s l t s c b s l t t s s t t s s t 0 p s c b s l t s c b s l t t s s t t s s t 0 where p is the pair function of s c b s l t s s pair at any two time steps with t t and τ ϵ 1 1 0 subsequently for the bivariate copula function the dependence parameter θ was calculated using the τ value favre et al 2004 which was further used for formulating the archimedean copulas after obtaining both the essential parameters i e τ and θ for the copula formation the archimedean copula family followed a unique mathematical property for continuous random variables in the form of a generator function e g zhang and singh 2006 given by 9 c c f u s t s c b s l t s s φ 1 φ s c b s l φ t s s where φ k is the generator function k is the dummy variable for the pair s c b s l t s s and φ 1 k is the pseudo inverse function of φ k given as 10 φ 1 k φ 1 k 0 k φ 0 0 φ 0 k further with the help of the obtained parameters for the archimedean copula family the clayton frank ali mikhail haq amh and gumble hougaard gh copulas were formulated as described in table 2 all the above mentioned copula functions were formulated and coded in matlab version 2016a using the mvcat toolbox and subsequently parameterized using the observed tss and corresponding s c b s l timeseries for the period of 2016 2018 to obtain the best fit copula for this study the performances of the formulated copulas were evaluated using three criteria as advocated by sadegh et al 2017 i lowest bayesian information criteria bic vrieze 2012 suman et al 2021 ii lowest root mean square error rmse dey et al 2022 and iii lowest alkaike s information criterion aic alkaike 1974 vrieze 2012 the aic and bic are given as

the best identified copula with the fust model was used in the enhanced cfust model for estimating the tss concentrations at finer spatiotemporal scale 3 4 development of turbidity estimation algorithm the turbidity algorithm s development relies on the basic principle that the suspended sediment concentration directly correlates with the turbidity of the river hence the modt fust and cfust model derived tss concentrations at any river water pixel along with the coincident in situ turbidity observations were used to establish the regression equations of the three proposed models for tss estimations in the river the best performing tss model was used as the base model for the turbidity estimation 3 5 evaluation of model performance all the developed algorithms for tss and turbidity estimation were tested using the performance measures of root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean absolute relative error mare coefficient of determination r 2 percentage

variant was selected based on the maximum determination efficiency measured by the maximum r2 estimate and minimum bias measured by the minimum rmse and mae estimates 4 results for daily scale tss estimation in the selected hooghly river reach using the satellite data it was observed that a poor correlation pearson coefficient r of 0 33 0 49 exists between the red band reflectance of the aqua modis images and the in situ tss observations at the five monitoring locations the highest r 0 49 being obtained at dakshineswar this reveals that unlike the static water bodies a direct relationship between the satellite data and tss would have been less effective for dynamic water bodies which was addressed in this study by developing the pixel ratio based modt fust and cfust model variants the core structure of the fust and cfust models depend on the performance of the estarfm while generating the synthetic landsat images in this case the accuracy of the fused 30 m synthetic landsat datasets was evaluated against the real landsat reflectances on some typical landsat passing dates for both the land and water this evaluation was carried out based on the structural similarity ssim index a visual interpretation approach rmse and correlation coefficients for the water pixels r w and land pixels r l the structural similarity between the real and synthetic landsat images is expressed as wang et al 2004 18 s s i m 2 μ r μ s j 1 2 σ r s j 2 μ r 2 μ s 2 j 1 σ s σ r j 2 where μ r and μ s are the means and σ r and σ s are the variances of real landsat and fused 30 m images respectively σ rs is the covariance of the real landsat and fused 30 m pairs and j 1 and j 2 are the constants 0 0001 to stabilize the denominator of eq 18 when it tends to zero an ssim estimate closer to 1 shows more similarity between the real landsat and fused 30 m images it can be envisaged from table 3 showing the accuracy evaluation measures of the fused synthetic landsat images for all the virtual stations that the ranges of rmse ssim r l and r w estimates are 0 011 0 026 sr 1 mean 0 016 sr 1 0 890 0 950 mean 0 924 0 900 0 980 mean 0 931 and 0 850 0 940 mean 0 885 respectively these results reveal that the estarfm can be successfully used for water quality inversion studies dealing with the fust model fig 5 illustrates the extent of noise reduction in the modis and landsat pixel ratios by the tres filter at palta dakshineswar and shivpur virtual stations as compared to the non filtered ratios this has resulted in enhanced correlations from 0 62 0 57 0 68 0 56 and 0 58 to 0 73 0 69 0 81 0 64 and 0 67 between the observed tss concentrations and the filtered pixel ratios at palta sreerampur dakshineswar shivpur and garden reach sampling stations respectively the best reference land pixel cb locations for all the virtual stations were found in the urban paved area present within the box matrix see fig s1 supplementary data generally the performance of the existing atmospheric correction ac algorithms varies significantly over the regions for which one cannot rely on a particular ac algorithm moses et al 2017 therefore before implementing the tres filter for water color inversion studies its performance was evaluated against the other existing ac algorithms specially designed for waters viz seadas l2gen provided by 9 5 0 v2019 3 git clone dated 2020 07 28 snap c2rcc ensembled in snap 7 0 and acolite designed by vanhellemont and ruddick 2018 with the absence of in situ spectral measurements the reflectance derived from these aforementioned ac algorithms were utilized as the reference reflectance for performance evaluation of tres therefore several experiments were carried out at the three vs along the hooghly river where comparative assessment of the ac algorithms was conducted using the real landsat images during these experiments the aforementioned ac algorithms were first applied on the real landsat images subsequently the corrected pixel reflectances of the red band images were extracted fig 6 illustrates the comparative performance of the tres filter while conducting the exercise over the three virtual stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 the results reveal that the tres derived pixel ratios were highly correlated with the acolite derived pixel ratios with the correlation coefficients r of 0 97 0 89 and 0 87 for vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively similarly as illustrated in the scattered plots in fig 6 the tres derived pixel ratios well correlate with the seadas l2gen r 0 86 followed by cr2cc derived pixel ratios r 0 78 at 95 confidence interval thus availing the reminiscent behavior of the tres with other existing ac algorithms the tres based filtered signals could be used for further analysis hence using the filtered signals the proposed models were calibrated for three years 2016 2019 and validated for one year 2019 of observed data as detailed in table 4 4 1 performance of modt model for estimating riverine tss concentrations using the calibration datasets in the framework of the modt model refer fig 5 the following three sets of regression equations were developed for the rs based virtual monitoring stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 as 19 t s s 130 14 s c b m 33 94 f o r v s 1 95 7 s c b m 24 88 f o r v s 2 118 51 s c b m 9 90 f o r v s 3 the observed in situ tss concentrations and the modt model estimated tss timeseries and scatter plots at all the virtual stations are shown in fig 7 the results illustrated in fig 8 reveal that the modt model could estimate the tss concentrations with the rmse estimate of 42 8 49 85 mg l nrmse of 0 14 0 15 mare of 0 33 0 35 and r2 of 0 65 0 72 with the best performance in the vs2 with the rmse mare r2 and mae estimates of 42 8 mg l 0 33 0 78 and 0 43 respectively 4 2 performance evaluation of the fust model for estimating riverine tss concentrations using the calibration datasets in the framework of the fust model the following sets of regression equations were developed for the rs based virtual monitoring stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 as 20 t s s 101 05 s c b s l 4 43 f o r v s 1 104 70 s c b s l 25 77 f o r v s 2 104 20 s c b s l 1 09 f o r v s 3 the number of real and synthetic landsat images used to develop the fust model and the number of training n c and testing n t datasets are given in table 4 fig 7 also illustrates the derivation of discrete in situ observed tss concentrations by the fust model during the validation period at all the five sampling stations along the hooghly river reach which is also shown in the form of scatter plots a comparative analysis between the modt and fust models reveals that the later model performed better with the lower rmse estimates of 20 mg l 27 mg l and 23 5 mg l and higher r2 estimates of 0 86 0 89 and 0 85 for the vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively 4 3 performance evaluation of the cfust model for estimating riverine tss concentrations the cfust model was upgraded from the fust model which is based on the correlation established with a suitable copula function against the linear regression in the fust model following the procedure discussed in section 3 3 the dependence parameter θ was computed as 10 1 12 23 and 9 25 for vs1 vs2 and vs3 respectively while the corresponding kendal s τ was computed as 0 78 0 89 and 0 82 respectively among the archimedean copula functions tested herein the frank copula outperformed the other three copula functions based on the lowest rmse along with aic and bic rankings for all the three virtual stations see table 5 fig 7 illustrates the best derivation of the discrete in situ observed tss concentrations by the frank copula based cfust model compared to the modt and fust model variants during the validation period at all the five sampling stations which is also shown in the form of scatter plots the best fit frank copula based cfust model as developed herein can be expressed as 21 c c f u s t s c b s l t s s f r a n k 1 10 1 l n 1 exp 10 1 s c b s l 1 exp 10 1 t s s 1 e x p 10 1 1 f o r v s 1 1 12 23 l n 1 exp 12 23 s c b s l 1 exp 12 23 t s s 1 e x p 12 23 1 f o r v s 2 1 9 5 l n 1 exp 9 5 s c b s l 1 exp 9 5 t s s 1 e x p 9 5 1 f o r v s 3 for testing the supremacy of the developed cfust model framework the performance of this model was again compared with some existing tss prediction algorithms as given in table 6 for this comparative analysis the existing algorithms were selected on the basis of i bands used for formulation exclusively used red and nir bands and ii nature of the algorithms prioritized empirical algorithms for establishing the empirical algorithms in the hooghly river the prescribed methodologies in the literature were followed and model coefficients were adjusted accordingly the comparative results presented in table 6 reveal that the cfust model outperformed all the existing models for tss estimation that utilizes the red band as the reference in the river environment further for testing the portability of the comparative assessment of tres filter with the exiting atmospheric correction algorithms for simulating the real landsat images framework this model was also applied for tss estimation in the brahmani river in eastern india wherein this model was calibrated for three years 2015 2017 and validated for one year 2018 datasets the four years 2015 2018 of in situ tss datasets in the brahmani river was procured from the state pollution control board scpb odisha the results as illustrated in fig 9 reveal that the proposed cfust model performed very well in reproducing the observed discrete tss concentrations at talcher s1 and talcher s2 sampling stations on the brahmani river with the estimates of r2 0 88 mare 0 12 mae 0 19 and nrmse 0 09 4 4 accuracy assessment of the cfust model for deriving the turbidity the developed cfust model performed the best for tss estimation and it was used as the base model for corresponding turbidity estimation at the all three vss for this linear regression relationships were established between the in situ observations of tss and turbidity over the period 2016 2018 calibration at the three vss as illustrated in fig 10 subsequently the turbidity tu levels at 30 m 1 day spatiotemporal resolution corresponding to the cfust model estimated tss concentrations along the selected river reach were estimated as 22 t u 0 8998 1 10 1 l n 1 exp 10 1 s c b s l 1 exp 10 1 t s s 1 e x p 10 1 1 2 9966 f o r v s 1 0 895 1 12 23 l n 1 exp 12 23 s c b s l 1 exp 12 23 t s s 1 e x p 12 23 1 9 9751 f o r v s 2 0 7874 1 9 5 l n 1 exp 9 5 s c b s l 1 exp 9 5 t s s 1 e x p 9 5 1 4 4004 f o r v s 3 the established relationships in eq 22 were validated using the in situ turbidity observations over the period 2019 at all the three vss illustrated in the form of scatter plots in fig 10 the performance measures given inset of fig 10d 10e reveal that eq 22 could provide reliable turbidity estimates corresponding to the rs based cfust model simulated tss concentrations at the three virtual monitoring stations along the hooghly river reach for addressing the issue of land adjacency effect in the red band wavelength region one pixel near to the river boundary was removed before simulating the cfust model for tss and the cfustu model for turbidity mapping along the hooghly river as advocated by feng et al 2012 and hou et al 2017 following this principle the spatiotemporal variability of the tss and turbidity were derived along the hooghly river as illustrated in fig 11 5 discussion in light of the aforementioned findings the study provides reliable framework to develop semi empirical models to monitor the tss and turbidity along the dynamic river system using the public domain satellite datasets in this regard the proposed pixel ratio based semi empirical model used the red band spectral reflectance of aqua modis is proven for its best correlation with the tss concentrations for which it is used directly or in combination with the nir band reflectance to map the tss in the static lakes as well as dynamic river systems e g miller and mckee 2004 shi and wang 2009 kilham and roberts 2011 espinoza villar et al 2012 r 2013 son and wang 2012 park and latrubesse 2014 as proposed by tarpanelli et al 2013 the fitted box matrix covering an area of 50 km2 along the river and near river environments is based on the homogeneity principle pertaining to the atmospheric noise contamination of the pixels within that area the same principle has also been adopted in several past studies for normalizing the atmospheric noises at the dynamic water pixel brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 li et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020b with reference to the identified relatively static land pixel c b within the area of 50 km2 that means the land pixel c b and the model parameters estimated for a specific river section are also applicable within the fitted box matrix of 50 km2 area covering about 10 12 km long river reach even in hydrometry the conventional discharge or flow depth estimation approaches using the rating curves are river section specific which is due to the change in the shape of the cross section and manning s roughness coefficient perumal et al 2007 sahoo et al 2014 therefore to ensure the consistency of the estimation results one has to fix a number of adjacent box matrices of area of 50 km2 at each 10 12 km interval along the river reach similarly while simulating the developed model along the river the consistency between two adjacent sections could be ensured by using two approaches i with more finer scale in situ samplings along the river box matrices can be fixed in a moving window concept such that two adjacent sections could be covered adequately without any boundary issue and ii with finer scale in situ samplings another box matrix centering the boundary of two adjacent box matrices can be overlapped using a moving window concept the study also demonstrated the above mentioned box matrix approach using three virtual stations vs1 vs2 and vs3 along the hooghly river the proposed framework dealing with the single band pixel ratio along with box matrix has also proven its reliability for streamflow estimation along several world rivers using the public domain satellite datasets as investigated by several researchers brakenridge et al 2007 tarpanelli et al 2013 2017 li et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020b further the performance of the tres was evaluated with the other existing atmospheric correction ac algorithms while implementing the single band pixel ratio method and reminiscent behavior was also observed notwithstanding these findings many ac algorithms in the literature have been tested in coastal inland waters worldwide for instance vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 evaluated the performance of l2 wfr polymer cr2cc seadas l2gen and acolite algorithms using sentinel 3 olci in belgium coastal waters and found that acolite is the best ac algorithms while comparing with the in situ spectrometer observations and for deriving the turbidity and chlorophyll a using semi analytical algorithms similarly the study conducted by windle et al 2022 claimed that c2rcc is the best suitable algorithm for tss and turbidity retrieval in chesapeake bay while comparing the polymor seadas l2gen and cr2cc ac algorithms following the findings by several authors e g mograne et al 2019 gossn et al 2019 pereira sandoval et al 2019 renosh et al 2020 giannini et al 2021 the general conclusion we can get that the performance of ac algorithms varies significantly over the regions precisely till now there is no standardized ac algorithm prescribed for inland water especially for the olci products availing the reminiscent behavior of the tres with other existing ac algorithms the tres could be utilized for daily tss estimation at the hooghly river reach as demonstrated in this study however observations of this study also advocate the findings of kuhn et al 2019 while examining ac algorithms over amazon and mississippi river reaches that more rigorous analysis with the in situ spectral measurement will be needed to prescribe the standardized ac algorithm for any typical river section which will be our future investigation moreover tss mapping using the modis images although effective and preferable on the wide river floodplains like the amazon river fassoni andrade and paiva 2019 the 250 m coarser resolution of the aqua modis images limits its application in narrower river stretches as considered in this study in these narrow rivers it fails to capture the spatial heterogeneity resulting in poor model performance further the heterogeneous pixels at this lower spatial resolution results in high background noise levels the modt model uses the filtered pixel ratio s c b m of the aqua modis red band reflectance to reduce the background noise normalizing the heterogeneity in water pixels with a best correlating land pixel in this study the best correlating land pixel was observed to be the paved surfaces for all the three vss indicating that a homogeneously paved surface reflectance could be the best fit for normalizing the water pixel reflectance although the modt model was able to estimate the daily scale tss with reasonable accuracy r2 0 65 0 77 the model was further improved by the fust model using the finer 30 m resolution of the landsat modis fusion images with r2 0 85 0 89 this improvement of the fust model could be attributed to the derived 30 m resolution s c b s l signals in this study however as landsat data is limited to a 16 days temporal resolution its direct use in the earlier studies e g wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 montanher et al 2014 herrault et al 2016 could not the achieve the objective of estimating the riverine tss concentration at daily scale additionally the fust model could be implemented along the braided river reach for tss estimation even during the low flows due to the finer spatial resolutions of the derived synthetic landsat datasets adopting the prescribed framework and sampling protocols in the dynamic river systems the fust model can further be improved using the advantage of recent launch of landsat 9 satellite in the year 2022 so that an eight days window can be considered between the landsat 8 and 9 image pairs during the fusion to address the effects of nonlinearity and randomness in the used datasets in the dynamic river water characterized with the unsteady flow further integration of the frank copula function with the fust model could enhance the cfust model performance with the average rmse and r2 estimates of 20 82 mg l and 0 93 respectively the study conducted by isidro et al 2018 demonstrated the idea of the tss and turbidity mapping in small width rivers using the commercial satellite images from rapideye spot 6 and pleiades 1a conversely the present study addresses this issue using the public domain modis and landsat satellite images with virtually no cost furthermore although some recent studies have used the sentinel 2 satellite images to estimate the tss concentrations in the small rivers and inland waters e g toming et al 2016 pahlevan et al 2017 2019 saberioon et al 2020 these methods could not be used to derive tss at daily scale and also limits their applicability to retrieve the historical record of tss concentration due to the late lunch of sentinel 2 in the year 2015 note that retrieval of the historical tss record could also be an essential input to study the spatiotemporal variability of the river pollutants as demonstrated with the ten years of modis data in the amazon river by park and latrubesse 2014 as envisaged from the results the proposed cfust model could be used to estimate the historical and real time mapping of tss and turbidity with better accuracy even in the smaller width unsteady dynamic river systems similarly as the proposed framework encapsulates the semi empirical models the site specific calibration of the models is essential before implementing in any other river section which is also an inherent characteristic of empirical models sagan et al 2020 peterson et al 2018 biswal et al 2018 however the developed models have certain limitations during the cloudy days in monsoon season as the prediction highly relied on the passive rs data the integration of microwave remote sensing to the proposed models could address these limitations which is a future research plan 5 conclusions for high frequent mapping of the total suspended solids and turbidity using rs images along a narrow transverse stretch of the dynamic river reach subjected to the continuous effects of urban wastes in the form of lateral flows this study developed three model variants these progressively enhanced models for daily scale tss estimation are the 250 m spatial resolution aqua modis based modt model 30 m spatial resolution synthetic landsat based fust model and further improvised cfust model that uses the frank copula function integrated fust model based on this study the following specific conclusions could be drawn 1 the better performance of the fust model over the modt model reveals that the finer spatial resolution of satellite images is always preferable for remote sensing based tss estimation in dynamic river systems 2 the nonlinear frank copula based algorithm for correlating the spectral property with the tss could further enhance the tss prediction with the cfust model compared to the linear regression based fust model this reveals that frank copula could better describe the tss spectral reflectance dynamics in rivers than the conventionally used linear functions 3 following the advocated approach in this study remote sensing based virtual tss and turbidity monitoring stations could easily be set up in the desired river reaches for real time mapping for near no cost involvement through initial training of the model with limited discrete in situ observations therefore the advocated cfust model could be used in an operational mode for many world rivers with scanty in situ observations of tss and turbidity moreover the proposed framework can also be implemented and standardized for tss and turbidity estimations in other world rivers with the support of in situ spectral measurements which will be our future investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

15526,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are excellent tracers for fossil fuel combustion natural fires and petroleum contamination and have been widely used for reconstructing past wildfires and industrial activities at a variety of time scales here for the first time we obtain a high resolution annual to decadal scale record of pahs from two parallel marine sediment cores from the liaodong bay northeastern china to reconstruct the industrial activities spanning the past 200 years from 1815 to 2014 our data indicate that pah variations can be divided into four episodes i low probably near background pahs from natural fires and domestic wood combustion during the pre industrial period from 1815 to 1890 ii slightly increased but with large fluctuations pah concentrations derived from intermittent warfare during the world war 1891 1945 and increased industrial activities after 1946 1946 1965 iii a period of stagnation and in some cases reduction in pahs during the cultural revolution 1966 to 1979 and iv a rapid and persistent rise in pahs post 1979 linked to fast economic development with pah concentrations doubled from 1979 to 2014 changes in pah distributions demonstrate major shifts in the dominant types of fuels over time from vegetation wood to coal and wood followed by coal and petroleum including vehicle emissions over the past 200 years we find that pah records also show similar trend to domestic economy and the estimated regional anthropocene co2 emissions from industrial activities suggesting sedimentary pah fluxes could be used as an indirect and qualitative proxy to track the trend for regional anthropogenic co2 emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs fire history industrial revolution diagnostic ratios anthropogenic co2 emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in natural environments can derive from following sources 1 incomplete combustion of wood vegetation fires either domestic or natural wild fires manoli and samara 1999 wang et al 2007 2 incomplete combustion of fossil fuels coal petroleum in internal combustion engines and electric power plants mostert et al 2010 and 3 diagenesis and catagenesis of natural organic matter in sediments xu et al 2019 specifically pahs are abundant in coal and petroleum resulting from diagenesis and thermal maturation of biomass of higher plants algae and microbes over millions of years abdel shafy and mansour 2016 pahs derived from different sources show distinct structural characteristics for example pahs in coals and petroleum derived from natural and slow thermal maturation over the millions or hundred millions of years at relatively low temperatures and high pressures in sediment achten and hofmann 2009 as a result pahs from coal and petroleum are characterized by abundant alkyl substitutions on the aromatic rings russo et al 2019 pahs derived from incomplete combustion of coal and petroleum are generally devoid of methyl and other alkyl substitutions because these alkyl groups are preferentially oxidized relative to aromatic rings during combustion yunker and macdonald 2003 pahs from vegetation fires tend to differ from those from fossil fuels by having fewer alkyl substitutions rocha and palma 2019 in addition the diagnostic ratios of pahs with certain structure features have been used to differentiate coal from petroleum yunker et al 2002 vaezzadeh et al 2021 or petroleum from car emissions pies et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 wood fire derived pahs are suggested to contain relatively high percentages of high molecular weight hmw pahs and high value 0 80 of retene retene chrysene ratio yan et al 2005 therefore examination of structural changes in pah structures in sediment cores can also provide information for the sources of pahs over time pahs in ocean and lake sediments can be used to reconstruct temporal changes in above sources depending on time periods before the industrial revolution pahs in sediments mainly originate from natural wild vegetation fires song et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of pahs and other occurrences in sediments as proxy for past vegetation fires vachula et al 2022 since the industrial revolution however the dominant sources of pahs in ocean and lake sediments have switched to incomplete combustion of coal and petroleum bao et al 2020 and in some cases direct pollution from petroleum spills martins et al 2010 such fossil fuel derived pahs can be collectively grouped into resulting from industrial activities pahs are highly stable organic compounds as the fused aromatic rings are extremely unreactive in natural environments and difficult to use as energy source by microbes in addition pahs can be readily transported to ocean and lake sediments via fluvial or aeolian processes melymuk et al 2014 merhaby et al 2019 therefore sedimentary pahs have been widely and successfully used to record regional industrial activities from high accumulation marine or lake sediment cores timoszczuk et al 2021 pahs from lake sediments often provide more localized signal than those from ocean records for example sun et al evaluated pah variations in sediment cores from three lakes located in northeast china and found that pah concentrations were higher in the industrial areas than that of rural area in daqing city sun et al 2014 tang et al 2015 and li et al 2016 revealed that loading and temporal variations of total pah concentrations in taihu lake and lake chao were consistent with historical economic and social development of the east china over past 120 years tang et al 2015 li et al 2016 in order to provide a larger regional scale estimation of industrial activities ocean sediments would be preferred especially ocean sediments adjacent to major river outlets for example liu et al 2021a measured pah concentrations of surface sediments and core sections from the yellow sea east china sea and south china sea the pah variations were closely associated with the socioeconomic development and historical energy consumption of china from 1840 to 2007 with concentration reduction during the chinese civil war 1946 1949 and cultural revolution 1966 1976 liu et al 2021a b several other pah records have been published from marine sediment sites in the south yellow and east china sea yuan et al 2014 cai et al 2016 these marine records however would mainly reflect both industrial activities in southeastern eastern china marine sites adjacent to yellow river delta in bohai bay are additionally complicated by the frequent changes in its locations of yellow river outlets from 1855 to present yellow river outlet locations experienced four times changes spanning about 160 kms along the coastal region between laizhou bay and bohai bay yu et al 2014 for example yuan et al 2014 reconstructed a historical pah record in old yellow river showing an evident peak during the year of 1976 1999 caused by relocation of the yellow river in 1976 and 1996 respectively yuan et al 2014 similarly hu et al also found pahs are strongly affected by the meandering yellow river outlets in additional to reflecting regional industrial activities hu et al 2011 so far there has been no pah records from ocean sites adjacent to major rivers for the northeastern china historically northeast is the earliest region to industrilize in china and is characterized by the heavy industries e g steel making petrochemical industry and power generation with high fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions thus pah record in northeast china may display different patterns of pah profiles relative to sites of yellow south and east china sea this region has also undergone the heaviest intermittent warfare from 1890 to 1945 in china with periods of major destruction followed by rapid expansion of heavy industrial activities and vice versa therefore our understanding of industrial activities over the anthropocene for china is incomplete without a high resolution record of pahs from ocean sites representing heavy industrial region in northeastern china before 1970s the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to obtain sediment cores from liaodong bay with exceedingly high sediment rate to allow annual to decadal scale reconstruction of past industrial activities over the anthropocene liaodong bay receives sediments from several major local rivers connecting heavy industrial sites to the coastal ports and thus likely to host high accumulation rate sediments the sediments are also likely to contain high abundance of pahs resulting from various human activities 2 to evaluate how total fluxes and different sources e g wood versus fossil fuel origins of pahs may have changed during major historical episodes such as pre industrial early industrial world war and cultural revolution and post 1978 2 materials and methods 2 1 regional setting liaodong bay is one of the three major bays of the bohai sea and located in the northern edge local rivers such as daliao and luan river flow down and deliver plenty of sediments and contaminants into the bay each year zhang et al 2016 yingkou qinhuangdao tangshan and dalian of the bohai sea opened as treaty ports for trading weapons and energy resources during the 1860s to 1890s accounting for over 50 input and exports of china before 1950s today they act as the marine transportation junctions in the north of china for domestic and international trade such as steel non metallic ore coal petroleum cement woods and food cargo and container shipping of these ports handled over 15 million standard containers in 2021 representing about 37 of total input and exports of china the gdp of circum bohai sea region accounted for about 20 of china s gdp since 1970s owing to a cluster of heavy industries especially the oil and gas fields steel works and power stations using billion tons of fossil fuels representing 27 of total energy consumption of china fig 1 these industrial activities in the northeast china plus various shipping exhausts yield large amounts of pahs which are carried by river northwest winter monsoon to liangdong bay the bohai sea is semi enclosed and could only communicate with open ocean by bohai strait the high sedimentation rate and relatively weak ocean current dynamics facilitate the accumulations and preservation of pahs derived from adjacent continents this region also does not have the complications as in the southwest bohai sea fig 1 resulting from frequent changes in the location of yellow river outlets that would change the pah sources and accumulation at any given site therefore the coastal and estuary of liaodong bay are the ideal locations for obtaining continuous regional human activities analyses with relatively stable source areas and sedimentary settings two parallel gravity cores were collected from the organic rich muddy areas near the estuary of daliaohe dlh liaodong bay in september 2014 the high sedimentation rates multiple sources and weak hydrodynamic condition make the liaodong bay be an optimal site for industrial activities analysis the dlhz01 and dlhz02 core sections are 116 cm and 106 cm long respectively with 100 sediment recovery the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 two cores are in situ sub sampled at 2 4 cm intervals for dating 2 cm interval for grain size and pahs analysis to reconstruct the fire changes in northeast china 2 2 dating and grain size measurement the chronology of the two parallel cores was determined by caesium 137 137cs and lead 210 210pb analysis samples for 210pb and 137cs dating were freeze dried weighted 5 g sediments and then packed into tin cups with a plastic cover the radioactivity of 210pb 226ra and 137cs for the sediments were measured by multi channel gamma spectrometry using the gamma emission peaks at 46 5 352 and 661 kev 226ra provided the support for analysis 210pb taken radioactive equilibration between the 226ra and 222rn into consideration 226ra was indirectly tested using its daughter radionuclide 214pb after storage for three weeks the experimental error was 10 with a detection limits of 0 1 bg kg 1 at the 99 confidence level the excess 210pb activity 210pbexc was calculated by subtraction of the supported activity from the total activity the dates of young estuarine sediments determined from 210pbexc were calculated by the constant flux constant sedimentation cfcs and the constant rate of supply crs models appleby et al 1979 powder samples were collected at 2 cm intervals for grain size analysis 0 5 g dried powders samples were added into 10 0 ml 10 h2o2 v v and 10 0 ml 10 hcl v v to remove organic matter and carbonate respectively then grain size distributions were determined using a malvern 2000 laser diffraction instrument the measurement uncertainty for each sample was 2 the 210pb 137cs dating and grain size measurement were conducted at the qingdao institute of marine geology china geological survey qingdao china 2 3 pah analysis freeze dried sediment samples used for extraction were ground to 200 mesh size 80 µm with an agate mortar and pestle then 5 g accuracy 0 1 mg homogenized sediment sample were added into a clean centrifuge tube injected with mixture solution of 10 0 ml of a 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane and 0 1 ml of 10 0 mg l 1 surrogate standard three blank sample were prepared using the same procedure and added with 10 ml of 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane all samples were vortexed by centrifuge rotation for 1 min ultrasonicated for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min to extracts the pahs the upper liquid was transferred into a new clean vial with the activated copper for desulphurization then residual sediments were reextracted twice by the same procedure the liquid extract was further purified with silica gel columns using 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane concentrated to 1 0 ml and added into 0 2 ml of 5 mg l 1 internal standard chen and chen 2011 pah measurements were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph equipped with an agilent 5975c mass selective detector and a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm i d 0 25 mm film thickness at the yantai institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences the parameters was set and based on published studies liu et al 2021 high purity helium was used as carrier gas with constant flow rate of 1 83 ml min 1 the temperatures of the injector and transfer lines were 280 c and 300 c respectively the initial oven temperature was set at 60 c for 5 min elevated to 280 c at a heating rate of 3 c min 1 and held for 30 min mass spectrometry was acquired using the electron ionization and selective ion monitoring modes the single pah for each sample was identified by the retention time external pah standards and characteristic mass fragments 15 pahs were quantified using an internal standard hexamethylbenzene and by the proportional relation of the peak areas in the chromatographs of the characteristic ions for each biomarker the concentrations of pah compounds were expressed on a dry weight basis detailed information and analyses for pah parameters are provided in supplementary materials tables s1 s2 and fig s1 3 results 3 1 sediment composition and age model the sediments of core dlhz01 comprise of grayish yellow sand and silt the mean gran size shows a distinct gradually increase from top to bottom ranging from 3 8 to 6 2 φ fig 2 a the decreasing trend in mean grain size from bottom to top infers that the sedimentary hydrodynamic tends to be weaker however the sediments of dlhz02 core mainly consist of black gray silt and clay the mean grain size of core dlhz02 varies from 5 0 to 6 9 φ suggesting relatively stable sedimentary environment and weak hydrodynamic condition fig 2b these two cores are analyzed to assess reproduction and fidelity of the pahs to indicate linkages to industrial revolution process the short lived radionuclides 210pb and 137cs is characterized by different half lives it has been widely applied to establish the age mode of undisturbed sediment archives over the past 100 150 years appleby et al 1979 foucher et al 2021 the 137cs fallout peaks recorded in sediment sequences are upwardly associated with the world frequent atomic bomb testing at 1963 and 1975 fallout release from the accident at chernobyl and fukushima daiichi nuclear station in 1986 and 2011 respectively however it is hard to detect 137cs peaks of coastal core samples of china due to the low concentration clay composition organic matter and hydrodynamic effects liu et al 2011 the 137cs activity of dlhz01 displays two dramatic increases at the depth of 18 cm and 54 cm that are considered to be fukushima daiichi nuclear accidents fallout at 2011 and the maximum atmospheric radionuclide fallout deposition at 1963 fig 2a but 137cs activities of dlhz02 shows no evident peaks against the depth variations fig 2b in general the 137cs activities ranging from 0 to 6 bq kg 1 are too low to provide reliable anchoring points the age control points are cross validated by following 210pb results in contrast to 137cs the 210pbexc is used as a continuous time marker to reconstruct sedimentation rates for the last 100 to 150 years bruel and sabatier 2020 the evolution of 210pbexc activities against depth in sediment cores follows an exponential decrease from which it is possible to calculate the sedimentation rates in this study the chronology of the two cores are established based on both of cfcs and crs 210pb models lan et al 2020 the crs ages are generally consistent with the 137cs based ages since 1964 for dlhz01 core fig 2a the average sedimentary rate of dlhz01 and dlhz02 are 1 11 cm year 1 and 1 48 cm year 1 lasting for 200 and 160 years respectively 3 2 downcore pah variations pah concentrations in sediments are affected by multiple factors including sediment composition organic content or grain size de abreu mota et al 2014 based on correlation analysis the coefficient determinations between grain size and pah compositions range from 0 49 to 0 64 for dlhz 01 and from 0 29 to 0 41 for dlhz02 table s2 indicating grain size influence on pah accumulations of two cores therefore the pah fluxes are applied to explore the relationship between the pah parameters and industrial revolution process in following section the concentrations of σpahs of core dlhz01 ranges from 12 18 to 430 96 ng g 1 with an average value of 134 96 ng g 1 fig 3 the sediments show higher concentration of hmw pahs mean value of 113 02 ng g 1 and mostly consist of four and five ring pahs accounting for over 60 in addition the four ring pahs are highest in content average percentage of 42 92 followed by five average percentage of 24 65 and three ring pahs average percentage of 17 40 descriptive statistics for each indicator are shown in figs s1a and s1c the pahs of liaodong bay are characterized by the dominant 3 4 ring pahs about 60 3 6 5 the weighted average of ring number average value of 4 4 0 1 is significantly lower than those dominated by 5 6 ring pahs with average of ring number of 4 9 from south and east china sea fig s2 liu et al 2021b increased low molecular weight lmw pahs may indicate more contribution from fluvial path because lmw pahs are more susceptible to volatilization and photodegradation melymuk et al 2014 whereas association with clay during fluvial transport can protect lmw pahs from microbial degradation duan et al 2015 thus long range aeolian transport would deplete lmw pahs and enrich in hmw phas ruiz fernández et al 2014 our data suggest that pahs in eastern liaodong bay are more likely transported by rivers and ocean currents additional reasons for the relative enrichment of pahs with smaller number of rings in the lioadong bay include the lower regional temperatures than those of the south and east china lower temperatures would decrease the loss of lmw pahs by reducing evaporation and retarding microbial degradations the σpahs concentrations reduce gradually from top to bottom with an exponential rate the other indicators such as concentrations of σlmw pahs σhmw pahs and four ring pahs display similar variations to that of σpahs figs 3 and s3 based on variation characteristics changes in pahs concentrations could be divided into four units including unit ⅰ 0 42 cm 1979 2014 rapid increase stage ⅱ 42 48 cm 1966 1978 a trough ⅲ 48 110 cm 1890 1965 slow increase stage and ⅳ 110 106 cm 1815 1890 stable stage furthermore although pah concentrations between the dhlz01 and dhlz02 differ by only approximately 13 throughout the core the pah proxies of dlhz02 also manifest the same exponential variation pattern as that of dlhz01 the percentages of different pah indicators are almost the same figs s1b and s1d suggesting that variation of pah concentrations is reproducible 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of sediment pahs and inferences for pah origins changes in pah structures can be used as indicators to assess the distribution pattern as well as to distinguish the types of combustion source du and jing 2018 for example phenanthrene anthracene phe an an an phe flu flu pyr icdp icdp bghip and baa baa chr ratios abbreviations in table s1 are applied to provide information on the source recognition katsoyiannis et al 2011 jautzy et al 2013 in general petrogenic source pahs are abundant in lmw pahs with a severe depletion of hmw pahs while pyrogenic sources pahs formed at high temperatures are less alkylated and their molecules contain more fused aromatic rings than petrogenic pahs zakaria et al 2002 therefore the an an phe ratio is useful for identifying petrogenic sources whereas flu flu pyr baa baa chr and icdp icdp bghip are better for identifying pyrolytic sources vaezzadeh et al 2021 the analysis of pahs cross plots for diagnostic ratios suggested mixed pyrogenic source wood coal combustion and vehicle emission of pahs fig s4 in order to distinguish different dominant sources over the past 200 years multi dimensional scaling mds analyses fig 4 of pah concentrations ages as well as five diagnostic ratios including phe an fla fla pyr icdp icdp bghip baa baa chr and σlmw pahs σhmw pahs were applied to ascertain the similarities in variation trend and source of pahs among the samples moon et al 2007 our mds analysis showed that samples of dlhz01 were divided into five groups since 1815 corresponding to intervals of 1815 1890 1890 1945 1945 1965 1965 1979 and 1979 to 2014 fig 4 although mds result could not identify the specific source the sample position of each group located close inner or near the circles suggested similar source of pahs combined with the results of quantitative pah patterns the main source of five groups could be classified into four intervals including wood interval 1815 1890 warfare interval 1890 1945 coal and wood interval 1945 1979 coal and vehicle emission interval 1979 2014 during the year of 1815 1890 the phe an ratio between 7 and 10 and fla fla pyr ratio ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 suggested possible main grass wood or coal sources fig s4 turgut et al 2017 the relative high percentage of three rings pahs mostly formed during natural diagenesis petroleum products and incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass at low to moderate temperatures wang et al 2017 pointed to the main source of pahs associated with the living activities and wildfire of burning the grass and woods during the interval of 1890 1945 most of phe an ratios of two cores showed higher value ranging from 6 to 9 relative to that during 1979 2014 fla fla pyr ratio 0 5 and baa baa chr ratio 0 35 were observed for all the samples in dhlz01 and dhlz02 fig s4 implying the mixing source of woods coal combustion and vehicle emission akyüz and çabuk 2010 however automobiles were uncommon during this stage the pah patterns were featured by decrease in percentage of three rings pahs but increase in percentage of four and six rings pahs fig s5 probably resulting from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels at high temperatures bandowe et al 2018 in addition phenanthrene which is used in the manufacturing of explosives saadi et al 2019 also showed evident variations with high peaks during 1890 1945 these implies major pah sources derived from the intermittent warfare in the northeast china during the period of 1945 1966 phe an ratios tended to have lower values 4 to 8 with icdp icdp bghip ratio 0 5 fig s4 indicating that the usage of coal for production activities and wood for domestic activities were the two dominated pah sources the gradual decrease in two rings pahs but increase in three and four rings pahs also support such change in dominant pah sources fig s5 at the interval of 1978 2014 phe an ratio between 3 and 6 and baa baa chr and icdp icdp bghip ratio 0 5 indicated the main source from the coal combustion for industrial manufacture petroleum burning for transportation and industrial production which leaded to the rapid increase in four from 38 to 46 and six rings pahs from 7 to 22 fig s5 4 2 spatial difference of pah records in adjacent oceans of southern eastern and northeastern china and implications pah records of two cores from liaodong bay located near the northeastern corner of bahai sea fig 1 are generally not affected by yellow river discharges so far there have been no published pah data from this region a number of southward flowing rivers namely liaohe daliaohe daling and xiaoling rivers provide the main sediment sources into this region these rivers plus northwest winter monsoon and westerly are likely the main carriers of pahs to our study site therefore pahs record of liaodong bay likely reflecte a larger scale influences of anthropogenic activities in the northeast china there are over ten published anthropocene pah records in ocean sites near major river outlets in southern eastern and northeastern china liu et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 pah profiles from lh4 in linhong river estuary zhang et al 2013 1 2 and s1 in pearl river outlet peng et al 2007 liu et al 2021b have been interpreted to reflect evolution of natural vegetation fires biomass burning domestic and industrial fossil fuel combustion on the adjacent provinces in the eastern and southern china during the anthropocene respectively however pah records of bc1 and bc2 from bohai bay likely reflect combined influence from both human activities and natural factors hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2014 the sediments of two sites were delivered mainly by yellow river partial by luanhe river and haihe river yellow river was characterized by extremely high suspended sediment load van maren et al 2009 thus interpretation of pah records as integrated regional industrial activities from sites adjacent to the yellow river delta could be greatly affected by major changes in sedimentation and delivery due to river fluctuations since 1855 yellow river has experienced four times of major shift in its course between bohai bay and laizhou bay in the year of 1996 1976 1964 and 1953 hu et al 2011 as a result pah records of y1 bc1 and bc2 in bohai bay differed greatly from each other fig 5 with each core showing evidence peaks at different times therefore changes in pah concentrations of bohai bay may mainly reflect varied sediment contribution from the yellow river and could not provide a truthful integration of regional industrial activities over time accounting for the effect of inorganic sediment fluxes on the pah records it is possible pah fluxes rather than concentrations from y1 bc1 and bc2 may yield a more uniform picture of pah changes over time compared with these existing pah profiles the major differences as well as similarities of variation rate and trend are observed among the pah records of liaodong bay yellow and south china sea fig s6 in general the rates of pah increases from 1815 to 2014 of pah concentrations decreased from north to south specifically pah concentrations of laizhou bay increased 35 times from 12 18 to 403 96 ng g 1 from 1890 to 2014 while pah concentrations of ys2 and s1 only rose 3 and 2 times from 1890 to 2007 respectively figs 5 and s6 pah concentrations during period of 1979 2014 increased 4 times in liaodong bay but only rose about 0 5 times in ys2 and 0 3 times and s1 from 1979 to 2007 fig s6 this difference can be explained by the fact that the daily coal and coke consumption accounts for over 70 of total energy consumption in northeast china and about five times higher than that in south china about 50 liu et al 2021a in addition the south china sea are featured by stronger hydrodynamic conditions than yellow sea and bohai sea strong ocean currents could disperse pahs to broader ocean areas hence reduce the pah fluctuations thus the varied increase rate of pah concentrations from north to south was likely caused by difference in both amount of energy consumption and hydrodynamic conditions among each region liu et al 2021b furthermore as to the spatial variation trend pah records of dlhz01 ys2 and s1 general increased from 1805 to present the minor changes in pah concentration of dlhz01 ys2 and s1 during the 1810 to 1890 indicated a low background pollution level linked to an agricultural dominated economy the standstill or decrease of pah concentrations during 1966 to 1978 in these three sites were linked to cultural revolution liu et al 2021b however due to the difference in industrial development between south and northeast china the pah concentrations of dlhz01 were featured by discrete peaks associated with intermittent warfare in northeast of china at the interval of 1890 to 1945 while pah concentrations of s2 displayed slow gradual increase since 1920 linked with the growth of industries caused by the military in south china liu et al 2021b during post 1978 pah records of ys2 and s1 manifested decline trend from 1995 to 2007 inconsistent with current day economic development and was possibly attributed to reduction proportional use of domestic coal and increasing consumption of cleaner energies natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas liu et al 2021a b while high resolution pahs record of dhlz01 was featured by three peaks during 1979 2014 with rapid increase rate linked to rising energy main coal combustion consumption for economy development 4 3 linkages with industrialization process and anthropogenic carbon emissions the diagnostic ratios of the two cores demonstrated that the main sources of pahs were woods coal as well as liquid fossil fuels combustion previous studies suggested that gdp growth was strongly associated with the increases in both energy consumption and co2 emissions raupach et al 2007 adedoyin et al 2020 meanwhile the sediment pah fluxes were also coincided with local economic development and energy consumption li et al 2019 timoszczuk et al 2021 therefore pah fluxes should be probably linked to anthropogenic carbon emissions in anthropocene in order to explore the underlying relationship between the local pah fluxes and domestic industrialization process as well as anthropogenic carbon emission the domestic economic parameters and co2 emission from different sources were employed to compared with the fluxes of σpahs σlmw pahs σhmw pahs respectively figs 6 and s7 the σpahs σlmw pahs and σhmw pahs fluxes showed high correspondence with chinese gross domestic product gdp coal and electricity consumption since 1950 and displayed similar variation trends to that of co2 emission from fossil fuel coal and oil consumption respectively boden et al 2017 overall pah fluxes in the two sediment cores are strongly correlated with domestic socioeconomic industrial structure and anthropogenic co2 emission in the past 200 years during the pre industrial stage from 1815 to 1890 the whole china was still an agricultural based country and barely had any modern industrial system the main source of pahs were the burning of woods and grass the contribution of anthropogenic co2 was also low and stable therefore the visible increase in pah fluxes and co2 emission is not observed fig 6 during the early industrial period 1890 1978 international conflicts wars happened frequently in northeast china the minor peak around 1890 1905 may correspond to the first sino japanese war during period from 1894 to 1895 and the eight power allied forces invasion of china during the year from 1900 to 1901 several intermittent minor peaks in pah fluxes during period of 1920 1945 were associated with warfare transporting of energy resources such as coal and petroleum and increasing usage of coal for generating electricity steelmaking and building railways in northeast china during japanese occupation 1931 1945 during this period the northeast china took the lead in developing the heavy industry the peaks during the period of 1949 1965 might be associated with rapid economic and industrial developments for the first second and third five year plan 1951 1965 yuan et al 2014 shen et al 2017 at this stage northeast china was developed to be the largest industrial base due to its abundant natural resources and industrialization inheritance the industries including coal crude oil cement iron and steel automobiles and machine tools in northeast china were highly developed and made prominent contributions to china s economy accounting for about 21 of domestic gdp liu et al 2019 the coupled increases in burning pah fluxes and anthropogenic co2 emission was attributed to the product of the first wave of industrialization in china the percentage of four and six rings pahs increased slowly during this period suggesting a gradual slow increase in the contribution of local high temperature combustion from expanding heavy industry to anthropogenic co2 emission however the decrease slow changes in pah fluxes during the year of 1967 1978 was linked to the standstill of industrial development affected by the cultural revolution natural disaster and evacuation of former soviet union in the 1960s yuan et al 2014 during the middle to late industrial stage 1978 2014 the average economic growth rate of china was up to 9 89 lasting for about 30 years which was far higher than the world s average growth rate of high to low income countries chang 2010 the pah fluxes showed general similar rapid growth trend to domestic gdp at the exponential rate but with two troughs around the 1990 and 2005 the first peak during the period of 1978 1990 was in line with first maxima of coal and electricity consumption associated with rapid economic growth and urbanization since the late 1970s when china began to introduce economic reforms however because of resource exhaustion environmental pollution and industry reorganization northeast china experienced an economic recession in the early 1990s the second peak at the interval of 1995 2005 corresponded to the second maxima of coal and electricity consumption it is related to re development of heavy industry as a result of upgrading of the consumption structure accelerating of urbanization and increasing investment in transport and infrastructure during the early 2000s the decrease in government investment to the northeastern china led to economic setback the third peak in the year of 2005 2014 was likely driven by revitalizing old industrial base of northeast china strategy implemented since 2003 resulting in rapid growth and development in manufacturing industry trends of co2 emission from coal and oil correspond well with pah variations during period of 1978 1995 and 1995 2014 the general coupling relationship pearson correlation analysis of r2 0 8 between pah fluxes and anthropogenic co2 emission over the last 200 years indicate that pahs could be possibly regarded as qualitative proxies for recording changes in regional anthropogenic co2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion during the industrial times the mechanism consists in burning of fossil fuels producing plenty of pahs accompanied by massive co2 furthermore the calculation of anthropogenic co2 emission is based on the production or consumption of fossil fuels the usage of fossil fuel mainly coal in highly developed industrial area is the main driver of rapid increase in anthropogenic co2 emission of china since 1949 which results in good correlation between the pah fluxes of heavy industrial region and domestic anthropogenic co2 emission meanwhile differences in variations rate decoupled trend of certain periods such as early industrial period cultural revolution and early 2000s are derived from regional and domestic comparison and indicate variable contribution of region human activities to anthropogenic co2 emission 5 conclusion based on variations characteristics mds results quantitative pattern and diagnostic ratios of pahs the dominating pah sources in heavy industry region of northeast china could be divided into four intervals showing that the main source shifts from combustion of vegetation wood to warfare and wood coal followed by coal and petroleum over the past 200 years the high correlation and similar variation trends between the fluxes of σpahs σlmw pahs and σhmw pahs and chinese gross domestic product gdp anthropogenic co2 emission from fossil fuel coal and oil consumption since the 1950 suggest significant human impact including domestic socioeconomic and industrial structure on pahs accumulation and anthropogenic co2 emission during the anthropocene

15526,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are excellent tracers for fossil fuel combustion natural fires and petroleum contamination and have been widely used for reconstructing past wildfires and industrial activities at a variety of time scales here for the first time we obtain a high resolution annual to decadal scale record of pahs from two parallel marine sediment cores from the liaodong bay northeastern china to reconstruct the industrial activities spanning the past 200 years from 1815 to 2014 our data indicate that pah variations can be divided into four episodes i low probably near background pahs from natural fires and domestic wood combustion during the pre industrial period from 1815 to 1890 ii slightly increased but with large fluctuations pah concentrations derived from intermittent warfare during the world war 1891 1945 and increased industrial activities after 1946 1946 1965 iii a period of stagnation and in some cases reduction in pahs during the cultural revolution 1966 to 1979 and iv a rapid and persistent rise in pahs post 1979 linked to fast economic development with pah concentrations doubled from 1979 to 2014 changes in pah distributions demonstrate major shifts in the dominant types of fuels over time from vegetation wood to coal and wood followed by coal and petroleum including vehicle emissions over the past 200 years we find that pah records also show similar trend to domestic economy and the estimated regional anthropocene co2 emissions from industrial activities suggesting sedimentary pah fluxes could be used as an indirect and qualitative proxy to track the trend for regional anthropogenic co2 emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs fire history industrial revolution diagnostic ratios anthropogenic co2 emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in natural environments can derive from following sources 1 incomplete combustion of wood vegetation fires either domestic or natural wild fires manoli and samara 1999 wang et al 2007 2 incomplete combustion of fossil fuels coal petroleum in internal combustion engines and electric power plants mostert et al 2010 and 3 diagenesis and catagenesis of natural organic matter in sediments xu et al 2019 specifically pahs are abundant in coal and petroleum resulting from diagenesis and thermal maturation of biomass of higher plants algae and microbes over millions of years abdel shafy and mansour 2016 pahs derived from different sources show distinct structural characteristics for example pahs in coals and petroleum derived from natural and slow thermal maturation over the millions or hundred millions of years at relatively low temperatures and high pressures in sediment achten and hofmann 2009 as a result pahs from coal and petroleum are characterized by abundant alkyl substitutions on the aromatic rings russo et al 2019 pahs derived from incomplete combustion of coal and petroleum are generally devoid of methyl and other alkyl substitutions because these alkyl groups are preferentially oxidized relative to aromatic rings during combustion yunker and macdonald 2003 pahs from vegetation fires tend to differ from those from fossil fuels by having fewer alkyl substitutions rocha and palma 2019 in addition the diagnostic ratios of pahs with certain structure features have been used to differentiate coal from petroleum yunker et al 2002 vaezzadeh et al 2021 or petroleum from car emissions pies et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 wood fire derived pahs are suggested to contain relatively high percentages of high molecular weight hmw pahs and high value 0 80 of retene retene chrysene ratio yan et al 2005 therefore examination of structural changes in pah structures in sediment cores can also provide information for the sources of pahs over time pahs in ocean and lake sediments can be used to reconstruct temporal changes in above sources depending on time periods before the industrial revolution pahs in sediments mainly originate from natural wild vegetation fires song et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of pahs and other occurrences in sediments as proxy for past vegetation fires vachula et al 2022 since the industrial revolution however the dominant sources of pahs in ocean and lake sediments have switched to incomplete combustion of coal and petroleum bao et al 2020 and in some cases direct pollution from petroleum spills martins et al 2010 such fossil fuel derived pahs can be collectively grouped into resulting from industrial activities pahs are highly stable organic compounds as the fused aromatic rings are extremely unreactive in natural environments and difficult to use as energy source by microbes in addition pahs can be readily transported to ocean and lake sediments via fluvial or aeolian processes melymuk et al 2014 merhaby et al 2019 therefore sedimentary pahs have been widely and successfully used to record regional industrial activities from high accumulation marine or lake sediment cores timoszczuk et al 2021 pahs from lake sediments often provide more localized signal than those from ocean records for example sun et al evaluated pah variations in sediment cores from three lakes located in northeast china and found that pah concentrations were higher in the industrial areas than that of rural area in daqing city sun et al 2014 tang et al 2015 and li et al 2016 revealed that loading and temporal variations of total pah concentrations in taihu lake and lake chao were consistent with historical economic and social development of the east china over past 120 years tang et al 2015 li et al 2016 in order to provide a larger regional scale estimation of industrial activities ocean sediments would be preferred especially ocean sediments adjacent to major river outlets for example liu et al 2021a measured pah concentrations of surface sediments and core sections from the yellow sea east china sea and south china sea the pah variations were closely associated with the socioeconomic development and historical energy consumption of china from 1840 to 2007 with concentration reduction during the chinese civil war 1946 1949 and cultural revolution 1966 1976 liu et al 2021a b several other pah records have been published from marine sediment sites in the south yellow and east china sea yuan et al 2014 cai et al 2016 these marine records however would mainly reflect both industrial activities in southeastern eastern china marine sites adjacent to yellow river delta in bohai bay are additionally complicated by the frequent changes in its locations of yellow river outlets from 1855 to present yellow river outlet locations experienced four times changes spanning about 160 kms along the coastal region between laizhou bay and bohai bay yu et al 2014 for example yuan et al 2014 reconstructed a historical pah record in old yellow river showing an evident peak during the year of 1976 1999 caused by relocation of the yellow river in 1976 and 1996 respectively yuan et al 2014 similarly hu et al also found pahs are strongly affected by the meandering yellow river outlets in additional to reflecting regional industrial activities hu et al 2011 so far there has been no pah records from ocean sites adjacent to major rivers for the northeastern china historically northeast is the earliest region to industrilize in china and is characterized by the heavy industries e g steel making petrochemical industry and power generation with high fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions thus pah record in northeast china may display different patterns of pah profiles relative to sites of yellow south and east china sea this region has also undergone the heaviest intermittent warfare from 1890 to 1945 in china with periods of major destruction followed by rapid expansion of heavy industrial activities and vice versa therefore our understanding of industrial activities over the anthropocene for china is incomplete without a high resolution record of pahs from ocean sites representing heavy industrial region in northeastern china before 1970s the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to obtain sediment cores from liaodong bay with exceedingly high sediment rate to allow annual to decadal scale reconstruction of past industrial activities over the anthropocene liaodong bay receives sediments from several major local rivers connecting heavy industrial sites to the coastal ports and thus likely to host high accumulation rate sediments the sediments are also likely to contain high abundance of pahs resulting from various human activities 2 to evaluate how total fluxes and different sources e g wood versus fossil fuel origins of pahs may have changed during major historical episodes such as pre industrial early industrial world war and cultural revolution and post 1978 2 materials and methods 2 1 regional setting liaodong bay is one of the three major bays of the bohai sea and located in the northern edge local rivers such as daliao and luan river flow down and deliver plenty of sediments and contaminants into the bay each year zhang et al 2016 yingkou qinhuangdao tangshan and dalian of the bohai sea opened as treaty ports for trading weapons and energy resources during the 1860s to 1890s accounting for over 50 input and exports of china before 1950s today they act as the marine transportation junctions in the north of china for domestic and international trade such as steel non metallic ore coal petroleum cement woods and food cargo and container shipping of these ports handled over 15 million standard containers in 2021 representing about 37 of total input and exports of china the gdp of circum bohai sea region accounted for about 20 of china s gdp since 1970s owing to a cluster of heavy industries especially the oil and gas fields steel works and power stations using billion tons of fossil fuels representing 27 of total energy consumption of china fig 1 these industrial activities in the northeast china plus various shipping exhausts yield large amounts of pahs which are carried by river northwest winter monsoon to liangdong bay the bohai sea is semi enclosed and could only communicate with open ocean by bohai strait the high sedimentation rate and relatively weak ocean current dynamics facilitate the accumulations and preservation of pahs derived from adjacent continents this region also does not have the complications as in the southwest bohai sea fig 1 resulting from frequent changes in the location of yellow river outlets that would change the pah sources and accumulation at any given site therefore the coastal and estuary of liaodong bay are the ideal locations for obtaining continuous regional human activities analyses with relatively stable source areas and sedimentary settings two parallel gravity cores were collected from the organic rich muddy areas near the estuary of daliaohe dlh liaodong bay in september 2014 the high sedimentation rates multiple sources and weak hydrodynamic condition make the liaodong bay be an optimal site for industrial activities analysis the dlhz01 and dlhz02 core sections are 116 cm and 106 cm long respectively with 100 sediment recovery the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 two cores are in situ sub sampled at 2 4 cm intervals for dating 2 cm interval for grain size and pahs analysis to reconstruct the fire changes in northeast china 2 2 dating and grain size measurement the chronology of the two parallel cores was determined by caesium 137 137cs and lead 210 210pb analysis samples for 210pb and 137cs dating were freeze dried weighted 5 g sediments and then packed into tin cups with a plastic cover the radioactivity of 210pb 226ra and 137cs for the sediments were measured by multi channel gamma spectrometry using the gamma emission peaks at 46 5 352 and 661 kev 226ra provided the support for analysis 210pb taken radioactive equilibration between the 226ra and 222rn into consideration 226ra was indirectly tested using its daughter radionuclide 214pb after storage for three weeks the experimental error was 10 with a detection limits of 0 1 bg kg 1 at the 99 confidence level the excess 210pb activity 210pbexc was calculated by subtraction of the supported activity from the total activity the dates of young estuarine sediments determined from 210pbexc were calculated by the constant flux constant sedimentation cfcs and the constant rate of supply crs models appleby et al 1979 powder samples were collected at 2 cm intervals for grain size analysis 0 5 g dried powders samples were added into 10 0 ml 10 h2o2 v v and 10 0 ml 10 hcl v v to remove organic matter and carbonate respectively then grain size distributions were determined using a malvern 2000 laser diffraction instrument the measurement uncertainty for each sample was 2 the 210pb 137cs dating and grain size measurement were conducted at the qingdao institute of marine geology china geological survey qingdao china 2 3 pah analysis freeze dried sediment samples used for extraction were ground to 200 mesh size 80 µm with an agate mortar and pestle then 5 g accuracy 0 1 mg homogenized sediment sample were added into a clean centrifuge tube injected with mixture solution of 10 0 ml of a 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane and 0 1 ml of 10 0 mg l 1 surrogate standard three blank sample were prepared using the same procedure and added with 10 ml of 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane all samples were vortexed by centrifuge rotation for 1 min ultrasonicated for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min to extracts the pahs the upper liquid was transferred into a new clean vial with the activated copper for desulphurization then residual sediments were reextracted twice by the same procedure the liquid extract was further purified with silica gel columns using 1 1 v v dichloromethane n hexane concentrated to 1 0 ml and added into 0 2 ml of 5 mg l 1 internal standard chen and chen 2011 pah measurements were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph equipped with an agilent 5975c mass selective detector and a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm i d 0 25 mm film thickness at the yantai institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences the parameters was set and based on published studies liu et al 2021 high purity helium was used as carrier gas with constant flow rate of 1 83 ml min 1 the temperatures of the injector and transfer lines were 280 c and 300 c respectively the initial oven temperature was set at 60 c for 5 min elevated to 280 c at a heating rate of 3 c min 1 and held for 30 min mass spectrometry was acquired using the electron ionization and selective ion monitoring modes the single pah for each sample was identified by the retention time external pah standards and characteristic mass fragments 15 pahs were quantified using an internal standard hexamethylbenzene and by the proportional relation of the peak areas in the chromatographs of the characteristic ions for each biomarker the concentrations of pah compounds were expressed on a dry weight basis detailed information and analyses for pah parameters are provided in supplementary materials tables s1 s2 and fig s1 3 results 3 1 sediment composition and age model the sediments of core dlhz01 comprise of grayish yellow sand and silt the mean gran size shows a distinct gradually increase from top to bottom ranging from 3 8 to 6 2 φ fig 2 a the decreasing trend in mean grain size from bottom to top infers that the sedimentary hydrodynamic tends to be weaker however the sediments of dlhz02 core mainly consist of black gray silt and clay the mean grain size of core dlhz02 varies from 5 0 to 6 9 φ suggesting relatively stable sedimentary environment and weak hydrodynamic condition fig 2b these two cores are analyzed to assess reproduction and fidelity of the pahs to indicate linkages to industrial revolution process the short lived radionuclides 210pb and 137cs is characterized by different half lives it has been widely applied to establish the age mode of undisturbed sediment archives over the past 100 150 years appleby et al 1979 foucher et al 2021 the 137cs fallout peaks recorded in sediment sequences are upwardly associated with the world frequent atomic bomb testing at 1963 and 1975 fallout release from the accident at chernobyl and fukushima daiichi nuclear station in 1986 and 2011 respectively however it is hard to detect 137cs peaks of coastal core samples of china due to the low concentration clay composition organic matter and hydrodynamic effects liu et al 2011 the 137cs activity of dlhz01 displays two dramatic increases at the depth of 18 cm and 54 cm that are considered to be fukushima daiichi nuclear accidents fallout at 2011 and the maximum atmospheric radionuclide fallout deposition at 1963 fig 2a but 137cs activities of dlhz02 shows no evident peaks against the depth variations fig 2b in general the 137cs activities ranging from 0 to 6 bq kg 1 are too low to provide reliable anchoring points the age control points are cross validated by following 210pb results in contrast to 137cs the 210pbexc is used as a continuous time marker to reconstruct sedimentation rates for the last 100 to 150 years bruel and sabatier 2020 the evolution of 210pbexc activities against depth in sediment cores follows an exponential decrease from which it is possible to calculate the sedimentation rates in this study the chronology of the two cores are established based on both of cfcs and crs 210pb models lan et al 2020 the crs ages are generally consistent with the 137cs based ages since 1964 for dlhz01 core fig 2a the average sedimentary rate of dlhz01 and dlhz02 are 1 11 cm year 1 and 1 48 cm year 1 lasting for 200 and 160 years respectively 3 2 downcore pah variations pah concentrations in sediments are affected by multiple factors including sediment composition organic content or grain size de abreu mota et al 2014 based on correlation analysis the coefficient determinations between grain size and pah compositions range from 0 49 to 0 64 for dlhz 01 and from 0 29 to 0 41 for dlhz02 table s2 indicating grain size influence on pah accumulations of two cores therefore the pah fluxes are applied to explore the relationship between the pah parameters and industrial revolution process in following section the concentrations of σpahs of core dlhz01 ranges from 12 18 to 430 96 ng g 1 with an average value of 134 96 ng g 1 fig 3 the sediments show higher concentration of hmw pahs mean value of 113 02 ng g 1 and mostly consist of four and five ring pahs accounting for over 60 in addition the four ring pahs are highest in content average percentage of 42 92 followed by five average percentage of 24 65 and three ring pahs average percentage of 17 40 descriptive statistics for each indicator are shown in figs s1a and s1c the pahs of liaodong bay are characterized by the dominant 3 4 ring pahs about 60 3 6 5 the weighted average of ring number average value of 4 4 0 1 is significantly lower than those dominated by 5 6 ring pahs with average of ring number of 4 9 from south and east china sea fig s2 liu et al 2021b increased low molecular weight lmw pahs may indicate more contribution from fluvial path because lmw pahs are more susceptible to volatilization and photodegradation melymuk et al 2014 whereas association with clay during fluvial transport can protect lmw pahs from microbial degradation duan et al 2015 thus long range aeolian transport would deplete lmw pahs and enrich in hmw phas ruiz fernández et al 2014 our data suggest that pahs in eastern liaodong bay are more likely transported by rivers and ocean currents additional reasons for the relative enrichment of pahs with smaller number of rings in the lioadong bay include the lower regional temperatures than those of the south and east china lower temperatures would decrease the loss of lmw pahs by reducing evaporation and retarding microbial degradations the σpahs concentrations reduce gradually from top to bottom with an exponential rate the other indicators such as concentrations of σlmw pahs σhmw pahs and four ring pahs display similar variations to that of σpahs figs 3 and s3 based on variation characteristics changes in pahs concentrations could be divided into four units including unit ⅰ 0 42 cm 1979 2014 rapid increase stage ⅱ 42 48 cm 1966 1978 a trough ⅲ 48 110 cm 1890 1965 slow increase stage and ⅳ 110 106 cm 1815 1890 stable stage furthermore although pah concentrations between the dhlz01 and dhlz02 differ by only approximately 13 throughout the core the pah proxies of dlhz02 also manifest the same exponential variation pattern as that of dlhz01 the percentages of different pah indicators are almost the same figs s1b and s1d suggesting that variation of pah concentrations is reproducible 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of sediment pahs and inferences for pah origins changes in pah structures can be used as indicators to assess the distribution pattern as well as to distinguish the types of combustion source du and jing 2018 for example phenanthrene anthracene phe an an an phe flu flu pyr icdp icdp bghip and baa baa chr ratios abbreviations in table s1 are applied to provide information on the source recognition katsoyiannis et al 2011 jautzy et al 2013 in general petrogenic source pahs are abundant in lmw pahs with a severe depletion of hmw pahs while pyrogenic sources pahs formed at high temperatures are less alkylated and their molecules contain more fused aromatic rings than petrogenic pahs zakaria et al 2002 therefore the an an phe ratio is useful for identifying petrogenic sources whereas flu flu pyr baa baa chr and icdp icdp bghip are better for identifying pyrolytic sources vaezzadeh et al 2021 the analysis of pahs cross plots for diagnostic ratios suggested mixed pyrogenic source wood coal combustion and vehicle emission of pahs fig s4 in order to distinguish different dominant sources over the past 200 years multi dimensional scaling mds analyses fig 4 of pah concentrations ages as well as five diagnostic ratios including phe an fla fla pyr icdp icdp bghip baa baa chr and σlmw pahs σhmw pahs were applied to ascertain the similarities in variation trend and source of pahs among the samples moon et al 2007 our mds analysis showed that samples of dlhz01 were divided into five groups since 1815 corresponding to intervals of 1815 1890 1890 1945 1945 1965 1965 1979 and 1979 to 2014 fig 4 although mds result could not identify the specific source the sample position of each group located close inner or near the circles suggested similar source of pahs combined with the results of quantitative pah patterns the main source of five groups could be classified into four intervals including wood interval 1815 1890 warfare interval 1890 1945 coal and wood interval 1945 1979 coal and vehicle emission interval 1979 2014 during the year of 1815 1890 the phe an ratio between 7 and 10 and fla fla pyr ratio ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 suggested possible main grass wood or coal sources fig s4 turgut et al 2017 the relative high percentage of three rings pahs mostly formed during natural diagenesis petroleum products and incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass at low to moderate temperatures wang et al 2017 pointed to the main source of pahs associated with the living activities and wildfire of burning the grass and woods during the interval of 1890 1945 most of phe an ratios of two cores showed higher value ranging from 6 to 9 relative to that during 1979 2014 fla fla pyr ratio 0 5 and baa baa chr ratio 0 35 were observed for all the samples in dhlz01 and dhlz02 fig s4 implying the mixing source of woods coal combustion and vehicle emission akyüz and çabuk 2010 however automobiles were uncommon during this stage the pah patterns were featured by decrease in percentage of three rings pahs but increase in percentage of four and six rings pahs fig s5 probably resulting from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels at high temperatures bandowe et al 2018 in addition phenanthrene which is used in the manufacturing of explosives saadi et al 2019 also showed evident variations with high peaks during 1890 1945 these implies major pah sources derived from the intermittent warfare in the northeast china during the period of 1945 1966 phe an ratios tended to have lower values 4 to 8 with icdp icdp bghip ratio 0 5 fig s4 indicating that the usage of coal for production activities and wood for domestic activities were the two dominated pah sources the gradual decrease in two rings pahs but increase in three and four rings pahs also support such change in dominant pah sources fig s5 at the interval of 1978 2014 phe an ratio between 3 and 6 and baa baa chr and icdp icdp bghip ratio 0 5 indicated the main source from the coal combustion for industrial manufacture petroleum burning for transportation and industrial production which leaded to the rapid increase in four from 38 to 46 and six rings pahs from 7 to 22 fig s5 4 2 spatial difference of pah records in adjacent oceans of southern eastern and northeastern china and implications pah records of two cores from liaodong bay located near the northeastern corner of bahai sea fig 1 are generally not affected by yellow river discharges so far there have been no published pah data from this region a number of southward flowing rivers namely liaohe daliaohe daling and xiaoling rivers provide the main sediment sources into this region these rivers plus northwest winter monsoon and westerly are likely the main carriers of pahs to our study site therefore pahs record of liaodong bay likely reflecte a larger scale influences of anthropogenic activities in the northeast china there are over ten published anthropocene pah records in ocean sites near major river outlets in southern eastern and northeastern china liu et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 pah profiles from lh4 in linhong river estuary zhang et al 2013 1 2 and s1 in pearl river outlet peng et al 2007 liu et al 2021b have been interpreted to reflect evolution of natural vegetation fires biomass burning domestic and industrial fossil fuel combustion on the adjacent provinces in the eastern and southern china during the anthropocene respectively however pah records of bc1 and bc2 from bohai bay likely reflect combined influence from both human activities and natural factors hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2014 the sediments of two sites were delivered mainly by yellow river partial by luanhe river and haihe river yellow river was characterized by extremely high suspended sediment load van maren et al 2009 thus interpretation of pah records as integrated regional industrial activities from sites adjacent to the yellow river delta could be greatly affected by major changes in sedimentation and delivery due to river fluctuations since 1855 yellow river has experienced four times of major shift in its course between bohai bay and laizhou bay in the year of 1996 1976 1964 and 1953 hu et al 2011 as a result pah records of y1 bc1 and bc2 in bohai bay differed greatly from each other fig 5 with each core showing evidence peaks at different times therefore changes in pah concentrations of bohai bay may mainly reflect varied sediment contribution from the yellow river and could not provide a truthful integration of regional industrial activities over time accounting for the effect of inorganic sediment fluxes on the pah records it is possible pah fluxes rather than concentrations from y1 bc1 and bc2 may yield a more uniform picture of pah changes over time compared with these existing pah profiles the major differences as well as similarities of variation rate and trend are observed among the pah records of liaodong bay yellow and south china sea fig s6 in general the rates of pah increases from 1815 to 2014 of pah concentrations decreased from north to south specifically pah concentrations of laizhou bay increased 35 times from 12 18 to 403 96 ng g 1 from 1890 to 2014 while pah concentrations of ys2 and s1 only rose 3 and 2 times from 1890 to 2007 respectively figs 5 and s6 pah concentrations during period of 1979 2014 increased 4 times in liaodong bay but only rose about 0 5 times in ys2 and 0 3 times and s1 from 1979 to 2007 fig s6 this difference can be explained by the fact that the daily coal and coke consumption accounts for over 70 of total energy consumption in northeast china and about five times higher than that in south china about 50 liu et al 2021a in addition the south china sea are featured by stronger hydrodynamic conditions than yellow sea and bohai sea strong ocean currents could disperse pahs to broader ocean areas hence reduce the pah fluctuations thus the varied increase rate of pah concentrations from north to south was likely caused by difference in both amount of energy consumption and hydrodynamic conditions among each region liu et al 2021b furthermore as to the spatial variation trend pah records of dlhz01 ys2 and s1 general increased from 1805 to present the minor changes in pah concentration of dlhz01 ys2 and s1 during the 1810 to 1890 indicated a low background pollution level linked to an agricultural dominated economy the standstill or decrease of pah concentrations during 1966 to 1978 in these three sites were linked to cultural revolution liu et al 2021b however due to the difference in industrial development between south and northeast china the pah concentrations of dlhz01 were featured by discrete peaks associated with intermittent warfare in northeast of china at the interval of 1890 to 1945 while pah concentrations of s2 displayed slow gradual increase since 1920 linked with the growth of industries caused by the military in south china liu et al 2021b during post 1978 pah records of ys2 and s1 manifested decline trend from 1995 to 2007 inconsistent with current day economic development and was possibly attributed to reduction proportional use of domestic coal and increasing consumption of cleaner energies natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas liu et al 2021a b while high resolution pahs record of dhlz01 was featured by three peaks during 1979 2014 with rapid increase rate linked to rising energy main coal combustion consumption for economy development 4 3 linkages with industrialization process and anthropogenic carbon emissions the diagnostic ratios of the two cores demonstrated that the main sources of pahs were woods coal as well as liquid fossil fuels combustion previous studies suggested that gdp growth was strongly associated with the increases in both energy consumption and co2 emissions raupach et al 2007 adedoyin et al 2020 meanwhile the sediment pah fluxes were also coincided with local economic development and energy consumption li et al 2019 timoszczuk et al 2021 therefore pah fluxes should be probably linked to anthropogenic carbon emissions in anthropocene in order to explore the underlying relationship between the local pah fluxes and domestic industrialization process as well as anthropogenic carbon emission the domestic economic parameters and co2 emission from different sources were employed to compared with the fluxes of σpahs σlmw pahs σhmw pahs respectively figs 6 and s7 the σpahs σlmw pahs and σhmw pahs fluxes showed high correspondence with chinese gross domestic product gdp coal and electricity consumption since 1950 and displayed similar variation trends to that of co2 emission from fossil fuel coal and oil consumption respectively boden et al 2017 overall pah fluxes in the two sediment cores are strongly correlated with domestic socioeconomic industrial structure and anthropogenic co2 emission in the past 200 years during the pre industrial stage from 1815 to 1890 the whole china was still an agricultural based country and barely had any modern industrial system the main source of pahs were the burning of woods and grass the contribution of anthropogenic co2 was also low and stable therefore the visible increase in pah fluxes and co2 emission is not observed fig 6 during the early industrial period 1890 1978 international conflicts wars happened frequently in northeast china the minor peak around 1890 1905 may correspond to the first sino japanese war during period from 1894 to 1895 and the eight power allied forces invasion of china during the year from 1900 to 1901 several intermittent minor peaks in pah fluxes during period of 1920 1945 were associated with warfare transporting of energy resources such as coal and petroleum and increasing usage of coal for generating electricity steelmaking and building railways in northeast china during japanese occupation 1931 1945 during this period the northeast china took the lead in developing the heavy industry the peaks during the period of 1949 1965 might be associated with rapid economic and industrial developments for the first second and third five year plan 1951 1965 yuan et al 2014 shen et al 2017 at this stage northeast china was developed to be the largest industrial base due to its abundant natural resources and industrialization inheritance the industries including coal crude oil cement iron and steel automobiles and machine tools in northeast china were highly developed and made prominent contributions to china s economy accounting for about 21 of domestic gdp liu et al 2019 the coupled increases in burning pah fluxes and anthropogenic co2 emission was attributed to the product of the first wave of industrialization in china the percentage of four and six rings pahs increased slowly during this period suggesting a gradual slow increase in the contribution of local high temperature combustion from expanding heavy industry to anthropogenic co2 emission however the decrease slow changes in pah fluxes during the year of 1967 1978 was linked to the standstill of industrial development affected by the cultural revolution natural disaster and evacuation of former soviet union in the 1960s yuan et al 2014 during the middle to late industrial stage 1978 2014 the average economic growth rate of china was up to 9 89 lasting for about 30 years which was far higher than the world s average growth rate of high to low income countries chang 2010 the pah fluxes showed general similar rapid growth trend to domestic gdp at the exponential rate but with two troughs around the 1990 and 2005 the first peak during the period of 1978 1990 was in line with first maxima of coal and electricity consumption associated with rapid economic growth and urbanization since the late 1970s when china began to introduce economic reforms however because of resource exhaustion environmental pollution and industry reorganization northeast china experienced an economic recession in the early 1990s the second peak at the interval of 1995 2005 corresponded to the second maxima of coal and electricity consumption it is related to re development of heavy industry as a result of upgrading of the consumption structure accelerating of urbanization and increasing investment in transport and infrastructure during the early 2000s the decrease in government investment to the northeastern china led to economic setback the third peak in the year of 2005 2014 was likely driven by revitalizing old industrial base of northeast china strategy implemented since 2003 resulting in rapid growth and development in manufacturing industry trends of co2 emission from coal and oil correspond well with pah variations during period of 1978 1995 and 1995 2014 the general coupling relationship pearson correlation analysis of r2 0 8 between pah fluxes and anthropogenic co2 emission over the last 200 years indicate that pahs could be possibly regarded as qualitative proxies for recording changes in regional anthropogenic co2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion during the industrial times the mechanism consists in burning of fossil fuels producing plenty of pahs accompanied by massive co2 furthermore the calculation of anthropogenic co2 emission is based on the production or consumption of fossil fuels the usage of fossil fuel mainly coal in highly developed industrial area is the main driver of rapid increase in anthropogenic co2 emission of china since 1949 which results in good correlation between the pah fluxes of heavy industrial region and domestic anthropogenic co2 emission meanwhile differences in variations rate decoupled trend of certain periods such as early industrial period cultural revolution and early 2000s are derived from regional and domestic comparison and indicate variable contribution of region human activities to anthropogenic co2 emission 5 conclusion based on variations characteristics mds results quantitative pattern and diagnostic ratios of pahs the dominating pah sources in heavy industry region of northeast china could be divided into four intervals showing that the main source shifts from combustion of vegetation wood to warfare and wood coal followed by coal and petroleum over the past 200 years the high correlation and similar variation trends between the fluxes of σpahs σlmw pahs and σhmw pahs and chinese gross domestic product gdp anthropogenic co2 emission from fossil fuel coal and oil consumption since the 1950 suggest significant human impact including domestic socioeconomic and industrial structure on pahs accumulation and anthropogenic co2 emission during the anthropocene

15527,phytoplankton biomass can significantly affect metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton but the underlying mechanisms are still controversial we investigated the bioaccumulation of eight metal

seasons in the yangtze river delta china our results highlight phytoplankton biomass is the major driver on metal loid bioaccumulation in the studied anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes mainly via affecting site specific water physiochemical characteristics and plankton communities however such impact is highly dependent on chlorophyll a chl a concentration the bioaccumulation of metal loid s in size fractionated plankton declined significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a was below 50 μg l 1 mainly owing to the reduced metal loid bioavailability and subsequent bioaccumulation at more productive sites with elevated ph and dissolved organic carbon rather than algal bloom dilution to a lesser extent phytoplankton growth dilution and the smaller body size of zooplankton at more productive sites also contributed to the lower metal loid bioaccumulation the bioaccumulation of metal loid s was enhanced under severe algal bloom conditions when chl a concentration was higher than 50 μg l 1 although the underlying mechanisms still require further investigations the potential risks of metal loid bioaccumulation under severe algal bloom conditions

bioaccumulation and toxicity in aquatic biota ali and khan 2018 anandkumar et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems metal loid bioconcentration via dissolved uptake in phytoplankton and bioaccumulation via dissolved uptake and dietary ingestion in zooplankton as the primary entry point of metal loid s into pelagic food webs could be further transferred to predators chen and folt 2000 griboff et al 2018 kainz et al 2006 wang et al 2011 it appears that metal loid burdens in pelagic fish could not be simply predicted by aqueous metal loid concentrations but are highly dependent on metal loid contents in plankton chen et al 2000 fang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 among aquatic ecosystems there are often significant variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton across lakes which were highly associated with varying intrinsic water physicochemical characteristics and plankton communities for example the dissolved organic carbon doc and ph of water could alter metal loid bioavailability and subsequent planktonic bioaccumulation as supported by both field investigations macmillan et al 2019 ogorek et al 2021 and biokinetic studies komjarova and blust 2009 vigneault and campbell 2005 yu and wang 2002a site specific phytoplankton density chen and folt 2000 and zooplankton taxa long et al 2018 could also contribute to the site to site variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in addition diet quality and food abundance have been recognized as crucial factors in altering dietary metal loid accumulation by modulating diet specific assimilation and elimination processes in zooplankton tsui and wang 2007 yu and wang 2002b while high growth rate could reduce metal loid bioaccumulation via growth dilution karimi et al 2007 sunda and huntsman 1998 therefore it is challenging but critical to identify the driving factors in metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton across lakes for understanding the large regional variations in metal loid burdens in pelagic fish metal loid contents especially widely reported for hg in plankton and fish are commonly higher in cold and low productive lakes compared to those in eutrophic lakes chen et al 2008 lavoie et al 2013 skei et al 2000 wu et al 2019 to explain such intriguing worldwide observation previous studies examined the relationships between metal loid contents i e as pb hg in plankton and plankton density biomass across lakes with different trophic status in north america chen and folt 2000 2005 and ascribed the observed negative correlations to a phenomenon termed as algal bloom dilution assuming that the pool of a certain contaminant is finite and uptake by individual cells is constant the important role of algal bloom dilution on regulating mass specific hg burdens in plankton was further verified under laboratory conditions with varying nutrient additions pickhardt et al 2002 nevertheless such negative correlations between metal loid contents and plankton biomass were not observed in many subtropical and tropical regions such as within baihua reservoir for hg long et al 2018 across three lakes in southwestern china for zn cu fe mn pb cr cd and ni long et al 2016 and across eight african lakes with different trophic status for hg poste et al 2015 considering that algal bloom is always associated with alterations in water physiochemical characteristics and planktonic communities amorim and moura 2021 sim et al 2020 we hypothesize that the above inconsistent findings might be attribute to the impacts of algal biomass associated confounding factors i e ph doc and planktonic communities on metal loid bioaccumulation process which may counteract with the phenomenon of algal bloom dilution here we conducted a comprehensive field study to explore how phytoplankton biomass controls metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton in six anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes with varying trophic status located in the yangtze river delta yrd china the primary objectives of this study were 1 to examine metal loid and biota specific bioaccumulation of metal loid s as co cu hg mn pb se and zn from lake water to three size categories of planktonic organisms including seston 0 7 64 μm mesozooplankton 200 500 μm and macrozooplankton 500 μm 2 to investigate the role of water physiochemical characteristics including water temperature ph chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn doc and planktonic communities including phytoplankton and zooplankton densities species compositions and zooplankton body size on metal loid bioaccumulation 3 to explore how phytoplankton biomass controls metal loid bioaccumulation and whether algal bloom dilution plays the key role in regulating planktonic metal loid bioaccumulation in anthropogenic impacted lakes in subtropical regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the yrd region covers 211 000 km2 with over 153 million people there are over 200 lakes widely distributed in the yrd making this region known as the land of fish and rice over thousands of years as one of the most socially and economically developed regions in china the yrd is also recognized as one of the world class mega city clusters which endures strong impacts of urbanization anthropogenic inputs of nutrients have largely elevated the nutrient levels in the surrounding aquatic ecosystems resulting in widespread eutrophication in lakes of the yrd the field study was conducted in six important freshwater lakes located in the yrd fig 1 see more details in table 1 four natural shallow lakes were sampled including dianshan lake ds gehu lake gh hongze lake hz and taihu lake th with average water depth 2 m table 1 among them th and hz are the third and fourth largest freshwater lakes in china two reservoir type lakes were also sampled including tianmu lake tm and qiandao lake qd with average water depth of 19 and 37 m respectively table 1 the lakes hz qd and th each 500 km2 table 1 were sampled from one offshore a and one nearshore b site fig 1 and table 1 while the other three lakes were sampled at one site close to the center each site was sampled twice in fall 2018 october and november and spring 2019 april and may respectively all the studied lakes are important sources of drinking water and aquatic products for the surrounding cities as well as popular recreational venues for local people nevertheless most of the selected lakes are facing metal loid contamination problems especially those shallow lakes li et al 2011 niu et al 2020 wu et al 2017 owing to the massive industrial wastewater inputs from the surrounding highly industrialized cities 2 2 field sampling water and plankton samples were collected using nonmetallic sampling apparatus and following

aqueous metal loid concentrations were measured from the sampled two or three different water layers with three replicates for each layer water temperature and ph were measured in the field with a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer hq40d hach usa tp and tn were quantified using the potassium persulfate oxidation method gb 11893 89 and gb 11894 89 respectively chl a as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass was extracted with 95 ethanol lorenzen 2003 and analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometer evolution 201 thermo fisher scientific usa doc was analyzed directly using a toc analyzer

method 200 8 1994 seston on filters and zooplankton samples were freeze dried and digested in 10 ml 30 nitric acid v v for 12 h at 60 c in the oven external quality control for all the tested metal loid s was performed by digesting and analyzing comparable amount of standard reference materials plankton bcr 414 irmm with known metal loid contents recovery rates for all the tested metal loid s ranged between 90 and 109 blanks certified reference materials and sample duplicates were measured every twenty samples the relative standard deviations of the measured parallel samples were mostly within 10 2 4 statistical analyses to better reflect the whole column water characteristics of each site water physiochemical characteristics and aqueous metal loid concentrations used in the following calculation or statistical analyses were all mean values calculated from the sampled two or three different water layers the trophic status of each sampling site was assessed based on tp concentrations lampert and sommer 2007 according to the following classifications tp 5 μg l 1 indicates ultra oligotrophic 5 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 indicates oligotrophic 10 μg l 1 tp 30 μg l 1 indicates mesotrophic 30 μg l 1 tp 100 μg l 1 indicates eutrophic and tp 100 μg l 1 indicates hypereutrophic metal loid bioconcentration factor bcf ml g 1 considering uptake from water for seston and bioaccumulation factor baf ml g 1 considering the contributions of both waterborne and dietborne pathways for mesozooplankton and macrozooplankton were calculated by dividing metal loid concentrations in seston or zooplankton μg g 1 dry wt by aqueous metal loid concentrations μg l 1 mean value of different water layers significant differences among metal loid bcf and baf meso and macro were performed through one way anova followed by tukey s post hoc test to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations on metal loid bioaccumulation paired t test analysis was performed to examine the difference of lake water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf between the two seasons considering no significant seasonal variations were observed for the tested water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf across the sampling sites seasonal variations were not further discussed in this study pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to test the relationships among water characteristics and between water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf linear regressions were performed to test the relationships between phytoplankton biomass indicated by chl a and phytoplankton density and metal loid bcf or baf the vertical migration of zooplankton would result in ingestion of phytoplankton from the whole water column therefore in this study the mean value of chl a at each site calculated from the data of two or three different water layers with three replicated for each layer was considered as a better indicator rather than phytoplankton density data measured only in surface water canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed to assess the differences among phytoplankton species on seston metal loid bcf as well as zooplankton community compositions on zooplankton metal loid baf all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 22 0 the significance levels for all tests were set at p 0 05 the distribution map of sampling sites was drawn using arcgis 10 7 the data graphs were plotted using r script 1 3 959 and graphpad prism 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton aqueous dissolved metal loid concentrations in the current study as shown in table s1 for mean values of two or three water layers and table s2 for detailed concentrations of each water layers are generally comparable to previous reports in lakes of eastern china guo et al 2020 razavi et al 2015 among the tested metal loid s zn 11 2 93 0 μg l 1 based on data of all studied sites same below and mn 3 66 93 0 μg l 1 exhibited the highest values while hg showed the lowest concentrations range 0 21 2 73 ng l 1 mean 1 14 ng l 1 the metal loid contents in size fractionated plankton seston meso and macro zooplankton varied largely across different sites table s3 but were generally comparable with those reported in lakes table s4 within the same geographic regions e g lake taihu yu et al 2012 seven reservoirs in eastern china razavi et al 2015 or lakes of other countries regions e g lake yeniçaga in turkey saygi and yigit 2012 three lakes in southwestern china long et al 2018 2016 lake bolshoy vudyavr in russia pavlova et al 2019 except that zn average 5800 μg g 1 and mn average 736 μg g 1 contents in seston were noticeably higher in our study such higher zn and mn contents in seston might be highly attributed to the higher zn and mn concentrations in lake water but also related to the different size fractions used for seston phytoplankton sampling across studies table s4 in the current study we used 0 7 64 μm as the size fraction for seston sampling this seston size fraction incorporated a certain proportion of smaller phytoplankton or other particles with higher surface area to volume ratios compared to those size fractions of seston phytoplankton in most of previous studies 30 μm saygi and yigit 2012 74 μm yu et al 2012 29 μm pavlova et al 2019 thus might partly accounting for the observed higher metal loid burdens the calculated metal loid specific seston bcfs and zooplankton meso and macro bafs are presented in fig 2 and table s4 the metal loid seston bcf exhibited large differences among metal loid s mainly due to the metal loid specific bioaccumulation processes the seston bcf and zooplankton baf for hg fig 2 and table s4 were significantly higher than those of other metal loid s which was in accord with the widely observed high bioaccumulation potential of hg owing its specific chemical properties bjørklund et al 2017 the seston bcf values fig 2 and table s4 of essential elements zn mn cu and co were generally higher than those of non essential elements pb and as except for hg which may be largely explained by the physiological requirements for essential elements the seston bcf of all the tested metal loid s except se were significantly higher than the corresponding zooplankton meso and macro baf across the sampling sites fig 2 and table s4 probably owing to the greater contribution of metal loid adsorption onto the surface of seston with higher surface area to volume ratio than zooplankton in contrast there was no significant differences in metal loid baf between the two size categories of zooplankton fig 2 and table s4 importantly the seston bcf and zooplankton meso and macro baf of the tested eight metal loid s showed large variations across sites table s4 which could be highly attributed to the site specific water characteristics and plankton communities discussed in detail below 3 2 impacts of water characteristics on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton the average water temperature of these lakes in fall 2018 and spring 2019 were 18 6 1 0 c and 19 1 0 8 c respectively as shown in table s5 for mean values of two or three water layers and table s6 for detailed water characteristics of different water layers same below for other water characteristics if not otherwise specified all lakes were alkaline ph values ranging from 7 1 to 9 3 but varied greatly in tp 40 240 μg l 1 tn 1 1 2 7 mg l 1 chl a 1 2 160 μg l 1 doc 2 9 9 5 mg l 1 phytoplankton density 3 9 105 9 2 108 cells l 1 zooplankton density 127 570 cells l 1 and zooplankton biomass 0 33 1 26 mg l 1 the seston bcfs of the tested eight metal loid s showed 5 36 times variations across sites calculated based on the data range of metal loid specific bcf as shown in table s4 which can be partly explained by the differences of water characteristics among each sampling site the site specific seston bcfs were significantly negatively correlated with ph p 0 05 for all metal loid s except zn and doc for cu r 0 486 p 0 05 but showed weaker relationships with other environmental variables fig 3 and table s7 indicating that ph and doc played key roles in reducing metal loid bioavailability and subsequent bioconcentration in seston mostly phytoplankton the negative relationships between ph and metal loid bcf could not be explained by the competition between protons and metal loid ions to biotic ligands as expected in biotic ligand model slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 but may related with the increase of total free metal loid concentrations due to protonation of complexing agents and the impact of ph on the formation of potentially bioavailable metal loid complexes can also account for the negative relationships between ph and metal loid bcf xu et al 2012 the lower metal loid bcf in seston at sites with higher doc levels figs 3 and s1 might be attribute to the formation of less bioavailable metal loid complexes with organic matter macoustra et al 2019 vigneault and campbell 2005 the bafs of the tested eight metal loid s in zooplankton exhibited 4 165 times differences across sites calculated based on the data range of metal loid specific baf as shown in table s4 biokinetic studies have predicted that both dietary ingestion and dissolved uptake are important metal loid exposure pathways for zooplankton wang and fisher 1998 yu and wang 2002a first similar with the results for seston the varying ph and doc across sites were crucial factors in controlling the dissolved uptake of metal loid s in zooplankton fan et al 2012 komjarova and blust 2009 wu et al 2019 which can be explained by the negative relationships of ph mostly r 0 5 p 0 05 and doc mostly r 0 2 p 0 05 with metal loid baf in zooplankton fig 3 and table s7 although tn generally exhibited negative correlations with metal loid baf in zooplankton mostly r 0 2 fig 3 and table s7 n additions could not lead to significant effect on metal loid accumulation in zooplankton yu and wang 2004 second ingestion of seston could largely account for the lower metal loid baf in zooplankton at productive sites as supported by the similar patterns between metal loid bcf in seston versus metal loid baf in zooplankton with environmental variables such as chl a ph and doc fig 3 although there were strong negative correlations between zooplankton density biomass and metal loid bcf mostly r 0 5 p 0 05 fig 3 or baf mostly r 0 2 p 0 05 fig 3 such relationships should be spurious correlations ascribing to the positive correlations between metal loid concentrations in water and zooplankton density biomass table s7a 3 3 impacts of plankton community on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton phytoplankton community compositions differed across lakes and showed site specific seasonal variations fig 4 a the prominent phytoplankton of the sampled two sites at th was cyanobacteria both in fall and spring 85 99 whereas diatoms were the most abundant about 90 phytoplankton at gh in both seasons the site to site differences in dominant phytoplankton species might be attribute to complex impacts of site specific environmental variables such as light nutrients water temperature etc kakouei et al 2022 in contrast the phytoplankton community compositions at other lakes exhibited strong seasonal variations fig 4a for example the dominant phytoplankton at ds shifted from cyanobacteria about 98 in fall to diatoms about 77 in spring while the main species at tm tended to change from diatoms about 75 in fall to cyanobacteria about 78 in spring at qd chlorophytes and cryptophytes contributed more than 90 of the total phytoplankton in fall but the major phytoplankton species shifted to diatoms and cyanobacteria 99 in total in spring such large seasonal variations might be related with seasonal changes of site specific environmental drivers for each phylum for example n p ratio showed significant effects on seasonal dynamics of chlorophytes li et al 2021 while ph dissolved oxygen transparency and colored doc have been reported to influence seasonal variations of diatoms in subtropical lakes li et al 2021 sullivan et al 2022 lake to lake differences and seasonal shifts in phytoplankton species fig 4a can be a crucial factor in regulating seston bcf across sites testing the relationships between species specific phytoplankton abundance and metal loid seston bcf via cca fig 5 a it was evident that the dominance of cyanobacteria was markedly contributed to zn bioaccumulation while pyrophyte cyanobacteria and cryptophyte positively were related to as bioaccumulation for the bioaccumulation of other tested metal loid s cryptophyte and chlorophyte turned out to be the most important contributors such differences can be highly attributed to the species specific bioaccumulation of phytoplankton owing to its differences in cell size shape surface area to volume ratios cottingham 1999 kim et al 2014 the community compositions of zooplankton differed across lakes but remained relatively constant between the two seasons fig 4b rotifers dominated zooplankton community in the six lakes contributing 40 84 of the total zooplankton abundance in contrast the biomass share of rotifers fig s2 was markedly lower than those of cladocerans and copepods across all the sampling sites owing to the smaller biovolume of rotifer in relative to crustacean for crustaceans the relative abundance and biomass share of cladocera were higher than those of copepoda at gh and ds compared to the other four lakes figs 4b and s2 the site specific biomass share of zooplankton fig s2 could at least partly explain the variation in zooplankton baf across sites testing the relationships between species specific zooplankton biomass 200 μm and metal loid zooplankton baf meso fig 5b the cca results showed that the biomass share of copepod was positively correlated with the bioaccumulation of most of the tested metal loid s except zn in contrast the biomass share of cladocera was related with zn bioaccumulation while rotifer showed no relationship with any of the tested metal loid s similarly zooplankton community compositions have also been reported to be strongly correlated with hg contents in zooplankton long et al 2018 and accounted for the temporal differences in as and pb bioaccumulation in zooplankton chen and folt 2000 3 4 controlling of phytoplankton biomass on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton the primary observation of this study was that the metal loid bcf or baf of size fractionated plankton in the studied six lakes in the yrd decreased figs 6 7 and s3 with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations were below 50 μg l 1 similar relationships also existed between metal loid bcf or baf in size fractionated plankton and phytoplankton density in surface water layer fig s4 a similar but different phenomenon reported previously was that the increase in phytoplankton biomass could result in lower mass specific burdens of contaminants in phytoplankton and subsequently transfer to zooplankton known as algal bloom dilution pickhardt et al 2002 for example plankton biomass has been observed to be negatively correlated with planktonic organochlorine levels across 33 lakes in southern ontario taylor et al 1991 and with planktonic polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations in lake ontario dachs et al 2000 field observations also showed that high plankton densities could reduce hg biomagnification chen and folt 2005 and as bioaccumulation in plankton and fish chen and folt 2000 across 20 lakes in the northeastern united states algal bloom dilution has been widely recognized as the key mechanism for the lower contaminant levels in plankton under more productive conditions in northern american lakes chen and folt 2000 2005 with two important assumptions 1 the pool of a certain contaminant is finite 2 uptake by individual cells is constant however our study provides evidences that algal bloom dilution is not the key driver for the lower metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton at more productive sites in these anthropogenic impacted lakes in the yrd china first the dissolved metal loid concentrations in the studied lakes were not negatively correlated with increasing chl a as would be expected under algal bloom dilution scenarios but generally showed positive correlations r 0 1 for all metal loid s r 0 5 p 0 05 for cu and hg table s7b such positive relationships might be attributed to the impacts of concurrent inputs of anthropogenic metal loid s and nutrients as evidenced by the positive correlations between metal loid s and tn except zn table s7b this was in disagreement with the first assumption that high phytoplankton biomass would reduce certain contaminants in a certain pool however phytoplankton at nutrient rich sites may experience growth dilution metal concentration in phytoplankton would be reduced when cellular growth rate exceed metal uptake rate sunda and huntsman 1998 even if such phenomenon can be obscured under high loads of anthropogenic metal loid s second ph and doc levels were generally negatively related with metal loid bcf or baf across sites fig 3 and table s7f h denoting hampered metal loid bioconcentration and bioaccumulation at productive sites with higher ph and doc levels such observation disagreed with the second assumption of the constant uptake by individual cells additionally we observed that the negative correlations between metal loid bcf or baf in plankton and chl a were more pronounced than those between metal loid contents in plankton and chl a fig 3 and table s7c e indicating that higher phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations below 50 μg l 1 reduced metal loid bioaccumulation rather than algal bloom dilution the higher phytoplankton biomass reduced metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton when chl a concentrations were lower than 50 μg l 1 mainly by regulating water characteristics and shaping plankton community first higher phytoplankton biomass was associated with higher ph and doc levels in lake water specifically doc was significantly positively related with chl a r 0 616 p 0 007 table s7a and phytoplankton density r 0 510 p 0 031 table s7a among the sampling sites although the positive relationships between ph and chl a phytoplankton density were not significant p 0 05 table s7 higher phytoplankton biomass at least partially contributed to the elevated ph levels in productive sites such results can be explained by the reduction of carbonate and bicarbonate levels to replenish the lost co2 utilized by photosynthesis of phytoplankton therefore higher phytoplankton biomass reduced metal loid bioavailability and subsequently bioaccumulation in plankton via elevating ph and doc levels possible mechanisms already discussed in section 3 2 second plankton community could be shaped under different nutrient levels davies et al 2010 irwin et al 2006 thus regulating metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton in our study the large variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton community across sites contributed greatly to the variations of metal loid bcf or baf across sites as discussed in section 3 3 although the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and plankton community was complex in addition we observed evidences that the smaller body sizes of zooplankton at more productive sites contributed to their lower metal loid baf the average body sizes of the main zooplankton species including six species of cladocerans and four species of copepods table s8 at qd with the lowest phytoplankton biomass were all larger than those in other lakes for example the average lengths of cladocerans bosmina longirostris one of the dominant cladoceran species and copepods thermocyclops dybowskii one of the dominant copepod species at qd were 693 μm and 1311 μm respectively which were both significantly larger than those in other lakes such as gh 541 μm and 998 μm and th 412 μm and 843 μm similar with our observation smaller sizes of zooplankton at more productive sites have been observed in a number of eutrophic lakes with high cyanobacterial biomass in eastern china zhang et al 2013 owing to both top down and bottom up forces therefore the larger body sizes of zooplankton table s8 in qd with the lowest phytoplankton biomass at least partially accounted for the higher metal loid baf the metal loid bcf in seston and baf in zooplankton did not further decrease with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations were higher than 50 μg l 1 figs 6 7 and s3 suggesting that the impact of phytoplankton biomass on metal loid bioaccumulation might be controlled by other confounding mechanisms one possible mechanism contributing to the enhanced metal loid accumulation might be related with the impacts of more algal derived extracellular polymeric substances eps under severe algal bloom conditions on metal loid adsorption and bioaccumulation once bound with algal cells algal derived eps could significantly facilitate the adsorption of metal loid s such as as and cd xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 due to its high metal loid binding affinity via ion exchange complexation and precipitation naveed et al 2019 when released into the water algal derived soluble eps may even enhance metal loid uptake via forming organic complexes which can increase metal loid sequestration from water there were evidences that weak complexes may increase metal loid uptake by phytoplankton i e zn and cd xu et al 2012 and algal derived doc could promote hg uptake by phytoplankton zhong and wang 2009 although the above mechanisms still require further investigations our results demonstrated that the potential risk of metal loid bioaccumulation in planktonic food webs under severe algal bloom conditions deserve special attention 4 conclusions based on a comprehensive field investigation across six anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes in the yangtze river delta this study showed great impacts of phytoplankton biomass on controlling metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton higher phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentration was below 50 μg l 1 associated with lower metal loid bcf or baf in size fractionated plankton which was highly attributed to the lower metal loid bioavailability at more productive sites with higher ph and doc rather than algal bloom dilution phytoplankton growth dilution and the smaller body size of zooplankton at more productive sites at least partially contributed to the lower metal loid bioaccumulation site specific plankton communities also accounted for the large variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton additionally this study provided field evidence that metal loid bioaccumulation could be enhanced under severe algal bloom conditions when chl a concentration was higher than 50 μg l 1 although the mechanisms still require to be tested under laboratory conditions such complex role of phytoplankton biomass in controlling metal loid bioaccumulation in planktonic food webs may further exhibit inevitable effects on predators such as pelagic fish indicating that algal bloom and plankton communities must be carefully examined in tandem with non biotic lake conditions to account for metal loid bioaccumulation risks in anthropogenic impacted lakes supplementary materials additional information as noted in the main text of the current paper is available including text

15527,phytoplankton biomass can significantly affect metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton but the underlying mechanisms are still controversial we investigated the bioaccumulation of eight metal loid s as co cu hg mn pb se and zn in three size categories of planktonic organisms seston 0 7 64 μm mesozooplankton 200 500 μm and macrozooplankton 500 μm sampled from six freshwater lakes in two seasons in the yangtze river delta china our results highlight phytoplankton biomass is the major driver on metal loid bioaccumulation in the studied anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes mainly via affecting site specific water physiochemical characteristics and plankton communities however such impact is highly dependent on chlorophyll a chl a concentration the bioaccumulation of metal loid s in size fractionated plankton declined significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a was below 50 μg l 1 mainly owing to the reduced metal loid bioavailability and subsequent bioaccumulation at more productive sites with elevated ph and dissolved organic carbon rather than algal bloom dilution to a lesser extent phytoplankton growth dilution and the smaller body size of zooplankton at more productive sites also contributed to the lower metal loid bioaccumulation the bioaccumulation of metal loid s was enhanced under severe algal bloom conditions when chl a concentration was higher than 50 μg l 1 although the underlying mechanisms still require further investigations the potential risks of metal loid bioaccumulation under severe algal bloom conditions

bioaccumulation and toxicity in aquatic biota ali and khan 2018 anandkumar et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems metal loid bioconcentration via dissolved uptake in phytoplankton and bioaccumulation via dissolved uptake and dietary ingestion in zooplankton as the primary entry point of metal loid s into pelagic food webs could be further transferred to predators chen and folt 2000 griboff et al 2018 kainz et al 2006 wang et al 2011 it appears that metal loid burdens in pelagic fish could not be simply predicted by aqueous metal loid concentrations but are highly dependent on metal loid contents in plankton chen et al 2000 fang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 among aquatic ecosystems there are often significant variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton across lakes which were highly associated with varying intrinsic water physicochemical characteristics and plankton communities for example the dissolved organic carbon doc and ph of water could alter metal loid bioavailability and subsequent planktonic bioaccumulation as supported by both field investigations macmillan et al 2019 ogorek et al 2021 and biokinetic studies komjarova and blust 2009 vigneault and campbell 2005 yu and wang 2002a site specific phytoplankton density chen and folt 2000 and zooplankton taxa long et al 2018 could also contribute to the site to site variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in addition diet quality and food abundance have been recognized as crucial factors in altering dietary metal loid accumulation by modulating diet specific assimilation and elimination processes in zooplankton tsui and wang 2007 yu and wang 2002b while high growth rate could reduce metal loid bioaccumulation via growth dilution karimi et al 2007 sunda and huntsman 1998 therefore it is challenging but critical to identify the driving factors in metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton across lakes for understanding the large regional variations in metal loid burdens in pelagic fish metal loid contents especially widely reported for hg in plankton and fish are commonly higher in cold and low productive lakes compared to those in eutrophic lakes chen et al 2008 lavoie et al 2013 skei et al 2000 wu et al 2019 to explain such intriguing worldwide observation previous studies examined the relationships between metal loid contents i e as pb hg in plankton and plankton density biomass across lakes with different trophic status in north america chen and folt 2000 2005 and ascribed the observed negative correlations to a phenomenon termed as algal bloom dilution assuming that the pool of a certain contaminant is finite and uptake by individual cells is constant the important role of algal bloom dilution on regulating mass specific hg burdens in plankton was further verified under laboratory conditions with varying nutrient additions pickhardt et al 2002 nevertheless such negative correlations between metal loid contents and plankton biomass were not observed in many subtropical and tropical regions such as within baihua reservoir for hg long et al 2018 across three lakes in southwestern china for zn cu fe mn pb cr cd and ni long et al 2016 and across eight african lakes with different trophic status for hg poste et al 2015 considering that algal bloom is always associated with alterations in water physiochemical characteristics and planktonic communities amorim and moura 2021 sim et al 2020 we hypothesize that the above inconsistent findings might be attribute to the impacts of algal biomass associated confounding factors i e ph doc and planktonic communities on metal loid bioaccumulation process which may counteract with the phenomenon of algal bloom dilution here we conducted a comprehensive field study to explore how phytoplankton biomass controls metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton in six anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes with varying trophic status located in the yangtze river delta

chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn doc and planktonic communities including phytoplankton and zooplankton densities species compositions and zooplankton body size on metal loid bioaccumulation 3 to explore how phytoplankton biomass controls metal loid bioaccumulation and whether algal bloom dilution plays the key role in regulating planktonic metal loid bioaccumulation in anthropogenic impacted lakes in subtropical regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the yrd region covers 211 000 km2 with over 153 million people there are over 200 lakes widely distributed in the yrd making this region known as the land of fish and rice over thousands of years as one of the most socially and economically developed regions in china the yrd is also recognized as one of the world class mega city clusters which endures strong impacts of urbanization anthropogenic inputs of nutrients have largely elevated the nutrient levels in the surrounding aquatic ecosystems resulting in widespread eutrophication in lakes of the yrd the field study was conducted in six important freshwater lakes located in the yrd fig 1 see more details in table 1 four natural shallow lakes were sampled including dianshan lake ds gehu lake gh hongze lake hz and taihu lake th with average water depth 2 m table 1 among them th and hz are the third and fourth largest freshwater lakes in china two reservoir type lakes were also sampled including tianmu lake tm and qiandao lake qd with average water depth of 19 and 37 m respectively table 1 the lakes hz qd and th each 500 km2 table 1 were sampled from one offshore a and one nearshore b site fig 1 and table 1 while the other three lakes were sampled at one site close to the center each site was sampled twice in fall 2018 october and november and spring 2019 april and may respectively all the studied lakes are important sources of drinking water and aquatic products for the surrounding cities as well as popular recreational venues for local people nevertheless most of the selected lakes are facing metal loid contamination problems especially those shallow lakes li et al 2011 niu et al 2020 wu et al 2017 owing to the massive industrial wastewater inputs from the surrounding highly industrialized cities 2 2 field sampling water and plankton samples were collected using nonmetallic sampling apparatus and following

method 200 8 1994 seston on filters and zooplankton samples were freeze dried and digested in 10 ml 30 nitric acid v v for 12 h at 60 c in the oven external quality control for all the tested metal loid s was performed by digesting and analyzing comparable amount of standard reference materials plankton bcr 414 irmm with known metal loid contents recovery rates for all the tested metal loid s ranged between 90 and 109 blanks certified reference materials and sample duplicates were measured every twenty samples the relative standard deviations of the measured parallel samples were mostly within 10 2 4 statistical analyses to better reflect the whole column water characteristics of each site water physiochemical characteristics and aqueous metal loid concentrations used in the following calculation or statistical analyses were all mean values calculated from the sampled two or three different water layers the trophic status of each sampling site was assessed based on tp concentrations lampert and sommer 2007 according to the following classifications tp 5 μg l 1 indicates ultra oligotrophic 5 μg l 1 tp 10 μg l 1 indicates oligotrophic 10 μg l 1 tp 30 μg l 1 indicates mesotrophic 30 μg l 1 tp 100 μg l 1 indicates eutrophic and tp 100 μg l 1 indicates hypereutrophic metal loid bioconcentration factor bcf ml g 1 considering uptake from water for seston and

in seston or zooplankton μg g 1 dry wt by aqueous metal loid concentrations μg l 1 mean value of different water layers significant differences among metal loid bcf and baf meso and macro were performed through one way anova followed by tukey s post hoc test to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations on metal loid bioaccumulation paired t test analysis was performed to examine the difference of lake water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf between the two seasons considering no significant seasonal variations were observed for the tested water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf across the sampling sites seasonal variations were not further discussed in this study pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to test the relationships among water characteristics and between water characteristics and metal loid bcf or baf linear regressions were performed to test the relationships between phytoplankton biomass indicated by chl a and phytoplankton density and metal loid bcf or baf the vertical migration of zooplankton would result in ingestion of phytoplankton from the whole water column therefore in this study the mean value of chl a at each site calculated from the data of two or three different water layers with three replicated for each layer was considered as a better indicator rather than phytoplankton density data measured only in surface water canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed to assess the differences among phytoplankton species on seston metal loid bcf as well as zooplankton community compositions on zooplankton metal loid baf all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 22 0 the significance levels for all tests were set at p 0 05 the distribution map of sampling sites was drawn using arcgis 10 7 the data graphs were plotted using r script 1 3 959 and graphpad prism 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton aqueous dissolved metal loid concentrations in the current study as shown in table s1 for mean values of two or three water layers and table s2 for detailed concentrations of each water layers are generally comparable to previous reports in lakes of eastern china guo et al 2020 razavi et al 2015 among the tested metal loid s zn 11 2 93 0 μg l 1 based on data of all studied sites same below and mn 3 66 93 0 μg l 1 exhibited the highest values while hg showed the lowest concentrations range 0 21 2 73 ng l 1 mean 1 14 ng l 1 the metal loid contents in size fractionated plankton seston meso and macro zooplankton varied largely across different sites table s3 but were generally comparable with those reported in lakes table s4 within the same geographic regions e g lake taihu yu et al 2012 seven reservoirs in eastern china razavi et al 2015 or lakes of other countries regions e g lake yeniçaga in turkey saygi and yigit 2012 three lakes in southwestern china long et al 2018 2016 lake bolshoy vudyavr in russia pavlova et al 2019 except that zn average 5800 μg g 1 and mn average 736 μg g 1 contents in seston were noticeably higher in our study such higher zn and mn contents in seston might be highly attributed to the higher zn and mn concentrations in lake water but also related to the different size fractions used for seston phytoplankton sampling across studies table s4 in the current study we used 0 7 64 μm as the size fraction for seston sampling this seston size fraction incorporated a certain proportion of smaller phytoplankton or other particles with higher surface area to volume ratios compared to those size fractions of seston phytoplankton in most of previous studies 30 μm saygi and yigit 2012 74 μm yu et al 2012 29 μm pavlova et al 2019 thus might partly accounting for the observed higher metal loid burdens the calculated metal loid specific seston bcfs and zooplankton meso and macro bafs are presented in fig 2 and table s4 the metal loid seston bcf exhibited large differences among metal loid s mainly due to the metal loid specific bioaccumulation processes the seston bcf and zooplankton baf for hg fig 2 and table s4 were significantly higher than those of other metal loid s which was in accord with the widely observed high bioaccumulation potential of hg owing its specific chemical properties bjørklund et al 2017 the seston bcf values fig 2 and table s4 of essential elements zn mn cu and co were generally higher than those of non essential elements pb and as except for hg which may be largely explained by the physiological requirements for essential elements the seston bcf of all the tested metal loid s except se were significantly higher than the corresponding zooplankton meso and macro baf across the sampling sites fig 2 and table s4 probably owing to the greater contribution of metal loid adsorption onto the surface of seston with higher surface area to volume ratio than zooplankton in contrast there was no significant differences in metal loid baf between the two size categories of zooplankton fig 2 and table s4 importantly the seston bcf and zooplankton meso and macro baf of the tested eight metal loid s showed large variations across sites table s4 which could be highly attributed to the site specific water characteristics and plankton communities discussed in detail below 3 2 impacts of water characteristics on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton the average water temperature of these lakes in fall 2018 and spring 2019 were 18 6 1 0 c and 19 1 0 8 c respectively as shown in table s5 for mean values of two or three water layers and table s6 for detailed water characteristics of different water layers same below for other water characteristics if not otherwise specified all lakes were alkaline ph values ranging from 7 1 to 9 3 but varied greatly in tp 40 240 μg l 1 tn 1 1 2 7 mg l 1 chl a 1 2 160 μg l 1 doc 2 9 9 5 mg l 1 phytoplankton density 3 9 105 9 2 108 cells l 1 zooplankton density 127 570 cells l 1 and zooplankton biomass 0 33 1 26 mg l 1 the seston bcfs of the tested eight metal loid s showed 5 36 times variations across sites calculated based on the data range of metal loid specific bcf as shown in table s4 which can be partly explained by the differences of water characteristics among each sampling site the site specific seston bcfs were significantly negatively correlated with ph p 0 05 for all metal loid s except zn and doc for cu r 0 486 p 0 05 but showed weaker relationships with other environmental variables fig 3 and table s7 indicating that ph and doc played key roles in reducing metal loid bioavailability and subsequent bioconcentration in seston mostly phytoplankton the negative relationships between ph and metal loid bcf could not be explained by the competition between protons and metal loid ions to biotic ligands as expected in biotic ligand model slaveykova and wilkinson 2005 but may related with the increase of total free metal loid concentrations due to protonation of complexing agents and the impact of ph on the formation of potentially bioavailable metal loid complexes can also account for the negative relationships between ph and metal loid bcf xu et al 2012 the lower metal loid bcf in seston at sites with higher doc levels figs 3 and s1 might be attribute to the formation of less bioavailable metal loid complexes with organic matter macoustra et al 2019 vigneault and campbell 2005 the bafs of the tested eight metal loid s in zooplankton exhibited 4 165 times differences across sites calculated based on the data range of metal loid specific baf as shown in table s4 biokinetic studies have predicted that both dietary ingestion and dissolved uptake are important metal loid exposure pathways for zooplankton wang and fisher 1998 yu and wang 2002a first similar with the results for seston the varying ph and doc across sites were crucial factors in controlling the dissolved uptake of metal loid s in zooplankton fan et al 2012 komjarova and blust 2009 wu et al 2019 which can be explained by the negative relationships of ph mostly r 0 5 p 0 05 and doc mostly r 0 2 p 0 05 with metal loid baf in zooplankton fig 3 and table s7 although tn generally exhibited negative correlations with metal loid baf in zooplankton mostly r 0 2 fig 3 and table s7 n additions could not lead to significant effect on metal loid accumulation in zooplankton yu and wang 2004 second ingestion of seston could largely account for the lower metal loid baf in zooplankton at productive sites as supported by the similar patterns between metal loid bcf in seston versus metal loid baf in zooplankton with environmental variables such as chl a ph and doc fig 3 although there were strong negative correlations between zooplankton density biomass and metal loid bcf mostly r 0 5 p 0 05 fig 3 or baf mostly r 0 2 p 0 05 fig 3 such relationships should be spurious correlations ascribing to the positive correlations between metal loid concentrations in water and zooplankton density biomass table s7a 3 3 impacts of plankton community on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton phytoplankton community compositions differed across lakes and showed site specific seasonal variations fig 4 a the prominent phytoplankton of the sampled two sites at th was cyanobacteria both in fall and spring 85 99 whereas diatoms were the most abundant about 90 phytoplankton at gh in both seasons the site to site differences in dominant phytoplankton species might be attribute to complex impacts of site specific environmental variables such as light nutrients water temperature etc kakouei et al 2022 in contrast the phytoplankton community compositions at other lakes exhibited strong seasonal variations fig 4a for example the dominant phytoplankton at ds shifted from cyanobacteria about 98 in fall to diatoms about 77 in spring while the main species at tm tended to change from diatoms about 75 in fall to cyanobacteria about 78 in spring at qd chlorophytes and cryptophytes contributed more than 90 of the total phytoplankton in fall but the major phytoplankton species shifted to diatoms and cyanobacteria 99 in total in spring such large seasonal variations might be related with seasonal changes of site specific environmental drivers for each phylum for example n p ratio showed significant effects on seasonal dynamics of chlorophytes li et al 2021 while ph dissolved oxygen transparency and colored doc have been reported to influence seasonal variations of diatoms in subtropical lakes li et al 2021 sullivan et al 2022 lake to lake differences and seasonal shifts in phytoplankton species fig 4a can be a crucial factor in regulating seston bcf across sites testing the relationships between species specific phytoplankton abundance and metal loid seston bcf via cca fig 5 a it was evident that the dominance of cyanobacteria was markedly contributed to zn bioaccumulation while pyrophyte cyanobacteria and cryptophyte positively were related to as bioaccumulation for the bioaccumulation of other tested metal loid s cryptophyte and chlorophyte turned out to be the most important contributors such differences can be highly attributed to the species specific bioaccumulation of phytoplankton owing to its differences in cell size shape surface area to volume ratios cottingham 1999 kim et al 2014 the community compositions of zooplankton differed across lakes but remained relatively constant between the two seasons fig 4b rotifers dominated zooplankton community in the six lakes contributing 40 84 of the total zooplankton abundance in contrast the biomass share of rotifers fig s2 was markedly lower than those of cladocerans and copepods across all the sampling sites owing to the smaller biovolume of rotifer in relative to crustacean for crustaceans the relative abundance and biomass share of cladocera were higher than those of copepoda at gh and ds compared to the other four lakes figs 4b and s2 the site specific biomass share of zooplankton fig s2 could at least partly explain the variation in zooplankton baf across sites testing the relationships between species specific zooplankton biomass 200 μm and metal loid zooplankton baf meso fig 5b the cca results showed that the biomass share of copepod was positively correlated with the bioaccumulation of most of the tested metal loid s except zn in contrast the biomass share of cladocera was related with zn bioaccumulation while rotifer showed no relationship with any of the tested metal loid s similarly zooplankton community compositions have also been reported to be strongly correlated with hg contents in zooplankton long et al 2018 and accounted for the temporal differences in as and pb bioaccumulation in zooplankton chen and folt 2000 3 4 controlling of phytoplankton biomass on metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton the primary observation of this study was that the metal loid bcf or baf of size fractionated plankton in the studied six lakes in the yrd decreased figs 6 7 and s3 with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations were below 50 μg l 1 similar relationships also existed between metal loid bcf or baf in size fractionated plankton and phytoplankton density in surface water layer fig s4 a similar but different phenomenon reported previously was that the increase in phytoplankton biomass could result in lower mass specific burdens of contaminants in phytoplankton and subsequently transfer to zooplankton known as algal bloom dilution pickhardt et al 2002 for example plankton biomass has been observed to be negatively correlated with planktonic organochlorine levels across 33 lakes in southern ontario taylor et al 1991 and with planktonic polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations in lake ontario dachs et al 2000 field observations also showed that high plankton densities could reduce hg biomagnification chen and folt 2005 and as bioaccumulation in plankton and fish chen and folt 2000 across 20 lakes in the northeastern united states algal bloom dilution has been widely recognized as the key mechanism for the lower contaminant levels in plankton under more productive conditions in northern american lakes chen and folt 2000 2005 with two important assumptions 1 the pool of a certain contaminant is finite 2 uptake by individual cells is constant however our study provides evidences that algal bloom dilution is not the key driver for the lower metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton at more productive sites in these anthropogenic impacted lakes in the yrd china first the dissolved metal loid concentrations in the studied lakes were not negatively correlated with increasing chl a as would be expected under algal bloom dilution scenarios but generally showed positive correlations r 0 1 for all metal loid s r 0 5 p 0 05 for cu and hg table s7b such positive relationships might be attributed to the impacts of concurrent inputs of anthropogenic metal loid s and nutrients as evidenced by the positive correlations between metal loid s and tn except zn table s7b this was in disagreement with the first assumption that high phytoplankton biomass would reduce certain contaminants in a certain pool however phytoplankton at nutrient rich sites may experience growth dilution metal concentration in phytoplankton would be reduced when cellular growth rate exceed metal uptake rate sunda and huntsman 1998 even if such phenomenon can be obscured under high loads of anthropogenic metal loid s second ph and doc levels were generally negatively related with metal loid bcf or baf across sites fig 3 and table s7f h denoting hampered metal loid bioconcentration and bioaccumulation at productive sites with higher ph and doc levels such observation disagreed with the second assumption of the constant uptake by individual cells additionally we observed that the negative correlations between metal loid bcf or baf in plankton and chl a were more pronounced than those between metal loid contents in plankton and chl a fig 3 and table s7c e indicating that higher phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations below 50 μg l 1 reduced metal loid bioaccumulation rather than algal bloom dilution the higher phytoplankton biomass reduced metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton when chl a concentrations were lower than 50 μg l 1 mainly by regulating water characteristics and shaping plankton community first higher phytoplankton biomass was associated with higher ph and doc levels in lake water specifically doc was significantly positively related with chl a r 0 616 p 0 007 table s7a and phytoplankton density r 0 510 p 0 031 table s7a among the sampling sites although the positive relationships between ph and chl a phytoplankton density were not significant p 0 05 table s7 higher phytoplankton biomass at least partially contributed to the elevated ph levels in productive sites such results can be explained by the reduction of carbonate and bicarbonate levels to replenish the lost co2 utilized by photosynthesis of phytoplankton therefore higher phytoplankton biomass reduced metal loid bioavailability and subsequently bioaccumulation in plankton via elevating ph and doc levels possible mechanisms already discussed in section 3 2 second plankton community could be shaped under different nutrient levels davies et al 2010 irwin et al 2006 thus regulating metal loid bioaccumulation in plankton in our study the large variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton community across sites contributed greatly to the variations of metal loid bcf or baf across sites as discussed in section 3 3 although the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and plankton community was complex in addition we observed evidences that the smaller body sizes of zooplankton at more productive sites contributed to their lower metal loid baf the average body sizes of the main zooplankton species including six species of cladocerans and four species of copepods table s8 at qd with the lowest phytoplankton biomass were all larger than those in other lakes for example the average lengths of cladocerans bosmina longirostris one of the dominant cladoceran species and copepods thermocyclops dybowskii one of the dominant copepod species at qd were 693 μm and 1311 μm respectively which were both significantly larger than those in other lakes such as gh 541 μm and 998 μm and th 412 μm and 843 μm similar with our observation smaller sizes of zooplankton at more productive sites have been observed in a number of eutrophic lakes with high cyanobacterial biomass in eastern china zhang et al 2013 owing to both top down and bottom up forces therefore the larger body sizes of zooplankton table s8 in qd with the lowest phytoplankton biomass at least partially accounted for the higher metal loid baf the metal loid bcf in seston and baf in zooplankton did not further decrease with increasing phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentrations were higher than 50 μg l 1 figs 6 7 and s3 suggesting that the impact of phytoplankton biomass on metal loid bioaccumulation might be controlled by other confounding mechanisms one possible mechanism contributing to the enhanced metal loid accumulation might be related with the impacts of more algal derived extracellular polymeric substances eps under severe algal bloom conditions on metal loid adsorption and bioaccumulation once bound with algal cells algal derived eps could significantly facilitate the adsorption of metal loid s such as as and cd xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 due to its high metal loid binding affinity via ion exchange complexation and precipitation naveed et al 2019 when released into the water algal derived soluble eps may even enhance metal loid uptake via forming organic complexes which can increase metal loid sequestration from water there were evidences that weak complexes may increase metal loid uptake by phytoplankton i e zn and cd xu et al 2012 and algal derived doc could promote hg uptake by phytoplankton zhong and wang 2009 although the above mechanisms still require further investigations our results demonstrated that the potential risk of metal loid bioaccumulation in planktonic food webs under severe algal bloom conditions deserve special attention 4 conclusions based on a comprehensive field investigation across six anthropogenic impacted subtropical lakes in the yangtze river delta this study showed great impacts of phytoplankton biomass on controlling metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton higher phytoplankton biomass when chl a concentration was below 50 μg l 1 associated with lower metal loid bcf or baf in size fractionated plankton which was highly attributed to the lower metal loid bioavailability at more productive sites with higher ph and doc rather than algal bloom dilution phytoplankton growth dilution and the smaller body size of zooplankton at more productive sites at least partially contributed to the lower metal loid bioaccumulation site specific plankton communities also accounted for the large variations in metal loid bioaccumulation in size fractionated plankton additionally this study provided field evidence that metal loid bioaccumulation could be enhanced under severe algal bloom conditions when chl a concentration was higher than 50 μg l 1 although the mechanisms still require to be tested under laboratory conditions such complex role of phytoplankton biomass in controlling metal loid bioaccumulation in planktonic food webs may further exhibit inevitable effects on predators such as pelagic fish indicating that algal bloom and plankton communities must be carefully examined in tandem with non biotic lake conditions to account for metal loid bioaccumulation risks in anthropogenic impacted lakes supplementary materials additional information as noted in the main text of the current paper is available including text

their functional diversity remains to be explored in anammox communities herein a total of 77 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags of denitrifying bacteria were recovered from the anammox community in a full scale swine wastewater treatment plant among these microbes a total of 26 mags were affiliated with the seven dominant denitrifying genera that have total abundances higher than 1 a meta analysis of these species suggested that external organics reduced the abundances of genus ignavibacterium and species mag 305 of utpro2 in anammox communities comparative genome analysis revealed functional divergence across different denitrifying bacteria largely owing to their distinct capabilities for carbohydrate including endogenous and exogenous utilization and vitamin e g pantothenate and thiamine biosynthesis serval microbes in this system contained fewer genes encoding biotin pantothenate and methionine biosynthesis compared with their related species from other habitats in addition the genes encoding energy production and conversion 73 genes and inorganic ion transport 53 genes putatively transferred from other species to denitrifying bacteria while these denitrifying bacteria especially genera utpro2 and scn 69 89 likely donated the genes encoding nutrients e g inorganic ion and amino acid transporter 64 genes for other members to utilize new metabolites collectively these findings highlighted the functional divergence of these denitrifying bacteria and speculated that the genetic interactions within anammox communities through horizontal gene transfer may be one of the reasons for their functional divergence graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrifying bacteria functional divergence horizontal gene transfer anammox community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox process that represents one efficient and cost effective technique for nitrogen removal has been implemented worldwide for treating high strength ammonium wastewater kartal et al 2010 lackner et al 2014 in practice anammox bacteria account only for 0 1 38 of the whole anammox community in anammox based wastewater treatment systems xiao et al 2021 while heterotrophs relying on the existing endogenous and or exogenous organics are generally much more abundant than anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 particularly dominant denitrifying bacteria with relative abundances ranging from 0 3 to 23 6 generally compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite xiao et al 2021 in return owing to the capabilities of degrading organics these co existing microbes can prevent anammox bacteria from organic inhibition and some members e g genus thauera under specific c n ratios can provide stable nitrite for anammox bacteria cao et al 2021 the complex functions of denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities determine their synergistic and competitive interactions with anammox bacteria wang et al 2022 therefore deciphering the functions of denitrifying bacteria can help to govern the stability of anammox systems and promote the full scale application of this process previous studies have focused on revealing the composition of denitrifying bacteria based on 16s rrna sequencing suggesting that it is mainly affiliated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria pereira et al 2017 intriguingly these denitrifying bacteria e g genera ignavibacterium denitratisoma dokdonella and limnobacter appear to show high phylogenetic similarity across different anammox communities speth et al 2016 and thus a more universal functional profile may exist in these microbes for instance low molecular compounds from the hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances are believed to be able to support their various heterotrophic lifestyles ni et al 2012 particularly in the anammox system without external organic substrates hu et al 2018 moreover the similar microbial composition and their widespread coexistences are also likely because of their cross feeding behaviors based on the auxotrophic features zengler and zaramela 2018 which were speculated from the functional profile of available genomes zhao et al 2018 however current studies still heavily rely on the typical genomes obtained from one system ignoring their specific functions when compared with the same genus obtained from different habitats commichaux et al 2021 further few studies have so far described the distribution of denitrifying bacteria across different anammox systems xiao et al 2021 as the specific environment could impose strong selections on the occurrence of microbes mock et al 2016 there is thus an urgent need to expand our understanding of the genomic variation of denitrifying bacteria notably microbes could acquire genetic materials from others with distant phylogenetic distances to gain beneficial features through horizontal gene transfer hgt events keeling and palmer 2008 li et al 2020 in which the transferred genes may misguide the phylogenomic analyses of these microbes dombrowski et al 2020 it has been reported that due to the short physical distances between microbes broszat and grohmann 2014 hgt events are more likely to occur in biofilms sørensen et al 2005 moreover denitrifying bacteria have been observed to exchange genes with other species in wastewater treatment plants gao et al 2019 rios miguel et al 2020 to retain sufficient biomass in anammox systems anammox communities are purposefully aggregated into dense biofilms and granules lawson et al 2017 and thus hgt events play potential roles in the distribution of certain functional genes however the extent of hgt events and the specific exchanged functions remain poorly understood in anammox communities in addition hgt events are thought to be an important driving force for microbial evolution and can offer a chance for microbes to get better environmental adaption brito 2021 for instance obtaining v type atpases allows thaumarchaeota to survive in acidic and high pressure habitats wang et al 2019 taken together we believe that revealing the hgt events in denitrifying bacteria will help us better understand their specific functions and ecological interactions in shaping anammox communities to date researchers have focused on the recent or ancient hgt events in isolates or reference genomes brito 2021 due to large numbers of uncultured microbes in anammox communities however metagenomic sequencing enables researchers to investigate the recent hgt events by mapping short reads into assemblies douglas and langille 2019 particularly based on the high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags the metagenomic community level hgt identification pipeline metachip by examining evolutionary histories of genes involved gives high confidence in identifying recent hgt events and allows to determine the direction of transfer robbins et al 2021 song et al 2019 in addition functional divergences among the obtained assemblies and their reference genomes can further be depicted through comparative genome analysis which is an effective approach to illuminate the evolution mechanism qi et al 2021 it can be expected that the above approaches will aid in providing functional potentials in denitrifying bacteria and revealing potential linkages between functions and hgt events herein to address the above mentioned research gaps sludge samples containing the anammox community from a full scale swine wastewater treatment plant were conducted by genome centric metagenomic analysis this work aims to understand the i phylogeny and distribution of denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities ii functional divergence in nitrogen carbohydrate and nutrient biosynthesis across different species and iii genetic interactions between denitrifying bacteria and other members through hgt events within the anammox community 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of anammox sludge and metagenomic sequencing the bacterial sludge samples were collected from a full scale swine wastewater treatment plant that is comprised of primary anaerobic anoxic anoxic primary sedimentation secondary anaerobic anaerobic aerobic and secondary sedimentation tanks about 70 5 of total nitrogen was removed in the primary anaerobic anoxic anoxic tank with dissolved oxygen do concentrations of less than 0 5 mg l moreover red granular sludge aggregations were observed in the primary anoxic tank thus a total of six anammox sludge samples including one floc sludge four granular sludges with the diameter of 5 8 mm and 12 14 mm and one mixture sludge were collected from the primary anoxic tank in the plant fig s1 all samples were transported with snap freezing on dry ice to the laboratory and stored at 80 c until subsequent dna extraction the total metagenomic dna of the samples was extracted by the fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa metagenomic sequence data were generated on the illumina hiseq novseq6000 platform in guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd the raw metagenome sequences were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with bioproject of prjna643669 2 2 metagenomic assembly binning and taxonomic classification all adapters were removed from raw metagenomic reads using trimmomatic v 0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the adapter sequences in truseq3 pe 2 fa low quality reads were identified and removed using a sliding window of 5 bases with an average phred q value lower than 20 slidingwindow 5 20 after the above cropping reads with final length 100 bp minlen 100 were discarded de novo assembly of clean reads was processed using megahit v 1 1 3 li et al 2015 with the k mer of 41 141 and the minimum contig length of 500 bp individual and co binning of contigs of each sample were performed using the metawrap pipeline v 1 3 uritskiy et al 2018 based on the binning output of concoct v 1 0 0 alneberg et al 2014 metabat2 v 2 12 1 kang et al 2019 and maxbin2 v 2 2 6 wu et al 2015 the obtained bins from three independent methods were refined using metawrap pipeline with the minimum completeness of 50 c 50 and maximum contamination of 10 x 10 additionally contigs were removed with refinem v 0 0 25 parks et al 2017 if their gc or tetranucleotide distance was outside the 98th percentile of the expected distributions to dereplicate the bins at the species level bin clustering was performed using drep v 3 0 0 olm et al 2017 with a cutoff value of average nucleotide identity ani of 95 sa 0 95 and aligned fraction as 60 nc 0 6 only the bins with the minimum completeness of 50 comp 50 and the maximum contamination con 10 were selected for subsequent analysis the quality scores of mags were calculated according to the level of completeness 5 the contamination parks et al 2017 the phylophlan 3 0 v 3 0 60 asnicar et al 2020 was used to retrieve 400 universal marker genes from each mag and each marker gene was conducted multiple sequence alignment using mafft v 7 455 katoh and standley 2013 both fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 and raxml v 8 2 12 stamatakis 2014 were used to build the phylogenetic tree using the phylophlan 3 0 pipeline in an accurate mode finally to reduce the computational cost the refined phylogeny produced by raxml starting from the fasttree phylogeny was selected as the final phylogenetic tree the obtained phylogenetic tree was visualized with the ggtree package v 3 4 1 yu et al 2017 in r v 4 1 0 all mags were classified using the command classify wf of the genome taxonomy database toolkit gtdb tk v 1 5 1 chaumeil et al 2020 based on the gtdb release r202 parks et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of each mag from separate samples was calculated with coverm v 0 6 1 https github com wwood coverm 2 3 genome annotation and statistics to profile the completeness of kegg orthology ko modules present in each genome all mags were performed using the commands annotate and classify of enrichm v 0 6 3 https github com geronimp enrichm respectively specifically the functional genes were identified using the diamond v 0 9 22 123 buchfink et al 2015 blasted the mag proteins against the enrichm v10 database incorporating a uniref100 database with ko annotation genomes that contained the functional genes of denitrification pathways modules m00529 m00530 and m00531 were considered denitrifying bacteria additionally the functional assignments of mag proteins were performed using the diamond alignment e value of 10 5 in eggnog mapper v 2 1 4 huerta cepas et al 2017 against the eggnog database v 5 0 huerta cepas et al 2019 subsequently based on the ratio of each ko number to all annotated genes the global metabolic differentiation in each genome was evaluated according to principal coordinate analyses in the vegan package v 2 6 2 dixon 2003 in r in this study seven dominant denitrifying genera with a relative abundance higher than 1 including genera dokdonella ignavibacterium ottowia rubrivivax scn 69 89 uba964 and utpro2 were used for comparative genome analysis the obtained functions of the seven genera from eggnog mapper results were further validated by using diamond alignment e value of 10 5 against the ncbi nr database download on october 2020 additionally to impartially depict the distribution characteristics of the above denitrifying bacteria in different anammox communities this study further compared the relative abundances of denitrifying bacteria in various systems through a meta analysis the metagenomic samples are published in the following literatures ali et al 2019 hosokawa et al 2021 ji et al 2020 keren et al 2020 li et al 2020 suarez et al 2021 wang et al 2022 2019 xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 2020 table s1 2 4 comparative genome analysis according to the genus taxonomic information in the gtdb a total of 96 genomes of the seven denitrifying bacteria were downloaded from the genbank and refseq public databases these downloaded genomes that were considered reference genomes were further used for comparative genome analysis specifically average nucleotide identity ani based on fastani v 1 33 jain et al 2018 was calculated to compare the similarity between all of the genomes in each genus the pre computed blast search in orthofinder v 2 5 4 emms and kelly 2019 was used to define the orthogroups i e the group of homologue protein sequences ogs for each genus and the core and species specific ogs were identified the complete set of phylogenomic trees of all genera was computed based on the amino acid sequences of ogs with the muscle alignment program and the tree inference method of iq tree in orthofinder a concatenated phylogeny based on the marker genes was also generated to assess the phylogenetic placement of recovered genomes in their corresponding genus marker genes retrieve and phylogenetic tree construct are performed using phylophlan 3 0 as detailly described above in addition the completeness of amino acids and vitamin biosynthesis pathways in all recovered and reference genomes were also calculated using the classify function in enrichm v 0 6 3 the ko module with the completeness of 70 was considered an incomplete pathway 2 5 identification of horizontal gene transfer and visualization to identify hgt events within the anammox community hgt events among all mags were detected with metachip v 1 9 0 song et al 2019 briefly each predicted gene aligned by the best match method was compared among taxa based on the defined phylogenetic tree and then the gene was identified as a candidate gene for hgt as the best matches from the non self group the putative hgt was then refined by the phylogenetic approach which allowed to identify the direction of gene flow the gene flow networks within the anammox community were visualized at the phylum and genus levels using the circlize package v 0 4 15 gu et al 2014 in r to assess whether hgt events potentially affected the global functions of anammox community we further annotated the function of all transferred genes using diamond alignment against the eggnog database v 5 0 as described above moreover the annotated results were also validated using diamond alignment against the ncbi nr database the genetic flow networks between dominant denitrifying bacteria and other bacteria were visualized using the gephi software v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 phylogenetic composition and genomic analysis of the recovered mags after quality filtering and dereplication a total of 238 mags quality scores 221 50 and 17 50 were obtained from the anammox community covering 74 1 82 0 of the metagenomic reads classification results suggested that at more refined levels especially the genus and species levels only 129 54 2 and 25 10 5 mags could be classified as known genus and species supplementary data s1 respectively based on the functional genes of denitrification pathways presenting in each genome a total of 77 mags were identified as putative denitrifying bacteria further these genomes displayed distinct functional potentials compared with other recovered genomes fig s2 the identified denitrifying bacteria were mainly distributed in seven genera including 26 species fig s3 i e scn 69 89 utpro2 dokdonella ignavibacterium uba964 rubrivivax and ottowia moreover five species mag 752 dokdonella mag 36 ignavibacterium mag 319 scn 69 89 mag 739 scn 69 89 and mag 305 utpro2 dominated in the community with an average abundance higher than 1 0 for each species fig 1a according to the ani index fig s4 some genera e g scn 69 89 uba964 and rubrivivax contained serval novel species in the community notably these denitrifying bacteria exhibited similar abundances in granular sludge and floc samples supplementary data s1 among the five species affiliated with the genus scn 69 89 the novel species mag 319 exhibited the highest relative abundances in all samples average of 2 9 in contrast the relative abundances of 11 species affiliated with genera uba964 and rubrivivax in all samples remained lower than 1 0 average ranging from 0 06 to 0 50 based on the phylogenetic analysis fig 1b the novel species tended to locate in the monophyletic group and maintain a large distance from their reference genomes moreover the phylogenomic tree based on orthogroups for each genus also revealed similar monophyletic features figs s5 s11 the individual lineage could give important insights into their putative common ancestor in the community for instance the novel species mag 752 was affiliated with the same clade as mag 181 despite the long evolutionary distance particularly five species affiliated with the genus rubrivivax comprised three clades based on the phylogenomic analysis of ogs fig s9a suggesting the differential protein family in these species 3 2 a meta analysis of the distribution of the proposed denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities anammox communities are normally present in two types of processes including canon completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite and sharon single reactor system for high activity ammonia removal over nitrite anammox in canon process the anammox communities are exposed to high concentrations of do while in sharon anammox process the anammox communities can avoid do stress in this work the anammox sludge samples were collected from the anoxic tank with a do of 0 5 mg l thereby we assumed that the anammox communities were assembled in a canon like system overall the total abundances of the above dominant denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities ranged from 0 48 to 20 25 fig 2 genera ignavibacterium and dokdonella showed low abundances in the previously reported canon process fig 2a while genus uba964 was seldom detected in the sharon anammox process fig 2b c although the five members of the genus rubrivivax had similar abundances in the canon process species mag 378 and mag 7 affiliated with that genus had the highest abundances in the sharon anammox process species mag 319 of genus scn 69 89 was particularly enriched in canon process while mag 739 had a high abundance in the sharon anammox process moreover the canon process likely promoted the occurrence of genus uba964 e g mag 696 which has been seldom detected in other anammox communities intriguingly two species i e mag 305 and mag 573 affiliated with the genus utpro2 had low abundances in the anammox communities from sharon anammox process under heterotrophic conditions fig 2c in summary the distribution of denitrifying species is likely related to the reactor operation pattern 3 3 predicting the functional divergence based on comparative genome analyses principal coordinate analyses showed that the recovered denitrifying genomes in the anammox community possessed distinct potentials compared with their reference genomes from other habitats fig s12 moreover fewer ogs were found in these covered genomes as compared with their reference genomes figs s13 19 for instance aromatics degradation genes were particularly identified in the recovered species of genera rubrivivax and scn 69 89 while the sulfate transport system was absent in these denitrifying species supplementary data s10 particularly the functional genes of the denitrification process in the seven genera were profiled fig 3a and each genome of these genera possessed part functional genes overall nitrate and nitrite reductase genes were widely identified in these genomes of note periplasmic nitrate reductase napa b c genes were only identified in genus utpro2 while the membrane bound nitrate reductase narg h genes existed in all species of genera uba964 scn 69 89 and rubrivivax moreover the two species mag 271 and mag 287 affiliated with genus ottowia and the species mag 322 affiliated with genus uba964 contained two types of nitrite reduction enzymes i e cytochrome cd1 containing nitrite reductase nirs and cooper type nitrite reductase nirk in terms of the nitric oxide reductase norb and nitrous oxide reductase nosz genes more than half of all species lacked the key genes for the complete denitrification process additionally this study found that the pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa h genes were merely detected in the genus ignavibacterium carbohydrates are a footstone for the heterotrophic lifestyle of denitrifying bacteria and thus the key genes for carbohydrate utilization have been identified in these genomes fig 3a particularly two species of genus ignavibacterium lacked the formate dehydrogenase fdh and glucokinase glk genes the cellulose synthase bcsa gene for cellulose biosynthesis was mainly identified in several members of genera uba964 ignavibacterium and dokdonella in comparison glycogen synthase glga b c and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase phac phbc genes for organic carbon storage were widely identified in the denitrifying bacteria in terms of vitamin biosynthesis potentials all members of genera dokdonella ottowia rubrivivax and uba964 lacked the key gene e g thiamine phosphate pyrophosphorylase gene thie for thiamine biosynthesis fig 3a the species affiliated with genera ottowia ignavibacterium and rubrivivax were absent of most key genes e g pantoate beta alanine ligase gene panc for pantothenate biosynthesis to evaluate the auxotrophy of amino acids the key genes for amino acid biosynthesis table s2 were further identified in these denitrifying bacteria fig 3b clearly the genus ignavibacterium lacked numerous genes for various amino acid biosynthesis while the other six genera contained most key genes in the genera utpro2 scn 69 89 and uba964 species mag 305 mag 322 mag 501 and mag 319 contained fewer key genes for amino acid biosynthesis than other species in addition according to the completeness of biosynthesis pathways fig s20 and supplementary data s9 several recovered genomes in this system contained fewer genes encoding amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis when compared with reference genomes such as the biotin in genus uba964 the methionine in genus ignavibacterium and the pantothenate in genus rubrivivax 3 4 putative hgt events in dominant denitrifying species according to the meta cihp pipeline this study identified 2495 putative hgt events from all recovered genomes in the anammox community fig s21 the transferred genes of putative hgt events were mainly responsible for energy metabolism and transport supplementary result 2 and figs s22 23 interestingly it was found that the putative hgt events were prevalent among the seven denitrifying genera in addition the putative hgt events also occurred between denitrifying bacteria and other bacteria the transferred genes of putative hgt events were mainly identified in five denitrifying genera i e rubrivivax 281 genes scn69 89 218 genes uba964 136 genes utpro2 120 genes and dokdonella 120 genes and three other genera i e joshi 001 165 genes uba5518 123 genes and ga0077536 91 genes however there were marginal hgt events between the species within one given genus in addition nearly zero putative hgt events were detected within the four anammox bacteria and no gene flow was observed between anammox and denitrifying bacteria as such the genetic flow networks containing donor and recipient were separately constructed to simulate the putative hgt events fig 4a b of note the seven denitrifying genera acquired 414 genes from other bacteria moreover these recipient genes were primarily responsible for energy production and conversion 73 genes and inorganic ion transport and metabolism 53 genes fig 4c for instance species mag 67 obtained the gene encoding acetate kinase from mag 696 and mag 271 obtained the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene from mag 373 fig 5a particularly all the members of genera utpro2 and rubrivivax received numerous abc transporter and multicomponent ion antiporter genes for example species mag 305 received six peptide nickel transport genes from mag 319 and mag 739 fig 5b on the other hand the seven denitrifying genera donated 554 genes which mainly encoded energy production and conversion 116 genes and amino acid transport and metabolism 64 genes these donor genes were largely identified in genera utpro2 and scn 69 89 such as two formate hydrogenlyase genes donated by species mag 305 fig 5c moreover the denitrifying bacteria could donate the same gene for different species for example the gene encoding abc 2 type transport system permease protein was transferred from species mag 67 to species mag 106 and mag 752 fig 5d of note although numerous transferred genes of putative hgt events were involved in nitrogen metabolism fig s23 only 11 related genes were identified in the dominant denitrifying bacteria figs s24 26 for example the nirk gene likely transferred from mag 181 dokdonella to mag 322 uba964 this observation can partially explain the result mentioned above that both nirs and nirk genes were identified in the species mag 322 4 discussion 4 1 distributions of denitrifying bacteria are largely determined by their functional divergences on the basis of meta analysis fig 2 denitrifying bacteria were widely detected and their distribution in anammox communities was likely related to specific environmental conditions a previous study has demonstrated that the acetate and glycerol are mostly converted to polyhydroxybutyrate as a storage compound to yield more electrons for nitrate reduction majone et al 2001 thus promoting the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria and enhancing nitrogen removal according to functional profiles all the denitrifying bacteria mentioned above possessed single or multiple key genes for carbon storage further the fermentative microbes e g ignavibacterium transferring macromolecules e g extracellular polymers to small organic acids preferred the environment without external organics du et al 2017 therefore additional acetate generally reduced the abundances of species mag 36 mag 305 and mag 739 in the canon process wang et al 2018 because of the presence of available endogenous and or exogenous organics in various systems cao et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the denitrifying bacteria are generally abundant in anammox communities it can be speculated that a favorable control of organic acids before anammox system can specifically enrich these denitrifying bacteria han et al 2020 lackner et al 2014 additionally a recent study reported that excessive dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia process detected in genera ignavibacterium remarkably deteriorated the anammox process keren et al 2020 in contrast most species of other denitrifying bacteria were found to likely cooperate and compete with anammox bacteria for nitrogen substrates lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2022 which was evidenced by the co existence of nitrate and nitrite reductase genes in genomes overall the functional divergences for carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism likely played a key role in the distribution of denitrifying bacteria 4 2 distinct potentials of nutrient biosynthesis in denitrifying bacteria previous studies have reached a consensus that the cross feeding interactions are important for the occurrence of anammox and denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 for instance several denitrifying bacteria contained key genes for folate biosynthesis and might support the folate requirements for other members e g anammox bacteria zhou et al 2020 here from the genomic information the distinct potentials for vitamin instead of amino acid biosynthesis in these denitrifying bacteria may suggest their different enrichment in the system it should be noted that available nutrients could lead to the biosynthetic loss of function in microbial communities d souza et al 2018 wang et al 2021 because the biosynthesis of a public good is an energy metabolism costly process tsoi et al 2019 zengler and zaramela 2018 this was agreed with our finding that owing to the available metabolites secreted by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 serval denitrifying bacteria contained fewer genes encoding nutrients biosynthesis compared with reference genomes from other non anammox habitats in addition although the low abundance species possessed prototrophic characteristics when compared with others in same genus the transcriptions of amino acid biosynthesis in these denitrifying bacteria maintained at a low level wang et al 2019 as such we speculated that these low abundance species likely exhibited storage effects for nutrient biosynthesis capabilities in this system 4 3 potential role of hgt events in the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria hgt events are always proposed as an important strategy in the evolution of an organism probably contributing to putative functional divergences and competitive advantages under specific environments abe et al 2020 eyres et al 2015 yang 2021 these transferred genes encoding carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism probably contributed to the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria in the community fig 5 moreover species mag 373 and mag 574 enriching in the system potentially received numerous genes and exhibited specific functions while the two species always have low abundances in other communities similarly the different functional profile in terms of carbohydrate metabolism resulting from hgt events was observed in each mast lineage and these hgt events may contribute to enabling metabolic specialization seeleuthner et al 2018 intriguingly most transferred genes in the community are related to transporters e g amino acid and inorganic ion which can determine how microbes utilize a new metabolite milner et al 2019 particularly nutrient transporter genes from other species may give some denitrifying bacteria capabilities to uptake public goods potentially saving their energy cost and expanding their adaptative range richards and talbot 2013 in addition donating genes from denitrifying bacteria were found to provide selective forces in shaping communities to a certain extent bonham et al 2017 however the frequency of hgt events is generally proportional to the abundance of the donors mori et al 2016 muntadas et al 2016 it could be expected that the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the system probably increased the functional evenness of the community while the denitrifying bacteria with low abundances improved the functional richness of the community taken together while the real hgt rates and frequencies could not be inferred from the cross section groussin et al 2021 the hgt events probably increase the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria 4 4 environmental implications in general the functional divergence among microbes can promote species co existence instead of competitive exclusion ayala muñoz et al 2021 potentially improving the stability of whole communities given the relatively low resistance of anammox systems to environmental pressure li et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 utilizing the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria by optimizing organics metabolites may expand the feasibility of anammox systems for treating various wastewater meanwhile hgt events may alter metabolite utilization by transferring transporter genes and thus the hgt process was considered an alternative strategy for bioaugmentation rios miguel et al 2020 nevertheless hgt events spontaneously occurred without full control in a natural system limiting their engineering application rios miguel et al 2020 although mobile genetic elements implemented in lab scale reactors can be used to purposefully transfer functional genes nzila et al 2016 hgt events generally varied across environmental conditions and bacterial strains brito 2021 for instance an external nutrient potentially determined the effect of hgt events and further alleviated metabolic loads for certain bacteria guo et al 2021 therefore future works should focus on purposefully exploring the response of hgt events to bioaugmentation under various environmental conditions arnold et al 2022 tsoi et al 2019 and revealing the real time hgt process between denitrifying bacteria and other members li et al 2018 5 conclusion 1 among the 77 denitrifying bacteria a total of 26 species were affiliated with the seven dominant denitrifying genera i e ignavibacterium dokdonella utpro2 rubrivivax scn 69 89 and uba964 that have total abundances higher than 1 meta analysis of these species suggested that external organics reduced the abundances of genus ignavibacterium and species mag 305 of utpro2 in anammox communities 2 the different capabilities for carbohydrate including endogenous and exogenous utilization and vitamin e g pantothenate and thiamine biosynthesis largely contributed to the functional divergences of these denitrifying bacteria serval species in this study contained fewer genes encoding methionine pantothenate and biotin biosynthesis compared with their related species from non anammox systems 3 denitrifying bacteria likely acquired the genes encoding energy conversion and inorganic ion transport and metabolism while they putatively donated the genes encoding nutrients e g inorganic ion and amino acid transporter for other members the genetic interactions within anammox communities through horizontal gene transfer might be one of the reasons for the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria supporting information the function of transferred genes is provided in

15528,denitrifying bacteria with high abundances in anammox communities play crucial roles in achieving stable anammox based systems despite the relative constant composition of denitrifying bacteria their functional diversity remains to be explored in anammox communities herein a total of 77 high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags of denitrifying bacteria were recovered from the anammox

anammox community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox process that represents one efficient and cost effective technique for nitrogen removal has been implemented worldwide for treating high strength ammonium wastewater kartal et al 2010 lackner et al 2014 in practice anammox bacteria account only for 0 1 38 of the whole anammox community in anammox based wastewater treatment systems xiao et al 2021 while heterotrophs relying on the existing endogenous and or exogenous organics are generally much more abundant than anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 particularly dominant denitrifying bacteria with relative abundances ranging from 0 3 to 23 6 generally compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite xiao et al 2021 in return owing to the capabilities of degrading organics these co existing microbes can prevent anammox bacteria from organic inhibition and some members e g genus thauera under specific c n ratios can provide stable nitrite for anammox bacteria cao et al 2021 the complex functions of denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities determine their synergistic and competitive interactions with anammox bacteria wang et al 2022 therefore deciphering the functions of denitrifying bacteria can help to govern the stability of anammox systems and promote the full scale application of this process previous studies have focused on revealing the composition of denitrifying bacteria based on 16s rrna sequencing suggesting that it is mainly affiliated with the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria pereira et al 2017 intriguingly these denitrifying bacteria e g genera ignavibacterium denitratisoma dokdonella and limnobacter appear to show high phylogenetic similarity across different anammox communities speth et al 2016 and thus a more universal functional profile may exist in these microbes for instance low molecular compounds from the hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances are believed to be able to support their various heterotrophic lifestyles ni et al 2012 particularly in the anammox system without external organic substrates hu et al 2018 moreover the similar microbial composition and their widespread coexistences are also likely because of their cross feeding behaviors based on the auxotrophic features zengler and zaramela 2018 which were speculated from the functional profile of available genomes zhao et al 2018 however current studies still heavily rely on the typical genomes obtained from one system ignoring their specific functions when compared with the same genus obtained from different habitats commichaux et al 2021 further few studies have so far described the distribution of denitrifying bacteria across different anammox systems xiao et al 2021 as the specific environment could impose strong selections on the occurrence of microbes mock et al 2016 there is thus an urgent need to expand our understanding of the genomic variation of denitrifying bacteria notably microbes could acquire genetic materials from others with distant phylogenetic distances to gain beneficial features through horizontal gene transfer hgt events keeling and palmer 2008 li et al 2020 in which the transferred genes may misguide the phylogenomic analyses of these microbes dombrowski et al 2020 it has been reported that due to the short physical distances between microbes broszat and grohmann 2014 hgt events are more likely to occur in biofilms sørensen et al 2005 moreover denitrifying bacteria have been observed to exchange genes with other species in wastewater treatment plants gao et al 2019 rios miguel et al 2020 to retain sufficient biomass in anammox systems anammox communities are purposefully aggregated into dense biofilms and granules lawson et al 2017 and thus hgt events play potential roles in the distribution of certain functional genes however the extent of hgt events and the specific exchanged functions remain poorly understood in anammox communities in addition hgt events are thought to be an important driving force for microbial evolution and can offer a chance for microbes to get better environmental adaption brito 2021 for instance obtaining v type atpases allows thaumarchaeota to survive in acidic and high pressure habitats wang et al 2019 taken together we believe that revealing the hgt events in denitrifying bacteria will help us better understand their specific functions and ecological interactions in shaping anammox communities to date researchers have focused on the recent or ancient hgt events in isolates or reference genomes brito 2021 due to large numbers of uncultured microbes in anammox communities however metagenomic sequencing enables researchers to investigate the recent hgt events by mapping short reads into assemblies douglas and langille 2019 particularly based on the high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags the metagenomic community level hgt identification pipeline metachip by examining evolutionary histories of genes involved gives high confidence in identifying recent hgt events and allows to determine the direction of transfer robbins et al 2021 song et al 2019 in addition functional divergences among the obtained assemblies and their reference genomes can further be depicted through comparative genome analysis which is an effective approach to illuminate the evolution mechanism qi et al 2021 it can be expected that the above approaches will aid in providing functional potentials in denitrifying bacteria and revealing potential linkages between functions and hgt events herein to address the above mentioned research gaps sludge samples containing the anammox community from a full scale swine wastewater treatment plant were conducted by genome centric metagenomic analysis this work aims to understand the i phylogeny and distribution of denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities ii functional divergence in nitrogen carbohydrate and nutrient biosynthesis across different species and iii genetic interactions between denitrifying bacteria and other members through hgt events within the anammox community 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of anammox sludge and metagenomic sequencing the bacterial sludge samples were collected from a full scale swine wastewater treatment plant that is comprised of primary anaerobic anoxic anoxic primary sedimentation secondary anaerobic anaerobic aerobic and secondary sedimentation tanks about 70 5 of total nitrogen was removed in the primary anaerobic anoxic anoxic tank with dissolved oxygen do concentrations of less than 0 5 mg l moreover red granular sludge aggregations were observed in the primary anoxic tank thus a total of six anammox sludge samples including one floc sludge four granular sludges with the diameter of 5 8 mm and 12 14 mm and one mixture sludge were collected from the primary anoxic tank in the plant fig s1 all samples were transported with snap freezing on dry ice to the laboratory and stored at 80 c until subsequent dna extraction the total metagenomic dna of the samples was extracted by the fastdna soil kit mp biomedicals ca usa metagenomic sequence data were generated on the illumina hiseq novseq6000 platform in guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd the raw metagenome sequences were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive database with bioproject of prjna643669 2 2 metagenomic assembly binning and taxonomic classification all adapters were removed from raw metagenomic reads using trimmomatic v 0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the adapter sequences in truseq3 pe 2 fa low quality reads were identified and removed using a sliding window of 5 bases with an average phred q value lower than 20 slidingwindow 5 20 after the above cropping reads with final length 100 bp minlen 100 were discarded de novo assembly of clean reads was processed using megahit v 1 1 3 li et al 2015 with the k mer of 41 141 and the minimum contig length of 500 bp individual and co binning of contigs of each sample were performed using the metawrap pipeline v 1 3 uritskiy et al 2018 based on the binning output of concoct v 1 0 0 alneberg et al 2014 metabat2 v 2 12 1 kang et al 2019 and maxbin2 v 2 2 6 wu et al 2015 the obtained bins from three independent methods were refined using metawrap pipeline with the minimum completeness of 50 c 50 and maximum contamination of 10 x 10 additionally contigs were removed with refinem v 0 0 25 parks et al 2017 if their gc or tetranucleotide distance was outside the 98th percentile of the expected distributions to dereplicate the bins at the species level bin clustering was performed using drep v 3 0 0 olm et al 2017 with a cutoff value of average nucleotide identity ani of 95 sa 0 95 and aligned fraction as 60 nc 0 6 only the bins with the minimum completeness of 50 comp 50 and the maximum contamination con 10 were selected for subsequent analysis the quality scores of mags were calculated according to the level of completeness 5 the contamination parks et al 2017 the phylophlan 3 0 v 3 0 60 asnicar et al 2020 was used to retrieve 400 universal marker genes from each mag and each marker gene was conducted multiple sequence alignment using mafft v 7 455 katoh and standley 2013 both fasttree v2 1 10 price et al 2010 and raxml v 8 2 12 stamatakis 2014 were used to build the phylogenetic tree using the phylophlan 3 0 pipeline in an accurate mode finally to reduce the computational cost the refined phylogeny produced by raxml starting from the fasttree phylogeny was selected as the final phylogenetic tree the obtained phylogenetic tree was visualized with the ggtree package v 3 4 1 yu et al 2017 in r v 4 1 0 all mags were classified using the command classify wf of the genome taxonomy database toolkit gtdb tk v 1 5 1 chaumeil et al 2020 based on the gtdb release r202 parks et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of each mag from separate samples was calculated with coverm v 0 6 1 https github com wwood coverm 2 3 genome annotation and statistics to profile the completeness of kegg orthology ko modules present in each genome all mags were performed using the commands annotate and classify of enrichm v 0 6 3 https github com geronimp enrichm respectively specifically the functional genes were identified using the diamond v 0 9 22 123 buchfink et al 2015 blasted the mag proteins against the enrichm v10 database incorporating a uniref100 database with ko annotation genomes that contained the functional genes of denitrification pathways modules m00529 m00530 and m00531 were considered denitrifying bacteria additionally the functional assignments of mag proteins were performed using the diamond alignment e value of 10 5 in eggnog mapper v 2 1 4 huerta cepas et al 2017 against the eggnog database v 5 0 huerta cepas et al 2019 subsequently based on the ratio of each ko number to all annotated genes the global metabolic differentiation in each genome was evaluated according to principal coordinate analyses in the vegan package v 2 6 2 dixon 2003 in r in this study seven dominant denitrifying genera with a relative abundance higher than 1 including genera dokdonella ignavibacterium ottowia rubrivivax scn 69 89 uba964 and utpro2 were used for comparative genome analysis the obtained functions of the seven genera from eggnog mapper results were further validated by using diamond alignment e value of 10 5 against the ncbi nr database download on october 2020 additionally to impartially depict the distribution characteristics of the above denitrifying bacteria in different anammox communities this study further compared the relative abundances of denitrifying bacteria in various systems through a meta analysis the metagenomic samples are published in the following literatures ali et al 2019 hosokawa et al 2021 ji et al 2020 keren et al 2020 li et al 2020 suarez et al 2021 wang et al 2022 2019 xu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 2020 table s1 2 4 comparative genome analysis according to the genus taxonomic information in the gtdb a total of 96 genomes of the seven denitrifying bacteria were downloaded from the genbank and refseq public databases these downloaded genomes that were considered reference genomes were further used for comparative genome analysis specifically average nucleotide identity ani based on fastani v 1 33 jain et al 2018 was calculated to compare the similarity between all of the genomes in each genus the pre computed blast search in orthofinder v 2 5 4 emms and kelly 2019 was used to define the orthogroups i e the group of homologue protein sequences ogs for each genus and the core and species specific ogs were identified the complete set of phylogenomic trees of all genera was computed based on the amino acid sequences of ogs with the muscle alignment program and the tree inference method of iq tree in orthofinder a concatenated phylogeny based on the marker genes was also generated to assess the phylogenetic placement of recovered genomes in their corresponding genus marker genes retrieve and phylogenetic tree construct are performed using phylophlan 3 0 as detailly described above in addition the completeness of amino acids and vitamin biosynthesis pathways in all recovered and reference genomes were also calculated using the classify function in enrichm v 0 6 3 the ko module with the completeness of 70 was considered an incomplete pathway 2 5 identification of horizontal gene transfer and visualization to identify hgt events within the anammox community hgt events among all mags were detected with metachip v 1 9 0 song et al 2019 briefly each predicted gene aligned by the best match method was compared among taxa based on the defined phylogenetic tree and then the gene was identified as a candidate gene for hgt as the best matches from the non self group the putative hgt was then refined by the phylogenetic approach which allowed to identify the direction of gene flow the gene flow networks within the anammox community were visualized at the phylum and genus levels using the circlize package v 0 4 15 gu et al 2014 in r to assess whether hgt events potentially affected the global functions of anammox community we further annotated the function of all transferred genes using diamond alignment against the eggnog database v 5 0 as described above moreover the annotated results were also validated using diamond alignment against the ncbi nr database the genetic flow networks between dominant denitrifying bacteria and other bacteria were visualized using the gephi software v 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 phylogenetic composition and genomic analysis of the recovered mags after quality filtering and dereplication a total of 238 mags quality scores 221 50 and 17 50 were obtained from the anammox community covering 74 1 82 0 of the metagenomic reads classification results suggested that at more refined levels especially the genus and species levels only 129 54 2 and 25 10 5 mags could be classified as known genus and species supplementary data s1 respectively based on the functional genes of denitrification pathways presenting in each genome a total of 77 mags were identified as putative denitrifying bacteria further these genomes displayed distinct functional potentials compared with other recovered genomes fig s2 the identified denitrifying bacteria were mainly distributed in seven genera including 26 species fig s3 i e scn 69 89 utpro2 dokdonella ignavibacterium uba964 rubrivivax and ottowia moreover five species mag 752 dokdonella mag 36 ignavibacterium mag 319 scn 69 89 mag 739 scn 69 89 and mag 305 utpro2 dominated in the community with an average abundance higher than 1 0 for each species fig 1a according to the ani index fig s4 some genera e g scn 69 89 uba964 and rubrivivax contained serval novel species in the community notably these denitrifying bacteria exhibited similar abundances in granular sludge and floc samples supplementary data s1 among the five species affiliated with the genus scn 69 89 the novel species mag 319 exhibited the highest relative abundances in all samples average of 2 9 in contrast the relative abundances of 11 species affiliated with genera uba964 and rubrivivax in all samples remained lower than 1 0 average ranging from 0 06 to 0 50 based on the phylogenetic analysis fig 1b the novel species tended to locate in the monophyletic group and maintain a large distance from their reference genomes moreover the phylogenomic tree based on orthogroups for each genus also revealed similar monophyletic features figs s5 s11 the individual lineage could give important insights into their putative common ancestor in the community for instance the novel species mag 752 was affiliated with the same clade as mag 181 despite the long evolutionary distance particularly five species affiliated with the genus rubrivivax comprised three clades based on the phylogenomic analysis of ogs fig s9a suggesting the differential protein family in these species 3 2 a meta analysis of the distribution of the proposed denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities anammox communities are normally present in two types of processes including canon completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite and sharon single reactor system for high activity ammonia removal over nitrite anammox in canon process the anammox communities are exposed to high concentrations of do while in sharon anammox process the anammox communities can avoid do stress in this work the anammox sludge samples were collected from the anoxic tank with a do of 0 5 mg l thereby we assumed that the anammox communities were assembled in a canon like system overall the total abundances of the above dominant denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities ranged from 0 48 to 20 25 fig 2 genera ignavibacterium and dokdonella showed low abundances in the previously reported canon process fig 2a while genus uba964 was seldom detected in the sharon anammox process fig 2b c although the five members of the genus rubrivivax had similar abundances in the canon process species mag 378 and mag 7 affiliated with that genus had the highest abundances in the sharon anammox process species mag 319 of genus scn 69 89 was particularly enriched in canon process while mag 739 had a high abundance in the sharon anammox process moreover the canon process likely promoted the occurrence of genus uba964 e g mag 696 which has been seldom detected in other anammox communities intriguingly two species i e mag 305 and mag 573 affiliated with the genus utpro2 had low abundances in the anammox communities from sharon anammox process under heterotrophic conditions fig 2c in summary the distribution of denitrifying species is likely related to the reactor operation pattern 3 3 predicting the functional divergence based on comparative genome analyses principal coordinate analyses showed that the recovered denitrifying genomes in the anammox community possessed distinct potentials compared with their reference genomes from other habitats fig s12 moreover fewer ogs were found in these covered genomes as compared with their reference genomes figs s13 19 for instance aromatics degradation genes were particularly identified in the recovered species of genera rubrivivax and scn 69 89 while the sulfate transport system was absent in these denitrifying species supplementary data s10 particularly the functional genes of the denitrification process in the seven genera were profiled fig 3a and each genome of these genera possessed part functional genes overall nitrate and nitrite reductase genes were widely identified in these genomes of note periplasmic nitrate reductase napa b c genes were only identified in genus utpro2 while the membrane bound nitrate reductase narg h genes existed in all species of genera uba964 scn 69 89 and rubrivivax moreover the two species mag 271 and mag 287 affiliated with genus ottowia and the species mag 322 affiliated with genus uba964 contained two types of nitrite reduction enzymes i e cytochrome cd1 containing nitrite reductase nirs and cooper type nitrite reductase nirk in terms of the nitric oxide reductase norb and nitrous oxide reductase nosz genes more than half of all species lacked the key genes for the complete denitrification process additionally this study found that the pentaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase nrfa h genes were merely detected in the genus ignavibacterium carbohydrates are a footstone for the heterotrophic lifestyle of denitrifying bacteria and thus the key genes for carbohydrate utilization have been identified in these genomes fig 3a particularly two species of genus ignavibacterium lacked the formate dehydrogenase fdh and glucokinase glk genes the cellulose synthase bcsa gene for cellulose biosynthesis was mainly identified in several members of genera uba964 ignavibacterium and dokdonella in comparison glycogen synthase glga b c and polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase phac phbc genes for organic carbon storage were widely identified in the denitrifying bacteria in terms of vitamin biosynthesis potentials all members of genera dokdonella ottowia rubrivivax and uba964 lacked the key gene e g thiamine phosphate pyrophosphorylase gene thie for thiamine biosynthesis fig 3a the species affiliated with genera ottowia ignavibacterium and rubrivivax were absent of most key genes e g pantoate beta alanine ligase gene panc for pantothenate biosynthesis to evaluate the auxotrophy of amino acids the key genes for amino acid biosynthesis table s2 were further identified in these denitrifying bacteria fig 3b clearly the genus ignavibacterium lacked numerous genes for various amino acid biosynthesis while the other six genera contained most key genes in the genera utpro2 scn 69 89 and uba964 species mag 305 mag 322 mag 501 and mag 319 contained fewer key genes for amino acid biosynthesis than other species in addition according to the completeness of biosynthesis pathways fig s20 and supplementary data s9 several recovered genomes in this system contained fewer genes encoding amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis when compared with reference genomes such as the biotin in genus uba964 the methionine in genus ignavibacterium and the pantothenate in genus rubrivivax 3 4 putative hgt events in dominant denitrifying species according to the meta cihp pipeline this study identified 2495 putative hgt events from all recovered genomes in the anammox community fig s21 the transferred genes of putative hgt events were mainly responsible for energy metabolism and transport supplementary result 2 and figs s22 23 interestingly it was found that the putative hgt events were prevalent among the seven denitrifying genera in addition the putative hgt events also occurred between denitrifying bacteria and other bacteria the transferred genes of putative hgt events were mainly identified in five denitrifying genera i e rubrivivax 281 genes scn69 89 218 genes uba964 136 genes utpro2 120 genes and dokdonella 120 genes and three other genera i e joshi 001 165 genes uba5518 123 genes and ga0077536 91 genes however there were marginal hgt events between the species within one given genus in addition nearly zero putative hgt events were detected within the four anammox bacteria and no gene flow was observed between anammox and denitrifying bacteria as such the genetic flow networks containing donor and recipient were separately constructed to simulate the putative hgt events fig 4a b of note the seven denitrifying genera acquired 414 genes from other bacteria moreover these recipient genes were primarily responsible for energy production and conversion 73 genes and inorganic ion transport and metabolism 53 genes fig 4c for instance species mag 67 obtained the gene encoding acetate kinase from mag 696 and mag 271 obtained the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene from mag 373 fig 5a particularly all the members of genera utpro2 and rubrivivax received numerous abc transporter and multicomponent ion antiporter genes for example species mag 305 received six peptide nickel transport genes from mag 319 and mag 739 fig 5b on the other hand the seven denitrifying genera donated 554 genes which mainly encoded energy production and conversion 116 genes and amino acid transport and metabolism 64 genes these donor genes were largely identified in genera utpro2 and scn 69 89 such as two formate hydrogenlyase genes donated by species mag 305 fig 5c moreover the denitrifying bacteria could donate the same gene for different species for example the gene encoding abc 2 type transport system permease protein was transferred from species mag 67 to species mag 106 and mag 752 fig 5d of note although numerous transferred genes of putative hgt events were involved in nitrogen metabolism fig s23 only 11 related genes were identified in the dominant denitrifying bacteria figs s24 26 for example the nirk gene likely transferred from mag 181 dokdonella to mag 322 uba964 this observation can partially explain the result mentioned above that both nirs and nirk genes were identified in the species mag 322 4 discussion 4 1 distributions of denitrifying bacteria are largely determined by their functional divergences on the basis of meta analysis fig 2 denitrifying bacteria were widely detected and their distribution in anammox communities was likely related to specific environmental conditions a previous study has demonstrated that the acetate and glycerol are mostly converted to polyhydroxybutyrate as a storage compound to yield more electrons for nitrate reduction majone et al 2001 thus promoting the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria and enhancing nitrogen removal according to functional profiles all the denitrifying bacteria mentioned above possessed single or multiple key genes for carbon storage further the fermentative microbes e g ignavibacterium transferring macromolecules e g extracellular polymers to small organic acids preferred the environment without external organics du et al 2017 therefore additional acetate generally reduced the abundances of species mag 36 mag 305 and mag 739 in the canon process wang et al 2018 because of the presence of available endogenous and or exogenous organics in various systems cao et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the denitrifying bacteria are generally abundant in anammox communities it can be speculated that a favorable control of organic acids before anammox system can specifically enrich these denitrifying bacteria han et al 2020 lackner et al 2014 additionally a recent study reported that excessive dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia process detected in genera ignavibacterium remarkably deteriorated the anammox process keren et al 2020 in contrast most species of other denitrifying bacteria were found to likely cooperate and compete with anammox bacteria for nitrogen substrates lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2022 which was evidenced by the co existence of nitrate and nitrite reductase genes in genomes overall the functional divergences for carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism likely played a key role in the distribution of denitrifying bacteria 4 2 distinct potentials of nutrient biosynthesis in denitrifying bacteria previous studies have reached a consensus that the cross feeding interactions are important for the occurrence of anammox and denitrifying bacteria in anammox communities wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 for instance several denitrifying bacteria contained key genes for folate biosynthesis and might support the folate requirements for other members e g anammox bacteria zhou et al 2020 here from the genomic information the distinct potentials for vitamin instead of amino acid biosynthesis in these denitrifying bacteria may suggest their different enrichment in the system it should be noted that available nutrients could lead to the biosynthetic loss of function in microbial communities d souza et al 2018 wang et al 2021 because the biosynthesis of a public good is an energy metabolism costly process tsoi et al 2019 zengler and zaramela 2018 this was agreed with our finding that owing to the available metabolites secreted by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 serval denitrifying bacteria contained fewer genes encoding nutrients biosynthesis compared with reference genomes from other non anammox habitats in addition although the low abundance species possessed prototrophic characteristics when compared with others in same genus the transcriptions of amino acid biosynthesis in these denitrifying bacteria maintained at a low level wang et al 2019 as such we speculated that these low abundance species likely exhibited storage effects for nutrient biosynthesis capabilities in this system 4 3 potential role of hgt events in the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria hgt events are always proposed as an important strategy in the evolution of an organism probably contributing to putative functional divergences and competitive advantages under specific environments abe et al 2020 eyres et al 2015 yang 2021 these transferred genes encoding carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism probably contributed to the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria in the community fig 5 moreover species mag 373 and mag 574 enriching in the system potentially received numerous genes and exhibited specific functions while the two species always have low abundances in other communities similarly the different functional profile in terms of carbohydrate metabolism resulting from hgt events was observed in each mast lineage and these hgt events may contribute to enabling metabolic specialization seeleuthner et al 2018 intriguingly most transferred genes in the community are related to transporters e g amino acid and inorganic ion which can determine how microbes utilize a new metabolite milner et al 2019 particularly nutrient transporter genes from other species may give some denitrifying bacteria capabilities to uptake public goods potentially saving their energy cost and expanding their adaptative range richards and talbot 2013 in addition donating genes from denitrifying bacteria were found to provide selective forces in shaping communities to a certain extent bonham et al 2017 however the frequency of hgt events is generally proportional to the abundance of the donors mori et al 2016 muntadas et al 2016 it could be expected that the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the system probably increased the functional evenness of the community while the denitrifying bacteria with low abundances improved the functional richness of the community taken together while the real hgt rates and frequencies could not be inferred from the cross section groussin et al 2021 the hgt events probably increase the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria 4 4 environmental implications in general the functional divergence among microbes can promote species co existence instead of competitive exclusion ayala muñoz et al 2021 potentially improving the stability of whole communities given the relatively low resistance of anammox systems to environmental pressure li et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 utilizing the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria by optimizing organics metabolites may expand the feasibility of anammox systems for treating various wastewater meanwhile hgt events may alter metabolite utilization by transferring transporter genes and thus the hgt process was considered an alternative strategy for bioaugmentation rios miguel et al 2020 nevertheless hgt events spontaneously occurred without full control in a natural system limiting their engineering application rios miguel et al 2020 although mobile genetic elements implemented in lab scale reactors can be used to purposefully transfer functional genes nzila et al 2016 hgt events generally varied across environmental conditions and bacterial strains brito 2021 for instance an external nutrient potentially determined the effect of hgt events and further alleviated metabolic loads for certain bacteria guo et al 2021 therefore future works should focus on purposefully exploring the response of hgt events to bioaugmentation under various environmental conditions arnold et al 2022 tsoi et al 2019 and revealing the real time hgt process between denitrifying bacteria and other members li et al 2018 5 conclusion 1 among the 77 denitrifying bacteria a total of 26 species were affiliated with the seven dominant denitrifying genera i e ignavibacterium dokdonella utpro2 rubrivivax scn 69 89 and uba964 that have total abundances higher than 1 meta analysis of these species suggested that external organics reduced the abundances of genus ignavibacterium and species mag 305 of utpro2 in anammox communities 2 the different capabilities for carbohydrate including endogenous and exogenous utilization and vitamin e g pantothenate and thiamine biosynthesis largely contributed to the functional divergences of these denitrifying bacteria serval species in this study contained fewer genes encoding methionine pantothenate and biotin biosynthesis compared with their related species from non anammox systems 3 denitrifying bacteria likely acquired the genes encoding energy conversion and inorganic ion transport and metabolism while they putatively donated the genes encoding nutrients e g inorganic ion and amino acid transporter for other members the genetic interactions within anammox communities through horizontal gene transfer might be one of the reasons for the functional divergence of denitrifying bacteria supporting information the function of transferred genes is provided in

15529,improper sludge treatment will cause serious environmental problems and sludge drying is the key to effective treatment almost all the existing sludge drying technologies use heating to overcome the great latent heat of moisture vaporization which leads to high drying energy consumption in this study based on the particle high speed self rotation in the cyclone and micro interface oscillations the cyclone self rotation drying csrd technology was developed it can realize drying of the dewatered landfill sludge dls and the urban sewage dewatered sludge udss with mainly non phase

request 1 introduction the sewage sludge contains a large number of heavy metals pathogens organic pollutants and other toxic harmful substances accompanied by a strong stench han et al 2015 improper sludge treatment will cause serious secondary pollution of the environment which seriously threatens human health and ecological security black et al 2021 feng et al 2015 rio et al 2005 in the past decade the average annual sludge production in the eu and the us has been 9 million ton and 17 8 million ton dry matter dm respectively wu et al 2020 further that in china has exceeded 14 million ton in 2020 with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization the sludge production will substantially increase worldwide gherghel et al 2019 therefore the effective reduction stabilization harmless and resourceful treatment of the sludge has become one of the most urgent social problems generally the moisture content of sewage sludge is more than 95 the high fluidity and large volume first make the transportation extremely unfavorable chen et al 2022 li et al 2022 as the final disposal method for sludge incineration sanitary landfill land use composting and other resource utilization means all have strict technical requirements for the sludge moisture content li et al 2014 rao et al 2017 wu et al 2022 2021 the massive sludge production and the increasingly scarce land resources are in contradiction so sanitary landfill is gradually being limited kansanga et al 2020 at present sludge incineration has become a more common treatment approach krüger et al 2014 it is reported in many papers that the sludge moisture content has a remarkable impact on its calorific value bian et al 2020 yoh et al 2020 yu et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 the reduction of the sludge moisture content from 80 to 30 can lead to the growth of the calorific value from 70 kcal kg to 2400 kcal kg liu et al 2017 it can be seen that any form of the sludge disposal always requires mass reduction with water removal as a core requirement after mechanical dewatering the sludge moisture content is still as high as 60 85 and drying treatment can further reduce the moisture content significantly cai et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the conventional thermal evaporation drying ted technology such as high temperature flash drying peeters 2010 hot air drying wulyapash et al 2022 and typical fluid bed drying groenewold and tsotsas 2007 can achieve the sludge rapid drying through heat transfer of high temperature medium but the energy consumption is as high as 3 5 mj kg h2o nikolopoulos et al 2015 rao et al 2015 tuncer et al 2020 designed a novel solar energy absorption auxiliary dryer to shorten the drying time of low temperature convection drying by 31 35 however due to the addition of auxiliary equipment the energy consumption of the system increased additionally it still took about 100 min to lessen the sludge moisture content to 30 a common feature of all these ted technologies is that they require heating to evaporate the liquid water in the sludge to achieve drying therefore it is necessary to overcome the hurdle of the high latent heat of water vaporization up to 2260 kj kg and high energy consumption becomes a serious problem therefore the development of sludge drying technologies with low energy consumption and high efficiency is of considerable significance for sludge treatment and even the entire sewage treatment industry sholl and lively 2016 pointed out in the nature review that purifying mixtures without using heat would lower global energy use emissions and pollution and open up new routes to resources development of non thermal separation technologies in the field of sludge drying is in its early stage the cyclone has been extensively utilized in ecological environmental protection the chemical industry and food processing due to the simple structure low cost and the ability to work at high temperature and pressure brar and elsayed 2018 dasar and patil 2020 ganegama bogodage and leung 2015 cyclones have been regarded only as the efficient separation device for a long time until huang et al explored the phenomenon of particle high speed self rotation in the swirling flow field up to 2000 6000 rad s through high speed photography huang et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2018 so new application prospects were initiated previous researchers attempted to apply the coupled motions between the particle s high speed self rotation and revolution in the cyclone to pollutants removal and achieved good results such as catalyst oil removal fu et al 2018 volatile organic compounds voc adsorption ma et al 2020 and lignite drying fu et al 2022 additionally the coupled motions can induce micro interface oscillations which can further enhance the mass transfer process li et al 2021 therefore the non thermal separation technology utilizing the particle s high speed self rotation in a cyclone is very promising in the sludge drying however no research has been conducted to address this fascinating issue yet this study is aimed to develop the cyclone self rotation drying csrd technology of sludge essentially based on the particle high speed self rotation and micro interface oscillations in the cyclone it is different from the conventional ted technologies the impacts of the carrier gas temperature feeding rate residence time and cyclone crushing on the sludge csrd were also examined in some detail the main purpose of the present scrutiny is to initiate research on the csrd technology associated with the sludge drying by opening an innovative path the obtained results can provide technical guidance for practical applications of the csrd and would be very important for solving the problem of balancing energy consumption and drying efficiency through non thermal separation technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental principle the water in the sludge is generally classified into the following four types vaxelaire and cézac 2004 wang et al 2017 1 the free water that is not affected by solid particles 2 the interstitial water trapped in the gap between particles 3 the surface water adsorbed on the surface and inside micropores of particles note that the water within micropores is also called the pore water and 4 the bound water that can only be detached by heat transfer the removal difficulty levels of these four types of water in order increase the sludge cake dewatered by an efficient mechanical device almost does not contain any free water deng et al 2011a the principle of the csrd has been demonstrated in fig 1 the hot carrier gas carries the sludge particles into the cyclone which has a complex three dimensional swirling turbulent flow field where the immersed sludge particles are mainly subject to the drag force buoyancy and gravity force the particles are dragged by the swirling fluid to revolute around the central axis of the cyclone the high strength shear flow in the swirling flow field generates a velocity difference on both sides of the sludge particle due to the unbalanced force on both sides of the particle it will make high speed self rotation around its self center in the opposite direction of the revolution under the action of the shear stress moment huang et al 2017 in text s1 there is the in depth analysis of particle self rotation in the cyclone the great centrifugal force generated by the high speed self rotation up to 2000 6000 rad s wang et al 2018 can separate the water via non phase change scheme when the particles are immersed in the swirling shear fluid meanwhile the local shear stress acting on the particle surface remarkably rises the sludge is mostly composed of small particles and has a low compressive strength hence the particles gradually deform until breaking the crushing effect separates the sludge into smaller particles preferentially along the large clearance pores this process makes part of the interstitial water existing in the large clearance pores of the sludge be removed in liquid form the great centrifugal force generated by the high speed self rotation can easily remove the water adsorbed on the surface and that in the internal micropores of the smallest sludge particles formed by crushing the coupled motions of the self rotation and revolution of the particles can also induce the micro interface to have oscillations li et al 2021 which further enhance water removal text s2 finally the dried sludge particles are discharged from the underflow port of the cyclone the carrier gas carrying droplets is discharged from the overflow port of the cyclone it should be noticed that the reason for providing the carrier gas at a particular temperature is to lessen the viscous resistance of water in the sludge particles so as to reduce the difficulty of water removal 2 2 experimental materials the experimental materials in this study including urban sewage dewatered sludge udss and dewatered landfill sludge dls were dewatered by the plate frame filter press machine at low temperature 80 90 c and under vacuum they have been extracted from shanghai taihe sewage treatment plant and shanghai laogang sludge landfill site respectively the moisture content of the udss is 67 which was produced from the anaerobic anoxic oxic biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal process system of the sewage treatment plant the moisture content of the dls is 53 which was the udss that has been landfilled for up to ten years due to the severe shortage of the sludge landfill storage capacity in china some cities such as shanghai have begun to require the excavation and incineration of the landfill sludge in existing landfills their main physical properties have been given in table 1 2 3 experimental equipment and process the csrd process 3d layout and physical photo of the experimental device have been presented in fig 2 a 2b and 2c respectively the hot carrier gas required by this study was produced by passing the normal temperature air through a blower and a gas heater the lump sludge cake was granulated by a screw granulator to produce long sludge strips 6 mm in diameter the strips cut off by airflow were transported into the cyclone dryer for shear crushing and drying with mainly non phase change the dried sludge particles fell to the middle part of the lifting column from the underflow port of the cyclone dryer the gas flow was discharged from the overflow port and entered the bottom of the lifting column and then it carried the sludge particles to the cyclone separator after the gas solid separation the dry sludge was discharged from the underflow port and collected the gas flow with droplets was discharged from the overflow port the main characteristic of all utilized cyclones in this device is the low pressure drop therefore the developed cyclone dryer and the lifting column can be connected in multi stage series to extend the residence time to improve the drying effect in industrial applications the size information of the cyclone dryer and cyclone separator are shown in fig 2d and 2e respectively 2 4 analysis and calculation methods the analysis methods of the sludge moisture content determination thermal drying experiment particle size sludge microscopic morphology and pore size distribution are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of the carrier gas temperature on the csrd the carrier gas temperature can alter the viscous resistance of the moisture in the sludge and hence is a crucial factor that affects the csrd performance fig 3 a and 3b demonstrate the drying effects of the two types of sludge subjected to various carrier gas temperatures the gas flow rate was kept fixed at 800 m3 h and the feeding rate was set equal to 30 kg h during the experimentation the measured residence time t r of the material in the system was about 5 s the obtained results reveal that as the carrier gas temperature grows the remaining moisture contents of the dls and udss lessen gradually while their corresponding drying efficiencies increase when the carrier gas temperature was set to 100 c the moisture content of the dls was significantly reduced to 17 53 with a drying efficiency of 82 61 for the carrier gas under room temperature condition the drying efficiency was obtained as 35 78 mainly depending on the high speed self rotation of the particles the csrd based performance of the udss was almost consistent with that of the dls but the overall performance was slightly worse the low carrier gas temperature could not considerably reduce the viscous resistance of the moisture it suggests that the carrier gas temperature should be increased to at least 40 c and a good drying effect can be obtained at around 90 c additionally the changes in the absolute total mass were compared for the two types of sludge before and after drying the total mass is defined as the sum of the dry sludge ds matrix per unit mass plus to the moisture carried at the carrier gas temperature of 100 c the total mass of the dls after drying reduced from 2 13 to 1 20 g g ds and that of the udss after drying lessened from 3 03 to 1 65 g g ds the masses of the two dried sludge in order were only 56 34 and 54 46 of their corresponding original sludge pieces this brief examination reveals that the csrd is a very effective scheme for the sludge mass reduction 3 2 impacts of the feeding rate on the csrd the feeding rate affects the particle density per unit gas volume and also represents the treatment capacity of the drying system as shown in fig 3c and 3d as the feeding rate increases the dls and udss drying efficiency gradually lessens in the presence of a constant controlled carrier gas temperature at 90 c and a gas volume of 800 m3 h a good drying effect could be achieved for the dls when the feeding rate was less than 70 kg h and its drying efficiency was stably above 60 further the overall drying effect of the udss was worse than that of the dls when the feeding rate was greater than 30 kg h the drying efficiency of the udss was less than 60 a comparison study on the total mass changes of these two types of sludge before and after drying reveal that although the overall drying effect of the udss was slightly worse than that of the dls the absolute amount of moisture removed from the udss was greater and hence its mass reduction was more apparent under the same operating condition this finding is consistent with the obtained results in section 3 1 additionally it is realized that when the system feeding rate was greater than 100 kg h corresponding to a sludge carrying capacity per unit gas volume of 0 125 kg m3 the sludge carrying capacity of the carrier gas was obviously insufficient therefore the feeding load should not exceed 0 125 kg m3 to guarantee a smooth feeding process these findings provide valuable guidelines for industrial applications of the csrd 3 3 impacts of the residence time on the csrd in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the average residence time of the sludge in the system is only 5 s to explore the effect of the particle residence time on the csrd performance we simulated the drying effect of increasing the number of cyclone series that is extending the residence time as mentioned in section 2 3 by circulating the feed twice continuously based on the device during circulating the feed the inlet temperature of the carrier gas was kept the same as the outlet temperature in the last feeding process to simulate the actual temperature environment after on site tests the residence time of one cycle and two cycles was extended to 10 s and 15 s respectively as the initial carrier gas temperature was set as 90 c and the gas volume rate was maintained fixed at 800 m3 h the impacts of the residence time on the csrd of the dls and udss at various feeding rates are presented in fig 4 a and 4d respectively with the same residence time the drying efficiency decreases as the feeding rate increases at the same feeding rate the drying efficiency remarkably grows as the residence time extends for example with the feeding rate of 50 kg h and the residence time of 5 s the drying efficiencies of the dls and udss in order were 64 92 and 45 27 when the residence time was extended to 15 s their corresponding drying efficiencies rose to 90 52 and 77 72 at higher feeding rates increasing the residence time also resulted in a substantial increase in the drying efficiency suggesting that extending the residence time can increase the processing capacity of the system furthermore when the residence time was extended from 10 to 15 s the drying efficiency improvement was significantly lower than that of the case in which the residence time was extended from 5 to 10 s this phenomenon can be explained for two main reasons as follows first as the residence time becomes longer the carrier gas temperature apparently lessens while most of it is due to the physical heat dissipation of the system and according to the previous experimental findings a lower carrier gas temperature is not conducive to sludge drying moreover as reported in the literature the difficulty of moisture removal gradually magnifies with the drying process cao et al 2021 wang et al 2017 in the later stage of the sludge drying the water that should be removed is mostly the surface water and bound water that have higher binding strengths and thereby more energy is required to remove them as the feeding rate and the gas volume rate in order were kept fixed at 30 kg h and 800 m3 h the effects of the residence time on the csrd of the dls and udss at various carrier gas temperatures have been presented in fig 4b and 4e respectively for a considered residence time the drying efficiency grows as the carrier gas temperature increases for a given temperature of the carrier gas the drying efficiency increases as the residence time grows when the temperature was set as 90 c the drying efficiencies of the dls with the residence time of 5 10 and 15 s in order were 67 39 91 90 and 93 48 while the drying efficiencies of the udss were 58 60 83 97 and 88 51 respectively it is observed that the extension of the residence time has a remarkable improvement effect on the drying efficiency as the residence time was extended to 15 s a satisfactory drying effect can be achieved even at low temperatures of the carrier gas this fact indicates that the residence time can be appropriately extended in exchange for a lower carrier gas temperature thereby reducing drying energy consumption furthermore the enhanced effect of the extended residence time on the drying effect becomes essentially highlighted within the range of 5 10 s a fact similar to the trend described earlier as shown in fig 4c and 4f when the feeding rate increased to 50 kg h although the overall drying effects of these two types of sludge slightly reduced the trends summarized above were still valid the cyclone size change also affects the residence time of the material so the effect of cyclone structure on drying is a very meaningful research content 3 4 comparison between the csrd and ted to compare the drying rates of the csrd and ted a constant temperature drying experiment was carried out based on the moisture analyzer the structure of the moisture analyzer which can quickly evaporate the moisture of the sample and record the remaining moisture content in real time mainly includes a high precision mass weighing element a drying chamber and a halogen lamp heating element in order to ensure that the sludge was fully dispersed in the drying chamber and consistent with the material state in the cyclone only a few samples were placed on the balanced plate the thickness was only about 2 mm to reduce the accumulation the ambient temperature in the drying chamber was kept constant at 80 c during the experiment the changes in the absolute moisture contents of the dls and udss the amount of moisture carried by the dry sludge matrix per unit mass over time have been presented in fig 5 the obtained results display that the csrd can remove the sludge moisture to a lower level in a very short period of 5 15 s and the drying rate was apparently greater than that of the ted when the carrier gas temperature was set as 80 c the absolute moisture content of dls given by the csrd at the residence time of 5 s lessened to 0 47 g g ds and the corresponding average drying rate was about 0 158 g s g ds in contrast it took approximately 630 s for the ted to reduce the sludge moisture to the same level and the corresponding average drying rate was roughly equal to 0 001 g s g ds hence the average drying rate of the ted was only about 1 158 of that of the csrd based on the material balance and the energy balance the proportion of the non phase change in the removal moisture in the csrd can be calculated the detailed calculation process can be found in text s4 and table s1 the obtained results reveal that when the residence time was equal to 5 10 and 15 s the proportions of the non phase change of the dls drying process were 68 94 63 61 and 61 27 respectively while those of the udss in order were 63 39 64 16 and 63 19 it can be seen that the moisture removal in the process of the sludge csrd was dominated by the non phase change which was noticeably different from that of the ted the csrd basically relies on the high speed self rotation of the particles and the micro interface oscillations for effective moisture removal this will be considerably different from the conventional ted process from the free water to bound water the distributions of the water types in the sludge before and after drying were measured quantitatively by the thermal drying experiment fig 6 a shows the water distribution of the original udss it can be seen that the sludge cake hardly contained any free water this fact is consistent with that investigated in the literature deng et al 2011b the absolute contents of the interstitial water surface water and bound water in the original sludge in order were 1 15 0 60 and 0 13 g m g ds 1 g dry sludge corresponds to 0 13 g moisture among them the interstitial water exhibited the highest content fig 6b illustrates the water distribution of the sludge after drying when the residence time carrier gas temperature and feeding rate in order were set equal to 5 s 90 c and 50 kg h under these conditions the absolute moisture contents of the interstitial water the surface water and the bound water were obtained as 0 80 0 14 and 0 13 g m g ds respectively it is detectable that the water types removed by csrd were mainly the interstitial water and the surface water and their corresponding removal rates in order were 30 and 77 interestingly the interstitial water was not be wholly removed by that time but the surface water exhibited an apparent removal rate exhibiting a big difference compared to the ted the csrd may not need to follow the water removal order from the interstitial water to the bound water when the residence time was extended to 10 and 15 s the interstitial water and surface water were further removed while the bound water basically remained unchanged fig 6c and 6d additionally the water distribution of the dls before and after drying has been given in text s5 and fig s2 3 5 shear crushing in sludge csrd process the water contained in the sludge cake is mostly distributed in the clearance between the smallest particle units particles surface and internal micro pores therefore the sludge particle size is very important for the csrd the particle sizes of these two types of sludge are generally between 1 and 1000 μm and that of the udss is remarkably smaller fig s3 according to the literature wakeman 2007 larger particle size allows for easier moisture removal the main reason behind this fact is that the anti compression capability of the sludge cake with larger particles is stronger therefore the clearance between the particles becomes bigger so that the interstitial water with a higher content can be removed more easily this is why the moisture removal effect of the udss is worse than that of the dls the strong shear stress of the swirling flow field can break the sludge into smaller particles the crushing effect is very significant for the soft material of the sludge this effect is beneficial to the drying process that relies on the high speed self rotation of the particles the dried dls at various operating conditions was screened and graded according to particle size and the obtained results have been provided in fig 7 most of the sludge discharge particle sizes of the dls more than 70 were distributed in the range of 0 to 0 5 mm the size distributions of the discharged particles and the original sludge particles exhibited a remarkable overlap therefore the dls can be rationally broken into the initial particle size range by the shear action of the swirling flow field to disperse the particles to the maximum extent this effect is beneficial for the csrd performance the cyclone crushing essentially occurs in the residence time of 0 5 s as the residence time increased the proportion of the particles smaller than 0 1 mm increased more but this change was insignificant it is worth mentioning that the main process which occurred in 0 5 s was the sludge crushing such a small period was not sufficient at all for moisture removal of most particles because they did not have a chance to fully achieve high speed self rotation this finding is also consistent with the results given in section 3 3 that the drying efficiency was significantly enhanced when the residence time was extended from 5 to 10 s a comparison between the plotted results in fig 7a and 7b indicates that the proportion of the discharged particles in the range of 0 0 5 mm was slightly greater in the case of 30 kg h feeding rate indicating that a lower feeding rate can achieve a better crushing effect additionally a comparison between the graphs of fig 7a and 7c reveals that the crushing effect is more obvious for the higher temperatures of the carrier gas the actual state of the original sludge and the dried discharge is shown in fig 7d additionally the moisture content of the dls discharge residence time 5 s were measured within the range of each sieved particle size fig 8 as a general rule the smaller the size of the discharged particles the lower the remaining moisture content when the feeding rate increases the remaining moisture content curve gradually increases and tends to equilibrium for the particles in the same size range fig 8a by growing the carrier gas temperature the remaining moisture content of the discharge within the same particle size range gradually lessened and the discrepancy in the remaining moisture contents of different particle size ranges became more obvious fig 8b as the carrier gas temperature increased from 60 c to 90 c the discrepancy between the remaining moisture content of particles 0 1 mm and those 2 mm grew from 12 30 to 22 the overall crushing effect of the udss was slightly worse than that of the dls fig s4 and the original sludge particle size is smaller which makes the drying effect worse text s6 pore size characteristics of the sludge particles before and after drying were analyzed by mercury intrusion and nitrogen adsorption methods the obtained results indicate that the average pore size pore volume and porosity of the dried sludge particles decreased noticeably table s2 and fig s5 this issue is attributed to the fact that the cyclone crushing process destroyed the interstitial pores between the particles and broke the aggregation state of the sludge particles the specific micromorphology of sludge particles was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem the original sludge particles demonstrated apparent relatively large interstitial pores while the dried sludge tended to be non aggregated independent particle units fig s6 the detailed microscopic pore structure analysis of sludge particles is provided in some detail in text s7 3 6 the 50 t d csrd process for the udss in enlarged industrial applications based on many pilot experiments in the early stage we cooperated with shanghai ceo environmental protection technology co ltd to propose a 50 t d enlarged industrial application program using csrd for the udss fig 9 the energy consumption of the system mainly includes power electricity and the heater s energy consumption the heat source of the gas heater is designed to use steam assuming the market unit price of electricity of 0 75 cny kw h and the market unit price of steam of 200 cny t the unit operating cost of the csrd process is calculated to be 91 25 cny t wet sludge if it is analyzed based on the amount of water removed the unit operation cost is calculated to be 159 69 cny t h2o in contrast the operation cost of the conventional ted technology in the market is approximately 320 cny t h2o therefore it is observed that csrd has great economic benefits the process introduction material and energy balance equipment list table s3 and running cost analysis table s4 of the scheme are presented specifically in text s8 4 conclusions in this study we developed a novel drying technology different from the conventional thermal evaporation drying based on the particle high speed self rotation in cyclone to achieve sludge drying with mainly non phase change at low carrier gas temperature and very short residence time primary conclusions include 1 the csrd efficiency increased significantly with increasing the carrier gas temperature decreasing the feeding rate and prolonging the residence time under the conditions of 90 c 30 kg h and 15 s the moisture content of the dls decreased from 53 to 6 85 and that of the udss decreased from 67 to 18 92 their drying efficiencies in order reached 93 48 and 88 51 respectively 2 the csrd process had a strong crushing effect on the sludge and the percentage of sludge particles with particle size less than 0 5 mm after drying was about 70 the higher the crushing strength the better the corresponding drying effect the particle size pore volume and average pore size of the original dls were significantly larger than those of udss while the porosity of both was close and all these parameters were significantly decreased after drying 3 the csrd can break the removal sequence from the free water to bound water in the conventional ted process of sludge and the drying rate of the former was more than 158 times that of the latter through calculation the proportions of dls and udss moisture non phase change removal during the csrd process touched 68 94 and 63 39 respectively the csrd also had lower operating cost than the conventional ted showing obvious technical advantages this study provides a new technology and idea for sludge drying with high efficiency and low energy consumption which can break the inherent thinking that sludge drying must rely on heating to make water evaporate fill the research gap of water non phase change separation in the field of drying and

15529,improper sludge treatment will cause serious environmental problems and sludge drying is the key to effective treatment almost all the existing sludge drying technologies use heating to overcome the great latent heat of moisture vaporization which leads to high drying energy consumption in this study based on the particle high speed self rotation in the cyclone and micro interface

phenomenon of particle high speed self rotation in the swirling flow field up to 2000 6000 rad s through high speed photography huang et al 2017 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2018 so new application prospects were initiated previous researchers attempted to apply the coupled motions between the particle s high speed self rotation and revolution in the cyclone to pollutants removal and achieved good results such as catalyst oil removal fu et al 2018 volatile organic compounds voc adsorption ma et al 2020 and lignite drying fu et al 2022 additionally the coupled motions can induce micro interface oscillations which can further enhance the mass transfer process li et al 2021 therefore the non thermal separation technology utilizing the particle s high speed self rotation in a cyclone is very promising in the sludge drying however no research has been conducted to address this fascinating issue yet this study is aimed to develop the cyclone self rotation drying csrd technology of sludge essentially based on the particle high speed self rotation and micro interface oscillations in the cyclone it is different from the conventional ted technologies the impacts of the carrier gas temperature feeding rate residence time and cyclone crushing on the sludge csrd were also examined in some detail the main purpose of the present scrutiny is to initiate research on the csrd technology associated with the sludge drying by opening an innovative path the obtained results can provide technical guidance for practical applications of the csrd and would be very important for solving the problem of balancing energy consumption and drying efficiency through non thermal separation technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental principle the water in the sludge is generally classified into the following four types vaxelaire and cézac 2004 wang et al 2017 1 the free water that is not affected by solid particles 2 the interstitial water trapped in the gap between particles 3 the surface water adsorbed on the surface and inside micropores of particles note that the water within micropores is also called the pore water and 4 the bound water that can only be detached by heat transfer the removal difficulty levels of these four types of water in order increase the sludge cake dewatered by an efficient mechanical device almost does not contain any free water deng et al 2011a the principle of the csrd has been demonstrated in fig 1 the hot carrier gas carries the sludge particles into the cyclone which has a complex three dimensional swirling turbulent flow field where the immersed sludge particles are mainly subject to the drag force buoyancy and gravity force the particles are dragged by the swirling fluid to revolute around the central axis of the cyclone the high strength shear flow in the swirling flow field generates a velocity difference on both sides of the sludge particle due to the unbalanced force on both sides of the particle it will make high speed self rotation around its self center in the opposite direction of the revolution under the action of the shear stress moment huang et al 2017 in text s1 there is the in depth analysis of particle self rotation in the cyclone the great centrifugal force generated by the high speed self rotation up to 2000 6000 rad s wang et al 2018 can separate the water via non phase change scheme when the particles are immersed in the swirling shear fluid meanwhile the local shear stress acting on the particle surface remarkably rises the sludge is mostly composed of small particles and has a low compressive strength hence the particles gradually deform until breaking the crushing effect separates the sludge into smaller particles preferentially along the large clearance pores this process makes part of the interstitial water existing in the large clearance pores of the sludge be removed in liquid form the great centrifugal force generated by the high speed self rotation can easily remove the water adsorbed on the surface and that in the internal micropores of the smallest sludge particles formed by crushing the coupled motions of the self rotation and revolution of the particles can also induce the micro interface to have oscillations li et al 2021 which further enhance water removal text s2 finally the dried sludge particles are discharged from the underflow port of the cyclone the carrier gas carrying droplets is discharged from the overflow port of the cyclone it should be noticed that the reason for providing the carrier gas at a particular temperature is to lessen the viscous resistance of water in the sludge particles so as to reduce the difficulty of water removal 2 2 experimental materials the experimental materials in this study including urban sewage dewatered sludge udss and dewatered landfill sludge dls were dewatered by the plate frame filter press machine at low temperature 80 90 c and under vacuum they have been extracted from shanghai taihe sewage treatment plant and shanghai laogang sludge landfill site respectively the moisture content of the udss is 67 which was produced from the anaerobic anoxic oxic biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal process system of the sewage treatment plant the moisture content of the dls is 53 which was the udss that has been landfilled for up to ten years due to the severe shortage of the sludge landfill storage capacity in china some cities such as shanghai have begun to require the excavation and incineration of the landfill sludge in existing landfills their main physical properties have been given in table 1 2 3 experimental equipment and process the csrd process 3d layout and physical photo of the experimental device have been presented in fig 2 a 2b and 2c respectively the hot carrier gas required by this study was produced by passing the normal temperature air through a blower and a gas heater the lump sludge cake was granulated by a screw granulator to produce long sludge strips 6 mm in diameter the strips cut off by airflow were transported into the cyclone dryer for shear crushing and drying with mainly non phase change the dried sludge particles fell to the middle part of the lifting column from the underflow port of the cyclone dryer the gas flow was discharged from the overflow port and entered the bottom of the lifting column and then it carried the sludge particles to the cyclone separator after the gas solid separation the dry sludge was discharged from the underflow port and collected the gas flow with droplets was discharged from the overflow port the main characteristic of all utilized cyclones in this device is the low pressure drop therefore the developed cyclone dryer and the lifting column can be connected in multi stage series to extend the residence time to improve the drying effect in industrial applications the size information of the cyclone dryer and cyclone separator are shown in fig 2d and 2e respectively 2 4 analysis and calculation methods the analysis methods of the sludge moisture content determination thermal drying experiment particle size sludge microscopic morphology and pore size distribution are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of the carrier gas temperature on the csrd the carrier gas temperature can alter the viscous resistance of the moisture in the sludge and hence is a crucial factor that affects the csrd performance fig 3 a and 3b demonstrate the drying effects of the two types of sludge subjected to various carrier gas temperatures the gas flow rate was kept fixed at 800 m3 h and the feeding rate was set equal to 30 kg h during the experimentation the measured residence time t r of the material in the system was about 5 s the obtained results reveal that as the carrier gas temperature grows the remaining moisture contents of the dls and udss lessen gradually while their corresponding drying efficiencies increase when the carrier gas temperature was set to 100 c the moisture content of the dls was significantly reduced to 17 53 with a drying efficiency of 82 61 for the carrier gas under room temperature condition the drying efficiency was obtained as 35 78 mainly depending on the high speed self rotation of the particles the csrd based performance of the udss was almost consistent with that of the dls but the overall performance was slightly worse the low carrier gas temperature could not considerably reduce the viscous resistance of the moisture it suggests that the carrier gas temperature should be increased to at least 40 c and a good drying effect can be obtained at around 90 c additionally the changes in the absolute total mass were compared for the two types of sludge before and after drying the total mass is defined as the sum of the dry sludge ds matrix per unit mass plus to the moisture carried at the carrier gas temperature of 100 c the total mass of the dls after drying reduced from 2 13 to 1 20 g g ds and that of the udss after drying lessened from 3 03 to 1 65 g g ds the masses of the two dried sludge in order were only 56 34 and 54 46 of their corresponding original sludge pieces this brief examination reveals that the csrd is a very effective scheme for the sludge mass reduction 3 2 impacts of the feeding rate on the csrd the feeding rate affects the particle density per unit gas volume and also represents the treatment capacity of the drying system as shown in fig 3c and 3d as the feeding rate increases the dls and udss drying efficiency gradually lessens in the presence of a constant controlled carrier gas temperature at 90 c and a gas volume of 800 m3 h a good drying effect could be achieved for the dls when the feeding rate was less than 70 kg h and its drying efficiency was stably above 60 further the overall drying effect of the udss was worse than that of the dls when the feeding rate was greater than 30 kg h the drying efficiency of the udss was less than 60 a comparison study on the total mass changes of these two types of sludge before and after drying reveal that although the overall drying effect of the udss was slightly worse than that of the dls the absolute amount of moisture removed from the udss was greater and hence its mass reduction was more apparent under the same operating condition this finding is consistent with the obtained results in section 3 1 additionally it is realized that when the system feeding rate was greater than 100 kg h corresponding to a sludge carrying capacity per unit gas volume of 0 125 kg m3 the sludge carrying capacity of the carrier gas was obviously insufficient therefore the feeding load should not exceed 0 125 kg m3 to guarantee a smooth feeding process these findings provide valuable guidelines for industrial applications of the csrd 3 3 impacts of the residence time on the csrd in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the average residence time of the sludge in the system is only 5 s to explore the effect of the particle residence time on the csrd performance we simulated the drying effect of increasing the number of cyclone series that is extending the residence time as mentioned in section 2 3 by circulating the feed twice continuously based on the device during circulating the feed the inlet temperature of the carrier gas was kept the same as the outlet temperature in the last feeding process to simulate the actual temperature environment after on site tests the residence time of one cycle and two cycles was extended to 10 s and 15 s respectively as the initial carrier gas temperature was set as 90 c and the gas volume rate was maintained fixed at 800 m3 h the impacts of the residence time on the csrd of the dls and udss at various feeding rates are presented in fig 4 a and 4d respectively with the same residence time the drying efficiency decreases as the feeding rate increases at the same feeding rate the drying efficiency remarkably grows as the residence time extends for example with the feeding rate of 50 kg h and the residence time of 5 s the drying efficiencies of the dls and udss in order were 64 92 and 45 27 when the residence time was extended to 15 s their corresponding drying efficiencies rose to 90 52 and 77 72 at higher feeding rates increasing the residence time also resulted in a substantial increase in the drying efficiency suggesting that extending the residence time can increase the processing capacity of the system furthermore when the residence time was extended from 10 to 15 s the drying efficiency improvement was significantly lower than that of the case in which the residence time was extended from 5 to 10 s this phenomenon can be explained for two main reasons as follows first as the residence time becomes longer the carrier gas temperature apparently lessens while most of it is due to the physical heat dissipation of the system and according to the previous experimental findings a lower carrier gas temperature is not conducive to sludge drying moreover as reported in the literature the difficulty of moisture removal gradually magnifies with the drying process cao et al 2021 wang et al 2017 in the later stage of the sludge drying the water that should be removed is mostly the surface water and bound water that have higher binding strengths and thereby more energy is required to remove them as the feeding rate and the gas volume rate in order were kept fixed at 30 kg h and 800 m3 h the effects of the residence time on the csrd of the dls and udss at various carrier gas temperatures have been presented in fig 4b and 4e respectively for a considered residence time the drying efficiency grows as the carrier gas temperature increases for a given temperature of the carrier gas the drying efficiency increases as the residence time grows when the temperature was set as 90 c the drying efficiencies of the dls with the residence time of 5 10 and 15 s in order were 67 39 91 90 and 93 48 while the drying efficiencies of the udss were 58 60 83 97 and 88 51 respectively it is observed that the extension of the residence time has a remarkable improvement effect on the drying efficiency as the residence time was extended to 15 s a satisfactory drying effect can be achieved even at low temperatures of the carrier gas this fact indicates that the residence time can be appropriately extended in exchange for a lower carrier gas temperature thereby reducing drying energy consumption furthermore the enhanced effect of the extended residence time on the drying effect becomes essentially highlighted within the range of 5 10 s a fact similar to the trend described earlier as shown in fig 4c and 4f when the feeding rate increased to 50 kg h although the overall drying effects of these two types of sludge slightly reduced the trends summarized above were still valid the cyclone size change also affects the residence time of the material so the effect of cyclone structure on drying is a very meaningful research content 3 4 comparison between the csrd and ted to compare the drying rates of the csrd and ted a constant temperature drying experiment was carried out based on the moisture analyzer the structure of the moisture analyzer which can quickly evaporate the moisture of the sample and record the remaining moisture content in real time mainly includes a high precision mass weighing element a drying chamber and a halogen lamp heating element in order to ensure that the sludge was fully dispersed in the drying chamber and consistent with the material state in the cyclone only a few samples were placed on the balanced plate the thickness was only about 2 mm to reduce the accumulation the ambient temperature in the drying chamber was kept constant at 80 c during the experiment the changes in the absolute moisture contents of the dls and udss the amount of moisture carried by the dry sludge matrix per unit mass over time have been presented in fig 5 the obtained results display that the csrd can remove the sludge moisture to a lower level in a very short period of 5 15 s and the drying rate was apparently greater than that of the ted when the carrier gas temperature was set as 80 c the absolute moisture content of dls given by the csrd at the residence time of 5 s lessened to 0 47 g g ds and the corresponding average drying rate was about 0 158 g s g ds in contrast it took approximately 630 s for the ted to reduce the sludge moisture to the same level and the corresponding average drying rate was roughly equal to 0 001 g s g ds hence the average drying rate of the ted was only about 1 158 of that of the csrd based on the material balance and the energy balance the proportion of the non phase change in the removal moisture in the csrd can be calculated the detailed calculation process can be found in text s4 and table s1 the obtained results reveal that when the residence time was equal to 5 10 and 15 s the proportions of the non phase change of the dls drying process were 68 94 63 61 and 61 27 respectively while those of the udss in order were 63 39 64 16 and 63 19 it can be seen that the moisture removal in the process of the sludge csrd was dominated by the non phase change which was noticeably different from that of the ted the csrd basically relies on the high speed self rotation of the particles and the micro interface oscillations for effective moisture removal this will be considerably different from the conventional ted process from the free water to bound water the distributions of the water types in the sludge before and after drying were measured quantitatively by the thermal drying experiment fig 6 a shows the water distribution of the original udss it can be seen that the sludge cake hardly contained any free water this fact is consistent with that investigated in the literature deng et al 2011b the absolute contents of the interstitial water surface water and bound water in the original sludge in order were 1 15 0 60 and 0 13 g m g ds 1 g dry sludge corresponds to 0 13 g moisture among them the interstitial water exhibited the highest content fig 6b illustrates the water distribution of the sludge after drying when the residence time carrier gas temperature and feeding rate in order were set equal to 5 s 90 c and 50 kg h under these conditions the absolute moisture contents of the interstitial water the surface water and the bound water were obtained as 0 80 0 14 and 0 13 g m g ds respectively it is detectable that the water types removed by csrd were mainly the interstitial water and the surface water and their corresponding removal rates in order were 30 and 77 interestingly the interstitial water was not be wholly removed by that time but the surface water exhibited an apparent removal rate exhibiting a big difference compared to the ted the csrd may not need to follow the water removal order from the interstitial water to the bound water when the residence time was extended to 10 and 15 s the interstitial water and surface water were further removed while the bound water basically remained unchanged fig 6c and 6d additionally the water distribution of the dls before and after drying has been given in text s5 and fig s2 3 5 shear crushing in sludge csrd process the water contained in the sludge cake is mostly distributed in the clearance between the smallest particle units particles surface and internal micro pores therefore the sludge particle size is very important for the csrd the particle sizes of these two types of sludge are generally between 1 and 1000 μm and that of the udss is remarkably smaller fig s3 according to the literature wakeman 2007 larger particle size allows for easier moisture removal the main reason behind this fact is that the anti compression capability of the sludge cake with larger particles is stronger therefore the clearance between the particles becomes bigger so that the interstitial water with a higher content can be removed more easily this is why the moisture removal effect of the udss is worse than that of the dls the strong shear stress of the swirling flow field can break the sludge into smaller particles the crushing effect is very significant for the soft material of the sludge this effect is beneficial to the drying process that relies on the high speed self rotation of the particles the dried dls at various operating conditions was screened and graded according to particle size and the obtained results have been provided in fig 7 most of the sludge discharge particle sizes of the dls more than 70 were distributed in the range of 0 to 0 5 mm the size distributions of the discharged particles and the original sludge particles exhibited a remarkable overlap therefore the dls can be rationally broken into the initial particle size range by the shear action of the swirling flow field to disperse the particles to the maximum extent this effect is beneficial for the csrd performance the cyclone crushing essentially occurs in the residence time of 0 5 s as the residence time increased the proportion of the particles smaller than 0 1 mm increased more but this change was insignificant it is worth mentioning that the main process which occurred in 0 5 s was the sludge crushing such a small period was not sufficient at all for moisture removal of most particles because they did not have a chance to fully achieve high speed self rotation this finding is also consistent with the results given in section 3 3 that the drying efficiency was significantly enhanced when the residence time was extended from 5 to 10 s a comparison between the plotted results in fig 7a and 7b indicates that the proportion of the discharged particles in the range of 0 0 5 mm was slightly greater in the case of 30 kg h feeding rate indicating that a lower feeding rate can achieve a better crushing effect additionally a comparison between the graphs of fig 7a and 7c reveals that the crushing effect is more obvious for the higher temperatures of the carrier gas the actual state of the original sludge and the dried discharge is shown in fig 7d additionally the moisture content of the dls discharge residence time 5 s were measured within the range of each sieved particle size fig 8 as a general rule the smaller the size of the discharged particles the lower the remaining moisture content when the feeding rate increases the remaining moisture content curve gradually increases and tends to equilibrium for the particles in the same size range fig 8a by growing the carrier gas temperature the remaining moisture content of the discharge within the same particle size range gradually lessened and the discrepancy in the remaining moisture contents of different particle size ranges became more obvious fig 8b as the carrier gas temperature increased from 60 c to 90 c the discrepancy between the remaining moisture content of particles 0 1 mm and those 2 mm grew from 12 30 to 22 the overall crushing effect of the udss was slightly worse than that of the dls fig s4 and the original sludge particle size is smaller which makes the drying effect worse text s6 pore size characteristics of the sludge particles before and after drying were analyzed by mercury intrusion and nitrogen adsorption methods the obtained results indicate that the average pore size pore volume and porosity of the dried sludge particles decreased noticeably table s2 and fig s5 this issue is attributed to the fact that the cyclone crushing process destroyed the interstitial pores between the particles and broke the aggregation state of the sludge particles the specific micromorphology of sludge particles was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem the original sludge particles demonstrated apparent relatively large interstitial pores while the dried sludge tended to be non aggregated independent particle units fig s6 the detailed microscopic pore structure analysis of sludge particles is provided in some detail in text s7 3 6 the 50 t d csrd process for the udss in enlarged industrial applications based on many pilot experiments in the early stage we cooperated with shanghai ceo environmental protection technology co ltd to propose a 50 t d enlarged industrial application program using csrd for the udss fig 9 the energy consumption of the system mainly includes power electricity and the heater s energy consumption the heat source of the gas heater is designed to use steam assuming the market unit price of electricity of 0 75 cny kw h and the market unit price of steam of 200 cny t the unit operating cost of the csrd process is calculated to be 91 25 cny t wet sludge if it is analyzed based on the amount of water removed the unit operation cost is calculated to be 159 69 cny t h2o in contrast the operation cost of the conventional ted technology in the market is approximately 320 cny t h2o therefore it is observed that csrd has great economic benefits the process introduction material and energy balance equipment list table s3 and running cost analysis table s4 of the scheme are presented specifically in text s8 4 conclusions in this study we developed a novel drying technology different from the conventional thermal evaporation drying based on the particle high speed self rotation in cyclone to achieve sludge drying with mainly non phase change at low carrier gas temperature and very short residence time primary conclusions include 1 the csrd efficiency increased significantly with increasing the carrier gas temperature decreasing the feeding rate and prolonging the residence time under the conditions of 90 c 30 kg h and 15 s the moisture content of the dls decreased from 53 to 6 85 and that of the udss decreased from 67 to 18 92 their drying efficiencies in order reached 93 48 and 88 51 respectively 2 the csrd process had a strong crushing effect on the sludge and the percentage of sludge particles with particle size less than 0 5 mm after drying was about 70 the higher the crushing strength the better the corresponding drying effect the particle size pore volume and average pore size of the original dls were significantly larger than those of udss while the porosity of both was close and all these parameters were significantly decreased after drying 3 the csrd can break the removal sequence from the free water to bound water in the conventional ted process of sludge and the drying rate of the former was more than 158 times that of the latter through calculation the proportions of dls and udss moisture non phase change removal during the csrd process touched 68 94 and 63 39 respectively the csrd also had lower operating cost than the conventional ted showing obvious technical advantages this study provides a new technology and idea for sludge drying with high efficiency and low energy consumption which can break the inherent thinking that sludge drying must rely on heating to make water evaporate fill the research gap of water non phase change separation in the field of drying and can provide guidance for the practical application of sludge csrd technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
