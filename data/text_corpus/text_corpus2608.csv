13040,industrial and developmental activities have raised heavy metal loads in wastewater and their inappropriate treatment before disposal causes grave dilemma to the environment chromium cr cadmium cd and lead pb are highly toxic heavy metals and extensively used hence excessively generated with disposing effluent from the industries like paint battery electroplating tannery paper and pulp textile smelting and mining has raised the public attention owing to health concerns microbial remediation processes are considered as environmentally benign options and their integration with existing treatment techniques can construct advanced types of systems in terms of their cost and efficiency due to their synergistic action these microbial integrated techniques are gaining popularity these days there are varieties of microbial integrated strategy which has been investigated carefully for efficient removal of cr cd and pb and has been published in leading journals in this review we have critically discussed the microbial integrated strategies and recent advances in microbial integrated techniques for proficient removal of cr pb and cd from industrial wastewater in a cheaper and cleaner way in addition the advantages and disadvantages of the integrated system also have been discussed in this review the microbial integrated systems such as bioelectrochemical photo bioelectrochemical nano microbial and constructed wetland showed excellent performance and have tremendous potential for large scale exploitation to conclude microbial integrated techniques proved as excellent remedial options for cr pb and cd contaminated wastewater that has been discussed well in this review these integrated processes may be cost effective viable more efficient and less time taking than the existing techniques and have intense opportunity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bioelectrochemical photobiochemical heavy metal bioelectro remediation cleaner technology phytobial remediation 1 introduction excessive use of heavy metals for various objectives causes heavy metal contamination to the environment these metals include but are not limited to cd cadmium cu copper cr chromium ni nickel pb lead mn manganese and hg mercury which are highly carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic causes multiple types of alteration in plants animals and human beings and become serious threats to the present era 1 4 ni pb cr cu hg and cd are placed on the top of the substance priority list spl of agency toxic substances and disease registry atsdr out of these metals cr pb and cd are highly toxic metals that are generated from the diverse types of industrial processes in massive quantity and disposed of into the water canals and tributaries of the river devoid of proper treatment 5 6 such types of activities led scantily damaged the whole ecosystem metal contamination sources include metal mining smelting plating and finishing workshops in addition to natural sources which include weathering of metal containing rocks and volcanoes 7 15 these cr cd and pb have prominent toxicity on the plant animals as well as on human beings and hexavalent cr cr vi and cd have been categorized as group 1 carcinogenic to humans while pb compounds are grouped as probably carcinogen to humans group 2a by the international agency for research on cancer https www iarc who int they have a wider impact on humans and can cause kidney damage bronchitis gastrointestinal disorder bone marrow problems liver damage mental retardation in children persisting diarrhea skin ulceration chrome holes and cancer 3 6 16 18 in plants they cause multiple disorders for instance chlorosis delayed senescence wilting biochemical lesions reduced biosynthesis stunted growth oxidative stress decrease in plant nutrient content growth inhibition and reduced seed germination 2 13 19 21 they are redox active metal and after uptake inside the cell induces the reactive oxygen species ros nascent oxygen o superoxide anion o2 hydroxide ion oh peroxoions ho2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh production that results into oxidative stress which depends on their concentration produced ros can cause unrepairable oxidative damages to cellular micro and macro molecules like membrane lipid protein and dna 11 12 21 24 they are also known to cause non oxidative damage of dna and a probable unambiguous type of damage is the binding of dna which causes metal induced mutation and chromosomal break metal metabolism can react to protein and dna and causes different types of damage inside the cell and can alter whole cell functioning 25 27 there are varieties of physicochemical technologies to treat metal containing industrial wastewater however their initial implementation cost and associated other drawbacks such as producing a huge amount of toxic sludge required high quantity of chemicals insufficient treatment efficiency and generation of toxic waste that have environmental concerns in addition they require high energy and skilled manpower input which limits their use 13 28 29 this arise a quick demand for cleaner strategies that have lessened impact on the environment in addition to economic feasibility bioremediation strategy minimizes these problems associated with physicochemical techniques and is also cheaper than other known techniques while requiring more time than physicochemical system 2 13 30 32 both of these either physicochemical or biological have their own challenges although their integration can give a newly generated system in recent days microbial integrated systems have taken immediate consideration of the researchers and are expected to be more adaptable and potential due to their hybrid characteristic and they can reduce the environmental consequences of physicochemical techniques while time requisite issue of bioremediation microbes bacteria fungi and algae perform several processes such as precipitation accumulation surface sorption reduction etc under aerobic as well as the anaerobic environment depends on microbes in the removal of cr cd pb and other heavy metals thus depending on the need of the system microbes can be integrated with existing physicochemical techniques in aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions for instance exoelectrogenic bacteria have excellent electron production performance via oxidizing organic substances that have been integrated into bioelectrochemical systems for electricity production and wastewater treatment 33 35 the microbial processes have a high opportunity for their integration with other treatment techniques that may offer outstanding results on the removal of cr pb and cd from industrial wastewater a few years back it was assumed that microbial integration with physicochemical techniques may enhance the treatment performance of the system and will construct novel types of systems at present integrated systems such as microbial fuel cell mfc and mfc constructed wetland have set an example of microbial integrated system and become an advanced type of system for multipurpose use and also have high removal performance for heavy metals like cr vi 33 40 there are several types of microbial integrated strategies such as bio chemical bio electro techniques bioelectrochemical microbial flocculation constructed wetland photobiochemical photo bioelectrochemical and other biointegrated techniques which have been categorized based on their microbial integration with physical or chemical techniques these strategies have been followed and investigated in various studies in the recent past and shown commendable outcomes that have potential demand in near future to the best of our knowledge this is the first review article that specially focused on microbial integrated techniques for the treatment of highly toxic cr cd and pb polluted industrial wastewater in this review we have considered all these microbial integrated techniques categorized them and discussed well in addition their possibilities advancement shortcomings and future perspective have also been discussed in detail in this paper 2 bioremediation industrial wastewater contains different types of pollutants together with organic and inorganic pollutants in the bioremediation process microbes and plants are used for the removal of these pollutants from wastewater they remove pollutants either via degradation or via the accumulation and adsorption process with the degradation process organic pollutants are mineralized into simpler molecules like carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide hydrochloric acid methane carbon monoxide through a chain of metabolic reaction processes by microbes the metals are non biodegradable so they accumulated inside the cell or adhere to their surface through physicochemical forces 2 1 microbial remediation microbes are used for the removal and degradation of a variety of pollutants including cr cd and pb from wastewater and soil table 1 the microbial cell is made up of carbohydrates protein and lipid and possesses several functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl phosphate amino etc these functional groups have a high affinity towards cr pb cd and others metals pollutants interaction with microbial cells cause adherence of pollutants on their cell surface through these surface functional groups which is called as surface adsorption process surface sorption is the result of different types of adsorption mechanisms which include chelation electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding diffusion complexation coordination and co precipitation and are driven by the present functional group on the surface of the microbes fig 1 2 14 203 it can vary with the types of pollutants and cell membrane composition of the microbes since cr pb and cd are non biodegradable so their removal does not only occur due to biosorption and another process is also involved in this process that called accumulation 204 the accumulation process is completed in three steps biosorption is also actually served as the first step of the accumulation process when interaction happens between cr cd pb with microbial surface the metal get adsorbed on microbial surface in the second step cr cd and pb are transported inside the cell via the active through transporter and passive such as direct diffusion mechanisms of the cell the sulfate transporter can transport the cr vi inside the cell due to its chromate structural similarity with sulfate ion as similar to the plant transporter some other specific heavy metal transporter has been reported that actively participate in the transportation of cr cd and pb inside the cell while active transportation mechanism always functionalized by a set of genes called as functional gene group such as gintabc1 protein belong sub group of abc transporter involved in cd transportation and encoded by gintabc1 gene in glomus intraradices 67 several proteins are also localized to the cell membrane that may responsible for the transportation of metal for instance gfp pcaa fusion protein that is encoded by pcaa gene and associated with cd transportation in aspergillus fumigatus 68 in the last third step cr cd and pb either get chelated bind with protein metallothionein amino acid glutathione and thiolic compound and reduced or participate in metabolism and cause oxidative stress via producing ros species chelated or bound metal translocated to vacuoles vesicle of the microbial cell as residued excretory by product a final deposition process of accumulation and sometime efflux outside the cell through efflux pump mechanism fig 1 however cr is generally found in hexavalent form so its reduction in its trivalent form due to its less toxicity as compared to cr vi is another approach being implemented these days in its reduction process different types of enzymatic and non enzymatic mechanisms are involved a well known example of an enzyme is chromate reductase chr which has been widely reported in bacteria and fungi 11 23 69 this enzymatic reaction involves nadph or nadh as an electron reservoir to be completed as eq 1 some time cr vi reduction process also occur without the presence of enzymes under specific or acidic condition in this process cr vi reduction happens through one electron transfer reaction mechanism and electrons are provided by the substrate of the medium are cell surface of the microbes see eqs 2 4 1 cr vi nadph chr cr iii nadp chr 2 cr vi e substrate cr v less stable intermediate pentavalent cr 3 cr v e substrate cr vi less stable intermediate tetravalent cr 4 cr vi e substrate cr iii highly stable trivalent cr the microbial remediation process is one of the cheapest ecofriendly techniques that have potential in remediation polluted sites microbes can be utilized to degrade or remove the pollutant from wastewater in a greener cleaner and more sustainable way their use in the remediation process is quite less easy than phytobial and phytoremediation while taking a reduced amount of time and more efficient than these processes and also more opportunistic than other known techniques in terms of cost and environmentally friendliness despite their advantages microbial remediation processes have some drawbacks when microbes are applied for metal removal in an open system it requires nutrient availability in the system proper monitoring affected by changes in the atmosphere temperature presence of co occurring contaminant and high concentration of pollutants no proper management of generated sludge and may require optimized condition for proper functioning to reduce such shortcomings various types of engineered systems bioreactors have been developed that provide an optimized condition for the proper functioning of the systems in the treatment process microbes can be utilized independently or simultaneously with other microbes their combination can be from the same group such as one bacterium with another bacterium or one fungus with another fungus or can be from the different groups such as the combination of bacteria fungi and algae 2 while using a single microbe in the treatment system the whole remediation process is led by one single microorganism there are huge numbers of bacteria fungi and algae that have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb either from single or multiple pollutants contaminated medium such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb can remove cd and pb by 94 8 and 94 4 via precipitation mechanism 70 cd and pb are also significantly removed by stenotrophomonas rhizophila variovorax boronicumulans and sporosarcina pasteurii via precipitation mechanism 71 aspergillus flavus and trichoderma lixii achieved up to 99 reduction of cr vi via enzyme mediated reduction process as shown in reaction 1 11 23 and nostoc muscorum and anabaena variabilis can remove pb significantly from the wastewater 62 the most basic problem that arises with the use of the single microbe is that the minor change in the optimized condition can affect the remediation efficiency of the system and microbes are not immune to all toxic pollutants so due to toxicity the presence of pollutants other than targeted pollutants can also affect the remediation process which is a very common phenomenon in large scale wastewater treatment systems this problem arise the need for the investigation of more than one microbe for the removal of such pollutant or pollutants that present concurrently in the same wastewater since one microbe is unable to tolerate other non targeted pollutants however the simultaneously applied microbes may do that another multi pollutant tolerant idea also has been added in this sequence where individual microbes can tolerate more than one metal pollutant and can be utilized for the treatment of multi metal contaminated water aspergillus flavus cr500 and aspergillus lentulus have shown multiple tolerant abilities and can remove multiple metals including cr cd and pb concomitantly 12 72 in the case of microbial consortium the microbial compatibility with each other is one of the necessary aspects that must exist between the microbes because a microbe may show antagonistic activity towards other microbes and can inhibit the growth of other concurrently applied microbes if one of them is an antagonist to other various researchers have worked on mixed microbial application or the development of microbial consortiums for the removal of one or more than one pollutant from industrial wastewater for example microalgae chlorella vulgaris can remove 58 58 and 61 of cr cd and pb respectively from textile wastewater when applied singly while enterobacter sp mn17 assisted chlorella vulgaris achieved 79 93 and 79 removal of cr cd and pb respectively 73 in the consortium form one microbe may be dominated and played a lead role although its survival and existence under in situ or open environmental conditions depend on their community and in absence of the community its treatment performance is also reduced significantly sometime similar microbe singly may achieve high removal efficiency under optimized or controlled conditions not in open conditions while treating wastewater contaminated with various pollutants including cr pb and cd an engineered system can be more efficient to remove such type of complexity from the microbial treatment systems researchers have developed various type arrangements in the form of several types of techniques by integrating microorganisms with available treatment techniques where microbes were utilized either individually or binary or as a consortium or as whole community which is discussed later however for the better understanding all the microbial integrated strategies have been classified based on the microbial integration with physical or chemical treatment techniques in this review 2 2 phyto and phytobial technique plants use sunlight for the photosynthesis process to synthesize glucose for their growth and development plants have high applicability in wastewater treatment aquatic plants species mainly have been investigated for the treatment of different types of industrial wastewater cr cd and pb are the metal so with first interaction they adhere to the surface of roots due to its cell wall composition which is made up of cellulose starch pectin and retains some surface functional groups like hydroxyl amine and carbonyl and participate in metal adsorption adhered metal pollutants get transported inside the cell either via active transportation or passive transportation mechanism cr vi species structure resembles sulfate ion transported inside the cell via sulfate transporter 74 some specific metal transporters are also involved in the transportation process such abc atp binding cassette transporter abcg36 is required for cd transportation in rice 75 and osnramp1 transporter associated with cd uptake in rice and abscisic acid mediated pb uptake is reported in populus canescens several genes are associated with the uptake and transportation process such as nramp1 4 abcg40 frd3 1 pcs1 1 and abcc1 1 are involved in the uptake and transportation of pb 44 oslct1 osccx2 oshma2 and ospcr1 are associated with cd uptake 76 transported metal inside the root cell is either translocated to different cell organelles or aerial part of the plant which is the last location of cr cd and pb in plants while in the case of volatilizing metal loid such as hg and as volatilized into the atmosphere through the volatilization process phytobial remediation is the process when microbes are used to associate the phytoremediation process and increase the efficiency of the system thus called phytobial phytobial remediation process is considered as one of the ecofriendly and sustainable strategies in the removal and degradation of pollutants various types of fungi bacteria and algae showed mutual relation with plants they accomplish with different types of mechanisms to assist plants and increase the remediation efficiency such as plant hormone production to improve plant growth their antagonistic activity towards pathogenic microbes they release soil phosphate which is used by plants as nutrient immobilize metal and reduces the toxicity of metal to plant increase the uptake and transportation of metal fig 2 in the case of organic pollutants microbes play a crucial role in pollutant degradation mineralization and assimilation process with plants metallic pollutants are non biodegradable so microbes involve through various processes in remediation together with solubilization of metals biosorption of metals metal reduction bioprecipitation of metals siderophores secretion bioaccumulation of metal by metal binding proteins binding of metals on the cell surface biotransformation of metals methylation of metals dna mediated interface towards heavy metal removal 2 77 79 a suitable microbe such as phosphate solubilizing bacteria or plant growth promoting bacteria can go through these mechanisms via producing plant growth promoting substances such as biosurfactant acc deaminase siderophore and organic acids and accelerate the remediation process 78 81 phytobial remediation is one of the cheapest and cleanest techniques unlike other all encompassing approaches it can be applied in a vast variety of contaminated sites for their remediation either under in situ or ex situ including contaminated wastewater ground water soil and sediment in spite of their advantages there are some shortcomings that limit the use of higher plants in phytobial process such as it restricting in shallow aquifer and soil due to restriction of root length may cause biomagnification of heavy metal in the food chain take a huge amount of acclimatization time need proper monitoring lack of safe disposal of obtained biomass and tough recycling or recovery process of metal 77 hao et al 82 successfully conducted cd phytoextraction experiment using spinach plant and reported that microbes belong to the genera alicyclobacillus clostridium sensu stricto and streptacidiphilus colonized with spinach and assisted the cd phytoextraction process in another investigation liang et al 83 utilized few chelators oxalic acid ethylenediamine disuccinic acid and citric acid with pteris vittata l for the phytoextraction and management of cd and pb contaminated site they also found increased microbial community abundance in the system that might be associated with increased cd and pb accumulation in plants brassica juncea and aspergillus sydowii contemporaneous use can also achieve more removal and degradation of heavy metal and organic pollutant co contaminated sites than a single one as best conjugate 84 3 microbial composite techniques material supported microorganisms are utilized in industrial sectors such as the fermentation process and this technique is often called as microbial composite technique 85 these days it is being investigated by the researcher for remediation of water and soil for different types of pollutants along with cr cd and pb in the case of organic pollutants live microbes a have very important role in the degradation of pollutant while metal get accumulated inside their cells the used support material and microbial cell surface also play a superficial role in pollutants adsorption the materials such as sodium alginate wheat straw fe sludge biochar alunite carbon fiber and biochar have been reported to show high applicability in the removal of cr pb cd in combination with applied microbes 86 90 among them materials like corn stalk biochar can increase the bacterial bacillus subtilis growth in the combined system and provide excellent removal performance for metal like pb 88 various types of microorganisms bacteria and fungi such as bacillus subtilis bacillus sp mucor plumbeus plesiomonas shigelloides h5 have been utilized in the development of microbial composite and successfully demonstrated for the removal of cr pb cd and other pollutants 86 88 90 91 biological activated carbon is another type of microbial composite that has been investigated and showed high proficiency in removing such pollutants from wastewater 92 93 the membrane bioreactor has also been investigated for the removal of several metallic pollutants including cr pb and cd from water and wastewater and gives excellent results in the removal of these metallic contaminants 94 96 4 microbial flocculation the flocculation process is mediated by floc formation by using some stimulant and occurred through the aggregation of collide and suspended particles several inorganic and organic chemicals are used as a stimulant in the chemical flocculation process and are known as chemical flocculants bioflocculants are different from the chemical flocculants are natural and biodegradable polymer extracellularly produced by microorganisms under stressed environments due to their defense mechanism and are generally known as microbial metabolites bioflocculants generally composed of glycolipids exopolysaccharides lipids glycoproteins and proteins used for different purposes and these days have been investigated in remediation of heavy metal contaminated water 97 98 they are recognized as a potential alternative of the chemical flocculant due to being environmentally benign harmless highly biodegradable do not generate noxious secondary pollution high suitability in removal of suspended pollutants like heavy metals due to possessing such excellent properties it is receiving the attention of researchers several microbes have been investigated for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater through bioflocculation mechanism ayangbenro et al 97 investigated the bioflocculant production efficiency of pseudomonas koreensis and pantoea sp which carry cd cr and pb resistant gene cada czcd and chra pantoea sp and p koreensis showed 71 3 and 51 7 flocculation activity with a yield of 2 98 g l and 3 26 g l which contain hydroxyl amino and carboxylic functional groups both of the isolate s bioflocculants showed a significant amount of removal for cd cr and pb in another study bacillus sp showed 97 flocculation efficiency and produced flocculant exhibited high removal efficiency for cd and cr 99 and flocculant composed of polysaccharide and protein produced from actinomycete nocardiopsis sp grg 3 exhibited 55 9 85 9 74 7 removal cd cr and pb respectively 100 5 bio chemical techniques simultaneous utilization of bioagents and chemicals in the pollutants removal process and wastewater remediation can give potential results bio agents may be plants or microbes and their good combination have high applicability in the removal of cd cr and pb in this type of system chemicals are utilized by microbes as sources of energy nutrients and electron source to reduce the pollutant concentration in the systems in a study acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans used for cr vi reduction and precipitation with pyrite a ferrooxidans participated in breaking of fs bond reducing the cr vi to cr iii and cr iii precipitation 101 using thiobacillus with zero valent s 0 and fe 0 can enhance the reduction and removal of cr vi 102 simultaneous microbes and chemicals with plants also enhanced the accumulation of metal in plants for instance vermicompost elemental sulfur inoculum of t thiooxidans and p putida increase the accumulation percentage of pb and cd in gladiolus grandiflorus l 103 recently zhao et al 104 applied nano zero valent iron nzvi in a system contaminated with cd which dominated with sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfobulbaceae desulfobacteraceae syntrophobacteraceae desulfovibrionaceae and desulfomicrobiaceae with the combined action of srbs and nzvi cd transformed into cd s fe like compounds they can be affected by the presence of other pollutants like heavy metals that have the potential to inhibit their growth or any of their metabolic process this type of treatment system can be utilized for the treatment of wastewater and they required additional supplement sources as utilized chemical and less hazards than chemical treatment systems and also require less time and are highly efficient than bioremediation 6 photo bio technique plants algae and cyanobacteria use light to produce energy for their growth and development a very sustainable approach for nutrient and metal removal recovery from wastewater for the treatment of wastewater researchers have developed different types of photo bioreactor to utilize algae for the removal and recovery of nutrient and metallic pollutants 105 106 on one hand obtained algal mass also has potential application for biofuel production the aspect that is also being covered in the photo bioreactor system in the system algae use the sun light and atmospheric carbon dioxide for the photosynthesis process and use nutrients such as nitrate phosphate and micronutrient for their growth and development metal pollutants get accumulated by these algae either as a real nutrient or as a pseudo nutrient when pollutant mimic as nutrient like chromate transported inside the cell via sulfate transporter due to similar structure as sulfate or due to smaller size pollutant gets diffused directly into the cell and removed from the system 107 110 since algal cells are composed of carbohydrates and lipids which carry various types of functional groups on their surface that play a crucial role in the bioadsorption of pollutants like cr cd and pb several algal species for example chlamydomonas reinhardtii and acid tolerant chlamydomonas cpcc 121 chlorella sorokiniana pseudopediastrum boryanum var longicorne raphidocelis subcapitata and chlorella vulgaris have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from water and wastewater and shows outstanding removal performance for these pollutants 107 109 112 these algal species have very high potential in their utilization in photo bioreactor for industrial wastewater clean up contaminated with cr cd and pb photo irradiation ph reactor configuration nutrient availability are some of the functional parameters that can highly influence the photo bioreactor performance some of the studies have also used algae as a coating to develop the hybrid system with other photoactive material like tio2 for efficient reduction of cr vi to cr iii and reported greater reduction efficiency than a single system 113 combining the photo bio process with mfc has a greater opportunity for pollutant removal like heavy metal for instance zhang et al 114 introduced chlorella sp qb 102 into the mfc as an algal cathode and utilized for the removal of cd they achieved a maximum of 95 cd removal via adsorption and precipitation as hydroxide besides this studies have upgraded the mdc using algae as photosynthetic mdc and investigated for chemical oxygen demand cod and total dissolved solids tds removal photosynthetic mdc has a high proficiency in the cod and tds removal and needs more exploration for its applicability in removal of cr pb cd and such other pollutants this system can reach high power density and high algal biomass production rates 115 7 bio electro technique it is a combined process of microbes and electro driven process that can reduce the energy input of the electro driven process and time requirement of bioremediation this process can be implemented separately in two different chambers as well as in single chamber systems it has been widely investigated for removal and degradation of dye pesticide other organo pollutant heavy metal and nutrients removal from water and wastewater it requires electricity input to happen the process for pollutant removal and degradation it can be applied in different ways some authors have implemented first the microbial processes as pretreatment process where all the biodegradable pollutants chemical oxygen demand cod are removed by microbes and some of them also accumulated inside the cell of the microbes generally this arrangement necessitates a long acclimatization period subsequent to the pretreatment process electro process is used to remove the remaining pollutants 116 117 conversely several researchers first applied electro process as a pretreatment which removes all the charged pollutants and many of the biodegradable pollutants and then microbial process are employed for the remaining pollutants removal in the latter configuration the acclimatization period is reduced and more pollutants are oxidized yet require high input of energy 50 from the cost perspective the first configuration is considered as more economical than latter one 117 118 on other hand this technique has also been well demonstrated for removal of heavy metals from contaminated soil in addition to wastewater and proven as a potential strategy for effective and ecofriendly management of heavy metal polluted soil 77 the authors have demonstrated lysinibacillus fusiformis pseudomonas putida shewanella putrefaciens in the removal of several heavy metals from soil 119 121 the results were positive towards their applicability in the management of such contaminated soil via microbial electrokinetic process however this process is more effective when metals are present in their soluble form in the soil 8 bio electro chemical technique similar to the bio electro process bio electro chemical bec system is the assemblage of microbes chemicals and electro processes under a unified system and broadly investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater treatment this process can be utilized for different types of pollutant removal including cr cd and pb table 2 the best example of bec is the microbial fuel cell mfc where microbes or enzymes are utilized at least one reaction either oxidation or reduction reaction in the mfc the utilized power was generated by the degradation of organic compounds on the bioanode by exoelectrogenic microorganisms fig 3 in the bec system electroactive microbes are used in electrolytic cell and work as a catalyst on one or both electrodes and they catalyze the reaction taking place on the electrode electron moved from the oxidized component to cathode for the reduction reaction or to the cathode for the oxidation reaction take place 131 tao et al 132 developed a hybrid type of bes and electrolysis reactors for recovering pb cu and zn and successfully demonstrated and illustrated reaction mechanism was as shown in eqs 5 7 a simultaneous cr vi reduction and nitrate removal experiment was conducted using bec system by wang et al 39 the system was dominated by pseudomonas halomonas and thauera and facilitated the autohydrogenotrophic denitrification and cr vi reduction process occurred as eqs 8 9 5 pb 2 2e pb e 0 0 130 v 6 cu 2 2e cu e0 0 337 v 7 zn 2 2e zn e0 0 762 v 8 1 06 no 3 0 3 co 2 3 34 h 2 1 06 h 0 06 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 5 n 2 3 66 h 2 o 9 cr 2 o 7 2 3 h 2 2h 2 cr oh 3 h 2 o in recent days different types of configuration in the bec system have been developed for efficient removal of cr cd and pb for mfc two types of configuration are popularly known single chamber mfc and dual chamber mfc 35 39 133 both of these have been widely investigated in the removal of a range of pollutants together with cr cd and pb the mfc configuration is one of its most basic requirements that can influence the whole system efficiency applicability and adaptability for its large scale application both of the mfcs were found to be efficient and can remove the pollutant effectively from the wastewater 35 39 these days some new mfc configurations were proposed and successfully demonstrated for cr cd or pb removal recently cao et al 33 proposed a novel osmotic mfc osmfc and successfully demonstrated for simultaneously cr vi removal organic pollutant removal energy production and water reclamation in another investigation fixed bed bec reactor was developed and 100 removal rate for cd was reported 134 photo mfc is another advanced form of mfc being investigated by the researcher using photocatalyst modified electrode in glass chamber under the presence of electromagnetic radiation and found to be efficient in electricity production and pollutant removal than common mfc photo mfc has been discussed well in section 9 129 135 some other important parameters such as utilized organic sources presence of nutrients electrode material acclimatized microbial community or type of microbe salts bridge and its concentration ph of electrolyte and applied supplements in addition to system configuration can affect the pollutant removal and electricity production efficiency of the system which is one another aspect being demonstrated concurrently to achieve more benefit from the single system 33 35 39 133 136 to upgrade the mfc researchers have applied various types of advanced material originated electrode that enhance the mfc performance on both respect either pollutant removal efficiency or electricity production such as application of graphite felt modified with iron sulfide wrapped with reduced graphene oxide fes rgo nanocomposite can reduce cr vi 4 6 time higher and produces 328 higher electricity than the blank mfc 137 biogenic palladium nanoparticles bio pdnps modified activated carbon electrode achieved a complete reduction of cr vi 138 oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes modified graphite felt electrode attain two times more reduction efficiency of cr vi than unmodified system 139 140 mfc systems have also been investigated in the sensing and detection cr vi in different types of wastewater and soil samples using various types of advanced material originated electrodes they are being investigated as biosensor systems and can detect the cr vi qualitatively and quantitatively its sensing ability can vary with used bacterial species electrode material system configuration etc 139 143 the microbial desalination cell mdc is also an advanced or extended type of bec system used for the desalination of water it can be operated in an auto powered mode no need for an extra power supply is needed and has been extensively investigated mdc produces electrical energy from the oxidation of organic substrate connected to extracellular electron transfer by respiring bacteria on the anode fig 4 144 145 ion exchange membrane iem that is cation exchange membrane cem and anion exchange membrane aem are arranged in a manner in the mdc system that permits the salts to be removed from saline water to uphold the charge neutrality in the system mdc has been investigated for the removal of cr pb cd and several other heavy metal pollutants in addition to salts for example in mdc mirzaienia et al 145 reported 69 5 removal for cd gholizadeh et al 34 achieved 91 8 and 98 4 removal rate for cr and pb to upgrade the mdc and improve its desalination efficiency researchers have developed the mdc in a range of configurations for laboratory scale investigation and successfully attain their objective which includes electrolyte recirculation biocathode capacitive osmotic photosynthetic stacked bipolar membrane resin packed ion exchange and upflow configurations which were reviewed previously 144 in a recent study mdc coupled with microbial electrolytic cell mec was examined for pb removal and reported removal efficiency of up to 90 146 microbial electrolysis cell mec is also comprised of bec technique and widely investigated for removal recovery of resources and treatment of wastewater it has been also investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from wastewater and successfully demonstrated on removing such pollutants several attempts have been made by the researcher to upgrade the mec system few of the workers have integrated the microbial membrane film with mec to achieve maximum wastewater treatment efficiency using mec 147 mec integrated mfc has also attracted the researcher and is being investigated for the treatment and remediation of wastewater and production of the various products including methane hydrogen acetate and hydrocarbon from wastewater 148 149 this type of integration can be investigated and utilized for removal and reduction of heavy metal from wastewater can give triumphant results in the removal of heavy metal pollutants some of the studies have investigated the cr pb and cd reduction and removal using mec mfc and excellent results are observed in these experiments 150 151 for instance li et al 151 coupled the mec with cr vi reducing mfc as a self driven system mfc was used as a bioelectricity source and at mec using different electrodes pb ii reduction to pb 0 was experimented and significant results for reduction of pb ii was observed cr vi reduction happened in the mfc as reaction 27 and pb ii reduction has occurred on mec as shown below 10 ch 3 coo 4 h 2 o 2 hco 3 9h 8e 11 pb 2 2e pb 9 photo bioelectrochemical photo bioelectrochemical p bec technique is the advanced version of an electrobiochemical system lased with light and photocatalyst that enhanced the efficiency of the system mfcs have been well studied by upgrading with photo catalytic process 152 to upgrade the system different types of photoactive materials semiconductor and photocatalyst are being investigated on the absorption of visible radiation by photocatalyst electron e of valance band vb excited to conduction band cb and generate hole h on vb the generated h and e initiate the oxidation reduction reaction and are completed through the following reaction to form reactive oxygen species that participate in organic pollutant degradation

through various mechanisms this principle is being integrated with the bioelectrochemical system as p bec system and investigated for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with different types of organic pollutants like dye pesticide pharmaceuticals and antibiotics and reported as very efficient for the treatment of wastewater 152 153 in the case of metal they are not degradable so it is less studied for metal removal while cr is highly toxic in its hexavalent form and it is also found in trivalent stage a stable form that very less toxic than its hexavalent form so its reduction into trivalent form was investigated in many studies in the cr vi reduction experiment several materials such as polyaniline nanofiber pani cds quantum dots qds and pd decorated p type silicon nanowire pd

constructed wetland cw is the integrated system of microbe plants and potential adsorbing substrate widely practiced in the treatment of industrial municipal and mining wastewater and considered as an efficient and sustainable technology fig 5 cws have high potential in removing pesticide dye pharmaceutical nitrate phosphate sulfate and heavy metals including cr cd and pb simultaneously as well as single pollutant contaminated medium 157 160 the removal of these pollutants happens via degradation adsorption accumulation precipitation complexation diffusion process which is either performed by microbes or plants or substrate used for the bedding microbial processes mainly associated with degradation and accumulation of pollutants sometimes also involve in precipitation of metallic pollutants as metal hydroxide phosphate sulfate while plants can accumulate adsorb and volatilize the pollutant various types of substrates like soil sand river sand gravel pebbles biochar pyrite activated carbon bazlsc and cockle shell etc have been investigated in cw in the removal of pollutants and they can absorb the pollutant on their surface and accumulate them in substrate system 36 40 158 160 161 other than plants microbes and substrate cw efficiency can be affected by its configuration flow rate hydraulic retention time and pollutant concentration even electroactive material can enhance cr vi reduction by 42 9 as compared to traditional gravel based cw 162 these days horizontal flow cw surface and subsurface flow vertical flow up flow hybrid cw and aerated cw have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from contaminated wastewater and achieved proficient removal capability 163 several investigated plants in cw that showed efficient removal efficiency are j effuses t orientalis s validus iris sibirica cyperus alternifolius coix lacryma jobi l eichhornia crassipes typha angustifolia l canna indica l and hydrocotyle umbellata l 158 161 164 contrary cr cd and pb containing wastewater can affect the enzymatic activity and rhizospheric microbial community of plants in cw when the cws are not used to such metal contaminated wastewater treatment or cw are not designated to treat such metal containing wastewater and can influence the efficiency of cw 40 165 to advance the cw system for removal of cr pb and cd various types of modifications have been made which include the application of advanced material as a substrate for bedding the addition of specific metal accumulating plants and microbes 157 these days cw integrated with microbial fuel cell cw mfc is being investigated at laboratory and pilot scale for its full application in wastewater treatment and concurrently electricity production this approach is trending and has attracted the research community cw and mfc are the structural and functional component of the cw mfc respectively cw is made up of plants gravels and a slowly developed microbial community as a film in the bottom of the cw at the bottom air diffusion is impaired and anoxic condition is generated while on the surface due to air diffusion and rhizospheric oxygen leakage aerobic environment prevail by adding the electrode cathode and anode in these anaerobic and aerobic zones cw is converted into cw mfc 166 this principle is well studied in the degradation and removal of various types of pollutants including cr pb and cd from wastewater change in bedding material types of electrodes spacing between the electrodes and hydraulic retention time can influence the electricity production as well treatment efficiency of cw mfc 36 38 40 in cw the removal of cd pb and cr occur through precipitation complexation adsorption biosorption accumulation etc while generated e from cw mfc also participate in cr vi reduction into its trivalent form and prevailing mechanism is illustrated in eq 27 several other integrated cw were investigated and reported as an efficient system for removal of cr and cd for example in two different experiments cw has been also integrated with biological pond plant pond for reduction of cd in irrigation water and significant reduction of cd was reported in irrigation water 167 168 zhang et al 169 developed a micro electric field constructed wetland and investigated for cd and other pollutant removal and reported successful removal cd from wastewater 11 nano microbial remediation nanomaterials synthesis and its application in the various fields are trending and widely studied materials whose size ranges between 1 and 100 nm are considered as nanomaterial which includes nanoparticles nanofibers nano sheets nanorods nanowires nanocomposites 2 3 13 14 170 nanomaterials are utilized in various ways in cleaning polluted environments such as nano catalyst nano photo catalyst nanoadsorbent in a range of technology nanomaterials carry high surface area prominent active sites high stability excellent reusability great electron conductivity admirable adsorption and catalytic activity that make them perfect in environmental remediation 171 although they have good environmental applicability and simultaneous application with plants and microbes in bioremediation systems can enhance the whole process efficiency of the integrated system and their concurrent process in pollutant removal and degradation can be called nano microbial remediation nanomaterial integrated system have been extensively studied in the management of polluted soil and water due to their catalytic and adsorption proficiency physicochemical fabrication of nanomaterials has some environmental concerns that reduce its environmental sustainability and ecofriendly concept that s why researchers moved to biological synthesis of nanomaterial using a range of microbes and plants microbial and plant cytoplasm hold a range of enzymes protein polyphenol and other highly bioactive compounds that act as reducing and capping agents in the synthesis of metallic nanomaterial 13 78 79 170 172 researchers have considered both the way as nanobioremediation either biosynthesized nanomaterial for environmental application or nanomaterial simultaneous utilization with microbes and plants in the environmental application 173 174 when microbially synthesized nanomaterials were used in the remediation process it adsorbed the cr pb cd through electrostatic attraction complexation coordination hydrogen bonding diffusion and ion exchange mechanism and stabilizes them into the system and block their movement 171 175 176 these mechanisms also play a crucial role when nanomaterial is applied simultaneously with microbes and occur concurrently on the surface of nanomaterial and microbes in removal of cr cd pb and other pollutants 177 179 in addition to adsorption on the surface of microbes cr cd and pb accumulation is also taking place inside the cell of microorganisms the combined action of microbes and nanomaterial may also lead the precipitation of cr cd pb as their oxide hydroxide sulfide phosphate under favorable environment as reported in several studies and ph of the medium work as most affecting factors for metal coprecipitation 179 180 cr vi species of cr can be reduced into its trivalent form while mitigating its toxicity by nanomaterial and microbes exclusively or concurrently 181 one electron transfer reaction takes place when nanomaterial involves in the reduction process and microbes can reduce cr vi either enzymatically or both processes where reductase enzymes such as chromate reductase enzyme are associated with reduction process 11 23 138 179 some of the nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticle can induce enzymatic activity and increase the hormonal secretion in plants and microbes that help in reducing pollution cd pb and other pollutants levels in systems 182 184 iron oxide nanoparticles have also been investigated in various studies in nanobioremediation cr cd and pb pollution in soil and water for example in a study iron biochar nano complex bc fe3o4 leersia hexandra and cr tolerant microbial consortium dominated with firmicutes and actinobacteria were used for managing cr vi pollution in the system microbial assisted the hyper accumulation of cr in the aerial part of the plant and bc fe3o4 reduces the bioavailability of cr vi via mechanism as shown in reaction eqs 32 36 179 several factors such as medium ph temperature metal concentration dose and properties of nanomaterial and microbe species can affect the effectiveness of the remediation practices while using nanomaterial and microbes concomitantly

also not immune to toxic pollutants and a rise in pollutant concentration can result in inhibition of microbial growth and activity this fear rise demand for newer strategies to deals with this problem and genetic engineering can be a viable approach to remove such drawbacks from the microbial and microbial integrated wastewater treatment system there are several reports are available which deals with the genetically modified microorganisms on removing heavy metal pollutants 185 189 basically the metal removal can happen through biosorption and bioaccumulation processes and both processes are different from each other in the biosorption process chemical moieties present on the matrix of biomass associate the removal of metal through chemical and physical bonding like chelation complexation electrostatic attraction and coprecipitation bioaccumulation involves interactive adsorption transportation and storage inside the cell thus researchers have made efforts on targeted sites that is to improve the biosorption process workers have applied physicochemical modification to improve the biosorption on the surface or made genetic changes that improve the metal binding protein and lipid on the microbial cell surface to achieve higher biosorption metal 190 191 for example a cr iii adsorption protein merp was displayed on the cell surface escherichia coli which facilitated the adsorption process 187 and zhou et al 189 expressed ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1 chrb in escherichia coli bl21 which enable them for excellent cr vi adsorption from wastewater bioaccumulation involves several types of metal transporter such as channels secondary carriers primary active transporters and abc transporter in transportation of metal from periplasm to cytoplasm all of these metal importers are usually made up of various types of proteins like channels are single component α helical proteins passive metal diffusion secondary carriers are single component protein and primary active transporters are the multicomponent protein complexes involve atp in metal transportation 192 researchers have improved these targeted paths through genetic engineering and utilized to facilitate the heavy metal including cr cd and pb uptake potential of microorganisms 185 186 188 193 197 imported metal inside the cell is stored in various locations via binding with metal chelating protein including metallothionein phytochelatin cystine glutathione non protein thiol content these metal chelating mediators regulated by different types of genes and enzymes may also involve in chelation release and translocation process in various investigations these proteins chelating agent encoding genes were expressed in a range of microorganisms to assist the accumulation process of cr cd pb and other heavy metals 197 206 208 these reports recorded an instant increase in the removal of heavy metal pollutants through accumulation process from wastewater enzyme dependent metal removal and reduction mechanism can also be enhanced through this tool chromate reductase encoding gene chrt from serratia sp s2 expression in chrt engineered strain enhanced the cr vi reduction than control 198 laboratory scale studies provide beginning results that display the fundamental molecular mechanisms and suggest that engineered microbial application for biosorption and bioaccumulation is more economical and ecofriendly than the known metal removal techniques the majority of conducted studies were batch studies where the flask shake method was applied by incubating synthetic microbes with heavy metals these miniatures are the first step to scaling up their application researchers have demonstrated the metal removal efficiency in pilot studies and reported exciting results two approaches batch experiment and continuous experiment are possible ways and being investigated some studies have investigated synthetic microbes to sense the metallic pollutant to develop a biosensor for their detection 199 their sensing ability varies with types of pollutant microbes and genetic changes despite being environmentally friendly economical efficient immune to higher metal concentration and immune to more than one pollutant engineered microbes also possesses some disadvantages such as they may be hazardous to the ecosystem may possess unknown changes their release in the ecosystem may cause severe impact on species community and whole ecosystem as invasive species they may produce toxic unknown metabolite with health risk 200 201 thus there disadvantages limit their large scale application and it may require proper guidelines and ethical approval to scale up in the treatment process 13 conclusion and future perspectives microbial remediation of heavy metal sounds good and opportunistic although the removal efficiency can be altered by various parameters that make it insufficient in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants microbial integrated strategies have significant advances than the existing techniques in removal of cr cd and pb and other heavy metals in this review all the strategies are categorized based on their nature like bio electro chemical and photo or integration of them for easier understanding and narrated well by congregating the information from the recently published research reports all the microbial integrated strategies have been found to be sound good and opportunistic in terms of environmental concern treatment efficiency and economical aspect than their non integrated configuration few of these have been investigated for multipurpose use like electrobiochemical and photo electrobiochemical use for the cr and pb as well as electricity and hydrogen production algal integrated system also provided high algal biomass for biofuel production in addition to efficient cr pb cd removal and electricity production the electro integrated and photo electro strategies can be advanced by using novel types of advanced material based electrodes and photocatalyst electrodes the novel excellent exoelectrogenic microbial species will always be useful when applied with suitable electrodes under optimum conditions this type of system can also be operated as an automated system without outsourcing energy input that needs more exploration and pilot scale study to investigate their cr cd and pb removal performance and efficiency for large scale application in industrial wastewater treatment by integrating cr cd and pb tolerant organisms microbes and plant and adsorptive material like biochar activated carbon and zeolite the efficiency of the constructed wetland cw can be improved while their configuration and operational parameter also play a lead role in removal of such toxic metals so their configuration is another point where a more experimental investigation is required to unlock their full potential for large scale exploitation in cr pb and cd removal from industrial wastewater as cr cd pb is highly toxic and microbes showed tolerance up to a certain concentration and increased metal form their tolerance limit can hamper the growth of microbes and at this point biotechnology is the most possible tool for the development of synthetic or engineered microbes they can replace the non synthetic microbes from integrated system and can become the most viable ones with an outstanding opportunity in cr pb cd contaminated industrial wastewater treatment however very few reports are available that deal with synthetic microbial integrated systems in removal of heavy metal pollutants and need more exploration for future possibilities credit authorship contribution statement vinay kumar conceptualization validation methodology formal analysis

13040,industrial and developmental activities have raised heavy metal loads in wastewater and their inappropriate treatment before disposal causes grave dilemma to the environment chromium cr cadmium cd and lead pb are highly toxic heavy metals and extensively used hence excessively generated with disposing effluent from the industries like paint battery electroplating tannery paper and pulp textile smelting and mining has raised the public attention owing to health concerns microbial remediation processes are considered as environmentally benign options and their integration with existing treatment techniques can construct advanced types of systems in terms of their cost and efficiency due to their synergistic action these microbial integrated techniques are gaining popularity these days there are varieties of microbial integrated strategy which has been investigated carefully for efficient removal of cr cd and pb and has been published in leading journals in this review we have critically discussed the microbial integrated strategies and recent advances in microbial integrated techniques for proficient removal of cr pb and cd from industrial wastewater in a cheaper and cleaner way in addition the advantages and disadvantages of the integrated system also have been discussed in this review the microbial integrated systems such as bioelectrochemical photo bioelectrochemical nano microbial and constructed wetland showed excellent performance and have tremendous potential for large scale exploitation to conclude microbial integrated techniques proved as excellent remedial options for cr pb and cd contaminated wastewater that has been discussed well in this review these integrated processes may be cost effective viable more efficient and less time taking than the existing techniques and have intense opportunity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bioelectrochemical photobiochemical heavy metal bioelectro remediation cleaner technology phytobial remediation 1 introduction excessive use of heavy metals for various objectives causes heavy metal contamination to the environment these metals include but are not limited to cd cadmium cu copper cr chromium ni nickel pb lead mn manganese and hg mercury which are highly carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic causes multiple types of alteration in plants animals and human beings and become serious threats to the present era 1 4 ni pb cr cu hg and cd are placed on the top of the substance priority list spl of agency toxic substances and disease registry atsdr out of these metals cr pb and cd are highly toxic metals that are generated from the diverse types of industrial processes in massive quantity and disposed of into the water canals and tributaries of the river devoid of proper treatment 5 6 such types of activities led scantily damaged the whole ecosystem metal contamination sources include metal mining smelting plating and finishing workshops in addition to natural sources which include weathering of metal containing rocks and volcanoes 7 15 these cr cd and pb have prominent toxicity on the plant animals as well as on human beings and hexavalent cr cr vi and cd have been categorized as group 1 carcinogenic to humans while pb compounds are grouped as probably carcinogen to humans group 2a by the international agency for research on cancer https www iarc who int they have a wider impact on humans and can cause kidney damage bronchitis gastrointestinal disorder bone marrow problems liver damage mental retardation in children persisting diarrhea skin ulceration chrome holes and cancer 3 6 16 18 in plants they cause multiple disorders for instance chlorosis delayed senescence wilting biochemical lesions reduced biosynthesis stunted growth oxidative stress decrease in plant nutrient content growth inhibition and reduced seed germination 2 13 19 21 they are redox active metal and after uptake inside the cell induces the reactive oxygen species ros nascent oxygen o superoxide anion o2 hydroxide ion oh peroxoions ho2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh production that results into oxidative stress which depends on their concentration produced ros can cause unrepairable oxidative damages to cellular micro and macro molecules like membrane lipid protein and dna 11 12 21 24 they are also known to cause non oxidative damage of dna and a probable unambiguous type of damage is the binding of dna which causes metal induced mutation and chromosomal break metal metabolism can react to protein and dna and causes different types of damage inside the cell and can alter whole cell functioning 25 27 there are varieties of physicochemical technologies to treat metal containing industrial wastewater however their initial implementation cost and associated other drawbacks such as producing a huge amount of toxic sludge required high quantity of chemicals insufficient treatment efficiency and generation of toxic waste that have environmental concerns in addition they require high energy and skilled manpower input which limits their use 13 28 29 this arise a quick demand for cleaner strategies that have lessened impact on the environment in addition to economic feasibility bioremediation strategy minimizes these problems associated with physicochemical techniques and is also cheaper than other known techniques while requiring more time than physicochemical system 2 13 30 32 both of these either physicochemical or biological have their own challenges although their integration can give a newly generated system in recent days microbial integrated systems have taken immediate consideration of the researchers and are expected to be more adaptable and potential due to their hybrid characteristic and they can reduce the environmental consequences of physicochemical techniques while time requisite issue of bioremediation microbes bacteria fungi and algae perform several processes such as precipitation accumulation surface sorption reduction etc under aerobic as well as the anaerobic environment depends on microbes in the removal of cr cd pb and other heavy metals thus depending on the need of the system microbes can be integrated with existing physicochemical techniques in aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions for instance exoelectrogenic bacteria have excellent electron production performance via oxidizing organic substances that have been integrated into bioelectrochemical systems for electricity production and wastewater treatment 33 35 the microbial processes have a high opportunity for their integration with other treatment techniques that may offer outstanding results on the removal of cr pb and cd from industrial wastewater a few years back it was assumed that microbial integration with physicochemical techniques may enhance the treatment performance of the system and will construct novel types of systems at present integrated systems such as microbial fuel cell mfc and mfc constructed wetland have set an example of microbial integrated system and become an advanced type of system for multipurpose use and also have high removal performance for heavy metals like cr vi 33 40 there are several types of microbial integrated strategies such as bio chemical bio electro techniques bioelectrochemical microbial flocculation constructed wetland photobiochemical photo bioelectrochemical and other biointegrated techniques which have been categorized based on their microbial integration with physical or chemical techniques these strategies have been followed and investigated in various studies in the recent past and shown commendable outcomes that have potential demand in near future to the best of our knowledge this is the first review article that specially focused on microbial integrated techniques for the treatment of highly toxic cr cd and pb polluted industrial wastewater in this review we have considered all these microbial integrated techniques categorized them and discussed well in addition their possibilities advancement shortcomings and future perspective have also been discussed in detail in this paper 2 bioremediation industrial wastewater contains different types of pollutants together with organic and inorganic pollutants in the bioremediation process microbes and plants are used for the removal of these pollutants from wastewater they remove pollutants either via degradation or via the accumulation and adsorption process with the degradation process organic pollutants are mineralized into simpler molecules like carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide hydrochloric acid methane carbon monoxide through a chain of metabolic reaction processes by microbes the metals are non biodegradable so they accumulated inside the cell or adhere to their surface through physicochemical forces 2 1 microbial remediation microbes are used for the removal and degradation of a variety of pollutants including cr cd and pb from wastewater and soil table 1 the microbial cell is made up of carbohydrates protein and lipid and possesses several functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl phosphate amino etc these functional groups have a high affinity towards cr pb cd and others metals pollutants interaction with microbial cells cause adherence of pollutants on their cell surface through these surface functional groups which is called as surface adsorption process surface sorption is the result of different types of adsorption mechanisms which include chelation electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding diffusion complexation coordination and co precipitation and are driven by the present functional group on the surface of the microbes fig 1 2 14 203 it can vary with the types of pollutants and cell membrane composition of the microbes since cr pb and cd are non biodegradable so their removal does not only occur due to biosorption and another process is also involved in this process that called accumulation 204 the accumulation process is completed in three steps biosorption is also actually served as the first step of the accumulation process when interaction happens between cr cd pb with microbial surface the metal get adsorbed on microbial surface in the second step cr cd and pb are transported inside the cell via the active through transporter and passive such as direct diffusion mechanisms of the cell the sulfate transporter can transport the cr vi inside the cell due to its chromate structural similarity with sulfate ion as similar to the plant transporter some other specific heavy metal transporter has been reported that actively participate in the transportation of cr cd and pb inside the cell while active transportation mechanism always functionalized by a set of genes called as functional gene group such as gintabc1 protein belong sub group of abc transporter involved in cd transportation and encoded by gintabc1 gene in glomus intraradices 67 several proteins are also localized to the cell membrane that may responsible for the transportation of metal for instance gfp pcaa fusion protein that is encoded by pcaa gene and associated with cd transportation in aspergillus fumigatus 68 in the last third step cr cd and pb either get chelated bind with protein metallothionein amino acid glutathione and thiolic compound and reduced or participate in metabolism and cause oxidative stress via producing ros species chelated or bound metal translocated to vacuoles vesicle of the microbial cell as residued excretory by product a final deposition process of accumulation and sometime efflux outside the cell through efflux pump mechanism fig 1 however cr is generally found in hexavalent form so its reduction in its trivalent form due to its less toxicity as compared to cr vi is another approach being implemented these days in its reduction process different types of enzymatic and non enzymatic mechanisms are involved a well known example of an enzyme is chromate reductase chr which has been widely reported in bacteria and fungi 11 23 69 this enzymatic reaction involves nadph or nadh as an electron reservoir to be completed as eq 1 some time cr vi reduction process also occur without the presence of enzymes under specific or acidic condition in this process cr vi reduction happens through one electron transfer reaction mechanism and electrons are provided by the substrate of the medium are cell surface of the microbes see eqs 2 4 1 cr vi nadph chr cr iii nadp chr 2 cr vi e substrate cr v less stable intermediate pentavalent cr 3 cr v e substrate cr vi less stable intermediate tetravalent cr 4 cr vi e substrate cr iii highly stable trivalent cr the microbial remediation process is one of the cheapest ecofriendly techniques that have potential in remediation polluted sites microbes can be utilized to degrade or remove the pollutant from wastewater in a greener cleaner and more sustainable way their use in the remediation process is quite less easy than phytobial and phytoremediation while taking a reduced amount of time and more efficient than these processes and also more opportunistic than other known techniques in terms of cost and environmentally friendliness despite their advantages microbial remediation processes have some drawbacks when microbes are applied for metal removal in an open system it requires nutrient availability in the system proper monitoring affected by changes in the atmosphere temperature presence of co occurring contaminant and high concentration of pollutants no proper management of generated sludge and may require optimized condition for proper functioning to reduce such shortcomings various types of engineered systems bioreactors have been developed that provide an optimized condition for the proper functioning of the systems in the treatment process microbes can be utilized independently or simultaneously with other microbes their combination can be from the same group such as one bacterium with another bacterium or one fungus with another fungus or can be from the different groups such as the combination of bacteria fungi and algae 2 while using a single microbe in the treatment system the whole remediation process is led by one single microorganism there are huge numbers of bacteria fungi and algae that have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb either from single or multiple pollutants contaminated medium such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb can remove cd and pb by 94 8 and 94 4 via precipitation mechanism 70 cd and pb are also significantly removed by stenotrophomonas rhizophila variovorax boronicumulans and sporosarcina pasteurii via precipitation mechanism 71 aspergillus flavus and trichoderma lixii achieved up to 99 reduction of cr vi via enzyme mediated reduction process as shown in reaction 1 11 23 and nostoc muscorum and anabaena variabilis can remove pb significantly from the wastewater 62 the most basic problem that arises with the use of the single microbe is that the minor change in the optimized condition can affect the remediation efficiency of the system and microbes are not immune to all toxic pollutants so due to toxicity the presence of pollutants other than targeted pollutants can also affect the remediation process which is a very common phenomenon in large scale wastewater treatment systems this problem arise the need for the investigation of more than one microbe for the removal of such pollutant or pollutants that present concurrently in the same wastewater since one microbe is unable to tolerate other non targeted pollutants however the simultaneously applied microbes may do that another multi pollutant tolerant idea also has been added in this sequence where individual microbes can tolerate more than one metal pollutant and can be utilized for the treatment of multi metal contaminated water aspergillus flavus cr500 and aspergillus lentulus have shown multiple tolerant abilities and can remove multiple metals including cr cd and pb concomitantly 12 72 in the case of microbial consortium the microbial compatibility with each other is one of the necessary aspects that must exist between the microbes because a microbe may show antagonistic activity towards other microbes and can inhibit the growth of other concurrently applied microbes if one of them is an antagonist to other various researchers have worked on mixed microbial application or the development of microbial consortiums for the removal of one or more than one pollutant from industrial wastewater for example microalgae chlorella vulgaris can remove 58 58 and 61 of cr cd and pb respectively from textile wastewater when applied singly while enterobacter sp mn17 assisted chlorella vulgaris achieved 79 93 and 79 removal of cr cd and pb respectively 73 in the consortium form one microbe may be dominated and played a lead role although its survival and existence under in situ or open environmental conditions depend on their community and in absence of the community its treatment performance is also reduced significantly sometime similar microbe singly may achieve high removal efficiency under optimized or controlled conditions not in open conditions while treating wastewater contaminated with various pollutants including cr pb and cd an engineered system can be more efficient to remove such type of complexity from the microbial treatment systems researchers have developed various type arrangements in the form of several types of techniques by integrating microorganisms with available treatment techniques where microbes were utilized either individually or binary or as a consortium or as whole community which is discussed later however for the better understanding all the microbial integrated strategies have been classified based on the microbial integration with physical or chemical treatment techniques in this review 2 2 phyto and phytobial technique plants use sunlight for the photosynthesis process to synthesize glucose for their growth and development plants have high applicability in wastewater treatment aquatic plants species mainly have been investigated for the treatment of different types of industrial wastewater cr cd and pb are the metal so with first interaction they adhere to the surface of roots due to its cell wall composition which is made up of cellulose starch pectin and retains some surface functional groups like hydroxyl amine and carbonyl and participate in metal adsorption adhered metal pollutants get transported inside the cell either via active transportation or passive transportation mechanism cr vi species structure resembles sulfate ion transported inside the cell via sulfate transporter 74 some specific metal transporters are also involved in the transportation process such abc atp binding cassette transporter abcg36 is required for cd transportation in rice 75 and osnramp1 transporter associated with cd uptake in rice and abscisic acid mediated pb uptake is reported in populus canescens several genes are associated with the uptake and transportation process such as nramp1 4 abcg40 frd3 1 pcs1 1 and abcc1 1 are involved in the uptake and transportation of pb 44 oslct1 osccx2 oshma2 and ospcr1 are associated with cd uptake 76 transported metal inside the root cell is either translocated to different cell organelles or aerial part of the plant which is the last location of cr cd and pb in plants while in the case of volatilizing metal loid such as hg and as volatilized into the atmosphere through the volatilization process phytobial remediation is the process when microbes are used to associate the phytoremediation process and increase the efficiency of the system thus called phytobial phytobial remediation process is considered as one of the ecofriendly and sustainable strategies in the removal and degradation of pollutants various types of fungi bacteria and algae showed mutual relation with plants they accomplish with different types of mechanisms to assist plants and increase the remediation efficiency such as plant hormone production to improve plant growth their antagonistic activity towards pathogenic microbes they release soil phosphate which is used by plants as nutrient immobilize metal and reduces the toxicity of metal to plant increase the uptake and transportation of metal fig 2 in the case of organic pollutants microbes play a crucial role in pollutant degradation mineralization and assimilation process with plants metallic pollutants are non biodegradable so microbes involve through various processes in remediation together with solubilization of metals biosorption of metals metal reduction bioprecipitation of metals siderophores secretion bioaccumulation of metal by metal binding proteins binding of metals on the cell surface biotransformation of metals methylation of metals dna mediated interface towards heavy metal removal 2 77 79 a suitable microbe such as phosphate solubilizing bacteria or plant growth promoting bacteria can go through these mechanisms via producing plant growth promoting substances such as biosurfactant acc deaminase siderophore and organic acids and accelerate the remediation process 78 81 phytobial remediation is one of the cheapest and cleanest techniques unlike other all encompassing approaches it can be applied in a vast variety of contaminated sites for their remediation either under in situ or ex situ including contaminated wastewater ground water soil and sediment in spite of their advantages there are some shortcomings that limit the use of higher plants in phytobial process such as it restricting in shallow aquifer and soil due to restriction of root length may cause biomagnification of heavy metal in the food chain take a huge amount of acclimatization time need proper monitoring lack of safe disposal of obtained biomass and tough recycling or recovery process of metal 77 hao et al 82 successfully conducted cd phytoextraction experiment using spinach plant and reported that microbes belong to the genera alicyclobacillus clostridium sensu stricto and streptacidiphilus colonized with spinach and assisted the cd phytoextraction process in another investigation liang et al 83 utilized few chelators oxalic acid ethylenediamine disuccinic acid and citric acid with pteris vittata l for the phytoextraction and management of cd and pb contaminated site they also found increased microbial community abundance in the system that might be associated with increased cd and pb accumulation in plants brassica juncea and aspergillus sydowii contemporaneous use can also achieve more removal and degradation of heavy metal and organic pollutant co contaminated sites than a single one as best conjugate 84 3 microbial composite techniques material supported microorganisms are utilized in industrial sectors such as the fermentation process and this technique is often called as microbial composite technique 85 these days it is being investigated by the researcher for remediation of water and soil for different types of pollutants along with cr cd and pb in the case of organic pollutants live microbes a have very important role in the degradation of pollutant while metal get accumulated inside their cells the used support material and microbial cell surface also play a superficial role in pollutants adsorption the materials such as sodium alginate wheat straw fe sludge biochar alunite carbon fiber and biochar have been reported to show high applicability in the removal of cr pb cd in combination with applied microbes 86 90 among them materials like corn stalk biochar can increase the bacterial bacillus subtilis growth in the combined system and provide excellent removal performance for metal like pb 88 various types of microorganisms bacteria and fungi such as bacillus subtilis bacillus sp mucor plumbeus plesiomonas shigelloides h5 have been utilized in the development of microbial composite and successfully demonstrated for the removal of cr pb cd and other pollutants 86 88 90 91 biological activated carbon is another type of microbial composite that has been investigated and showed high proficiency in removing such pollutants from wastewater 92 93 the membrane bioreactor has also been investigated for the removal of several metallic pollutants including cr pb and cd from water and wastewater and gives excellent results in the removal of these metallic contaminants 94 96 4 microbial flocculation the flocculation process is mediated by floc formation by using some stimulant and occurred through the aggregation of collide and suspended particles several inorganic and organic chemicals are used as a stimulant in the chemical flocculation process and are known as chemical flocculants bioflocculants are different from the chemical flocculants are natural and biodegradable polymer extracellularly produced by microorganisms under stressed environments due to their defense mechanism and are generally known as microbial metabolites bioflocculants generally composed of glycolipids exopolysaccharides lipids glycoproteins and proteins used for different purposes and these days have been investigated in remediation of heavy metal contaminated water 97 98 they are recognized as a potential alternative of the chemical flocculant due to being environmentally benign harmless highly biodegradable do not generate noxious secondary pollution high suitability in removal of suspended pollutants like heavy metals due to possessing such excellent properties it is receiving the attention of researchers several microbes have been investigated for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater through bioflocculation mechanism ayangbenro et al 97 investigated the bioflocculant production efficiency of pseudomonas koreensis and pantoea sp which carry cd cr and pb resistant gene cada czcd and chra pantoea sp and p koreensis showed 71 3 and 51 7 flocculation activity with a yield of 2 98 g l and 3 26 g l which contain hydroxyl amino and carboxylic functional groups both of the isolate s bioflocculants showed a significant amount of removal for cd cr and pb in another study bacillus sp showed 97 flocculation efficiency and produced flocculant exhibited high removal efficiency for cd and cr 99 and flocculant composed of polysaccharide and protein produced from actinomycete nocardiopsis sp grg 3 exhibited 55 9 85 9 74 7 removal cd cr and pb respectively 100 5 bio chemical techniques simultaneous utilization of bioagents and chemicals in the pollutants removal process and wastewater remediation can give potential results bio agents may be plants or microbes and their good combination have high applicability in the removal of cd cr and pb in this type of system chemicals are utilized by microbes as sources of energy nutrients and electron source to reduce the pollutant concentration in the systems in a study acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans used for cr vi reduction and precipitation with pyrite a ferrooxidans participated in breaking of fs bond reducing the cr vi to cr iii and cr iii precipitation 101 using thiobacillus with zero valent s 0 and fe 0 can enhance the reduction and removal of cr vi 102 simultaneous microbes and chemicals with plants also enhanced the accumulation of metal in plants for instance vermicompost elemental sulfur inoculum of t thiooxidans and p putida increase the accumulation percentage of pb and cd in gladiolus grandiflorus l 103 recently zhao et al 104 applied nano zero valent iron nzvi in a system contaminated with cd which dominated with sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfobulbaceae desulfobacteraceae syntrophobacteraceae desulfovibrionaceae and desulfomicrobiaceae with the combined action of srbs and nzvi cd transformed into cd s fe like compounds they can be affected by the presence of other pollutants like heavy metals that have the potential to inhibit their growth or any of their metabolic process this type of treatment system can be utilized for the treatment of wastewater and they required additional supplement sources as utilized chemical and less hazards than chemical treatment systems and also require less time and are highly efficient than bioremediation 6 photo bio technique plants algae and cyanobacteria use light to produce energy for their growth and development a very sustainable approach for nutrient and metal removal recovery from wastewater for the treatment of wastewater researchers have developed different types of photo bioreactor to utilize algae for the removal and recovery of nutrient and metallic pollutants 105 106 on one hand obtained algal mass also has potential application for biofuel production the aspect that is also being covered in the photo bioreactor system in the system algae use the sun light and atmospheric carbon dioxide for the photosynthesis process and use nutrients such as nitrate phosphate and micronutrient for their growth and development metal pollutants get accumulated by these algae either as a real nutrient or as a pseudo nutrient when pollutant mimic as nutrient like chromate transported inside the cell via sulfate transporter due to similar structure as sulfate or due to smaller size pollutant gets diffused directly into the cell and removed from the system 107 110 since algal cells are composed of carbohydrates and lipids which carry various types of functional groups on their surface that play a crucial role in the bioadsorption of pollutants like cr cd and pb several algal species for example chlamydomonas reinhardtii and acid tolerant chlamydomonas cpcc 121 chlorella sorokiniana pseudopediastrum boryanum var longicorne raphidocelis subcapitata and chlorella vulgaris have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from water and wastewater and shows outstanding removal performance for these pollutants 107 109 112 these algal species have very high potential in their utilization in photo bioreactor for industrial wastewater clean up contaminated with cr cd and pb photo irradiation ph reactor configuration nutrient availability are some of the functional parameters that can highly influence the photo bioreactor performance some of the studies have also used algae as a coating to develop the hybrid system with other photoactive material like tio2 for efficient reduction of cr vi to cr iii and reported greater reduction efficiency than a single system 113 combining the photo bio process with mfc has a greater opportunity for pollutant removal like heavy metal for instance zhang et al 114 introduced chlorella sp qb 102 into the mfc as an algal cathode and utilized for the removal of cd they achieved a maximum of 95 cd removal via adsorption and precipitation as hydroxide besides this studies have upgraded the mdc using algae as photosynthetic mdc and investigated for chemical oxygen demand cod and total dissolved solids tds removal photosynthetic mdc has a high proficiency in the cod and tds removal and needs more exploration for its applicability in removal of cr pb cd and such other pollutants this system can reach high power density and high algal biomass production rates 115 7 bio electro technique it is a combined process of microbes and electro driven process that can reduce the energy input of the electro driven process and time requirement of bioremediation this process can be implemented separately in two different chambers as well as in single chamber systems it has been widely investigated for removal and degradation of dye pesticide other organo pollutant heavy metal and nutrients removal from water and wastewater it requires electricity input to happen the process for pollutant removal and degradation it can be applied in different ways some authors have implemented first the microbial processes as pretreatment process where all the biodegradable pollutants chemical oxygen demand cod are removed by microbes and some of them also accumulated inside the cell of the microbes generally this arrangement necessitates a long acclimatization period subsequent to the pretreatment process electro process is used to remove the remaining pollutants 116 117 conversely several researchers first applied electro process as a pretreatment which removes all the charged pollutants and many of the biodegradable pollutants and then microbial process are employed for the remaining pollutants removal in the latter configuration the acclimatization period is reduced and more pollutants are oxidized yet require high input of energy 50 from the cost perspective the first configuration is considered as more economical than latter one 117 118 on other hand this technique has also been well demonstrated for removal of heavy metals from contaminated soil in addition to wastewater and proven as a potential strategy for effective and ecofriendly management of heavy metal polluted soil 77 the authors have demonstrated lysinibacillus fusiformis pseudomonas putida shewanella putrefaciens in the removal of several heavy metals from soil 119 121 the results were positive towards their applicability in the management of such contaminated soil via microbial electrokinetic process however this process is more effective when metals are present in their soluble form in the soil 8 bio electro chemical technique similar to the bio electro process bio electro chemical bec system is the assemblage of microbes chemicals and electro processes under a unified system and broadly investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater treatment this process can be utilized for different types of pollutant removal including cr cd and pb table 2 the best example of bec is the microbial fuel cell mfc where microbes or enzymes are utilized at least one reaction either oxidation or reduction reaction in the mfc the utilized power was generated by the degradation of organic compounds on the bioanode by exoelectrogenic microorganisms fig 3 in the bec system electroactive microbes are used in electrolytic cell and work as a catalyst on one or both electrodes and they catalyze the reaction taking place on the electrode electron moved from the oxidized component to cathode for the reduction reaction or to the cathode for the oxidation reaction take place 131 tao et al 132 developed a hybrid type of bes and electrolysis reactors for recovering pb cu and zn and successfully demonstrated and illustrated reaction mechanism was as shown in eqs 5 7 a simultaneous cr vi reduction and nitrate removal experiment was conducted using bec system by wang et al 39 the system was dominated by pseudomonas halomonas and thauera and facilitated the autohydrogenotrophic denitrification and cr vi reduction process occurred as eqs 8 9 5 pb 2 2e pb e 0 0 130 v 6 cu 2 2e cu e0 0 337 v 7 zn 2 2e zn e0 0 762 v 8 1 06 no 3 0 3 co 2 3 34 h 2 1 06 h 0 06

mfc two types of configuration are popularly known single chamber mfc and dual chamber mfc 35 39 133 both of these have been widely investigated in the removal of a range of pollutants together with cr cd and pb the mfc configuration is one of its most basic requirements that can influence the whole system efficiency applicability and adaptability for its large scale application both of the mfcs were found to be efficient and can remove the pollutant effectively from the wastewater 35 39 these days some new mfc configurations were proposed and successfully demonstrated for cr cd or pb removal recently cao et al 33 proposed a novel osmotic mfc osmfc and successfully demonstrated for simultaneously cr vi removal organic pollutant removal energy production and water reclamation in another investigation fixed bed bec reactor was developed and 100 removal rate for cd was reported 134 photo mfc is another advanced form of mfc being investigated by the researcher using photocatalyst modified electrode in glass chamber under the presence of electromagnetic radiation and found to be efficient in electricity production and pollutant removal than common mfc photo mfc has been discussed well in section 9 129 135 some other important parameters such as utilized organic sources presence of nutrients electrode material acclimatized microbial community or type of microbe salts bridge and its concentration ph of electrolyte and applied supplements in addition to system configuration can affect the pollutant removal and electricity production efficiency of the system which is one another aspect being demonstrated concurrently to achieve more benefit from the single system 33 35 39 133 136 to upgrade the mfc researchers have applied various types of advanced material originated electrode that enhance the mfc performance on both respect either pollutant removal efficiency or electricity production such as application of graphite felt modified with iron sulfide wrapped with reduced graphene oxide fes rgo nanocomposite can reduce cr vi 4 6 time higher and produces 328 higher electricity than the blank mfc 137 biogenic palladium nanoparticles bio pdnps modified activated carbon electrode achieved a complete reduction of cr vi 138 oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes modified graphite felt electrode attain two times more reduction efficiency of cr vi than unmodified system 139 140 mfc systems have also been investigated in the sensing and detection cr vi in different types of wastewater and soil samples using various types of advanced material originated electrodes they are being investigated as biosensor systems and can detect the cr vi qualitatively and quantitatively its sensing ability can vary with used bacterial species electrode material system configuration etc 139 143 the microbial desalination cell mdc is also an advanced or extended type of bec system used for the desalination of water it can be operated in an auto powered mode no need for an extra power supply is needed and has been extensively investigated mdc produces electrical energy from the oxidation of organic substrate connected to extracellular electron transfer by respiring bacteria on the anode fig 4 144 145 ion exchange membrane iem that is cation exchange membrane cem and anion exchange membrane aem are arranged in a manner in the mdc system that permits the salts to be removed from saline water to uphold the charge neutrality in the system mdc has been investigated for the removal of cr pb cd and several other heavy metal pollutants in addition to salts for example in mdc mirzaienia et al 145 reported 69 5 removal for cd gholizadeh et al 34 achieved 91 8 and 98 4 removal rate for cr and pb to upgrade the mdc and improve its desalination efficiency researchers have developed the mdc in a range of configurations for laboratory scale investigation and successfully attain their objective which includes electrolyte recirculation biocathode capacitive osmotic photosynthetic stacked bipolar membrane resin packed ion exchange and upflow configurations which were reviewed previously 144 in a recent study mdc coupled with microbial electrolytic cell mec was examined for pb removal and reported removal efficiency of up to 90 146 microbial electrolysis cell mec is also comprised of bec technique and widely investigated for removal recovery of resources and treatment of wastewater it has been also investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from wastewater and successfully demonstrated on removing such pollutants several attempts have been made by the researcher to upgrade the mec system few of the workers have integrated the microbial membrane film with mec to achieve maximum wastewater treatment efficiency using mec 147 mec integrated mfc has also attracted the researcher and is being investigated for the treatment and remediation of wastewater and production of the various products including methane hydrogen acetate and hydrocarbon from wastewater 148 149 this type of integration can be investigated and utilized for removal and reduction of heavy metal from wastewater can give triumphant results in the removal of heavy metal pollutants some of the studies have investigated the cr pb and cd reduction and removal using mec mfc and excellent results are observed in these experiments 150 151 for instance li et al 151 coupled the mec with cr vi reducing mfc as a self driven system mfc was used as a bioelectricity source and at mec using different electrodes pb ii reduction to pb 0 was experimented and significant results for reduction of pb ii was observed cr vi reduction happened in the mfc as reaction 27 and pb ii reduction has occurred on

through various mechanisms this principle is being integrated with the bioelectrochemical system as p bec system and investigated for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with different types of organic pollutants like dye pesticide pharmaceuticals and antibiotics and reported as very efficient for the treatment of wastewater 152 153 in the case of metal they are not degradable so it is less studied for metal removal while cr is highly toxic in its hexavalent form and it is also found in trivalent stage a stable form that very less toxic than its hexavalent form so its reduction into trivalent form was investigated in many studies in the cr vi reduction experiment several materials such as polyaniline nanofiber pani cds quantum dots qds and pd decorated p type silicon nanowire pd sinw have been studied and used as photocathode in photo mfc 129 135 photo mfc showed highest power density and cr vi reduction efficiency under visible light in the cr vi reduction process the

constructed wetland cw is the integrated system of microbe plants and potential adsorbing substrate widely practiced in the treatment of industrial municipal and mining wastewater and considered as an efficient and sustainable technology fig 5 cws have high potential in removing pesticide dye pharmaceutical nitrate phosphate sulfate and heavy metals including cr cd and pb simultaneously as well as single pollutant contaminated medium 157 160 the removal of these pollutants happens via degradation adsorption accumulation precipitation complexation diffusion process which is either performed by microbes or plants or substrate used for the bedding microbial processes mainly associated with degradation and accumulation of pollutants sometimes also involve in precipitation of metallic pollutants as metal hydroxide phosphate sulfate while plants can accumulate adsorb and volatilize the pollutant various types of substrates like soil sand river sand gravel pebbles biochar pyrite activated carbon bazlsc and cockle shell etc have been investigated in cw in the removal of pollutants and they can absorb the pollutant on their surface and accumulate them in substrate system 36 40 158 160 161 other than plants microbes and substrate cw efficiency can be affected by its configuration flow rate hydraulic retention time and pollutant concentration even electroactive material can enhance cr vi reduction by 42 9 as compared to traditional gravel based cw 162 these days horizontal flow cw surface and subsurface flow vertical flow up flow hybrid cw and aerated cw have been investigated for the removal of cr cd and pb from contaminated wastewater and achieved proficient removal capability 163 several investigated plants in cw that showed efficient removal efficiency are j effuses t orientalis s validus iris sibirica cyperus alternifolius coix lacryma jobi l eichhornia crassipes typha angustifolia l canna indica l and hydrocotyle umbellata l 158 161 164 contrary cr cd and pb containing wastewater can affect the enzymatic activity and rhizospheric microbial community of plants in cw when the cws are not used to such metal contaminated wastewater treatment or cw are not designated to treat such metal containing wastewater and can influence the efficiency of cw 40 165 to advance the cw system for removal of cr pb and cd various types of modifications have been made which include the application of advanced material as a substrate for bedding the addition of specific metal accumulating plants and microbes 157 these days cw integrated with microbial fuel cell cw mfc is being investigated at laboratory and pilot scale for its full application in wastewater treatment and concurrently electricity production this approach is trending and has attracted the research community cw and mfc are the structural and functional component of the cw mfc respectively cw is made up of plants gravels and a slowly developed microbial community as a film in the bottom of the cw at the bottom air diffusion is impaired and anoxic condition is generated while on the surface due to air diffusion and rhizospheric oxygen leakage aerobic environment prevail by adding the electrode cathode and anode in these anaerobic and aerobic zones cw is converted into cw mfc 166 this principle is well studied in the degradation and removal of various types of pollutants including cr pb and cd from wastewater change in bedding material types of electrodes spacing between the electrodes and hydraulic retention time can influence the electricity production as well treatment efficiency of cw mfc 36 38 40 in cw the removal of cd pb and cr occur through precipitation complexation adsorption biosorption accumulation etc while generated e from cw mfc also participate in cr vi reduction into its trivalent form and prevailing mechanism is illustrated in eq 27 several other integrated cw were investigated and reported as an efficient system for removal of cr and cd for example in two different experiments cw has been also integrated with biological pond plant pond for reduction of cd in irrigation water and significant reduction of cd was reported in irrigation water 167 168 zhang et al 169 developed a micro electric field constructed wetland and investigated for cd and other pollutant removal and reported successful removal cd from wastewater 11 nano microbial remediation nanomaterials synthesis and its application in the various fields are trending and widely studied materials whose size ranges between 1 and 100 nm are considered as nanomaterial which includes nanoparticles nanofibers nano sheets nanorods nanowires nanocomposites 2 3 13 14 170 nanomaterials are utilized in various ways in cleaning polluted environments such as nano catalyst nano photo catalyst nanoadsorbent in a range of technology nanomaterials carry high surface area prominent active sites high stability excellent reusability great electron conductivity admirable adsorption and catalytic activity that make them perfect in environmental remediation 171 although they have good environmental applicability and simultaneous application with plants and microbes in bioremediation systems can enhance the whole process efficiency of the integrated system and their concurrent process in pollutant removal and degradation can be called nano microbial remediation nanomaterial integrated system have been extensively studied in the management of polluted soil and water due to their catalytic and adsorption proficiency physicochemical fabrication of nanomaterials has some environmental concerns that reduce its environmental sustainability and ecofriendly concept that s why researchers moved to biological synthesis of nanomaterial using a range of microbes and plants microbial and plant cytoplasm hold a range of enzymes protein polyphenol and other highly bioactive compounds that act as reducing and capping agents in the synthesis of metallic nanomaterial 13 78 79 170 172 researchers have considered both the way as nanobioremediation either biosynthesized nanomaterial for environmental application or nanomaterial simultaneous utilization with microbes and plants in the environmental application 173 174 when microbially synthesized nanomaterials were used in the remediation process it adsorbed the cr pb cd through electrostatic attraction complexation coordination hydrogen bonding diffusion and ion exchange mechanism and stabilizes them into the system and block their movement 171 175 176 these mechanisms also play a crucial role when nanomaterial is applied simultaneously with microbes and occur concurrently on the surface of nanomaterial and microbes in removal of cr cd pb and other pollutants 177 179 in addition to adsorption on the surface of microbes cr cd and pb accumulation is also taking place inside the cell of microorganisms the combined action of microbes and nanomaterial may also lead the precipitation of cr cd pb as their oxide hydroxide sulfide phosphate under favorable environment as reported in several studies and ph of the medium work as most affecting factors for metal coprecipitation 179 180 cr vi species of cr can be reduced into its trivalent form while mitigating its toxicity by nanomaterial and microbes exclusively or concurrently 181 one electron transfer reaction takes place when nanomaterial involves in the reduction process and microbes can reduce cr vi either enzymatically or both processes where reductase enzymes such as chromate reductase enzyme are associated with reduction process 11 23 138 179 some of the nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticle can induce enzymatic activity and increase the hormonal secretion in plants and microbes that help in reducing pollution cd pb and other pollutants levels in systems 182 184 iron oxide nanoparticles have also been investigated in various studies in nanobioremediation cr cd and pb pollution in soil and water for example in a study iron biochar nano complex bc fe3o4 leersia hexandra and cr tolerant microbial consortium dominated with firmicutes and actinobacteria were used for managing cr vi pollution in the system microbial assisted the hyper accumulation of cr in the aerial part of the plant and bc fe3o4 reduces the bioavailability of cr vi via mechanism as shown in reaction eqs 32 36 179 several factors such as medium ph temperature metal concentration dose and properties of nanomaterial and microbe species can affect the effectiveness of the remediation practices while using nanomaterial and microbes concomitantly

also not immune to toxic pollutants and a rise in pollutant concentration can result in inhibition of microbial growth and activity this fear rise demand for newer strategies to deals with this problem and genetic engineering can be a viable approach to remove such drawbacks from the microbial and microbial integrated wastewater treatment system there are several reports are available which deals with the genetically modified microorganisms on removing heavy metal pollutants 185 189 basically the metal removal can happen through biosorption and bioaccumulation processes and both processes are different from each other in the biosorption process chemical moieties present on the matrix of biomass associate the removal of metal through chemical and physical bonding like chelation complexation electrostatic attraction and coprecipitation bioaccumulation involves interactive adsorption transportation and storage inside the cell thus researchers have made efforts on targeted sites that is to improve the biosorption process workers have applied physicochemical modification to improve the biosorption on the surface or made genetic changes that improve the metal binding protein and lipid on the microbial cell surface to achieve higher biosorption metal 190 191 for example a cr iii adsorption protein merp was displayed on the cell surface escherichia coli which facilitated the adsorption process 187 and zhou et al 189 expressed ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1 chrb in escherichia coli bl21 which enable them for excellent cr vi adsorption from wastewater bioaccumulation involves several types of metal transporter such as channels secondary carriers primary active transporters and abc transporter in transportation of metal from periplasm to cytoplasm all of these metal importers are usually made up of various types of proteins like channels are single component α helical proteins passive metal diffusion secondary carriers are single component protein and primary active transporters are the multicomponent protein complexes involve atp in metal transportation 192 researchers have improved these targeted paths through genetic engineering and utilized to facilitate the heavy metal including cr cd and pb uptake potential of microorganisms 185 186 188 193 197 imported metal inside the cell is stored in various locations via binding with metal chelating protein including metallothionein phytochelatin cystine glutathione non protein thiol content these metal chelating mediators regulated by different types of genes and enzymes may also involve in chelation release and translocation process in various investigations these proteins chelating agent encoding genes were expressed in a range of microorganisms to assist the accumulation process of cr cd pb and other heavy metals 197 206 208 these reports recorded an instant increase in the removal of heavy metal pollutants through accumulation process from wastewater enzyme dependent metal removal and reduction mechanism can also be enhanced through this tool chromate reductase encoding gene chrt from serratia sp s2 expression in chrt engineered strain enhanced the cr vi reduction than control 198 laboratory scale studies provide beginning results that display the fundamental molecular mechanisms and suggest that engineered microbial application for biosorption and bioaccumulation is more economical and ecofriendly than the known metal removal techniques the majority of conducted studies were batch studies where the flask shake method was applied by incubating synthetic microbes with heavy metals these miniatures are the first step to scaling up their application researchers have demonstrated the metal removal efficiency in pilot studies and reported exciting results two approaches batch experiment and continuous experiment are possible ways and being investigated some studies have investigated synthetic microbes to sense the metallic pollutant to develop a biosensor for their detection 199 their sensing ability varies with types of pollutant microbes and genetic changes despite being environmentally friendly economical efficient immune to higher metal concentration and immune to more than one pollutant engineered microbes also possesses some disadvantages such as they may be hazardous to the ecosystem may possess unknown changes their release in the ecosystem may cause severe impact on species community and whole ecosystem as invasive species they may produce toxic unknown metabolite with health risk 200 201 thus there disadvantages limit their large scale application and it may require proper guidelines and ethical approval to scale up in the treatment process 13 conclusion and future perspectives microbial remediation of heavy metal sounds good and opportunistic although the removal efficiency can be altered by various parameters that make it insufficient in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants microbial integrated strategies have significant advances than the existing techniques in removal of cr cd and pb and other heavy metals in this review all the strategies are categorized based on their nature like bio electro chemical and photo or integration of them for easier understanding and narrated well by congregating the information from the recently published research reports all the microbial integrated strategies have been found to be sound good and opportunistic in terms of environmental concern treatment efficiency and economical aspect than their non integrated configuration few of these have been investigated for multipurpose use like electrobiochemical and photo electrobiochemical use for the cr and pb as well as electricity and hydrogen production algal integrated system also provided high algal biomass for biofuel production in addition to efficient cr pb cd removal and electricity production the electro integrated and photo electro strategies can be advanced by using novel types of advanced material based electrodes and photocatalyst electrodes the novel excellent exoelectrogenic microbial species will always be useful when applied with suitable electrodes under optimum conditions this type of system can also be operated as an automated system without outsourcing energy input that needs more exploration and pilot scale study to investigate their cr cd and pb removal performance and efficiency for large scale application in industrial wastewater treatment by integrating cr cd and pb tolerant organisms microbes and plant and adsorptive material like biochar activated carbon and zeolite the efficiency of the constructed wetland cw can be improved while their configuration and operational parameter also play a lead role in removal of such toxic metals so their configuration is another point where a more experimental investigation is required to unlock their full potential for large scale exploitation in cr pb and cd removal from industrial wastewater as cr cd pb is highly toxic and microbes showed tolerance up to a certain concentration and increased metal form their tolerance limit can hamper the growth of microbes and at this point biotechnology is the most possible tool for the development of synthetic or engineered microbes they can replace the non synthetic microbes from integrated system and can become the most viable ones with an outstanding opportunity in cr pb cd contaminated industrial wastewater treatment however very few reports are available that deal with synthetic microbial integrated systems in removal of heavy metal pollutants and need more exploration for future possibilities credit authorship contribution statement vinay kumar conceptualization validation methodology formal analysis

important role of oxygenated and nitrogenated functional groups as well as the aromatic structure of the go mcs oc promoting h bonds and π π interactions the nanoadsorbent had a maximum experimental capacity of 50 5 mg g 1 30 c the selectivity of the nanocomposite in binary solutions with bisphenol a bpa revealed satisfactory removal efficiency good selectivity and material stability the go oc nanocomposite showed reuse potential for two consecutive cycles decreasing its capacity until the fifth adsorptive cycle finally the developed nanocomposite proved to be a promising alternative for removing emerging contaminants from aquatic matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption 17α ethinylestradiol nanocomposite graphene oxide emerging contaminant 1 introduction emerging contaminants belong to a category of pollutants that comprises new compounds that appear as well as known molecules but whose impact is not fully understood 1 pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial products microplastics surfactants illicit drugs disinfection products among other organic contaminants can be classified as emerging contaminants 2 3 this group of pollutants has been attracting the world s attention due to its great impact on human health and its risk to the ecosystem even at low concentrations 4 a fact that heightens the concern with this problem nowadays is the absence of specific regulations for many of these contaminants and quality standards that define their acceptable safe levels for society 4 another aggravating factor is that conventional effluent treatments often do not efficiently remove the various emerging contaminants that have very different chemical properties and make a unique and effective treatment difficult 5 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 is an emerging contaminant classified as synthetic estrogen with high estrogen potential and for this reason it is present in most commercial oral contraceptives 6 the rise in the use of this substance over the years results in increasingly concentrated anthropogenic waste arriving at wastewater treatment plants 7 incomplete removal of ee2 by conventional treatments contributes to its accumulation in the environment and causes serious environmental damages 8 its lipophilic characteristic shows a tendency of accumulation in animal fats that causes damages such as feminization reduced fertility and increased fish mortality in addition to endocrine dysfunction in humans 6 9 despite the difficult monitoring of emerging contaminants ee2 has already been identified in surface waters of more than 32 countries with great variability in its concentrations but with a tendency to occur more frequently in underdeveloped countries 10 even with all the concern related to this drug existing regulations are only related to its occurrence levels in drinking water such as the japanese drinking water quality standard and the environmental quality standard promoted by japan and the european union respectively 10 the lack of monitoring and regulation for this class of contaminants also contributes to the fact that more expensive and efficient treatments do not replace conventional treatments several procedures are investigated in order to efficiently remove emerging contaminants from water among them are bioremediation 11 12 advanced oxidative processes 13 16 membrane 17 18 photocatalysis 19 20 and adsorption 21 22 membrane and oxidation treatments present high efficiency however with high cost and problems of fouling and release of toxic end products respectively 23 25 adsorption stands out among the alternatives due to its easy operation low cost high efficiency and mainly due to the great diversity of adsorbent materials 26 28 the structural variety available for adsorbent materials allows for different types of interactions that may favor the removal of a contaminant of interest the removal of emerging contaminants via adsorption has been investigated in several materials such as modified biochar 29 30 activated biochar 15 16 31 alumina 32 zeolites 33 clays 34 35 organoclays 36 37 metal organic frameworks 38 39 etc the adsorption process in each material presents particularities and differences that are related to different types of interactions obtained for different adsorbate adsorbent systems nanoadsorbents have been extensively investigated due to their particularities and advantages in environmental application in general nanoadsorbents have a large surface area and atoms with high reactivity are disposed on its surface 40 several experimental works are presenting nanometric materials such as carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide go to remove pharmaceuticals from water 41 43 graphene oxide is a nanomaterial derived from graphene that has a large specific area and different oxygenated groups available on its surface hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy 44 materials based on graphene oxide have been constantly developed through the formation of nanocomposites with different materials such as organophilic clays and chitosan 45 46 the formation of the nanocomposite seeks to take advantage of the particular characteristics of precursor materials and improve their adsorption capacity 47 48 organoclays are materials that have undergone a modification process through the insertion of surfactant compounds that creates a hydrophobic surface on the clay which easily interacts with organic contaminants 49 chitosan is a natural biopolymer abundant in the world that has low cost and good adsorption capacity for different types of adsorbates 50 the amines and hydroxyls present on its surface are very important and have crucial contributions in the adsorption process 50 there are several reports in the literature of chitosan modifications by the insertion of fe3o4 nanoparticles to obtain composites with magnetic properties that facilitate its reuse and its separation from the system 51 52 in this work the adsorption of ee2 by the nanocomposite synthesized from graphene oxide chitosan and organophilic clay go mcs oc was investigated the adsorption study included the

simplified batch adsorption system a simplified batch system was designed to measure the amount of nanoadsorbent required to achieve different percentages of ee2 removal the estimate was based on a mass balance for a batch system and is represented by eq 17 17 v c 0 c 1 m q 1 q 0 some considerations were made to estimate the mass of go mcs oc such as considering the absence of ee2 initially in nanocomposite considering the concentration in fluid phase equal to equilibrium as well as considering the amount adsorbed on solid phase the amount adsorbed on equilibrium in this way eq 17 becomes eq 18 18 v c 0 c e m q e the nanocomposite mass required was evaluated for a solution volume range between 10 and 1000 l with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 and removal percentages of 50 70

9 regeneration cycles in batch go mcs oc reuse tests for ee2 removal were evaluated for five adsorption desorption cycles in a batch system in each cycle 25 ml of solution of initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 were treated with 5 mg of go mcs oc after 180 min of agitation at 200 rpm in shaker equipment at 30 c the solid phase was separated through centrifugation and magnets and the concentration of the aliquots was measured as previously described 3 ml of acetonitrile or ethanol were added to the solid phase and the system was subjected to a 3 min of ultrasonic bath acetonitrile and ethanol were selected as a desorption eluent due to its high solubility for organic contaminants subsequently the solid phase was again separated and submitted to the adsorption desorption cycle in a shaker equipment the procedure described was repeated five times evaluating the removal percentages and the adsorption capacities for five go mcs oc reuses 2 10 selectivity evaluation the selectivity parameter for go mcs oc was evaluated through tests with binary solutions of ee2 and bpa bpa is another emerging contaminant related to industrial activity but it can also be found in wastewater along with ee2 65 the assays were carried out in triplicate for systems with 5 ml of solution nanoadsorbent dosage of 0 2 mg ml 1 and temperature of 30 c initial concentrations of ee2 and bpa were adjusted and three different conditions were evaluated the first condition showed a predominance of ee2 0 016 and 0 009 mmol l 1 the second showed a predominance of bpa 0 01 and 0 017 mmol l

results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc n2 isotherms and pore distribution for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc were evaluated using the bet and bjh method and shown in fig 1 the isotherms obtained are classified as type ii which are characteristics of non porous and macroporous materials 66 68 the transition from monolayer to multilayer adsorption was observed from the first inflection point and the beginning of the linear behavior low relative pressure corroborating the small amount of micropores 67 68 hysteresis phenomenon was observed in desorption being classified as type h3 and typical of aggregates of plate like particles and macroporous systems that are not completely filled 69 table 1 summarizes the structural properties and pore volume information for pristine and contaminated material both samples showed an inflection point at relative pressure close to 0 2 having adsorbed 4 5 cm3 g 1 of n2 in pristine material and 3 7 cm3 g 1 in contaminated material this first range is related to the volume of micropores and suggests that even in small quantities some of them were occupied by ee2 after the inflection point both curves have a slow linear growth until the relative pressure of 0 8 indicating the predominance of mesopores after the relative pressure of 0 8 the curves showed a sharp increase representing the presence of macropores in the material 70 72 the pore size distribution corroborated with the isotherm behavior showing presence of micropores however presenting a larger range corresponding to mesopores and macropores the increase in the volume adsorbed to larger pores of the contaminated material suggests surface changes with deposition of the contaminant the average pore diameter of go mcs oc was 9 8 nm showing a slight increase 13 2 nm with the contamination process the surface area of the prepared nanocomposite was 17 8 m2 g 1 and after contamination decreased to 13 2 m2 g 1 indicating that part of the surface was occupied by the adsorbate thermogravimetric curves of pristine and contaminated nanocomposite are illustrated in fig 2 both materials showed a decrease in the initial percentage related to water loss and subsequently there was a more evident loss of mass from 200 c which intensified as the temperature increased the most intense mass loss occurred in the range between 200 and 500 c and this is related to the degradation of oxygenated groups present in go glycosidic units of chitosan and iron nanoparticles 73 75 the samples lost mass with less intensity from this range resulting in a final degradation 1000 c of 49 0 and 44 9 for pristine and contaminated samples respectively despite the behavior of both samples being similar the contaminated sample showed a slightly higher degradation than the non contaminated sample which may be associated with the increase of ee2 in the nanocomposite structure the crystallinity of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc was evaluated from x ray patterns shown in fig 3 the materials presented amorphous characteristics as well as the presence of some crystalline peaks similar to those presented for the organophilic clay spectrogel which was used in nanocomposite synthesis 76 77 the interplanar distances were evaluated using bragg s law and showed that basal spaces of the material did not change significantly after ee2 adsorption the interplanar distance found was 1 3 and 1 26 nm for pristine and contaminated nanocomposite being a value close to that expected for bentonite clays 1 5 nm 76 the angles of 6 8 9 5 20 24 6 26 5 27 8 30 2 35 5 43 5 44 6 53 9 57 1 62 9 e 74 3 showed prominent peaks in pristine sample being very close to peaks observed after contamination some peaks that were identified are characteristic of clayey materials such as montmorillonite 20 0 44 nm kaolinite 24 6 0 36 nm quartz 26 5 27 8 and 35 5 0 33 0 32 and 0 25 nm and mica 44 6 0 20 nm 77 79 the mineral morphology of dioctahedral conformation is related to the highlighted peak at 0 15 nm 79 the diffractograms also showed some peaks that are characteristic of chitosan magnetized with fe3o4 that stood out at 30 2 35 5 43 5 53 9 57 1 and 62 9 nm and represent the bragg s diffraction planes 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 80 81 the peak that appears at 10 0 94 nm may be related to go sheets intercalated within the clay interlayer and its decrease in contaminated sample is an indication of its reorganization and its participation in the adsorption process 81 46 the structural changes of the go pristine and contaminated go mcs oc was evaluated from raman spectroscopy and their spectra are shown in fig 4 the most common bands related to graphene oxide materials are the d and g bands the d band represents imperfections in the aromatic structure of go being related to sp3 hybridized carbon bonds such as hydroxyl and epoxy bonds in the basal plane the g band represents the layer of sp2 hybridized carbons being related to the aromatic structure of go 82 83 the intensity ratio between the d and g bands id ig reflects the degree of imperfection of the go graphitic layer 84 the go spectrum showed d and g bands located at 1343 and 1585 cm 1 and an id ig of 0 981 after the nanocomposite synthesis process a loss of intensity of the d and g bands was observed which may be related to the heterogeneous characteristic of the material so that the presence of mineral portion impacts the intensity of the spectrum the pristine go mcs oc spectrum showed a red shift in the d and g bands compared to go and were located at 1365 and 1590 cm 1 however the id ig remained identical to go the identification of the d and g bands and the similarity of id ig in the nanocomposite spectrum suggests the presence of pristine go in its structure and that the nanomaterial was not destroyed in the nanocomposite synthesis 85 86 the spectrum of contaminated go mcs oc also revealed a red shift of the d and g bands in relation to go being located at 1365 and 1590 cm 1 the id ig of the contaminated nanocomposite was 1 004 which is superior to go and pristine go mcs oc denoting a greater presence of imperfections in the aromatic structure after the adsorption process pristine and contaminated go mcs oc samples were verified by x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps seeking to understand the chemical state of elements and measure the functional groups present in the samples survey spectra analysis of the pristine nanocomposite fig 5 showed the presence of carbon 70 1 and oxygen 21 9 in larger quantities as well as small traces of silica 3 8 aluminum 1 4 nitrogen 1 3 iron 1 2 and sodium 0 2 after contamination the spectrum did not show significant changes in percentages high resolution spectra of c 1s for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are shown in fig 6 a the uncontaminated go mcs oc spectrum revealed peaks at 284 7 285 8 286 8 288 5 and 289 7 ev corresponding to the bonds cc ch 55 5 cn coh 22 co cnh2 11 oco 10 6 and π π interactions 0 9 between aromatic rings of go respectively 87 90 after contamination with ee2 fig 6 b the binding energies changed to 284 5 285 5 286 8 and 288 3 ev with different percentages for their representatives 50 5 27 8 15 7 and 6 respectively the peak related to π π interactions was not identified after contamination suggesting that the nanocomposite interacts via π π interactions with the aromatic ring of ee2 91 the contaminated sample showed a shift of the peaks related to cc ch cn coh and oco bonds to lower binding energies this modification suggests an increase in electronic density due to the displacement of electrons on the nanocomposite surface 92 the decrease in these binding energies indicates that interactions via hydrogen bonding may be occurring between the hydroxyls present in ee2 and the cn coh and oco groups of the nanocomposite 93 high resolution spectra of o 1s for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are illustrated in fig 6 c and d the uncontaminated go mcs oc spectrum revealed peaks at 530 2 531 7 and 533 2 ev corresponding to anionic oxygen of fe3o4 12 9 co oco alo binding 52 4 and coh sioh bond 34 7 respectively 87 94 96 after contamination the spectrum showed peaks at the binding energies of 530 1 531 5 and 532 8 ev with different percentages for their representatives 23 3 45 and 31 7 respectively the discrete decrease in binding energies for o 1s indicates that oxygenated groups are involved in ee2 adsorption mechanisms 92 high resolution spectra of n 1s region for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are illustrated in fig 6 e and f the crude sample showed peaks for binding energies of 399 8 and 402 1 ev that correspond to amines primary and tertiary and amides 53 3 and to protonated amines 46 7 97 98 respectively the contaminated sample presented peaks at binding energies of 399 7 and 401 9 ev with different percentages 71 5 and 28 5 the variations in binding energy and percentages indicate that amines and protonated amines present in nanocomposite through chitosan act in ee2 adsorption process possibly due to the reception and donation of hydrogen bonding 93 the hydroxyls present in the nanocomposite can also act as hydrogen bond donors like protonated amines on the other hand non protonated amines and carboxylate groups can act as hydrogen bond receptors supporting that this type of interaction is relevant between go mcs oc and ee2 high resolution spectra of fe 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples very similar peaks with binding energies of 710 2 711 9 723 7 and 725 4 ev the first peak is related to the coexistence of fe2 and fe3 in the 2p3 2 oxidation state the second is related to fe3 in the 2p3 2 oxidation state the third is related to fe2 in the 2p1 2 oxidation state and the fourth indicates fe3 in the 2p1 2 oxidation state 94 this range of peaks is also related to the success in combining chitosan and fe3o4 99 high resolution spectra of si 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples identical peaks with binding energies of 101 8 and 102 8 ev that are related to si3 and si4 respectively which compose the clay layers 96 a peak close to 1072 ev was identified in both samples and both are related to residual na 1s that were not organophilized and that are ionized in the clay interlayer 100 high resolution spectra of al 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples very close peaks with binding energies of 73 8 and 74 8 ev which are related to octahedrally ordered aluminum in the clay layers 101 similar peaks before and after adsorption demonstrate that iron silicon sodium and aluminum do not play an important role in interactions between go mcs oc and ee2 ftir spectra of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are highlighted in fig 7 pristine nanocomposite showed several notable bands throughout the spectrum 4000 450 cm 1 the bands that stood out at 3620 and 3371 cm 1 represent nh and oh elongations that come from the amines present in chitosan and from the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids and the alcohol group that are mainly present in go 80 102 the bands found at 2923 and 2850 cm 1 represent asymmetric and symmetrical ch elongations present in the aromatized groups of chitosan and go as well as in the alkylammonium cations that give the clay an organophilic character 76 103 the highlighted bands at 1641 and 1567 cm 1 represent co and nh elongations respectively being related to the go carboxylates and to chitosan amines 102 103 the bands that stood out at 1468 1377 and 1303 cm 1 are related to cn elongations representing amines that are on chitosan surface and can react with epoxy and carboxylate groups of go to form amides which are also related with this stretch 80 104 105 the highlight band at 1045 cm 1 is related to sio stretches present in organoclay as well as epoxy groups located in the basal plane of go 77 106 107 the bands located between 950 and 800 cm 1 are related to oh stretches in the mineral layer as well as the bands of 600 450 cm 1 represent sioal and siosi bonds 76 77 the peak located at 521 cm 1 is also related to feo bonds that represent chitosan magnetization 80 108 the nanocomposite before adsorption showed similar bands to contaminated material although in some cases displaced and less intense the band related to nh bond which was already overshadowed by oh band was not evident after adsorption even with the band related to the hydroxyl group being wider and displaced to 3410 cm 1 the decrease in intensity and the red shift of the hydroxyl related peak indicates presence of hydrogen bonds this functional group acts as hydrogen donor and possibly the aromatic ring and oxygens present in ee2 molecule act as hydrogen acceptors 109 the bands between 1650 and 1300 cm 1 as well as the band at 1045 cm 1 showed significant loss of intensity corroborating the evidence that oxygenated groups originated mainly from go and chitosan and nitrogen groups from amines and possibly formed amides participate in ee2 adsorption mechanisms the analysis of xps and ftir spectra of pristine and contaminated sample showed that hydrogen bonds and π π interactions are present in ee2 adsorption process on go mcs oc surface the proposed interactions between the functional groups present on the nanocomposite surface and ee2 molecule are illustrated in fig 8 sem micrographs of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are shown in fig 9 the micrographics from samples before and after the adsorption process were similar indicating that the removal of ee2 did not change the material structure the surface of go mcs oc was heterogeneous showing points of higher density that indicate the presence of clay as well as intercalated lamellar structures confirming the presence of go sheets 3 2 effects of nanoadsorbent dosage ph and sonication time the positive effect of nanoadsorbent dosage on ee2 removal was evident in fig 10 a while the value of adsorption capacity decreases with the increase of the nanoadsorbent mass similar results on the effect of dosage in relation to adsorption capacity and percentage of removal were also observed for other nanoadsorbents 110 111 the system presented a maximum removal percentage of 89 8 at a dosage of 0 35 mg ml 1 and a maximum adsorption capacity of 50 5 mg g 1 at a dosage of 0 05 mg ml 1 the increase in dosage resulted in a significant increase in removal up to 0 25 mg ml 1 so from that point on the results were statistically similar according to turkey test with a 5 significance level fig 10 b illustrates the effect of solution ph on ee2 adsorption process by go mcs oc the removal percentage had a decrease from ph 3 to ph 4 and a slight increase from ph 4 to ph 8 however according to turkey test the results were statistically equivalent with a 5 significance level except between ph 4 and 8 sonication time is a parameter widely evaluated in nanomaterial suspensions and implies the exfoliation of graphene materials which can increase stability and surface area 81 the effect of sonication time of go mcs oc suspensions on ee2 removal is illustrated in fig 10 c the results indicated superior performance when the system was not submitted to ultrasonic bath and a decrease in efficiency with increasing sonication time these results revealed that the nanocomposite sheets can suffer fragmentation with the procedure compromising some interactions that help in adsorption process 112 the evaluation of this parameter by turkey test with a 5 significance level demonstrated that the application of the ultrasonic bath resulted in statistically similar removal efficiencies 3 3 adsorption kinetics the kinetic curves of ee2 adsorption by go mcs oc for different initial concentrations of adsorbate are shown in fig 11 the increase in adsorption capacity with the increase in initial concentration of ee2 is evidenced ee2 was quickly removed in the first 30 min of the process followed by slower removal kinetics until the equilibrium plateau which was reached in about 120 min the adsorption capacities at equilibrium were 0 131 0 098 and 0 061 mmol g 1 38 8 29 2 and 18 2 mg g 1 for initial concentrations of 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 mmol l 1 respectively literature presents great variation in the equilibrium time for ee2 adsorption kinetic assays depending on the type of adsorbent and the initial concentration evaluated han et al 113 reported equilibrium after 60 min in polyamides whereas lai et al 114 reported that equilibrium was reached after 10 h using heat treated plastic waste 113 114 zhang et al 115 also reported a kinetic equilibrium around 120 min for a copper sulfide based nanomaterial 115 thus the developed nanocomposite showed relatively fast kinetics and is within the range found in the literature pfo and pso kinetic models as well as boyd and ip diffusion models were applied to experimental data seeking to describe adsorption mechanisms the models and adjustment parameters are organized in table 2 the pseudo second order model exhibited q e values closer to experimental ones and better represented the adsorption kinetic behavior for all concentrations the upper value of adjusted coefficient of determination as well as the lower value of reduced chi squared and corrected akaike criterion corroborated with a better fit of pso model to experimental data this fact indicates that chemisorption may be involved in adsorption mechanism of ee2 on go mcs oc 116 as reported in the adsorption of this contaminant by other materials 113 114 117 the presence of chemisorption corroborates the hydrogen bonds that were proposed by characterizations 118 the intraparticle and boyd diffusion models are based on the resistance to mass transfer and were applied to experimental data for a better understanding of the limiting step of the process the ip model presented a multilinear profile separated into three stages for all concentrations evaluated the three regions represent external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and equilibrium 119 the second region suggests the presence of intraparticle diffusion step however the low adjustment and the constant c value greater than zero indicate that this is not the adsorption limiting step 120 the non linear profile of endpoints presented by boyd model and its straight line not crossing the origin corroborate the ip model hypothesis the evaluation of diffusion models suggests the existence of a stage of resistance to mass transfer in external film 58 3 4 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium models of langmuir freundlich and bet were fitted to experimental data of the equilibrium isotherms of ee2 adsorption by go mcs oc obtained at 30 40 and 50 c fig 12 the positive effect of temperature is pronounced revealing the endothermic character and that adsorption can occur via chemisorption or by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption 121 similar behavior was also observed in ee2 removal by another reduced graphene oxide magnetic nanocomposite 122 the positive effect of temperature is pronounced for smaller dosages however with increasing dosage lower values of equilibrium concentration in fluid phase this influence becomes less expressive in the values of q table 3 grouped the parameters of langmuir freundlich and bet models that were fitted to experimental data isotherms profiles shown in fig 12 indicate that the material is not completely saturated with the decrease in nanoadsorbent mass suggesting that the adsorbate is deposited in multilayers the difference between q max values proposed by langmuir model and experimental ones corroborates with this statement since this model considers homogeneous surface and monolayer adsorption 123 although the values of r 2 adj for langmuir and freundlich model are similar the lower values of χ 2 red and aic c for freundlich model are indicative of multilayer physisorption on a heterogeneous surface 124 values of n less than 1 indicate low energy interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent which are also characteristic of physical interactions 125 the experimental behavior was better represented by the bet model implying more satisfactory values of r 2 adj e χ 2 red despite better representing experimental data the corrected akaike criterion for bet model presents a slightly higher value at some temperatures because the model presents one more adjustment parameter than langmuir and freundlich models the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity represented by q b was about 30 mg g 1 however this value differs from maximum adsorption capacity that tends to grow with formation of multilayers 62 126 the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and physical interactions in ee2 removal by go mcs oc is supported by kinetic tests and by favoring adsorption with increasing temperature chemical interactions as well as by the evidence presented in freundlich and bet models physical interactions table 4 summarizes and compares the maximum adsorption capacity observed for go mcs oc with other adsorbents reported in literature go mcs oc showed superior performance to several advanced adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes polyamides and reduced graphene oxide indicating that it is a promising material for the removal of ee2 from aqueous media 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters of ee2 adsorption in go mcs oc were evaluated and are summarized in table 5 henry s law was applied in the infinite dilution region and parameters were calculated from the graph of ln k d vs 1 t the positive value of enthalpy variation h 0 indicates that ee2 adsorption on go mcs oc has an endothermic nature therefore it is favored by temperature the increase in activation energy with increasing temperature also indicates the endothermic profile of the system values of h 0 in the range between 2 and 21 kj mol 1 are related to systems governed by physical adsorption while values between 80 and 200 kj mol 1 are related to chemical adsorption processes 132 intermediate values are related to systems wherein both interactions take place however the proximity between 21 e 32 kj mol 1 indicates predominance of physisorption the occurrence of physisorption corroborates the presence of π π interactions between the aromatics of nanoadsorbent and adsorbate 133 positive values of entropy variation s 0 indicate an increase in system disorder and the presence of dissociative mechanisms in the adsorption process 132 negative values of variation of gibbs energy and its decrease with increasing temperature suggest that the process is spontaneous and favored by the increase in temperature 134 the proposed adsorbate adsorbent system is controlled by entropy changes because for all temperatures tδs 0 h 0 revealing that the system entropy has more influence on the ee2 adsorption process the endothermic and spontaneous profile as well as the tendency for physical adsorption of ee2 were reported in the literature for some materials such as metal organic framework and reduced graphene oxide magnetic composite 117 122 the adsorption of ee2 on nano copper sulfide showed evidence of chemical interactions while its adsorption on carbon nanotubes showed an exothermic nature 115 127 3 6 designing a simplified bath adsorption system the simplified batch design for go mcs oc ee2 system estimated the amount of nanocomposite needed to remove 50 70 and 90 of the microcontaminant from the aqueous medium fig 13 with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 the bet model was used due to its better fit to equilibrium data to estimate the values of q e in a simplified batch system there is a linear relationship between effluent volume and nanocomposite mass for all evaluated efficiencies for 1000 l of effluent with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 112 194 and 373 g of nanocomposite are needed to remove 50 70 and 90 of ee2 respectively de farias et al 135 proposed a similar batch system for removing bisphenol a another emerging contaminant and a considerably superior performance was observed for go mcs oc nanocomposite the study used the same organoclay applied in nanocomposite synthesis however to remove 90 of bpa in 1000 l of solution with 1 mmol l 1 a mass 20 times greater was required than those calculated in the work 135 coelho et al 136 also proposed a batch system using a bioadsorbent obtained from residual algae to remove propranolol hydrochloride another drug considered an emerging contaminant the system presented required 18 4 g of bioadsorbent to remove 90 of the contaminant from only 10 l of solutions with 1 mmol l 1 136 a direct comparison of these systems reported for bpa and propranolol with the present study is not possible as they are different adsorbates and the studies were carried out at different concentrations 3 7 isosteric heat of adsorption the isosteres obtained for different values of constant surface coverage q e were illustrated in fig 14 the values of q e chosen for the evaluation of isosteric heat of adsorption were 16 3 32 4 39 and 49 5 mg g 1 and their values are shown in table 6 the h iso values obtained were 19 33 23 95 9 62 and 3 15 kj mol 1 for q and 49 5 39 32 4 and 16 3 mg g 1 the variation of isosteric heat values indicates that the nanocomposite surface is energetically heterogeneous 137 furthermore its values below 80 kj mol 1 indicate that the adsorption process is governed by physical mechanisms 137 the results corroborate with experimental data that were better represented freundlich and bet models also denoting the heterogeneous characteristic and the energetic non uniformity of the active sites 3 8 regeneration cycles in bath the reuse of go mcs oc was investigated for five cycles to remove ee2 evaluating acetonitrile and ethanol as eluents fig 15 removal efficiency and adsorption capacity using acetonitrile as eluent decreased from 74 9 and 36 5 mg g 1 to 46 7 and 20 mg g 1 in the fifth adsorptive cycle in its turn using ethanol as eluent the same response variables decreased from 68 9 and 30 8 mg g 1 to 32 1 and 14 4 mg g 1 in the fifth adsorptive cycle respectively in comparison with the results obtained under the same conditions in the equilibrium tests 69 3 and 30 8 mg g 1 the regeneration of go mcs oc using acetonitrile as eluent presented a satisfactory performance compared to the initial for the first two cycles decreasing only from the third adsorptive cycle the regeneration of go mcs oc using ethanol showed a lower performance compared to acetonitrile and a significant decrease from the second cycle the decrease in go mcs oc regenerability may be related to the shear force which alters the structure and reduces the number of active sites and to the loss of mass of the nanocomposite due to its reuse for five consecutive cycles the results indicated that the synthesized nanocomposite is a potential adsorbent for ee2 removal in up to two cycles losing up to about 40 of its ee2 adsorptive capacity thereafter 3 9 selectivity evaluation the selectivity of the nanocomposite was evaluated for three different initial concentration conditions in binary solutions of ee2 and bpa fig 16 in the condition with the highest amount of ee2 the tests showed removal percentages of 84 9 and 67 5 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 069 and 0 030 mmol l 1 20 5 and 6 9 mg g 1 respectively in the solution with the highest amount of bpa a removal percentage of 82 4 and 64 7 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 044 and 0 055 mmol l 1 13 1 and 12 7 mg g 1 were observed respectively in the equimolar solution a removal percentage of 89 3 and 73 2 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 048 and 0 039 mmol l 1 14 2 and 8 8 mg g 1 were obtained respectively all conditions evaluated showed satisfactory removal percentages and adsorption capacities for both emerging contaminants removal percentages and adsorption capacities for ee2 were higher than for bpa in all evaluated conditions except in the condition where bpa was predominant under these conditions although the percentage of removal of ee2 is higher its adsorption capacity was lower than bpa adsorption capacity due to the excess of this contaminant in the medium implying a greater adsorbed amount selectivity assays demonstrated that go mcs oc interacts better with ee2 than with bpa the distribution coefficient k ee2 and k bpa and selectivity coefficient k ee2 bpa are shown in table 7 k ee2 bpa values greater than 1 indicate more selective adsorption for ee2 than bpa k ee2 bpa values greater than 1 and close to unity even in the condition where bpa was more abundant suggest that the surface of go mcs oc presents higher affinity with ee2 bpa and ee2 molecules fig 17 have the same number of ionizable hydroxyls that theoretically are involved in hydrogen bonds on the other hand the bpa molecule has one more aromatic than the ee2 molecule which should cause a greater possibility of π π interactions although there are satisfactory affinities of the material for adsorption of both ee2 and bpa its preference for ee2 is notable a possible explanation for this may be related to the angular conformation of the bpa molecule which can impair its physisorption in multilayers even though the ee2 molecule is bigger than that of bpa its flatter conformation seems to favor its deposition onto the go mcs oc surface 4 conclusions the synthesized nanocomposite go mcs oc showed satisfactory performance in removing ee2 from the aqueous medium the large adsorption capacity reached even with a small dose of adsorbent and low concentration of adsorbate suggests go mcs oc as a promising material for environmental application the nitrogen physisorption isotherms obtained were type ii and are typical of meso and macroporous materials the original material had a surface area of 17 8 m2 g 1 which was partially reduced after the adsorption process 13 2 m2 g 1 xrd spectra and sem micrographs showed a heterogeneous structure of the prepared nanocomposite raman analysis showed the structural changes of go and of the raw and contaminated go mcs oc indicating an increase in imperfections in the nanocomposite structure after the contamination process xps and ftir analyses provided information on predominant functional groups and bonds in nanocomposite structure revealing that oxygenated and nitrogenated groups as well as aromatic structure participate in the ee2 capture through hydrogen bonds and π π interactions the models fitted to kinetic data indicated that chemisorption was present corroborating hydrogen bonds and that external mass transfer was the main step in the adsorption process equilibrium isotherms showed an endothermic profile for the system being also indicative of the presence of chemisorption bet and freundlich models fitted the equilibrium data well suggesting that the material has heterogeneous characteristics and that there is formation of multilayers through physisorption corroborating π π interactions highlighted in the process the maximum experimental adsorption capacity obtained for go mcs oc at 30 c was 50 5 mg g 1 while the bet model predicted a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 30 7 mg g 1 this difference in the maximum adsorbed amount also corroborates the coexistence of chemisorption and physisorption although both types of interactions are present in ee2 adsorption process in go mcs oc the values of freundlich s n factor enthalpy variation and isosteric heat suggest a predominance of physical interactions the design of the simplified batch system showed the possibility of treating large volumes of effluent with a small amount of nanocomposite go mcs oc nanocomposite showed satisfactory regeneration performance using acetonitrile as eluent through two successive adsorptions reducing up to 40 of its capacity until the fifth cycle the selectivity tests displayed the best performance of ee2 against bpa in addition to an ability to remove a large percentage of both even in a binary system the set of results indicates the go mcs oc as a promising adsorbent technology for removal of emerging contaminants with impactful benefits for the environment and suggests the evaluation of this material in more complex real aqueous

13041,17α ethinylestradiol ee2 is a synthetic estrogen present in contraceptive pills being considered an emerging contaminant in this work ee2 adsorption process in a nanocomposite of graphene oxide magnetic chitosan and organophilic clay go mcs oc was evaluated the nanocomposite was characterized by nitrogen physisorption thermogravimetry x ray diffraction x ray photoelectric spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy the effects of dosage sonication time and ph on the process were assessed kinetics equilibrium thermodynamics and reusability tests of ee2 adsorption onto go mcs oc were investigated the adsorptive kinetics of ee2 followed a pseudo second order model while the equilibrium was better represented by the bet model with a characteristic profile of multilayer physisorption thermodynamics suggested that the process was spontaneous and endothermic adsorption mechanisms were assessed indicating an important role of oxygenated and nitrogenated functional groups as well as the aromatic structure of the go mcs oc promoting h bonds and π π interactions the nanoadsorbent had a maximum experimental capacity of 50 5 mg g 1 30 c the selectivity of the nanocomposite in binary solutions with bisphenol a bpa revealed satisfactory removal efficiency good selectivity and material stability the go oc nanocomposite showed reuse potential for two consecutive cycles decreasing its capacity until the fifth adsorptive cycle finally the developed nanocomposite proved to be a promising alternative for removing emerging contaminants from aquatic matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption 17α ethinylestradiol nanocomposite graphene oxide emerging contaminant 1 introduction emerging contaminants belong to a category of pollutants that comprises new compounds that appear as well as known molecules but whose impact is not fully understood 1 pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial products microplastics surfactants illicit drugs disinfection products among other organic contaminants can be classified as emerging contaminants 2 3 this group of pollutants has been attracting the world s attention due to its great impact on human health and its risk to the ecosystem even at low concentrations 4 a fact that heightens the concern with this problem nowadays is the absence of specific regulations for many of these contaminants and quality standards that define their acceptable safe levels for society 4 another aggravating factor is that conventional effluent treatments often do not efficiently remove the various emerging contaminants that have very different chemical properties and make a unique and effective treatment difficult 5 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 is an emerging contaminant classified as synthetic estrogen with high estrogen potential and for this reason it is present in most commercial oral contraceptives 6 the rise in the use of this substance over the years results in increasingly concentrated anthropogenic waste arriving at wastewater treatment plants 7 incomplete removal of ee2 by conventional treatments contributes to its accumulation in the environment and causes serious environmental damages 8 its lipophilic characteristic shows a tendency of accumulation in animal fats that causes damages such as feminization reduced fertility and increased fish mortality in addition to endocrine dysfunction in humans 6 9 despite the difficult monitoring of emerging contaminants ee2 has already been identified in surface waters of more than 32 countries with great variability in its concentrations but with a tendency to occur more frequently in underdeveloped countries 10 even with all the concern related to this drug existing regulations are only related to its occurrence levels in drinking water such as the japanese drinking water quality standard and the environmental quality standard promoted by japan and the european union respectively 10 the lack of monitoring and regulation for this class of contaminants also contributes to the fact that more expensive and efficient treatments do not replace conventional treatments several procedures are investigated in order to efficiently remove emerging contaminants from water among them are bioremediation 11 12 advanced oxidative processes 13 16 membrane 17 18 photocatalysis 19 20 and adsorption 21 22 membrane and oxidation treatments present high efficiency however with high cost and problems of fouling and release of toxic end products respectively 23 25 adsorption stands out among the alternatives due to its easy operation low cost high efficiency and mainly due to the great diversity of adsorbent materials 26 28 the structural variety available for adsorbent materials allows for different types of interactions that may favor the removal of a contaminant of interest the removal of emerging contaminants via adsorption has been investigated in several materials such as modified biochar 29 30 activated biochar 15 16 31 alumina 32 zeolites 33 clays 34 35 organoclays 36 37 metal organic frameworks 38 39 etc the adsorption process in each material presents particularities and differences that are related to different types of interactions obtained for different adsorbate adsorbent systems nanoadsorbents have been extensively investigated due to their particularities and advantages in environmental application in general nanoadsorbents have a large surface area and atoms with high reactivity are disposed on its surface 40 several experimental works are presenting nanometric materials such as carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide go to remove pharmaceuticals from water 41 43 graphene oxide is a nanomaterial derived from graphene that has a large specific area and different oxygenated groups available on its surface hydroxyl carboxyl and epoxy 44 materials based on graphene oxide have been constantly developed through the formation of nanocomposites with different materials such as organophilic clays and chitosan 45 46 the formation of the nanocomposite seeks to take advantage of the particular characteristics of precursor materials and improve their adsorption capacity 47 48 organoclays are materials that have undergone a modification process through the insertion of surfactant compounds that creates a hydrophobic surface on the clay which easily interacts with organic contaminants 49 chitosan is a natural biopolymer abundant in the world that has low cost and good adsorption capacity for different types of adsorbates 50 the amines and hydroxyls present on its surface are very important and have crucial contributions in the adsorption process 50 there are several reports in the literature of chitosan modifications by the insertion of fe3o4 nanoparticles to obtain composites with magnetic properties that facilitate its reuse and its separation from the system 51 52 in this work the adsorption of ee2 by the nanocomposite synthesized from graphene oxide chitosan and organophilic clay go mcs oc was investigated the adsorption study included the evaluation of operating parameters kinetic equilibrium and thermodynamic studies as well as the design of a simplified batch system reusability tests and an evaluation of the selectivity of the nanocomposite by ee2 in relation to bpa another emerging contaminant the pristine and contaminated nanocomposite was characterized by n2 physisorption analysis at 77 k bet thermogravimetry tga x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem few studies reported the removal of ee2 from aquatic matrices and much less involving its removal by a nanocomposite with these characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 materials and reagents the mineral graphite and the organophilic clay spectrogel

heated from 25 to 1000 c with a heating rate of 20 c min 1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml min 1 the crystallinity of pristine and contaminated nanoadsorbent was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd

evaluated amplitudes between 450 and 4000 cm 1 surface micrographs of pristine and contaminated nanocomposite were obtained by scanning electron microscopy using vega 3 equipment tescan brun czech republic 2 3 effects of nanoadsorbent dosage ph and sonication time the effects of important parameters such as dosage of go mcs oc ph and sonication time in the adsorption process were assessed all tests were carried out in triplicate in 5 ml of 0 03 mmol l 1 8 9 mg l 1 solution the experiments were performed under constant agitation at 200 rpm and 30 c for 12 h the dosage of go mcs oc was evaluated in the range between 0 05 and 0 35 mg ml 1 the initial ph values were adjusted with hcl and naoh 0 1 mmol l 1 and evaluated in the range between 3 and 8 the sonication time parameter was evaluated to 0 no sonication treatment 1 5 and 30 min after each test the samples were subjected to a magnetic field so that most of go mcs oc was removed the magnetic characteristics of the nanocomposite were previously described 54 to ensure the complete removal of the nanocomposite samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min and subjected to syringe filters 0 45 μm ptfe ee2

the equilibrium study for different temperatures allows calculating the thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process the equilibrium thermodynamic constant k d was determined from henry s law which was applied in the infinite dilution region of each temperature eq 13 the modification proposed by milonjić was applied to k d seeking to make it dimensionless for application in the van t hoff equation eq 15 64 the parameters of gibbs energy variation g 0 enthalpy variation h 0 entropy variation s 0 and activation energy e a were determined by eqs 14 15 and 16 13 q e k d c e 14 g 0 rtln k c 15 ln k c s 0 r h 0 rt 16 e a h 0 rt wherein k c represents the dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant r the ideal gas constant and t k the experimental temperatures 2 7 designing a simplified batch adsorption system a simplified batch system was designed to measure the amount of nanoadsorbent required to achieve different percentages of ee2 removal the estimate was based on a mass balance for a batch system and is represented by eq 17 17 v c 0 c 1 m q 1 q 0 some considerations were made to estimate the mass of go mcs oc such as considering the absence of ee2 initially in nanocomposite considering the concentration in fluid phase equal to equilibrium as well as considering the amount adsorbed on solid phase the amount adsorbed on equilibrium in this way eq 17 becomes eq 18 18 v c 0 c e m q e the nanocomposite mass required was evaluated for a solution volume range between 10 and 1000 l with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 and removal percentages of 50 70 and 90 the data obtained at 30 c closer to room temperature and the best fit model to the experimental data were considered for this system 2 8 isosteric heat of adsorption some characteristics about uniformity of the adsorbent surface can be evaluated through the isosteric heat of adsorption h iso the adsorption heat is compared on a limited surface for different temperatures so that energetic

9 regeneration cycles in batch go mcs oc reuse tests for ee2 removal were evaluated for five adsorption desorption cycles in a batch system in each cycle 25 ml of solution of initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 were treated with 5 mg of go mcs oc after 180 min of agitation at 200 rpm in shaker equipment at 30 c the solid phase was separated through centrifugation and magnets and the concentration of the aliquots was measured as previously described 3 ml of acetonitrile or ethanol were added to the solid phase and the system was subjected to a 3 min of ultrasonic bath acetonitrile and ethanol were selected as a desorption eluent due to its high solubility for organic contaminants subsequently the solid phase was again separated and submitted to the adsorption desorption cycle in a shaker equipment the procedure described was repeated five times evaluating the removal percentages and the adsorption capacities for five go mcs oc reuses 2 10 selectivity evaluation the selectivity parameter for go mcs oc was evaluated through tests with binary solutions of ee2 and bpa bpa is another emerging contaminant related to industrial activity but it can also be found in wastewater along with ee2 65 the assays were carried out in triplicate for systems with 5 ml of solution nanoadsorbent dosage of 0 2 mg ml 1 and temperature of 30 c initial concentrations of ee2 and bpa were adjusted and three different conditions were evaluated the first condition showed a predominance of ee2 0 016 and 0 009 mmol l 1 the second showed a predominance of bpa 0 01 and 0 017 mmol l 1 while the third was an equimolar solution 0 01 mmol l 1 the samples were shaken for 300 min then pre treated and their concentration measured as described previously the analytical method for evaluating bpa on hplc was validated under the same conditions as ee2 the distribution coefficients k ee2 e k bpa and selectivity coefficients k ee2 bpa are described in eqs 20 and 21 20 k q e c e 21 k ee 2 bpa k ee 2 k bpa wherein k ee2 e k bpa l g 1 represent the distribution coefficients of each emerging contaminant and k ee2 bpa represents the selectivity coefficient of the proposed system 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc n2 isotherms and pore distribution for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc were evaluated using the bet and bjh method and shown in fig 1 the isotherms obtained are classified as type ii which are characteristics of non porous and macroporous materials 66 68 the transition from monolayer to multilayer adsorption was observed from the first inflection point and the beginning of the linear behavior low relative pressure corroborating the small amount of micropores 67 68 hysteresis phenomenon was observed in desorption being classified as type h3 and typical of aggregates of plate like particles and macroporous systems that are not completely filled 69 table 1 summarizes the structural properties and pore volume information for pristine and contaminated material both samples showed an inflection point at relative pressure close to 0 2 having adsorbed 4 5 cm3 g 1 of n2 in pristine material and 3 7 cm3 g 1 in contaminated material this first range is related to the volume of micropores and suggests that even in small quantities some of them were occupied by ee2 after the inflection point both curves have a slow linear growth until the relative pressure of 0 8 indicating the predominance of mesopores after the relative pressure of 0 8 the curves showed a sharp increase representing the presence of macropores in the material 70 72 the pore size distribution corroborated with the isotherm behavior showing presence of micropores however presenting a larger range corresponding to mesopores and macropores the increase in the volume adsorbed to larger pores of the contaminated material suggests surface changes with deposition of the contaminant the average pore diameter of go mcs oc was 9 8 nm showing a slight increase 13 2 nm with the contamination process the surface area of the prepared nanocomposite was 17 8 m2 g 1 and after contamination decreased to 13 2 m2 g 1 indicating that part of the surface was occupied by the adsorbate thermogravimetric curves of pristine and contaminated nanocomposite are illustrated in fig 2 both materials showed a decrease in the initial percentage related to water loss and subsequently there was a more evident loss of mass from 200 c which intensified as the temperature increased the most intense mass loss occurred in the range between 200 and 500 c and this is related to the degradation of oxygenated groups present in go glycosidic units of chitosan and iron nanoparticles 73 75 the samples lost mass with less intensity from this range resulting in a final degradation 1000 c of 49 0 and 44 9 for pristine and contaminated samples respectively despite the behavior of both samples being similar the contaminated sample showed a slightly higher degradation than the non contaminated sample which may be associated with the increase of ee2 in the nanocomposite structure the crystallinity of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc was evaluated from x ray patterns shown in fig 3 the materials presented amorphous characteristics as well as the presence of some crystalline peaks similar to those presented for the organophilic clay spectrogel which was used in nanocomposite synthesis 76 77 the interplanar distances were evaluated using bragg s law and showed that basal spaces of the material did not change significantly after ee2 adsorption the interplanar distance found was 1 3 and 1 26 nm for pristine and contaminated nanocomposite being a value close to that expected for bentonite clays 1 5 nm 76 the angles of 6 8 9 5 20 24 6 26 5 27 8 30 2 35 5 43 5 44 6 53 9 57 1 62 9 e 74 3 showed prominent peaks in pristine sample being very close to peaks observed after contamination some peaks that were identified are characteristic of clayey materials such as montmorillonite 20 0 44 nm kaolinite 24 6 0 36 nm quartz 26 5 27 8 and 35 5 0 33 0 32 and 0 25 nm and mica 44 6 0 20 nm 77 79 the mineral morphology of dioctahedral conformation is related to the highlighted peak at 0 15 nm 79 the diffractograms also showed some peaks that are characteristic of chitosan magnetized with fe3o4 that stood out at 30 2 35 5 43 5 53 9 57 1 and 62 9 nm and represent the bragg s diffraction planes 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 80 81 the peak that appears at 10 0 94 nm may be related to go sheets intercalated within the clay interlayer and its decrease in contaminated sample is an indication of its reorganization and its participation in the adsorption process 81 46 the structural changes of the go pristine and contaminated go mcs oc was evaluated from raman spectroscopy and their spectra are shown in fig 4 the most common bands related to graphene oxide materials are the d and g bands the d band represents imperfections in the aromatic structure of go being related to sp3 hybridized carbon bonds such as hydroxyl and epoxy bonds in the basal plane the g band represents the layer of sp2 hybridized carbons being related to the aromatic structure of go 82 83 the intensity ratio between the d and g bands id ig reflects the degree of imperfection of the go graphitic layer 84 the go spectrum showed d and g bands located at 1343 and 1585 cm 1 and an id ig of 0 981 after the nanocomposite synthesis process a loss of intensity of the d and g bands was observed which may be related to the heterogeneous characteristic of the material so that the presence of mineral portion impacts the intensity of the spectrum the pristine go mcs oc spectrum showed a red shift in the d and g bands compared to go and were located at 1365 and 1590 cm 1 however the id ig remained identical to go the identification of the d and g bands and the similarity of id ig in the nanocomposite spectrum suggests the presence of pristine go in its structure and that the nanomaterial was not destroyed in the nanocomposite synthesis 85 86 the spectrum of contaminated go mcs oc also revealed a red shift of the d and g bands in relation to go being located at 1365 and 1590 cm 1 the id ig of the contaminated nanocomposite was 1 004 which is superior to go and pristine go mcs oc denoting a greater presence of imperfections in the aromatic structure after the adsorption process pristine and contaminated go mcs oc samples were verified by x ray photoelectric spectroscopy xps seeking to understand the chemical state of elements and measure the functional groups present in the samples survey spectra analysis of the pristine nanocomposite fig 5 showed the presence of carbon 70 1 and oxygen 21 9 in larger quantities as well as small traces of silica 3 8 aluminum 1 4 nitrogen 1 3 iron 1 2 and sodium 0 2 after contamination the spectrum did not show significant changes in percentages high resolution spectra of c 1s for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are shown in fig 6 a the uncontaminated go mcs oc spectrum revealed peaks at 284 7 285 8 286 8 288 5 and 289 7 ev corresponding to the bonds cc ch 55 5 cn coh 22 co cnh2 11 oco 10 6 and π π interactions 0 9 between aromatic rings of go respectively 87 90 after contamination with ee2 fig 6 b the binding energies changed to 284 5 285 5 286 8 and 288 3 ev with different percentages for their representatives 50 5 27 8 15 7 and 6 respectively the peak related to π π interactions was not identified after contamination suggesting that the nanocomposite interacts via π π interactions with the aromatic ring of ee2 91 the contaminated sample showed a shift of the peaks related to cc ch cn coh and oco bonds to lower binding energies this modification suggests an increase in electronic density due to the displacement of electrons on the nanocomposite surface 92 the decrease in these binding energies indicates that interactions via hydrogen bonding may be occurring between the hydroxyls present in ee2 and the cn coh and oco groups of the nanocomposite 93 high resolution spectra of o 1s for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are illustrated in fig 6 c and d the uncontaminated go mcs oc spectrum revealed peaks at 530 2 531 7 and 533 2 ev corresponding to anionic oxygen of fe3o4 12 9 co oco alo binding 52 4 and coh sioh bond 34 7 respectively 87 94 96 after contamination the spectrum showed peaks at the binding energies of 530 1 531 5 and 532 8 ev with different percentages for their representatives 23 3 45 and 31 7 respectively the discrete decrease in binding energies for o 1s indicates that oxygenated groups are involved in ee2 adsorption mechanisms 92 high resolution spectra of n 1s region for pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are illustrated in fig 6 e and f the crude sample showed peaks for binding energies of 399 8 and 402 1 ev that correspond to amines primary and tertiary and amides 53 3 and to protonated amines 46 7 97 98 respectively the contaminated sample presented peaks at binding energies of 399 7 and 401 9 ev with different percentages 71 5 and 28 5 the variations in binding energy and percentages indicate that amines and protonated amines present in nanocomposite through chitosan act in ee2 adsorption process possibly due to the reception and donation of hydrogen bonding 93 the hydroxyls present in the nanocomposite can also act as hydrogen bond donors like protonated amines on the other hand non protonated amines and carboxylate groups can act as hydrogen bond receptors supporting that this type of interaction is relevant between go mcs oc and ee2 high resolution spectra of fe 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples very similar peaks with binding energies of 710 2 711 9 723 7 and 725 4 ev the first peak is related to the coexistence of fe2 and fe3 in the 2p3 2 oxidation state the second is related to fe3 in the 2p3 2 oxidation state the third is related to fe2 in the 2p1 2 oxidation state and the fourth indicates fe3 in the 2p1 2 oxidation state 94 this range of peaks is also related to the success in combining chitosan and fe3o4 99 high resolution spectra of si 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples identical peaks with binding energies of 101 8 and 102 8 ev that are related to si3 and si4 respectively which compose the clay layers 96 a peak close to 1072 ev was identified in both samples and both are related to residual na 1s that were not organophilized and that are ionized in the clay interlayer 100 high resolution spectra of al 2p showed for pristine and contaminated samples very close peaks with binding energies of 73 8 and 74 8 ev which are related to octahedrally ordered aluminum in the clay layers 101 similar peaks before and after adsorption demonstrate that iron silicon sodium and aluminum do not play an important role in interactions between go mcs oc and ee2 ftir spectra of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are highlighted in fig 7 pristine nanocomposite showed several notable bands throughout the spectrum 4000 450 cm 1 the bands that stood out at 3620 and 3371 cm 1 represent nh and oh elongations that come from the amines present in chitosan and from the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids and the alcohol group that are mainly present in go 80 102 the bands found at 2923 and 2850 cm 1 represent asymmetric and symmetrical ch elongations present in the aromatized groups of chitosan and go as well as in the alkylammonium cations that give the clay an organophilic character 76 103 the highlighted bands at 1641 and 1567 cm 1 represent co and nh elongations respectively being related to the go carboxylates and to chitosan amines 102 103 the bands that stood out at 1468 1377 and 1303 cm 1 are related to cn elongations representing amines that are on chitosan surface and can react with epoxy and carboxylate groups of go to form amides which are also related with this stretch 80 104 105 the highlight band at 1045 cm 1 is related to sio stretches present in organoclay as well as epoxy groups located in the basal plane of go 77 106 107 the bands located between 950 and 800 cm 1 are related to oh stretches in the mineral layer as well as the bands of 600 450 cm 1 represent sioal and siosi bonds 76 77 the peak located at 521 cm 1 is also related to feo bonds that represent chitosan magnetization 80 108 the nanocomposite before adsorption showed similar bands to contaminated material although in some cases displaced and less intense the band related to nh bond which was already overshadowed by oh band was not evident after adsorption even with the band related to the hydroxyl group being wider and displaced to 3410 cm 1 the decrease in intensity and the red shift of the hydroxyl related peak indicates presence of hydrogen bonds this functional group acts as hydrogen donor and possibly the aromatic ring and oxygens present in ee2 molecule act as hydrogen acceptors 109 the bands between 1650 and 1300 cm 1 as well as the band at 1045 cm 1 showed significant loss of intensity corroborating the evidence that oxygenated groups originated mainly from go and chitosan and nitrogen groups from amines and possibly formed amides participate in ee2 adsorption mechanisms the analysis of xps and ftir spectra of pristine and contaminated sample showed that hydrogen bonds and π π interactions are present in ee2 adsorption process on go mcs oc surface the proposed interactions between the functional groups present on the nanocomposite surface and ee2 molecule are illustrated in fig 8 sem micrographs of pristine and contaminated go mcs oc are shown in fig 9 the micrographics from samples before and after the adsorption process were similar indicating that the removal of ee2 did not change the material structure the surface of go mcs oc was heterogeneous showing points of higher density that indicate the presence of clay as well as intercalated lamellar structures confirming the presence of go sheets 3 2 effects of nanoadsorbent dosage ph and sonication time the positive effect of nanoadsorbent dosage on ee2 removal was evident in fig 10 a while the value of adsorption capacity decreases with the increase of the nanoadsorbent mass similar results on the effect of dosage in relation to adsorption capacity and percentage of removal were also observed for other nanoadsorbents 110 111 the system presented a maximum removal percentage of 89 8 at a dosage of 0 35 mg ml 1 and a maximum adsorption capacity of 50 5 mg g 1 at a dosage of 0 05 mg ml 1 the increase in dosage resulted in a significant increase in removal up to 0 25 mg ml 1 so from that point on the results were statistically similar according to turkey test with a 5 significance level fig 10 b illustrates the effect of solution ph on ee2 adsorption process by go mcs oc the removal percentage had a decrease from ph 3 to ph 4 and a slight increase from ph 4 to ph 8 however according to turkey test the results were statistically equivalent with a 5 significance level except between ph 4 and 8 sonication time is a parameter widely evaluated in nanomaterial suspensions and implies the exfoliation of graphene materials which can increase stability and surface area 81 the effect of sonication time of go mcs oc suspensions on ee2 removal is illustrated in fig 10 c the results indicated superior performance when the system was not submitted to ultrasonic bath and a decrease in efficiency with increasing sonication time these results revealed that the nanocomposite sheets can suffer fragmentation with the procedure compromising some interactions that help in adsorption process 112 the evaluation of this parameter by turkey test with a 5 significance level demonstrated that the application of the ultrasonic bath resulted in statistically similar removal efficiencies 3 3 adsorption kinetics the kinetic curves of ee2 adsorption by go mcs oc for different initial concentrations of adsorbate are shown in fig 11 the increase in adsorption capacity with the increase in initial concentration of ee2 is evidenced ee2 was quickly removed in the first 30 min of the process followed by slower removal kinetics until the equilibrium plateau which was reached in about 120 min the adsorption capacities at equilibrium were 0 131 0 098 and 0 061 mmol g 1 38 8 29 2 and 18 2 mg g 1 for initial concentrations of 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 mmol l 1 respectively literature presents great variation in the equilibrium time for ee2 adsorption kinetic assays depending on the type of adsorbent and the initial concentration evaluated han et al 113 reported equilibrium after 60 min in polyamides whereas lai et al 114 reported that equilibrium was reached after 10 h using heat treated plastic waste 113 114 zhang et al 115 also reported a kinetic equilibrium around 120 min for a copper sulfide based nanomaterial 115 thus the developed nanocomposite showed relatively fast kinetics and is within the range found in the literature pfo and pso kinetic models as well as boyd and ip diffusion models were applied to experimental data seeking to describe adsorption mechanisms the models and adjustment parameters are organized in table 2 the pseudo second order model exhibited q e values closer to experimental ones and better represented the adsorption kinetic behavior for all concentrations the upper value of adjusted coefficient of determination as well as the lower value of reduced chi squared and corrected akaike criterion corroborated with a better fit of pso model to experimental data this fact indicates that chemisorption may be involved in adsorption mechanism of ee2 on go mcs oc 116 as reported in the adsorption of this contaminant by other materials 113 114 117 the presence of chemisorption corroborates the hydrogen bonds that were proposed by characterizations 118 the intraparticle and boyd diffusion models are based on the resistance to mass transfer and were applied to experimental data for a better understanding of the limiting step of the process the ip model presented a multilinear profile separated into three stages for all concentrations evaluated the three regions represent external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and equilibrium 119 the second region suggests the presence of intraparticle diffusion step however the low adjustment and the constant c value greater than zero indicate that this is not the adsorption limiting step 120 the non linear profile of endpoints presented by boyd model and its straight line not crossing the origin corroborate the ip model hypothesis the evaluation of diffusion models suggests the existence of a stage of resistance to mass transfer in external film 58 3 4 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium models of langmuir freundlich and bet were fitted to experimental data of the equilibrium isotherms of ee2 adsorption by go mcs oc obtained at 30 40 and 50 c fig 12 the positive effect of temperature is pronounced revealing the endothermic character and that adsorption can occur via chemisorption or by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption 121 similar behavior was also observed in ee2 removal by another reduced graphene oxide magnetic nanocomposite 122 the positive effect of temperature is pronounced for smaller dosages however with increasing dosage lower values of equilibrium concentration in fluid phase this influence becomes less expressive in the values of q table 3 grouped the parameters of langmuir freundlich and bet models that were fitted to experimental data isotherms profiles shown in fig 12 indicate that the material is not completely saturated with the decrease in nanoadsorbent mass suggesting that the adsorbate is deposited in multilayers the difference between q max values proposed by langmuir model and experimental ones corroborates with this statement since this model considers homogeneous surface and monolayer adsorption 123 although the values of r 2 adj for langmuir and freundlich model are similar the lower values of χ 2 red and aic c for freundlich model are indicative of multilayer physisorption on a heterogeneous surface 124 values of n less than 1 indicate low energy interactions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent which are also characteristic of physical interactions 125 the experimental behavior was better represented by the bet model implying more satisfactory values of r 2 adj e χ 2 red despite better representing experimental data the corrected akaike criterion for bet model presents a slightly higher value at some temperatures because the model presents one more adjustment parameter than langmuir and freundlich models the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity represented by q b was about 30 mg g 1 however this value differs from maximum adsorption capacity that tends to grow with formation of multilayers 62 126 the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and physical interactions in ee2 removal by go mcs oc is supported by kinetic tests and by favoring adsorption with increasing temperature chemical interactions as well as by the evidence presented in freundlich and bet models physical interactions table 4 summarizes and compares the maximum adsorption capacity observed for go mcs oc with other adsorbents reported in literature go mcs oc showed superior performance to several advanced adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes polyamides and reduced graphene oxide indicating that it is a promising material for the removal of ee2 from aqueous media 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters of ee2 adsorption in go mcs oc were evaluated and are summarized in table 5 henry s law was applied in the infinite dilution region and parameters were calculated from the graph of ln k d vs 1 t the positive value of enthalpy variation h 0 indicates that ee2 adsorption on go mcs oc has an endothermic nature therefore it is favored by temperature the increase in activation energy with increasing temperature also indicates the endothermic profile of the system values of h 0 in the range between 2 and 21 kj mol 1 are related to systems governed by physical adsorption while values between 80 and 200 kj mol 1 are related to chemical adsorption processes 132 intermediate values are related to systems wherein both interactions take place however the proximity between 21 e 32 kj mol 1 indicates predominance of physisorption the occurrence of physisorption corroborates the presence of π π interactions between the aromatics of nanoadsorbent and adsorbate 133 positive values of entropy variation s 0 indicate an increase in system disorder and the presence of dissociative mechanisms in the adsorption process 132 negative values of variation of gibbs energy and its decrease with increasing temperature suggest that the process is spontaneous and favored by the increase in temperature 134 the proposed adsorbate adsorbent system is controlled by entropy changes because for all temperatures tδs 0 h 0 revealing that the system entropy has more influence on the ee2 adsorption process the endothermic and spontaneous profile as well as the tendency for physical adsorption of ee2 were reported in the literature for some materials such as metal organic framework and reduced graphene oxide magnetic composite 117 122 the adsorption of ee2 on nano copper sulfide showed evidence of chemical interactions while its adsorption on carbon nanotubes showed an exothermic nature 115 127 3 6 designing a simplified bath adsorption system the simplified batch design for go mcs oc ee2 system estimated the amount of nanocomposite needed to remove 50 70 and 90 of the microcontaminant from the aqueous medium fig 13 with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 the bet model was used due to its better fit to equilibrium data to estimate the values of q e in a simplified batch system there is a linear relationship between effluent volume and nanocomposite mass for all evaluated efficiencies for 1000 l of effluent with an initial concentration of 0 03 mmol l 1 112 194 and 373 g of nanocomposite are needed to remove 50 70 and 90 of ee2 respectively de farias et al 135 proposed a similar batch system for removing bisphenol a another emerging contaminant and a considerably superior performance was observed for go mcs oc nanocomposite the study used the same organoclay applied in nanocomposite synthesis however to remove 90 of bpa in 1000 l of solution with 1 mmol l 1 a mass 20 times greater was required than those calculated in the work 135 coelho et al 136 also proposed a batch system using a bioadsorbent obtained from residual algae to remove propranolol hydrochloride another drug considered an emerging contaminant the system presented required 18 4 g of bioadsorbent to remove 90 of the contaminant from only 10 l of solutions with 1 mmol l 1 136 a direct comparison of these systems reported for bpa and propranolol with the present study is not possible as they are different adsorbates and the studies were carried out at different concentrations 3 7 isosteric heat of adsorption the isosteres obtained for different values of constant surface coverage q e were illustrated in fig 14 the values of q e chosen for the evaluation of isosteric heat of adsorption were 16 3 32 4 39 and 49 5 mg g 1 and their values are shown in table 6 the h iso values obtained were 19 33 23 95 9 62 and 3 15 kj mol 1 for q and 49 5 39 32 4 and 16 3 mg g 1 the variation of isosteric heat values indicates that the nanocomposite surface is energetically heterogeneous 137 furthermore its values below 80 kj mol 1 indicate that the adsorption process is governed by physical mechanisms 137 the results corroborate with experimental data that were better represented freundlich and bet models also denoting the heterogeneous characteristic and the energetic non uniformity of the active sites 3 8 regeneration cycles in bath the reuse of go mcs oc was investigated for five cycles to remove ee2 evaluating acetonitrile and ethanol as eluents fig 15 removal efficiency and adsorption capacity using acetonitrile as eluent decreased from 74 9 and 36 5 mg g 1 to 46 7 and 20 mg g 1 in the fifth adsorptive cycle in its turn using ethanol as eluent the same response variables decreased from 68 9 and 30 8 mg g 1 to 32 1 and 14 4 mg g 1 in the fifth adsorptive cycle respectively in comparison with the results obtained under the same conditions in the equilibrium tests 69 3 and 30 8 mg g 1 the regeneration of go mcs oc using acetonitrile as eluent presented a satisfactory performance compared to the initial for the first two cycles decreasing only from the third adsorptive cycle the regeneration of go mcs oc using ethanol showed a lower performance compared to acetonitrile and a significant decrease from the second cycle the decrease in go mcs oc regenerability may be related to the shear force which alters the structure and reduces the number of active sites and to the loss of mass of the nanocomposite due to its reuse for five consecutive cycles the results indicated that the synthesized nanocomposite is a potential adsorbent for ee2 removal in up to two cycles losing up to about 40 of its ee2 adsorptive capacity thereafter 3 9 selectivity evaluation the selectivity of the nanocomposite was evaluated for three different initial concentration conditions in binary solutions of ee2 and bpa fig 16 in the condition with the highest amount of ee2 the tests showed removal percentages of 84 9 and 67 5 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 069 and 0 030 mmol l 1 20 5 and 6 9 mg g 1 respectively in the solution with the highest amount of bpa a removal percentage of 82 4 and 64 7 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 044 and 0 055 mmol l 1 13 1 and 12 7 mg g 1 were observed respectively in the equimolar solution a removal percentage of 89 3 and 73 2 for ee2 and bpa as well as adsorption capacities of 0 048 and 0 039 mmol l 1 14 2 and 8 8 mg g 1 were obtained respectively all conditions evaluated showed satisfactory removal percentages and adsorption capacities for both emerging contaminants removal percentages and adsorption capacities for ee2 were higher than for bpa in all evaluated conditions except in the condition where bpa was predominant under these conditions although the percentage of removal of ee2 is higher its adsorption capacity was lower than bpa adsorption capacity due to the excess of this contaminant in the medium implying a greater adsorbed amount selectivity assays demonstrated that go mcs oc interacts better with ee2 than with bpa the distribution coefficient k ee2 and k bpa and selectivity coefficient k ee2 bpa are shown in table 7 k ee2 bpa values greater than 1 indicate more selective adsorption for ee2 than bpa k ee2 bpa values greater than 1 and close to unity even in the condition where bpa was more abundant suggest that the surface of go mcs oc presents higher affinity with ee2 bpa and ee2 molecules fig 17 have the same number of ionizable hydroxyls that theoretically are involved in hydrogen bonds on the other hand the bpa molecule has one more aromatic than the ee2 molecule which should cause a greater possibility of π π interactions although there are satisfactory affinities of the material for adsorption of both ee2 and bpa its preference for ee2 is notable a possible explanation for this may be related to the angular conformation of the bpa molecule which can impair its physisorption in multilayers even though the ee2 molecule is bigger than that of bpa its flatter conformation seems to favor its deposition onto the go mcs oc surface 4 conclusions the synthesized nanocomposite go mcs oc showed satisfactory performance in removing ee2 from the aqueous medium the large adsorption capacity reached even with a small dose of adsorbent and low concentration of adsorbate suggests go mcs oc as a promising material for environmental application the nitrogen physisorption isotherms obtained were type ii and are typical of meso and macroporous materials the original material had a surface area of 17 8 m2 g 1 which was partially reduced after the adsorption process 13 2 m2 g 1 xrd spectra and sem micrographs showed a heterogeneous structure of the prepared nanocomposite raman analysis showed the structural changes of go and of the raw and contaminated go mcs oc indicating an increase in imperfections in the nanocomposite structure after the contamination process xps and ftir analyses provided information on predominant functional groups and bonds in nanocomposite structure revealing that oxygenated and nitrogenated groups as well as aromatic structure participate in the ee2 capture through hydrogen bonds and π π interactions the models fitted to kinetic data indicated that chemisorption was present corroborating hydrogen bonds and that external mass transfer was the main step in the adsorption process equilibrium isotherms showed an endothermic profile for the system being also indicative of the presence of chemisorption bet and freundlich models fitted the equilibrium data well suggesting that the material has heterogeneous characteristics and that there is formation of multilayers through physisorption corroborating π π interactions highlighted in the process the maximum experimental adsorption capacity obtained for go mcs oc at 30 c was 50 5 mg g 1 while the bet model predicted a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 30 7 mg g 1 this difference in the maximum adsorbed amount also corroborates the coexistence of chemisorption and physisorption although both types of interactions are present in ee2 adsorption process in go mcs oc the values of freundlich s n factor enthalpy variation and isosteric heat suggest a predominance of physical interactions the design of the simplified batch system showed the possibility of treating large volumes of effluent with a small amount of nanocomposite go mcs oc nanocomposite showed satisfactory regeneration performance using acetonitrile as eluent through two successive adsorptions reducing up to 40 of its capacity until the fifth cycle the selectivity tests displayed the best performance of ee2 against bpa in addition to an ability to remove a large percentage of both even in a binary system the set of results indicates the go mcs oc as a promising adsorbent technology for removal of emerging contaminants with impactful benefits for the environment and suggests the evaluation of this material in more complex real aqueous

potential carcinogenicity to any eukaryotic organism the ubiquitous presence of cytostatics on effluents from wastewater treatment plants and natural water streams has raised concerns about environmental integrity resilience and sustainability therefore the seeking for a treatment solution to mitigate their entrance spread and accumulation in the environment is urgent besides the well known tertiary treatments of sorption by activated carbon or even more recent ones such as ozonation membrane processes are advanced treatment technologies with high potential benefits since they are known to provide high removal rates for low molecular weight organic pollutants and effluents of excellent quality for the first time this work intends to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of membrane based processes as stand alone units or combined with other technologies for the treatment of wastewaters and waters contaminated with cytostatics information on the influence of operating conditions on process efficiency removal mechanisms and toxicity of the generated effluents are discussed in detail while the current gaps are highlighted furthermore relevant information regarding the implementation of membrane technologies for cytostatics depletion from an economical and environmental perspective is given at first hand keywords cytostatics membrane separation membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment life cycle assessment 1 introduction cytostatics are plant derived or synthetic pharmaceuticals used in different treatment procedures including chemotherapy one of the main therapies for cancer disease 1 they act by affecting the cells metabolism exterminating cancerous cells however cytostatics are not specific for them interfering also with the viability of healthy tissues after being administered these compounds are excreted by the patients kidneys and bile ending up in the wastewater treatment plants wwtp coming both from the hospitals and their homes 2 the inefficacy of conventional wwtps to degrade cytotoxic compounds along with the environmental risk associated to them 3 4 call for the implementation of efficient technologies for their removal in wwtps prior to their discharge chlorination and electrooxidation seem to be not suitable for cytostatics removal as harmful transformation products are generated 5 although o3 and h2o2 based processes have generally yielded to less toxic products some cytostatics of concern were found to be partially refractory to these technologies e g cyclophosphamide 5 membrane based processes are an attractive option for the removal of cytostatics due to their high performance on the removal of low molecular weight mw organic pollutants their reliability compared with conventional processes aligned with the production of effluents of excellent quality their modularity and ability to be integrated with other treatment technologies 6 7 studies have already been published with regard to the application of membrane based processes on the removal of cytostatics 7 8 however no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive analysis of the findings on the treatment of waters and wastewaters containing cytostatics using membrane based processes by understanding the factors affecting the processes performance the removal mechanisms the quality of the effluents and environmental footprints indeed none review article focusing on the removal of cytostatics by membrane processes has been published so far for the first time this work aims to fill this major gap by compiling and giving a comprehensive review on the use of membrane separation techniques and their combination with other processes for the elimination of cytostatics in aqueous phase furthermore the main critical points to have into consideration on the implementation of the new technologies are addressed from an economical and environmental life cycle assessment perspective up to the authors best knowledge there are no life cycle assessment lca reviews related to the exploitation and implementation of membrane processes as advanced treatment technologies for cytostatics in wastewaters the originality and impact of the present review rely on the provision of consolidated information regarding the design and optimization of a high potential treatment process membrane technology for dealing with one of the highest global threats of our water systems cytostatics 9 this is crucial to systematize current doubts and to guide towards the development of research addressing questions of scientific and technical interest for experts in this field of research 2 literature search the selected articles were extracted from the core collection in the web of science wos considering all the published papers until february 2022 keywords for the research were cytostatics antineoplastic anticancer separation membrane filtration nanofiltration ultrafiltration osmosis membrane bioreactor mbr and water a total of twenty original papers were obtained after applying the exclusion criteria non original research articles publications that are not considered full reports and papers not written in english between the publications found six are related to nf and ro ten to mbr and seven to hybrid technologies combination of membrane based technologies and other processes regarding the cytostatics studied cyclophosphamide was by far the one described in the highest number of papers thirteen being present in 40 of the studies found followed by fluorouracil with three studies and paclitaxel etoposide ifosfamide and tamoxifen with two studies each fig 1 the other cytostatics are present in one study each capecitabine cytarabine platinum compounds doxorubicin azathioprine methotrexate epirubicin flutamide mitotane and ifosfamide mbr is also a very promising technology which has been widely applied worldwide and for which the rejection of cytostatics has been studied a total of ten papers were found studying the rejection of cyclophosphamide ifosfamide platinum compounds fluorouracil doxorubicin azathioprine methotrexate epirubicin flutamide mitotane and tamoxifen by mbr systems usually membrane processes are coupled with other technologies thus some studies regarding hybrid technologies were found for cytostatic removal from wastewaters being cyclophosphamide the most studied cytostatic in these works three studies followed by platinum compounds etoposide and paclitaxel mentioned in one work each 3 membranes in the last decades membrane processes have been increasingly used in the reclamation reuse of wastewaters and in the treatment of water for human consumption lately there is a wide range of water contaminants that membranes have been proposed to remove such as pahs 10 neonicotinoids 11 dyes 12 microplastics 13 among others 14 17 there are several types of membrane technologies such as membrane distillation forward osmosis fo electro dialysis pervaporation and pressure driven technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 18 19 the main advantages and disadvantages of each process are described in table 1 analyzing this information pressure driven technologies appear to be the best option to study cytostatics removal from wastewaters since they allow the rejection of low mw compounds are already widely applied at large scale aiming their introduction in wwtp facilities and have several membrane types which can be chosen according to the contaminants to eliminate the selection of the membrane process is usually dependent on several factors the mw of the contaminant molecular weight cut off mwco of the membrane the membrane configuration the membrane material among others the mw of cytostatics usually ranges from 100 900 da table 2 thus nf and ro seem to have the most adequate membranes to apply with this aim which mwco varies from 100 5000 da fig 2 nf and ro high pressure membranes have a wide application in the removal of pharmaceuticals from contaminated streams due to their complete or nearly complete efficiency and their easily combination with other removal degradation technologies 7 however the process is strongly dependent on solute physico chemical properties more details are provided in the following sections nf ro were the most investigated membranes in the removal of cytostatics from contaminated streams still other membranes were used for cytostatics rejection a fo membrane was tested for eight cytostatics in synthetic domestic wastewater cyclophosphamide doxorubicin epirubicin methotrexate tamoxifen mitotane azathioprine and flutamide but negligible rejections were attained for mitotane and flutamide the other cytostatics showed rejections 95 for having mw 370 da 20 verliefde and co workers tested nf membranes for pharmaceuticals removal from surface water after a pre treatment with an uf membrane they found that cyclophosphamide which was among the target pharmaceuticals was not removed at all 21 janssens and co workers studied the efficacy of a photocatalysis membrane reactor using a ceramic membrane mwco 200 1000 da but they assumed that the low mw of cytostatics makes polymeric membranes a better attraction 22 23 attending on the high toxicity of cytostatics and the high potential of membrane technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the removal of cytostatics from water by nf and ro and the individual contributions of the influencing factors are herein fully discussed this analysis aims at providing a basis for selecting the appropriate treatment approach removal system and conditions for the removal of a specific or a group of cytostatics from contaminated streams 3 1 nanofiltration nf up to author s best knowledge only six documents studying the removal of cytostatics from water by nf membranes are found in the literature table 3 the rejection of a solute by a nf membrane can occur through different mechanisms size exclusion sieving steric effects electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions the following sections try to explain the different mechanisms that play a role in cytostatics rejections by nf membranes under different experimental conditions as well as the influence of membrane materials and configurations on cytostatics removal from waters wastewaters 3 1 1 the effect of membrane materials in terms of membrane material make up although all the studies found mention the composition of the membranes used there is no clear information regarding the effect of the materials in cytostatics removal from waters usually pressure driven membrane processes use organic polymer based membranes polyethylene polytetrafluorethylene polypropylene cellulose etc 18 which were used in the published studies there are three studies which compare the efficacy of two membranes 21 24 25 cristóvão and co workers compared the rejection of paclitaxel etoposide cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide using both nf270 and desal 5dk 24 26 both membranes are thin composite polymeric membranes with a polysulphone support layer and are negatively charged at neutral ph with the main difference in their mwco 300 da for the nf270 and 150 300 da for desal 5dk table 4 which the authors justified as the reason for better results using desal 5dk verliefde and co workers compared the removal efficiency of trisep ts 80 and desal hl for cyclophosphamide 21 25 both membranes were thin film composite membranes with a cross linked aromatic polyamide top layer with some differences between them trisep ts 80 had a higher negative surface charge was more hydrophobic and with less oxygen content according to the manufacturer of the membranes trisep ts 80 was especially engineered for its low fouling characteristics which was proved by the authors when the effect of fouling on permeate flux was studied 21 in terms of cytostatic removal trisep ts 80 showed slightly higher rejections than desal hl due to its lower mwco another work developed by janssens and co workers studied the degradation of cytostatics using a photocatalytic membrane reactor with a ceramic membrane although this membrane presents higher resistance than polymeric ones their larger pore size is not effective for cytostatics retention 23 cellulose based membranes thin film composite membranes ceramic membranes metal oxide membranes carbon based membranes among others have already been studied for water purification 27 polymer membranes are by far the most widely applied especially in large scale operations however fouling is one of their biggest disadvantages the modification of these membranes structures by adding materials that contain inorganic fillers in the organic matrix is one of the answers to improve these membranes performance recent studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of mixed matrix membranes made with both organic and inorganic nanomaterials for water cleaning processes using nf and ro technologies 28 although they provided very promising results there are still some limitations that need to be overcome especially regarding their cost when compared to other membranes 27 28 the development of low mwco membranes with higher resistance e g polymeric membranes protected by ceramic layer could be a promising strategy for large scale experiments 23 still for first experiments the applicability of these easily commercially available membranes seemed to be a good choice therefore information regarding the influence in membrane composition on cytostatics rejection is still scarce and more studies regarding this topic should be done 3 1 2 membrane configuration another aspect that influences the performance of the process especially for large scale equipment is the membrane configuration there are essentially four types of membrane modules plate and frame tubular spiral wound and hollow fiber 18 spiral wound module is the most applied module in ro and nf membranes with easily replacement of module elements and scaled up for large equipment 18 the main disadvantage of this configuration is the fact that it has a relatively high potential for fouling and it is not very easily cleaned 18 hollow fiber modules are also a good option for wwtp implementation especially due to their ability to house large membrane areas and the high packing density however they need a much higher area to be constructed and also have high potential for fouling 18 29 regarding the papers found in this review three of them used flat sheet membrane modules 21 24 30 two of them used spiral wound modules 25 26 and one paper used a capillary module 31 which is similar to hollow fiber module differentiating by the dimension of the fibers 32 however none of the studies have a deep analysis on the impact of the membrane configuration chosen it is important to choose the most likely membrane to the one that would probably be applied in large scale facilities according to the configuration of the system verliefde and co workers found out that the rejections obtained for cytostatic removal using a small flat sheet membrane were lower than the ones using a spiral wound configuration membrane which they justified by the hydrodynamic conditions in the sepa cell 21 25 on the other side cristóvão and co workers studied the rejection of the same cytostatics in a desal 5dk lab scale flat sheet membrane and desal 5dk pilot scale spiral wound membrane modules achieving similar rejections in both cases 24 26 ribera and co workers also concluded that nf270 membrane showed similar results in the degradation of several pharmaceuticals when used flat sheet lab scale and spiral wound pilot scale configurations which may strength the already published studies regarding future applicability 33 working with the same recovery and the same permeate flux than the ones predicted to be used in the full scale plant had also been proved to be of utmost importance 33 3 1 3 physico chemical properties of target cytostatics and membranes in these studies only six cytostatics have been considered as solutes their physico chemical properties are compiled in table 2 as shown the mw of the target cytostatics varied from 130 08 g mol fluorouracil to 853 91 g mol paclitaxel the mw is a common descriptor of the molecular size and therefore it is one of the main relevant parameters influencing the performance of membrane processes as previously mentioned typically size exclusion sieving steric effect is responsible for rejection of uncharged and hydrophilic solutes 7 34 taking into account that most of the membranes are hydrophobic and negatively charged at working ph values table 4 moderate to high rejections are expected for molecules with mw higher than the mwco of the membrane table 5 cristóvão and co workers studied the rejection of four cytostatics cyclophosphamide ifosfamide etoposide and paclitaxel by two different nf membranes nf270 and desal 5dk 24 authors showed that etoposide mw 588 56 g mol and paclitaxel mw 853 91 g mol were more efficiently removed than cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide mw 261 09 g mol by nf270 mwco 300 g mol and desal 5dk mwco 150 300 g mol membranes rejections higher than 91 were achieved in all experiments table 3 24 they also demonstrated that the rejection of etoposide by nf270 and desal 5dk membranes was mainly due to size exclusion since etoposide has a low logk ow and is neutral at the experimental ph conditions table 2 24 the same group achieved rejections higher than 96 for capecitabine cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide using a desal 5dk membrane in a pilot scale equipment size exclusion was the main mechanism responsible for their removal 26 this is in line with the predictions for solutes with category ii profile moderate to high rejections governed by size exclusion mechanism table 5 cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are also hydrophilic and uncharged at typical working ph values table 2 but since they have mws close to the mwco of nf270 and desal 5dk only low to moderate rejections were achieved 43 8 table 2 being steric hindrance effects the most important controlling factor 24 a similar conclusion was drawn by wang et al 30 who reported cyclophosphamide rejections in the range of 20 to 60 by desal 5dk table 3 verliefde and co workers also demonstrated that the process of rejection of cyclophosphamide by trisep ts 80 and desal hl membranes was mainly determined by steric effects being trisep ts 80 slightly more effective due to its lower mwco tables 3 and 4 25 however the membrane process should not be seen as a simple filtration sieving process since the net sorption at the membrane solute interface and the transport inside the membrane can also play a significant role in the removal efficiency and they are affected by other parameters e g charge and hydrophobicity of the solute this supports for instance the findings for paclitaxel 24 as it will be further explained as can be found in table 2 the only charged cytostatic at typical feed water ph values 6 7 is cytarabine therefore it is expected that the rejection of cytarabine negatively charged by nf membranes is predominantly governed by a charge repulsion mechanism being steric effects less pronounced table 5 typically high to very high rejection values are observed for negatively charged solutes because they cannot approach the negatively charged membrane electrostatic repulsion and are therefore prevented from permeating through it 38 39 on the other hand the lower the zeta potential of the membrane i e the higher the surface charge the higher the expected difference in rejection values for charged solutes 25 the only study which exploits the rejection of a charged cytostatic in this case cytarabine by a nf membrane reports rejections of 80 8 table 3 31 none or weak electrostatic interactions are expected between the remaining target cytostatics neutral solutes and the negatively charged nf membranes since their rejections are expectedly governed by steric or hydrophobic effects table 5 regarding other pharmaceuticals radjenovic et al concluded that diclofenac mw 296 da negative charge in neutral ph showed higher rejections when compared to acetaminophen mw 151 da uncharged in neutral ph which was expected due to size exclusion effect however lower rejections were found for gemfibrozil mw 250 da negative charge in neutral ph due to charge repulsion effect this is a very complex topic since different correlations regarding molecular dimensions mw molar volume and rejections have been concluded by the scientific community 35 37 hydrophobicity is expressed by the logarithm of the octanol water partitioning coefficient logk ow for non ionizable solutes and of the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient logd ph for ionizable compounds eqs 1 and 2 40 1 for acids log d ph log k ow log 1 10 ph pka 2 for bases log d ph log k ow log 1 10 pka ph the compound is usually referred as hydrophilic if the octanol water coefficient is 2 41 thus all target cytostatics are hydrophilic except paclitaxel table 2 verliefde and co authors studied the removal of cyclophosphamide among other pharmaceuticals by nf and they found that the rejection of negatively charged pharmaceuticals is independent on their hydrophobicity as they are inhibited to approach the membrane surface due to electrostatic repulsions 25 on the other hand they verified that the rejection of positively charged pharmaceuticals decreased with increasing hydrophobicity the attractive forces bring solute and membrane together and the higher the hydrophobicity of the solute the higher its adsorption on the surface or pores of the membrane and the chances of permeation 25 these effects were found to be even more pronounced for the nf membrane of higher contact angle i e higher hydrophobic nature desal hl versus trisep ts 80 table 4 25 the same behavior on the rejection of neutral pharmaceuticals was observed due to the absence of electrostatic repulsions between solute and membrane albeit at much lesser extent 25 however opposite trends for paclitaxel neutral and hydrophobic in comparison to the other cytostatics neutral and hydrophilic were reported by cristóvão et al 24 the authors found that paclitaxel was the cytostatic with the highest observed adsorption on the membrane and simultaneously with the highest rejection values in all experiments 95 table 3 27 the short time frame of the experiments 24 h and or the use of small volumes of water 10 l have been found to lead to an overestimation of the rejections of positive and hydrophobic solutes the measurement of rejections at the equilibrium is crucial to ensure unbiased values 42 44 membrane fouling can also have impact in the rejections due to the hydrophilic nature of the foulants reducing or improving the passage of the compounds through the membrane 45 3 1 4 the effect of water matrix the effect of water matrix in the rejection of cytostatics by nf membranes was investigated in two studies 24 30 cristóvão et al found that the rejections of paclitaxel etoposide cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide by desal 5dk are not impacted by the matrix table 3 24 comerton and co authors also concluded studying other pharmaceuticals that the presence of natural organic matter and cations do not influence the final rejection of other pharmaceuticals 46 however quite low rejections were reported for cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide in laboratory grade water and wwtp effluent using nf270 membrane 45 versus 81 in synthetic urine table 3 24 on the other hand wang and co authors shown that cyclophosphamide rejection from a natural wastewater by desal 5dk was greater than that from ultrapure water 60 versus 20 40 table 3 30 it was concluded that both in depth membrane fouling due to the natural organic matter retention and adsorption on membrane surface and cyclophosphamide interactions with the water matrix may have contributed to the higher rejections 30 47 ion adsorption inside the membrane pores was also proven to strength the size exclusion effect which may justify greater rejections using natural wastewaters rather than ultrapure as seen previously 7 according to the authors perspective further investigations on the removal of cytostatics of different physico chemical properties from natural raw water and wastewaters are recommended in order to design an effective treatment approach for future applications 3 1 5 the effect of cytostatic concentrations in feed water up to date only wang and co workers have studied the influence of the initial concentration of a cytostatic on its rejection by nf membranes 30 they verified that no obvious effect of cyclophosphamide initial concentration on rejections exists in the concentration range used in the experiments 10 to 600 μg l 30 this was indeed previously demonstrated for other emerging pollutants i e the rejection of neutral solutes is independent on their initial concentrations at low concentration ranges 48 45 however delgado and co workers concluded that the presence of toxic compounds cyclophosphamide and its metabolites in a mbr system increased the production of polysaccharides by the sludge rising the fouling phenomena and consequently reducing the rejection of these compounds 47 although cyclophosphamide may serve as a model solute for the description of neutral cytostatics rejections at different initial concentrations a complete lack of knowledge exists for charged cytostatics furthermore previous studies mentioned a significant impact of lowering feed concentrations on rejections of charged pollutants 50 it seems that the shielding of the membrane surface charge becomes more important with increasing feed concentrations which eventually lead to lower and higher rejections for negatively and positively charged solutes respectively this clearly underlies the need for further investigations on charged cytostatics particularly at concentrations lower than the ones usually tested μg l according to table 3 as the concentrations of cytostatics in sewage and surface waters are often in the ng l level 2 3 1 6 the effect of ionic strength regarding the ionic strength wang and co workers showed that the presence of salt had almost no influence on the uncharged cyclophosphamide rejection which is in line with previous studies 30 up to the authors best knowledge this parameter was never studied for charged cytostatics albeit the literature points out that the salt alters the rejection rates of charged solutes due to the shield of the electrostatic potential generated by the membrane and the salting out effect 25 51 52 3 2 reverse osmosis ro so far only one study applying ro membranes in the removal of cytostatics from contaminated waters was found table 3 the experiments were conducted at relatively low concentrations of the cytostatic cyclophosphamide 1 to 10 μg l in ultrapure and natural wastewaters using a polyamide membrane ymaksp3001 30 excellent rejections were attained for cyclophosphamide under all operating conditions 93 neither effects of the cyclophosphamide feed concentration nor of the water matrix were observed table 3 30 the removal mechanism of solutes by ro membranes is complex and poorly understood 7 studies regarding ro should be done for cytostatics with a deep interpretation on the dipole moment hydrophobicity and molecular size of the compounds which are the parameters that generally influences most ro processes 5 4 membrane bioreactors membrane bioreactors are considered the most recent technology for the effective removal of certain pollutants particularly micropollutants from wastewaters it has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional activated sludge treatment by combining biological treatment and membrane filtration in a single step process while avoiding the need of a secondary clarifier this key configuration of mbrs allows hydraulic retention time hrt to be independent on the sludge retention time srt i e slow growing biomass could be maintained in contact with pollutants for longer periods of time contributing to the adaptation of microorganisms to resistant compounds microorganisms are more diversified and with higher physiological capacity 53 the high performance of mbrs over conventional activated sludge is due to the i enhanced adsorption through improved sludge characteristics increased biomass concentration and increased effective surface area ii better biodegradation performances thanks to the high sludge age iii the removal of many contaminants bound to rejectable colloids and particulates by membrane separation 54 59 this section is reserved for the compilation and interpretation of the studies found in the literature regarding the application of mbrs in the treatment of wastewaters contaminated by cytostatics as expected the focus on this specific class of pharmaceuticals is still sparse table 6 despite their recognized potential threat to the environment and human health nevertheless important conclusions have been achieved in this field which should be taken into account in the design of future investigations therefore the following sections intend to give key information regarding the influence of some prime factors on the removal of cytostatics by mbrs as well as the removal mechanism 4 1 mbr configuration and specificities microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes with pore sizes in the range of 0 01 0 1 μm have been the choices for mbrs in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters since the size of microorganism flocs are in the range of 10 100 μm 7 8 the same trend is observed for the treatment of effluents containing cytostatics table 6 just one study applying nf membranes 60 the use of nf membranes over higher mwco membranes mf and uf may represent an advantage on the removal of pollutants with low mws however challenges related to fouling control are faced besides the increased capital and operational costs due to their lower permeability fo membranes have also demonstrated to be promising alternatives to conventional membranes being able to remove small molecules nitrogen and phosphorous 20 there is one study which uses a fo membrane coupled to an anaerobic mbr anombr for the removal of cyclophosphamide azathioprine methotrexate doxorubicin epirubicin flutamide mitotane and tamoxifen from wastewaters 20 regarding the configuration of the mbr both side stream mbrs 61 64 and submerged mbrs 65 66 have been exploited for the removal of cytostatics in the side stream mbr the membrane module is placed outside the bioreactor in the recirculation stream whereas in the submerged configuration the membrane is submerged within the bioreactor the submerged version is more recent it requires less energy and it has the advantage of limiting the membrane fouling by maintaining the activated sludge in suspension through aeration up to date the side stream configuration has been the most used in the treatment of effluents containing cytostatics table 6 the exploitation of the submerged version is encouraged because albeit there are not yet evidences of better removal performances energy and maintenance costs are predictably lower 4 2 sludge retention time srt is among the most significant parameters for mbr operation high srt means that the activated sludge is retained in the mbr for a longer period of time and therefore the microorganisms have the chance for growing and adapting to severe conditions as the presence of biologically persistent compounds this sometimes has a positive impact on the removal of micropollutants but increasing srt beyond a critical point leads to sever fouling and ageing of the membrane high concentration of suspended solids and high energy consumption a srt between 20 and 30 days seems to be sufficient for the removal of the majority of micropollutants 67 in the case of cytostatics a relatively high srt has been used 30 70 days 20 60 61 65 66 68 which could be justified by the cytotoxicity of this specific class of pharmaceutical compounds delgado and co workers studied the removal of cyclophosphamide in a membrane bioreactor under different operating conditions and verified that slightly higher removal efficiencies were obtained when the period of adaptation of the microorganisms to the cocktail of pharmaceuticals was longer 80 for 2 7 times the srt versus 80 for 1 6 times srt table 6 61 furthermore raising the srt up to 70 days they have concluded that cyclophosphamide was not supposedly retained by the membrane during filtration because similar cyclophosphamide concentrations were obtained in the permeate and supernatant whatever its degree of fouling 61 68 zaviska et al have also demonstrated the importance of microorganisms acclimation to achieve better degradation of cyclophosphamide in wastewaters 60 they observed a significant decrease on cyclophosphamide concentration after 20 days reaching 50 removal before 20 days none or negligible removal was recorded 60 the fact that there are very limited studies regarding the impact of srt in cytostatics degradation by mbr makes it difficult to know which is the best time to improve the performance of the process although cyclophosphamide showed to have higher degradations with higher srt some compounds have been proven not to show that trend such as ibuprofen bezafibrate naproxen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole srt 10 80 days 7 69 thus further studies regarding this topic are of utmost importance in order to improve srt times for all the cytostatics individually and in mixture 4 3 hydraulic retention time hrt is the time that a certain volume of wastewater is inside the mbr system in contact with the biomass previous studies suggest that a minimum hrt is required to ensure pollutants degradation c a 5 h 59 above which only marginal effects on their removal would be expected 70 72 hrts between 8 h 66 and 98 h 65 have been used for cytostatics removal from wastewaters table 6 but no justification has been provided attending on the specificity of this class of micropollutants of relatively high cytotoxicity the study of the influence of hrt on their removal rates would be of paramount importance but none of the published studies focus on this matter for instance lenz and co workers have studied the removal of platinum compounds in a mbr operating at a hrt of 20 24 h and concluded that the persistent presence of these cytostatics in the effluent of the mbr system was probably a consequence of the short contact time between wastewater and activated sludge low hrt 64 still rejection is not higher for all compounds with the increase of the hrt 7 actually some studies regarding other pharmaceuticals e g ibuprofen naproxen erythromycin acetaminophen bezafibrate ofloxacin gemfibrozil and metronidazole revealed that hrt in the range of 12 h 24 h did not affect the quality of the final effluent 71 72 as previously mentioned the impact of hrt on cytostatics removal would be a valued topic for the scientific community 4 4 other operating conditions temperature is other relevant parameter in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters using mbrs in fact temperature may directly impact sorption of micropollutants and metabolic activity it has been demonstrated that the removal of most hydrophobic compounds logd 3 is stable in the range of 10 c to 35 c whereas the removal of the others may significantly vary for temperatures below and above 20 c 73 in any case temperatures above 35 c generally lead to a clear decline in the removal rate due to the decreased metabolic activity and sludge disintegration furthermore an enhancement in the soluble microbial products has been noticed by authors at these high temperatures which further contributes to membrane fouling 74 although the temperature of the experiments performed with cytostatics has not always been specified the available data is in line with the range defined above 10 c to 35 c table 6 this means that the investigation on the removal of anthracyclines e g doxorubicin and platinum compounds are expectedly being performed under stable conditions i e no effect of the temperature on the process performance is envisaged conversely cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil are hydrophilic and their removal performance may vary with the temperature in the range between 10 c and 35 c therefore a study of the effect of the temperature on the removal of hydrophilic cytostatics is strongly advised in future investigations although ph 6 7 is generally recommended for biological treatments different ph conditions could be used taking into account the physico chemical properties of the target pollutants and wastewaters previous studies point out that ph plays a significant role in the removal efficiency of ionizable pharmaceuticals the slightly reduction of the ph is expected to lead to an increase in the hydrophobicity and to an increase in the biodegradation performances of adsorbed pollutants 75 76 conversely results in the literature suggest that no impact of the ph on the removal of non ionizable pollutants is expected 7 it is recommended to take this into account in future studies 4 5 target cytostatics the functional groups of the target compounds play a significant part in the removal efficiency usually aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds having electron donating group are readily biodegraded whereas polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing group are relatively difficult to degrade 77 78 cyclophosphamide is currently the most studied cytostatic table 6 some works indicate that cyclophosphamide is poorly biodegradable removals below 50 60 65 66 the presence of multi electron withdrawing groups e g chlorine nitrogen and a cyclic structure within the molecule of cyclophosphamide may justify the lower removal rates attained similarly to what has been verified for other pollutants 79 80 in contrast delgado and co workers have experimentally demonstrated that a removal above 80 can be achieved for cyclophosphamide using a mbr and wang et al achieved removals up to 95 6 using a anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr 20 concerning the removal mechanism it seems that adsorption of cyclophosphamide on sludge flocs and its biodegradation are both affecting the overall process performance 61 68 azathioprine flutamide and mitotane were also mainly removed through these mechanisms 23 regarding fluorouracil and doxorubicin complete elimination has been reported 20 62 64 81 investigations with radio labelled equivalents of these cytostatics showed that the adsorption of fluorouracil on sludge is marginal and at least one part of fluorouracil is biodegraded 62 81 regarding anthracyclines e g doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin adsorption on suspended solids seemed to be the major elimination pathway 62 this was somewhat expected since for instance doxorubicin has multi aromatic rings in its molecular structure anticipating biological persistency the removal of platinum compounds from wastewater using mbr was exploited by lenz et al being achieved a maximum of 65 elimination 64 the molecular structure of platinum compounds is complex and the authors concluded that their elimination is due to i removal of the solid constituents of wastewater and ii their adsorption on activated sludge regarding methotrexate epirubicin and tamoxifen all of them were more than 95 6 removed from synthetic wastewater being epirubicin and tamoxifen mainly removed by adsorption to anaerobic sludge and methotrexate by biodegradation 20 5 hybrid technologies the results suggest that if a membrane process is applied an effective treatment of the retentate produced is always required actually this retentate stream is highly concentrated in micropollutants and it was found to induce acute toxicity to freshwater crustaceans 24 nevertheless investigations have been only focused on the permeate stream aiming at producing a high quality effluent for further disposal an example is the work of verliefde et al who investigated the removal efficiency of cyclophosphamide from wastewaters through the combination of nf with granular activated carbon gac 25 the authors reported global removals higher than 98 even with the short empty bed contact time used 3 min this high performance is due to the removal of most of the higher mw s natural organic matter in the nf leading to less competition for adsorption sites on activated carbon and to less pore blocking this results in lower investment costs for gac filtration as gac lifetime could theoretically be extended up to a factor of 100 according to the literature 25 wang and co workers also studied the efficacy of coupling nf or ro to a mbr system on the removal of cyclophosphamide 30 they proved that ro membrane can provide excellent rejections 90 over maximum of 60 rejection with nf membrane 30 despite all advantages of combining systems the disposal of the retentate stream remains a challenge of concern the concept of zero liquid discharge zld has been investigated which aims at decreasing the volume of concentrated stream by operating at 99 recovery however it has been shown that the rejections of pharmaceuticals by nf membranes can significantly decrease when operated at high feed water recoveries i e reducing the volume of the concentrated stream negatively impacts the permeate quality 25 current findings point out that advances in wastewater treatment using mbr can provide a suitable approach for lowering cytostatic concentrations before discharge into the aqueous environment however a tertiary treatment is always needed if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted 61 64 in addition the treatment of the toxic sludge must be considered 61 62 for instance by incineration in this sense lenz et al studied the performance of coupling mbr with adsorption to activated carbon and or uv radiation processes in the treatment of hospital wastewaters containing platinum cytostatics 64 they verified that the combination of mbr with uv radiation led to further 60 carboplatin elimination the cytostatic predominant in the mbr effluent despite of resulting on a negligible reduction of the total pt concentration the combination of mbr with uv radiation followed by adsorption on activated carbon resulted in a reduction of the total pt concentration but of lesser extent compared to that obtained by combining mbr with adsorption only probably due to the low affinity of oxidation products to activated carbon 64 uv radiation was also exploited as a mbr post treatment by köhler and co workers 66 the authors assessed the performance of uv low pressure lp and medium pressure mp lamps in the absence or presence of h2o2 as chemical oxidant in the elimination of cyclophosphamide they found that a large amount of electrical energy is required if uv radiation is applied in the absence of h2o2 they also concluded that the lp lamp in combination with 1 11 g h2o2 l allowed achieving better cyclophosphamide degradation efficiencies than mp lamp c a 97 versus 45 when operated under the same electrical energy inputs actually around 90 of the uvc irradiation of the lp lamp over 5 10 of the mp lamp is emitted at 254 nm which is an excellent wavelength for h2o2 irradiation to photo induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly oxidant and non selective this thus has a great impact in the elimination of pollutants as cyclophosphamide whose degradation is more dependent on the chemical oxidation than direct photolysis i e on the h2o2 dosage and the subsequent oxidation through hydroxyl radicals 66 the combination of an advanced oxidation process aop adsorption ultrasounds and others have also been studied as tertiary treatments with very promising results for several pharmaceuticals 14 16 the performance of photocatalysis electrooxidation persulfate chlorination ozonation and h2o2 for cytostatic removals from wastewater were already studied being h2o2 based technologies electrooxidation and photocatalysis the most efficient processes in terms of cytostatic removal however o3 and h2o2 based processes generally lead to less toxic compounds and their application in current facilities is easier janssens and co workers found that etoposide and paclitaxel were completely removed after the combination of nf with direct photolysis 83 the combination of a membrane process prior to aops may increase pollutant concentration and remove other interferents from the water less complex matrix reducing possible scavenging reactions and leading to better oxidation results 5 82 on the other side researchers found a possible synergistic effect between the matrix constituents and contaminant degradation 84 85 in this case the implementation of a membrane process after an aops could be valued janssens and co workers also studied the efficacy of an hybrid system putting together the high degradation rates obtained with suspended photocatalyst and the separation properties of a ceramic membrane for the removal of cytostatics from wastewaters 23 although this system could possibly remove these compounds from wastewaters future work should be conducted in order to manufacture composite polymeric membranes protected by a ceramic layer with lower pore size allowing a successful elimination of cytostatics 23 moninari and co workers studied the elimination of tamoxifen by membrane photoreactors using suspended polycrystalline tio2 as catalyst they concluded that the photocatalytic process allowed a total elimination of the drug in about 15 min however the flat sheet nf membrane ntr 7410 employed in the membrane photoreactor did not show any rejection for tamoxifen 86 membrane fouling concentration polarization or low membrane maintenance could have influenced the results although chlorination shows promising results in the removal of several pharmaceuticals from wastewater and is a process which is already implemented in some wwtp all over the world 87 88 it has the disadvantage of generating halogenated products with high toxicity 5 the implementation of a membrane process after chlorination in the facilities which use it as tertiary treatment could be able to diminish the toxicity of the effluents this suggests that much more research is needed aiming at effectively treating wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals especially cytostatics by membrane systems both as isolated units and combined with other processes 6 life cycle assessment and operating costs life cycle assessment lca has emerged as a crucial tool for assessing the net impact difference between the generated and avoided impacts to the environment due to the implementation of a certain technology for water treatment avoiding the problem shift and promoting sustainable water treatment processes the environmental burden includes all type of impacts to the environment e g depletion of natural resources energy consumption pollutants emission to land water and air human carcinogenic toxicity human non carcinogenic toxicity and marine ecotoxicity coming from any step of the process extraction and preparation of raw materials manufacture distribution operation use repair upgrade maintenance and final disposal or recycling only one reference dealing with the lca for the treatment of wastewaters containing cytostatics by membrane based processes was found in the literature 64 furthermore the study has only focused on the operation phase of the process including chemical and energy demands the authors concluded that uv technology may not be a suitable choice to treat a mbr effluent from an environmental point of view unless a significant influence from pollutants depletion on lca results is observed 64 actually electricity consumption in uv technologies is very high around two thirds of the total generated environmental impacts and it needs to be compensated by a proper enhancement of the avoided environmental impacts through the effective degradation of highly toxic cytostatics aiming at achieving a positive net impact 64 however many other points should be taken into account to perform a complete lca analysis which is crucial for decision makers materials chosen for membrane production manufacturing itself transportation including membrane casting and module assembly recycling of membranes and end of life disposal options regarding the material of the membranes polymeric ones are of particular interest due to their small footprints cost effectiveness and ease of production another aspect relies on the chemicals used during the production of membranes as well as the waste and by products generated usually toxic solvents are employed and due to this process over 50 billion liters of contaminated water is discharge annually green solvents e g tributyl o acetyl citrate organic carbonates etc and bio based polymers e g cellulose acetate have been proved to significant reduce environmental impact by up to 35 therefore the choice of each chemical used for polymer production as well as the polymer and the source of electricity should be carefully studied if the production of a bio based polymer has environmentally unfriendly steps substitution may increase costs 89 yadav and co workers studied the environmental impact of different polymer membranes in hollow fiber configuration they concluded that polyvinylidene fluoride n methyl 2 pyrrolidonesystem polymer had the highest environmental cost 766 functional unit mainly due to adverse global warming and human toxicity impacts and polysulfone dimethylacetamide the lowest one 327 functional unit 89 membranes have some environmental issues being the energy demand identified as one of the most overwhelming contributors to environmental impacts such as climate change or fossil resource depletion 90 in fact ro uf and nf membranes are the processes requiring the lowest investment but the highest energy and maintenance costs among those processes reviewed in this paper energy costs have been reported to be higher for uf and ro 30 of the total costs followed by nf 9 gac 4 and mbr 4 5 91 regarding maintenance costs are higher for gac 74 5 followed by nf 64 uf and ro 23 and mbr 0 5 91 another major challenge of membranes is their relatively short lifetime usually 5 10 years which leads to the generation of tonnes of membrane waste annually that is landfilled or to a lesser extent incinerated 92 therefore current efforts have been focused on prolonging the membrane life cycle for example by recycling of ro into nf and uf membranes 90 lawler and co workers conducted a conceptual study of six different alternatives of end of life ro management routes and concluded that the recycling process is more environmentally favorable to landfill disposal regardless of the transportation distance required after membrane direct reusing over one year 93 moreover incineration was found to provide the greatest benefit in terms of direct reduction of waste to landfill at the expense of increased greenhouse gas emissions 93 in the case of mbr the energy costs are around 60 70 of the overall operating costs and are mainly associated to the aeration of the tank to mitigate membrane fouling 94 95 some strategies to reduce costs with aeration are course bubbling aeration for constant membrane cleaning 95 better aeration regime 96 air cycling or intermittent bubbling 94 in the case of anaerobic mbrs operating costs can be absolutely compensated by biogas recuperation 97 however membrane price is still the achilles heel of mbr process membrane costs are ten times higher than energy costs 98 furthermore although mbrs are more sustainable technologies than conventional activated sludge anaerobic mbr could have higher environmental impacts if upstream or downstream polishing steps to remove dissolved methane and sulfide are not considered 99 100 sulfide can be removed from anaerobic mbr permeate by chemical coagulation 101 regarding dissolved methane vacuum assisted degassing tanks and stripping towers appear to have better potential for its sustainable removal 102 104 an upstream alternative for dissolved methane and sulfite removal consists in the combination of primary sedimentation with anaerobic digestion 101 foglia and co workers proposed three scenarios to provide benefits in most impact categories replacing conventional activated sludge with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket as biological treatment in anaerobic mbr showed as a promising alternative this combination gives relatively higher environmental benefits than the other proposed scenarios uv disinfection at higher uv dose and chemical disinfection using peracetic acid to reduce environmental impact in climate change 28 fossil fuel depletion 31 mineral resource depletion 52 and terrestrial ecotoxicity however between the three scenarios this was the one with the highest overall costs principally owing to the replacement of membrane modules 24 of the total cost 105 this reflection highlights the importance of a deeper lca to support decision making when considering possible implementation or upgrading scenarios in wwtps for water cleaning 7 future perspectives although there are a limited number of original papers regarding membrane based processes for cytostatics removal from waters these have been proved to be promising alternatives to apply in wwtps as an additional treatment to avoid these pharmaceuticals from entering the environment and pose risks focusing on cyclophosphamide which was the most studied compound when membrane based technologies are applied highly variable results are obtained fig 3 there are many factors which can explain these results i the type of membrane used material mwco configuration etc ii the conditions of operation temperature ph hrt srt etc iii the maintenance of the membrane iv the possibility of fouling and concentration polarization iv the matrix used in the studies etc still removals around 100 were achieved coupling a nf membrane with an anombr 20 25 being around 70 of the results obtained with 60 removals for cyclophosphamide using nf ro and mbr technologies which seems to be slightly higher than the average removal obtained for this compound in a portuguese wwtp with uv as tertiary treatment 106 mbrs showed very high potential and its applicability with fo membranes showed the high potential of this technique 95 6 removal for eight cytostatics the fact that there is only one study which uses fo membranes for cytostatics removal as well as ro membranes demonstrates the lack of studies on this topic and the need for more research 20 30 when hybrid technologies were studied for cyclophosphamide the rejections obtained were all 90 25 30 66 which clearly demonstrates that the combination of a membrane process with another removal technology not only allows a higher removal of the contaminant but also their degradation depending on the process chosen in author s perspective the number of cytostatics that were studied is still very limited actually information regarding the efficacy of membrane based technologies for some of the riskier compounds is not available yet e g mycophenolic acid bicalutamide mycophenolate mofetil tegafur vinorelbine and gemcitabine 2 107 111 more tests regarding membrane processes for cytostatics would be valuable for the scientific community in which several membranes and conditions should be tested their combination with other processes such as aops would be a perfect match for higher removals and further degradation of the cytostatics that are retained in the membranes sludge another aspect of relevance is the study of effluents toxicity since these pharmaceutical byproducts can be more toxic than the original ones 112 8 conclusions nf membranes have shown to provide high rejection efficiencies for cytostatics but the process is highly dependent on different factors regarding their physico chemical properties i moderate to high rejections are expected for uncharged and hydrophilic cytostatics with mw higher than the mwco of the membrane being size exclusion the predominant mechanism ii high to very high rejections are expected for charged cytostatics at typical feed water ph values being charge repulsion the main mechanism involved in the process and iii low to moderate rejections are expected for hydrophobic cytostatics and the hydrophobic interactions are indicated as the controlling step the presence of natural organic matter on natural wastewaters seems to positively impact the rejection of some cytostatics of most concern namely cyclophosphamide 60 versus 20 40 for ultrapure water no obvious effect of the initial pollutant concentration and ionic strength on rejections of uncharged cytostatics was observed nevertheless further investigations are required particularly at concentrations lower than the ones usually tested μg l level and also considering charged cytostatics for which impacts on rejection efficiencies are expected according to the literature ro membranes provided excellent rejections for cyclophosphamide which is classified as carcinogenic to humans regardless of the operating conditions notwithstanding the application of nf or ro membranes isolated or combined with other technologies for the treatment of wastewaters containing cytostatics still faces a challenge of concern the disposal of the retentate stream which is highly concentrated in micropollutants and it was found to induce acute toxicity to freshwater crustaceans furthermore their high energy demand results in a strong impact to the environment e g climate change or fossil resource depletion which needs to be compensated by an adequate reduction of the avoided impacts namely by the production of a high quality permeate another challenge is the seeking for sustainable recycling alternatives for end of life membranes keeping in mind that the direct reuse is the most environmentally friendly option regarding mbrs the presence of certain functional groups in the molecular structure of the target compounds strongly impacts their biodegradability polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing groups are relatively difficult to degrade e g cyclophosphamide anthracyclines and platinum cytostatics anyway relatively high removal efficiencies may be achieved even for these cytostatics if microorganisms acclimation is ensured typically higher srt are needed for the degradation of cytostatics 30 to 70 days moreover there are still gaps on the study of the effect of hrt on cytostatics removal by mbr that warrant further studies furthermore the impact of the operating temperature on the removal of hydrophilic cytostatics is still an unsolved question current findings on the removal of cytostatics by mbrs indicate that this technology could efficiently eliminate cytostatics but a tertiary treatment must be considered if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted in addition the treatment of the sludge contaminated with cytostatics and other cytotoxic compounds is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as

13042,cytostatics are a class of pharmaceuticals of major concern due to their increasing consumption in cancer therapy their resistance to conventional wastewater treatment processes and their potential carcinogenicity to any eukaryotic organism the ubiquitous presence of cytostatics on effluents from wastewater treatment plants and natural water streams has raised concerns about environmental integrity resilience and sustainability therefore the seeking for a treatment solution to mitigate their entrance spread and accumulation in the environment is urgent besides the well known tertiary treatments of sorption by activated carbon or even more recent ones such as ozonation membrane processes are advanced treatment technologies with high potential benefits since they are known to provide high removal rates for low molecular weight organic pollutants and effluents of excellent quality for the first time this work intends to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of membrane based processes as stand alone units or combined with other technologies for the treatment of wastewaters and waters contaminated with cytostatics information on the influence of operating conditions on process efficiency removal mechanisms and toxicity of the generated effluents are discussed in detail while the current gaps are highlighted furthermore relevant information regarding the implementation of membrane technologies for cytostatics depletion from an economical and environmental perspective is given at first hand keywords cytostatics membrane separation membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment life cycle assessment 1 introduction cytostatics are plant derived or synthetic pharmaceuticals used in different treatment procedures including chemotherapy one of the main therapies for cancer disease 1 they act by affecting the cells metabolism exterminating cancerous cells however cytostatics are not specific for them interfering also with the viability of healthy tissues after being administered these compounds are excreted by the patients kidneys and bile ending up in the wastewater treatment plants wwtp coming both from the hospitals and their homes 2 the inefficacy of conventional wwtps to degrade cytotoxic compounds along with the environmental risk associated to them 3 4 call for the implementation of efficient technologies for their removal in wwtps prior to their discharge chlorination and electrooxidation seem to be not suitable for cytostatics removal as harmful transformation products are generated 5 although o3 and h2o2 based processes have generally yielded to less toxic products some cytostatics of concern were found to be partially refractory to these technologies e g cyclophosphamide 5 membrane based processes are an attractive option for the removal of cytostatics due to their high performance on the removal of low molecular weight mw organic pollutants their reliability compared with conventional processes aligned with the production of effluents of excellent quality their modularity and ability to be integrated with other treatment technologies 6 7 studies have already been published with regard to the application of membrane based processes on the removal of cytostatics 7 8 however no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive analysis of the findings on the treatment of waters and wastewaters containing cytostatics using membrane based processes by understanding the factors affecting the processes performance the removal mechanisms the quality of the effluents and environmental footprints indeed none review article focusing on the removal of cytostatics by membrane processes has been published so far for the first time this work aims to fill this major gap by compiling and giving a comprehensive review on the use of membrane separation techniques and their combination with other processes for the elimination of cytostatics in aqueous phase furthermore the main critical points to have into consideration on the implementation of the new technologies are addressed from an economical and environmental life cycle assessment perspective up to the authors best knowledge there are no life cycle assessment lca reviews related to the exploitation and implementation of membrane processes as advanced treatment technologies for cytostatics in wastewaters the originality and impact of the present review rely on the provision of consolidated information regarding the design and optimization of a high potential treatment process membrane technology for dealing with one of the highest global threats of our water systems cytostatics 9 this is crucial to systematize current doubts and to guide towards the development of research addressing questions of scientific and technical interest for experts in this field of research 2 literature search the selected articles were extracted from the core collection in the web of science wos considering all the published papers until february 2022 keywords for the research were cytostatics antineoplastic anticancer separation membrane filtration nanofiltration ultrafiltration osmosis membrane bioreactor mbr and water a total of twenty original papers were obtained after applying the exclusion criteria non original research articles publications that are not considered full reports and papers not written in english between the publications found six are related to nf and ro ten to mbr and seven to hybrid technologies combination of membrane based technologies and other processes regarding the cytostatics studied cyclophosphamide was by far the one described in the highest number of papers thirteen being present in 40 of the studies found followed by fluorouracil with three studies and paclitaxel etoposide ifosfamide and tamoxifen with two studies each fig 1 the other cytostatics are present in one study each capecitabine cytarabine platinum compounds doxorubicin azathioprine methotrexate epirubicin flutamide mitotane and ifosfamide mbr is also a very promising technology which has been widely applied worldwide and for which the rejection of cytostatics has been studied a total of ten papers were found studying the rejection of cyclophosphamide ifosfamide platinum compounds fluorouracil doxorubicin azathioprine methotrexate epirubicin flutamide mitotane and tamoxifen by mbr systems usually membrane processes are coupled with other technologies thus some studies regarding hybrid technologies were found for cytostatic removal from wastewaters being cyclophosphamide the most studied cytostatic in these works three studies followed by platinum compounds etoposide and paclitaxel mentioned in one work each 3 membranes in the last decades membrane processes have been increasingly used in the reclamation reuse of wastewaters and in the treatment of water for human consumption lately there is a wide range of water contaminants that membranes have been proposed to remove such as pahs 10 neonicotinoids 11 dyes 12 microplastics 13 among others 14 17 there are several types of membrane technologies such as membrane distillation forward osmosis fo electro dialysis pervaporation and pressure driven technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 18 19 the main advantages and disadvantages of each process are described in table 1 analyzing this information pressure driven technologies appear to be the best option to study cytostatics removal from wastewaters since they allow the rejection of low mw compounds are already widely applied at large scale aiming their introduction in wwtp facilities and have several membrane types which can be chosen according to the contaminants to eliminate the selection of the membrane process is usually dependent on several factors the mw of the contaminant molecular weight cut off mwco of the membrane the membrane configuration the membrane material among others the mw of cytostatics usually ranges from 100 900 da table 2 thus nf and ro seem to have the most adequate membranes to apply with this aim which mwco varies from 100 5000 da fig 2 nf and ro high pressure membranes have a wide application in the removal of pharmaceuticals from contaminated streams due to their complete or nearly complete efficiency and their easily combination with other removal degradation technologies 7 however the process is strongly dependent on solute physico chemical properties more details are provided in the following sections nf ro were the most investigated membranes in the removal of cytostatics from contaminated streams still other membranes were used for cytostatics rejection a fo membrane was tested for eight cytostatics in synthetic domestic wastewater cyclophosphamide doxorubicin epirubicin methotrexate tamoxifen mitotane azathioprine and flutamide but negligible rejections were attained for mitotane and flutamide the other cytostatics showed rejections 95 for having mw 370 da 20 verliefde and co workers tested nf membranes for pharmaceuticals removal from surface water after a pre treatment with an uf membrane they found that cyclophosphamide which was among the target pharmaceuticals was not removed at all 21 janssens and co workers studied the efficacy of a photocatalysis membrane reactor using a ceramic membrane mwco 200 1000 da but they assumed that the low mw of cytostatics makes polymeric membranes a better attraction 22 23 attending on the high toxicity of cytostatics and the high potential of membrane technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the removal of cytostatics from water by nf and ro and the individual contributions of the influencing factors are herein fully discussed this analysis aims at providing a basis for selecting the appropriate treatment approach removal system and conditions for the removal of a specific or a group of cytostatics from contaminated streams 3 1 nanofiltration nf up to author s best knowledge only six documents studying the removal of cytostatics from water by nf membranes are found in the literature table 3 the rejection of a solute by a nf membrane can occur through different mechanisms size exclusion sieving steric effects electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions the following sections try to explain the different mechanisms that play a role in cytostatics rejections by nf membranes under different experimental conditions as well as the influence of membrane materials and configurations on cytostatics removal from waters wastewaters 3 1 1 the effect of membrane materials in terms of membrane material make up although all the studies found mention the composition of the membranes used there is no clear information regarding the effect of the materials in cytostatics removal from waters usually pressure driven membrane processes use organic polymer based membranes polyethylene polytetrafluorethylene polypropylene cellulose etc 18 which were used in the published studies there are three studies which compare the efficacy of two membranes 21 24 25 cristóvão and co workers compared the rejection of paclitaxel etoposide cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide using both nf270 and desal 5dk 24 26 both membranes are thin composite polymeric membranes with a polysulphone support layer and are negatively charged at neutral ph with the main difference in their mwco 300 da for the nf270 and 150 300 da for desal 5dk table 4 which the authors justified as the reason for better results using desal 5dk verliefde and co workers compared the removal efficiency of trisep ts 80 and desal hl for cyclophosphamide 21 25 both membranes were thin film composite membranes with a cross linked aromatic polyamide top layer with some differences between them trisep ts 80 had a higher negative surface charge was more hydrophobic and with less oxygen content according to the manufacturer of the membranes trisep ts 80 was especially engineered for its low fouling characteristics which was proved by the authors when the effect of fouling on permeate flux was studied 21 in terms of cytostatic removal trisep ts 80 showed slightly higher rejections than desal hl due to its lower mwco another work developed by janssens and co workers studied the degradation of cytostatics using a photocatalytic membrane reactor with a ceramic membrane although this membrane presents higher resistance than polymeric ones their larger pore size is not effective for cytostatics retention 23 cellulose based membranes thin film composite membranes ceramic membranes metal oxide membranes carbon based membranes among others have already been studied for water purification 27 polymer membranes are by far the most widely applied especially in large scale operations however fouling is one of their biggest disadvantages the modification of these membranes structures by adding materials that contain inorganic fillers in the organic matrix is one of the answers to improve these membranes performance recent studies have demonstrated the high efficiency of mixed matrix membranes made with both organic and inorganic nanomaterials for water cleaning processes using nf and ro technologies 28 although they provided very promising results there are still some limitations that need to be overcome especially regarding their cost when compared to other membranes 27 28 the development of low mwco membranes with higher resistance e g polymeric membranes protected by ceramic layer could be a promising strategy for large scale experiments 23 still for first experiments the applicability of these easily commercially available membranes seemed to be a good choice therefore information regarding the influence in membrane composition on cytostatics rejection is still scarce and more studies regarding this topic should be done 3 1 2 membrane configuration another aspect that influences the performance of the process especially for large scale equipment is the membrane configuration there are essentially four types of membrane modules plate and frame tubular spiral wound and hollow fiber 18 spiral wound module is the most applied module in ro and nf membranes with easily replacement of module elements and scaled up for large equipment 18 the main disadvantage of this configuration is the fact that it has a relatively high potential for fouling and it is not very easily cleaned 18 hollow fiber modules are also a good option for wwtp implementation especially due to their ability to house large membrane areas and the high packing density however they need a much higher area to be constructed and also have high potential for fouling 18 29 regarding the papers found in this review three of them used flat sheet membrane modules 21 24 30 two of them used spiral wound modules 25 26 and one paper used a capillary module 31 which is similar to hollow fiber module differentiating by the dimension of the fibers 32 however none of the studies have a deep analysis on the impact of the membrane configuration chosen it is important to choose the most likely membrane to the one that would probably be applied in large scale facilities according to the configuration of the system verliefde and co workers found out that the rejections obtained for cytostatic removal using a small flat sheet membrane were lower than the ones using a spiral wound configuration membrane which they justified by the hydrodynamic conditions in the sepa cell 21 25 on the other side cristóvão and co workers studied the rejection of the same cytostatics in a desal 5dk lab scale flat sheet membrane and desal 5dk pilot scale spiral wound membrane modules achieving similar rejections in both cases 24 26 ribera and co workers also concluded that nf270 membrane showed similar results in the degradation of several pharmaceuticals when used flat sheet lab scale and spiral wound pilot scale configurations which may strength the already published studies regarding future applicability 33 working with the same recovery and the same permeate flux than the ones predicted to be used in the full scale plant had also been proved to be of utmost importance 33 3 1 3 physico chemical properties of target cytostatics and membranes in these studies only six cytostatics have been considered as solutes their physico chemical properties are compiled in table 2 as shown the mw of the target cytostatics varied from 130 08 g mol fluorouracil to 853 91 g mol paclitaxel the mw is a common descriptor of the molecular size and therefore it is one of the main relevant parameters influencing the performance of membrane processes as previously mentioned typically size exclusion sieving steric effect is responsible for rejection of uncharged and hydrophilic solutes 7 34 taking into account that most of the membranes are hydrophobic and negatively charged at working ph values table 4 moderate to high rejections are expected for molecules with mw higher than the mwco of the membrane table 5 cristóvão and co workers studied the rejection of four cytostatics cyclophosphamide ifosfamide etoposide and paclitaxel by two different nf membranes nf270 and desal 5dk 24 authors showed that etoposide mw 588 56 g mol and paclitaxel mw 853 91 g mol were more efficiently removed than cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide mw 261 09 g mol by nf270 mwco 300 g mol and desal 5dk mwco 150 300 g mol membranes rejections higher than 91 were achieved in all experiments table 3 24 they also demonstrated that the rejection of etoposide by nf270 and desal 5dk membranes was mainly due to size exclusion since etoposide has a low logk ow and is neutral at the experimental ph conditions table 2 24 the same group achieved rejections higher than 96 for capecitabine cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide using a desal 5dk membrane in a pilot scale equipment size exclusion was the main mechanism responsible for their removal 26 this is in line with the predictions for solutes with category ii profile moderate to high rejections governed by size exclusion mechanism table 5 cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide are also hydrophilic and uncharged at typical working ph values table 2 but since they have mws close to the mwco of nf270 and desal 5dk only low to moderate rejections were achieved 43 8 table 2 being steric hindrance effects the most important controlling factor 24 a similar conclusion was drawn by wang et al 30 who reported cyclophosphamide rejections in the range of 20 to 60 by desal 5dk table 3 verliefde and co workers also demonstrated that the process of rejection of cyclophosphamide by trisep ts 80 and desal hl membranes was mainly determined by steric effects being trisep ts 80 slightly more effective due to its lower mwco tables 3 and 4 25 however the membrane process should not be seen as a simple filtration sieving process since the net sorption at the membrane solute interface and the transport inside the membrane can also play a significant role in the removal efficiency and they are affected by other parameters e g charge and hydrophobicity of the solute this supports for instance the findings for paclitaxel 24 as it will be further explained as can be found in table 2 the only charged cytostatic at typical feed water ph values 6 7 is cytarabine therefore it is expected that the rejection of cytarabine negatively charged by nf membranes is predominantly governed by a charge repulsion mechanism being steric effects less pronounced table 5 typically high to very high rejection values are observed for negatively charged solutes because they cannot approach the negatively charged membrane electrostatic repulsion and are therefore prevented from permeating through it 38 39 on the other hand the lower the zeta potential of the membrane i e the higher the surface charge the higher the expected difference in rejection values for charged solutes 25 the only study which exploits the rejection of a charged cytostatic in this case cytarabine by a nf membrane reports rejections of 80 8 table 3 31 none or weak electrostatic interactions are expected between the remaining target cytostatics neutral solutes and the negatively charged nf membranes since their rejections are expectedly governed by steric or hydrophobic effects table 5 regarding other pharmaceuticals radjenovic et al concluded that diclofenac mw 296 da negative charge in neutral ph showed higher rejections when compared to acetaminophen mw 151 da uncharged in neutral ph which was expected due to size exclusion effect however lower rejections were found for gemfibrozil mw 250 da negative charge in neutral ph due to charge repulsion effect this is a very complex topic since different correlations regarding molecular dimensions mw molar volume and rejections have been concluded by the scientific community 35 37 hydrophobicity is expressed by the logarithm of the octanol water partitioning coefficient logk ow for non ionizable solutes and of the ph dependent octanol water distribution coefficient logd ph for ionizable compounds eqs 1 and 2 40 1 for acids log d ph log k ow log 1 10 ph pka 2 for bases log d ph log k ow log 1 10 pka ph the compound is usually referred as hydrophilic if the octanol water coefficient is 2 41 thus all target cytostatics are hydrophilic except paclitaxel table 2 verliefde and co authors studied the removal of cyclophosphamide among other pharmaceuticals by nf and they found that the rejection of negatively charged pharmaceuticals is independent on their hydrophobicity as they are inhibited to approach the membrane surface due to electrostatic repulsions 25 on the other hand they verified that the rejection of positively charged pharmaceuticals decreased with increasing hydrophobicity the attractive forces bring solute and membrane together and the higher the hydrophobicity of the solute the higher its adsorption on the surface or pores of the membrane and the chances of permeation 25 these effects were found to be even more pronounced for the nf membrane of higher contact angle i e higher hydrophobic nature desal hl versus trisep ts 80 table 4 25 the same behavior on the rejection of neutral pharmaceuticals was observed due to the absence of electrostatic repulsions between solute and membrane albeit at much lesser extent 25 however opposite trends for paclitaxel neutral and hydrophobic in comparison to the other cytostatics neutral and hydrophilic were reported by cristóvão et al 24 the authors found that paclitaxel was the cytostatic with the highest observed adsorption on the membrane and simultaneously with the highest rejection values in all experiments 95 table 3 27 the short time frame of the experiments 24 h and or the use of small volumes of water 10 l have been found to lead to an overestimation of the rejections of positive and hydrophobic solutes the measurement of rejections at the equilibrium is crucial to ensure unbiased values 42 44 membrane fouling can also have impact in the rejections due to the hydrophilic nature of the foulants reducing or improving the passage of the compounds through the membrane 45 3 1 4 the effect of water matrix the effect of water matrix in the rejection of cytostatics by nf membranes was investigated in two studies 24 30 cristóvão et al found that the rejections of paclitaxel etoposide cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide by desal 5dk are not impacted by the matrix table 3 24 comerton and co authors also concluded studying other pharmaceuticals that the presence of natural organic matter and cations do not influence the final rejection of other pharmaceuticals 46 however quite low rejections were reported for cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide in laboratory grade water and wwtp effluent using nf270 membrane 45 versus 81 in synthetic urine table 3 24 on the other hand wang and co authors shown that cyclophosphamide rejection from a natural wastewater by desal 5dk was greater than that from ultrapure water 60 versus 20 40 table 3 30 it was concluded that both in depth membrane fouling due to the natural organic matter retention and adsorption on membrane surface and cyclophosphamide interactions with the water matrix may have contributed to the higher rejections 30 47 ion adsorption inside the membrane pores was also proven to strength the size exclusion effect which may justify greater rejections using natural wastewaters rather than ultrapure as seen previously 7 according to the authors perspective further investigations on the removal of cytostatics of different physico chemical properties from natural raw water and wastewaters are recommended in order to design an effective treatment approach for future applications 3 1 5 the effect of cytostatic concentrations in feed water up to date only wang and co workers have studied the influence of the initial concentration of a cytostatic on its rejection by nf membranes 30 they verified that no obvious effect of cyclophosphamide initial concentration on rejections exists in the concentration range used in the experiments 10 to 600 μg l 30 this was indeed previously demonstrated for other emerging pollutants i e the rejection of neutral solutes is independent on their initial concentrations at low concentration ranges 48 45 however delgado and co workers concluded that the presence of toxic compounds cyclophosphamide and its metabolites in a mbr system increased the production of polysaccharides by the sludge rising the fouling phenomena and consequently reducing the rejection of these compounds 47 although cyclophosphamide may serve as a model solute for the description of neutral cytostatics rejections at different initial concentrations a complete lack of knowledge exists for charged cytostatics furthermore previous studies mentioned a significant impact of lowering feed concentrations on rejections of charged pollutants 50 it seems that the shielding of the membrane surface charge becomes more important with increasing feed concentrations which eventually lead to lower and higher rejections for negatively and positively charged solutes respectively this clearly underlies the need for further investigations on charged cytostatics particularly at concentrations lower than the ones usually tested μg l according to table 3 as the concentrations of cytostatics in sewage and surface waters are often in the ng l level 2 3 1 6 the effect of ionic strength regarding the ionic strength wang and co workers showed that the presence of salt had almost no influence on the uncharged cyclophosphamide rejection which is in line with previous studies 30 up to the authors best knowledge this parameter was never studied for charged cytostatics albeit the literature points out that the salt alters the rejection rates of charged solutes due to the shield of the electrostatic potential generated by the membrane and the salting out effect 25 51 52 3 2 reverse osmosis ro so far only one study applying ro membranes in the removal of cytostatics from contaminated waters was found table 3 the experiments were conducted at relatively low concentrations of the cytostatic cyclophosphamide 1 to 10 μg l in ultrapure and natural wastewaters using a polyamide membrane ymaksp3001 30 excellent rejections were attained for cyclophosphamide under all operating conditions 93 neither effects of the cyclophosphamide feed concentration nor of the water matrix were observed table 3 30 the removal mechanism of solutes by ro membranes is complex and poorly understood 7 studies regarding ro should be done for cytostatics with a deep interpretation on the dipole moment hydrophobicity and molecular size of the compounds which are the parameters that generally influences most ro processes 5 4 membrane bioreactors membrane bioreactors are considered the most recent technology for the effective removal of certain pollutants particularly micropollutants from wastewaters it has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional activated sludge treatment by combining biological treatment and membrane filtration in a single step process while avoiding the need of a secondary clarifier this key configuration of mbrs allows hydraulic retention time hrt to be independent on the sludge retention time srt i e slow growing biomass could be maintained in contact with pollutants for longer periods of time contributing to the adaptation of microorganisms to resistant compounds microorganisms are more diversified and with higher physiological capacity 53 the high performance of mbrs over conventional activated sludge is due to the i enhanced adsorption through improved sludge characteristics increased biomass concentration and increased effective surface area ii better biodegradation performances thanks to the high sludge age iii the removal of many contaminants bound to rejectable colloids and particulates by membrane separation 54 59 this section is reserved for the compilation and interpretation of the studies found in the literature regarding the application of mbrs in the treatment of wastewaters contaminated by cytostatics as expected the focus on this specific class of pharmaceuticals is still sparse table 6 despite their recognized potential threat to the environment and human health nevertheless important conclusions have been achieved in this field which should be taken into account in the design of future investigations therefore the following sections intend to give key information regarding the influence of some prime factors on the removal of cytostatics by mbrs as well as the removal mechanism 4 1 mbr configuration and specificities microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes with pore sizes in the range of 0 01 0 1 μm have been the choices for mbrs in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters since the size of microorganism flocs are in the range of 10 100 μm 7 8 the same trend is observed for the treatment of effluents containing cytostatics table 6 just one study applying nf membranes 60 the use of nf membranes over higher mwco membranes mf and uf may represent an advantage on the removal of pollutants with low mws however challenges related to fouling control are faced besides the increased capital and operational costs due to their lower permeability fo membranes have also demonstrated to be promising alternatives to conventional membranes being able to remove small molecules nitrogen and phosphorous 20 there is one study which uses a fo membrane coupled to an anaerobic mbr anombr for the removal of cyclophosphamide azathioprine methotrexate doxorubicin epirubicin flutamide mitotane and tamoxifen from wastewaters 20 regarding the configuration of the mbr both side stream mbrs 61 64 and submerged mbrs 65 66 have been exploited for the removal of cytostatics in the side stream mbr the membrane module is placed outside the bioreactor in the recirculation stream whereas in the submerged configuration the membrane is submerged within the bioreactor the submerged version is more recent it requires less energy and it has the advantage of limiting the membrane fouling by maintaining the activated sludge in suspension through aeration up to date the side stream configuration has been the most used in the treatment of effluents containing cytostatics table 6 the exploitation of the submerged version is encouraged because albeit there are not yet evidences of better removal performances energy and maintenance costs are predictably lower 4 2 sludge retention time srt is among the most significant parameters for mbr operation high srt means that the activated sludge is retained in the mbr for a longer period of time and therefore the microorganisms have the chance for growing and adapting to severe conditions as the presence of biologically persistent compounds this sometimes has a positive impact on the removal of micropollutants but increasing srt beyond a critical point leads to sever fouling and ageing of the membrane high concentration of suspended solids and high energy consumption a srt between 20 and 30 days seems to be sufficient for the removal of the majority of micropollutants 67 in the case of cytostatics a relatively high srt has been used 30 70 days 20 60 61 65 66 68 which could be justified by the cytotoxicity of this specific class of pharmaceutical compounds delgado and co workers studied the removal of cyclophosphamide in a membrane bioreactor under different operating conditions and verified that slightly higher removal efficiencies were obtained when the period of adaptation of the microorganisms to the cocktail of pharmaceuticals was longer 80 for 2 7 times the srt versus 80 for 1 6 times srt table 6 61 furthermore raising the srt up to 70 days they have concluded that cyclophosphamide was not supposedly retained by the membrane during filtration because similar cyclophosphamide concentrations were obtained in the permeate and supernatant whatever its degree of fouling 61 68 zaviska et al have also demonstrated the importance of microorganisms acclimation to achieve better degradation of cyclophosphamide in wastewaters 60 they observed a significant decrease on cyclophosphamide concentration after 20 days reaching 50 removal before 20 days none or negligible removal was recorded 60 the fact that there are very limited studies regarding the impact of srt in cytostatics degradation by mbr makes it difficult to know which is the best time to improve the performance of the process although cyclophosphamide showed to have higher degradations with higher srt some compounds have been proven not to show that trend such as ibuprofen bezafibrate naproxen carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole srt 10 80 days 7 69 thus further studies regarding this topic are of utmost importance in order to improve srt times for all the cytostatics individually and in mixture 4 3 hydraulic retention time hrt is the time that a certain volume of wastewater is inside the mbr system in contact with the biomass previous studies suggest that a minimum hrt is required to ensure pollutants degradation c a 5 h 59 above which only marginal effects on their removal would be expected 70 72 hrts between 8 h 66 and 98 h 65 have been used for cytostatics removal from wastewaters table 6 but no justification has been provided attending on the specificity of this class of micropollutants of relatively high cytotoxicity the study of the influence of hrt on their removal rates would be of paramount importance but none of the published studies focus on this matter for instance lenz and co workers have studied the removal of platinum compounds in a mbr operating at a hrt of 20 24 h and concluded that the persistent presence of these cytostatics in the effluent of the mbr system was probably a consequence of the short contact time between wastewater and activated sludge low hrt 64 still rejection is not higher for all compounds with the increase of the hrt 7 actually some studies regarding other pharmaceuticals e g ibuprofen naproxen erythromycin acetaminophen bezafibrate ofloxacin gemfibrozil and metronidazole revealed that hrt in the range of 12 h 24 h did not affect the quality of the final effluent 71 72 as previously mentioned the impact of hrt on cytostatics removal would be a valued topic for the scientific community 4 4 other operating conditions temperature is other relevant parameter in the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters using mbrs in fact temperature may directly impact sorption of micropollutants and metabolic activity it has been demonstrated that the removal of most hydrophobic compounds logd 3 is stable in the range of 10 c to 35 c whereas the removal of the others may significantly vary for temperatures below and above 20 c 73 in any case temperatures above 35 c generally lead to a clear decline in the removal rate due to the decreased metabolic activity and sludge disintegration furthermore an enhancement in the soluble microbial products has been noticed by authors at these high temperatures which further contributes to membrane fouling 74 although the temperature of the experiments performed with cytostatics has not always been specified the available data is in line with the range defined above 10 c to 35 c table 6 this means that the investigation on the removal of anthracyclines e g doxorubicin and platinum compounds are expectedly being performed under stable conditions i e no effect of the temperature on the process performance is envisaged conversely cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil are hydrophilic and their removal performance may vary with the temperature in the range between 10 c and 35 c therefore a study of the effect of the temperature on the removal of hydrophilic cytostatics is strongly advised in future investigations although ph 6 7 is generally recommended for biological treatments different ph conditions could be used taking into account the physico chemical properties of the target pollutants and wastewaters previous studies point out that ph plays a significant role in the removal efficiency of ionizable pharmaceuticals the slightly reduction of the ph is expected to lead to an increase in the hydrophobicity and to an increase in the biodegradation performances of adsorbed pollutants 75 76 conversely results in the literature suggest that no impact of the ph on the removal of non ionizable pollutants is expected 7 it is recommended to take this into account in future studies 4 5 target cytostatics the functional groups of the target compounds play a significant part in the removal efficiency usually aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds having electron donating group are readily biodegraded whereas polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing group are relatively difficult to degrade 77 78 cyclophosphamide is currently the most studied cytostatic table 6 some works indicate that cyclophosphamide is poorly biodegradable removals below 50 60 65 66 the presence of multi electron withdrawing groups e g chlorine nitrogen and a cyclic structure within the molecule of cyclophosphamide may justify the lower removal rates attained similarly to what has been verified for other pollutants 79 80 in contrast delgado and co workers have experimentally demonstrated that a removal above 80 can be achieved for cyclophosphamide using a mbr and wang et al achieved removals up to 95 6 using a anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr 20 concerning the removal mechanism it seems that adsorption of cyclophosphamide on sludge flocs and its biodegradation are both affecting the overall process performance 61 68 azathioprine flutamide and mitotane were also mainly removed through these mechanisms 23 regarding fluorouracil and doxorubicin complete elimination has been reported 20 62 64 81 investigations with radio labelled equivalents of these cytostatics showed that the adsorption of fluorouracil on sludge is marginal and at least one part of fluorouracil is biodegraded 62 81 regarding anthracyclines e g doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin adsorption on suspended solids seemed to be the major elimination pathway 62 this was somewhat expected since for instance doxorubicin has multi aromatic rings in its molecular structure anticipating biological persistency the removal of platinum compounds from wastewater using mbr was exploited by lenz et al being achieved a maximum of 65 elimination 64 the molecular structure of platinum compounds is complex and the authors concluded that their elimination is due to i removal of the solid constituents of wastewater and ii their adsorption on activated sludge regarding methotrexate epirubicin and tamoxifen all of them were more than 95 6 removed from synthetic wastewater being epirubicin and tamoxifen mainly removed by adsorption to anaerobic sludge and methotrexate by biodegradation 20 5 hybrid technologies the results suggest that if a membrane process is applied an effective treatment of the retentate produced is always required actually this retentate stream is highly concentrated in micropollutants and it was found to induce acute toxicity to freshwater crustaceans 24 nevertheless investigations have been only focused on the permeate stream aiming at producing a high quality effluent for further disposal an example is the work of verliefde et al who investigated the removal efficiency of cyclophosphamide from wastewaters through the combination of nf with granular activated carbon gac 25 the authors reported global removals higher than 98 even with the short empty bed contact time used 3 min this high performance is due to the removal of most of the higher mw s natural organic matter in the nf leading to less competition for adsorption sites on activated carbon and to less pore blocking this results in lower investment costs for gac filtration as gac lifetime could theoretically be extended up to a factor of 100 according to the literature 25 wang and co workers also studied the efficacy of coupling nf or ro to a mbr system on the removal of cyclophosphamide 30 they proved that ro membrane can provide excellent rejections 90 over maximum of 60 rejection with nf membrane 30 despite all advantages of combining systems the disposal of the retentate stream remains a challenge of concern the concept of zero liquid discharge zld has been investigated which aims at decreasing the volume of concentrated stream by operating at 99 recovery however it has been shown that the rejections of pharmaceuticals by nf membranes can significantly decrease when operated at high feed water recoveries i e reducing the volume of the concentrated stream negatively impacts the permeate quality 25 current findings point out that advances in wastewater treatment using mbr can provide a suitable approach for lowering cytostatic concentrations before discharge into the aqueous environment however a tertiary treatment is always needed if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted 61 64 in addition the treatment of the toxic sludge must be considered 61 62 for instance by incineration in this sense lenz et al studied the performance of coupling mbr with adsorption to activated carbon and or uv radiation processes in the treatment of hospital wastewaters containing platinum cytostatics 64 they verified that the combination of mbr with uv radiation led to further 60 carboplatin elimination the cytostatic predominant in the mbr effluent despite of resulting on a negligible reduction of the total pt concentration the combination of mbr with uv radiation followed by adsorption on activated carbon resulted in a reduction of the total pt concentration but of lesser extent compared to that obtained by combining mbr with adsorption only probably due to the low affinity of oxidation products to activated carbon 64 uv radiation was also exploited as a mbr post treatment by köhler and co workers 66 the authors assessed the performance of uv low pressure lp and medium pressure mp lamps in the absence or presence of h2o2 as chemical oxidant in the elimination of cyclophosphamide they found that a large amount of electrical energy is required if uv radiation is applied in the absence of h2o2 they also concluded that the lp lamp in combination with 1 11 g h2o2 l allowed achieving better cyclophosphamide degradation efficiencies than mp lamp c a 97 versus 45 when operated under the same electrical energy inputs actually around 90 of the uvc irradiation of the lp lamp over 5 10 of the mp lamp is emitted at 254 nm which is an excellent wavelength for h2o2 irradiation to photo induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly oxidant and non selective this thus has a great impact in the elimination of pollutants as cyclophosphamide whose degradation is more dependent on the chemical oxidation than direct photolysis i e on the h2o2 dosage and the subsequent oxidation through hydroxyl radicals 66 the combination of an advanced oxidation process aop adsorption ultrasounds and others have also been studied as tertiary treatments with very promising results for several pharmaceuticals 14 16 the performance of photocatalysis electrooxidation persulfate chlorination ozonation and h2o2 for cytostatic removals from wastewater were already studied being h2o2 based technologies electrooxidation and photocatalysis the most efficient processes in terms of cytostatic removal however o3 and h2o2 based processes generally lead to less toxic compounds and their application in current facilities is easier janssens and co workers found that etoposide and paclitaxel were completely removed after the combination of nf with direct photolysis 83 the combination of a membrane process prior to aops may increase pollutant concentration and remove other interferents from the water less complex matrix reducing possible scavenging reactions and leading to better oxidation results 5 82 on the other side researchers found a possible synergistic effect between the matrix constituents and contaminant degradation 84 85 in this case the implementation of a membrane process after an aops could be valued janssens and co workers also studied the efficacy of an hybrid system putting together the high degradation rates obtained with suspended photocatalyst and the separation properties of a ceramic membrane for the removal of cytostatics from wastewaters 23 although this system could possibly remove these compounds from wastewaters future work should be conducted in order to manufacture composite polymeric membranes protected by a ceramic layer with lower pore size allowing a successful elimination of cytostatics 23 moninari and co workers studied the elimination of tamoxifen by membrane photoreactors using suspended polycrystalline tio2 as catalyst they concluded that the photocatalytic process allowed a total elimination of the drug in about 15 min however the flat sheet nf membrane ntr 7410 employed in the membrane photoreactor did not show any rejection for tamoxifen 86 membrane fouling concentration polarization or low membrane maintenance could have influenced the results although chlorination shows promising results in the removal of several pharmaceuticals from wastewater and is a process which is already implemented in some wwtp all over the world 87 88 it has the disadvantage of generating halogenated products with high toxicity 5 the implementation of a membrane process after chlorination in the facilities which use it as tertiary treatment could be able to diminish the toxicity of the effluents this suggests that much more research is needed aiming at effectively treating wastewaters containing pharmaceuticals especially cytostatics by membrane systems both as isolated units and combined with other processes 6 life cycle assessment and operating costs life cycle assessment lca has emerged as a crucial tool for assessing the net impact difference between the generated and avoided impacts to the environment due to the implementation of a certain technology for water treatment avoiding the problem shift and promoting sustainable water treatment processes the environmental burden includes all type of impacts to the environment e g depletion of natural resources energy consumption pollutants emission to land water and air human carcinogenic toxicity human non carcinogenic toxicity and marine ecotoxicity coming from any step of the process extraction and preparation of raw materials manufacture distribution operation use repair upgrade maintenance and final disposal or recycling only one reference dealing with the lca for the treatment of wastewaters containing cytostatics by membrane based processes was found in the literature 64 furthermore the study has only focused on the operation phase of the process including chemical and energy demands the authors concluded that uv technology may not be a suitable choice to treat a mbr effluent from an environmental point of view unless a significant influence from pollutants depletion on lca results is observed 64 actually electricity consumption in uv technologies is very high around two thirds of the total generated environmental impacts and it needs to be compensated by a proper enhancement of the avoided environmental impacts through the effective degradation of highly toxic cytostatics aiming at achieving a positive net impact 64 however many other points should be taken into account to perform a complete lca analysis which is crucial for decision makers materials chosen for membrane production manufacturing itself transportation including membrane casting and module assembly recycling of membranes and end of life disposal options regarding the material of the membranes polymeric ones are of particular interest due to their small footprints cost effectiveness and ease of production another aspect relies on the chemicals used during the production of membranes as well as the waste and by products generated usually toxic solvents are employed and due to this process over 50 billion liters of contaminated water is discharge annually green solvents e g tributyl o acetyl citrate organic carbonates etc and bio based polymers e g cellulose acetate have been proved to significant reduce environmental impact by up to 35 therefore the choice of each chemical used for polymer production as well as the polymer and the source of electricity should be carefully studied if the production of a bio based polymer has environmentally unfriendly steps substitution may increase costs 89 yadav and co workers studied the environmental impact of different polymer membranes in hollow fiber configuration they concluded that polyvinylidene fluoride n methyl 2 pyrrolidonesystem polymer had the highest environmental cost 766 functional unit mainly due to adverse global warming and human toxicity impacts and polysulfone dimethylacetamide the lowest one 327 functional unit 89 membranes have some environmental issues being the energy demand identified as one of the most overwhelming contributors to environmental impacts such as climate change or fossil resource depletion 90 in fact ro uf and nf membranes are the processes requiring the lowest investment but the highest energy and maintenance costs among those processes reviewed in this paper energy costs have been reported to be higher for uf and ro 30 of the total costs followed by nf 9 gac 4 and mbr 4 5 91 regarding maintenance costs are higher for gac 74 5 followed by nf 64 uf and ro 23 and mbr 0 5 91 another major challenge of membranes is their relatively short lifetime usually 5 10 years which leads to the generation of tonnes of membrane waste annually that is landfilled or to a lesser extent incinerated 92 therefore current efforts have been focused on prolonging the membrane life cycle for example by recycling of ro into nf and uf membranes 90 lawler and co workers conducted a conceptual study of six different alternatives of end of life ro management routes and concluded that the recycling process is more environmentally favorable to landfill disposal regardless of the transportation distance required after membrane direct reusing over one year 93 moreover incineration was found to provide the greatest benefit in terms of direct reduction of waste to landfill at the expense of increased greenhouse gas emissions 93 in the case of mbr the energy costs are around 60 70 of the overall operating costs and are mainly associated to the aeration of the tank to mitigate membrane fouling 94 95 some strategies to reduce costs with aeration are course bubbling aeration for constant membrane cleaning 95 better aeration regime 96 air cycling or intermittent bubbling 94 in the case of anaerobic mbrs operating costs can be absolutely compensated by biogas recuperation 97 however membrane price is still the achilles heel of mbr process membrane costs are ten times higher than energy costs 98 furthermore although mbrs are more sustainable technologies than conventional activated sludge anaerobic mbr could have higher environmental impacts if upstream or downstream polishing steps to remove dissolved methane and sulfide are not considered 99 100 sulfide can be removed from anaerobic mbr permeate by chemical coagulation 101 regarding dissolved methane vacuum assisted degassing tanks and stripping towers appear to have better potential for its sustainable removal 102 104 an upstream alternative for dissolved methane and sulfite removal consists in the combination of primary sedimentation with anaerobic digestion 101 foglia and co workers proposed three scenarios to provide benefits in most impact categories replacing conventional activated sludge with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket as biological treatment in anaerobic mbr showed as a promising alternative this combination gives relatively higher environmental benefits than the other proposed scenarios uv disinfection at higher uv dose and chemical disinfection using peracetic acid to reduce environmental impact in climate change 28 fossil fuel depletion 31 mineral resource depletion 52 and terrestrial ecotoxicity however between the three scenarios this was the one with the highest overall costs principally owing to the replacement of membrane modules 24 of the total cost 105 this reflection highlights the importance of a deeper lca to support decision making when considering possible implementation or upgrading scenarios in wwtps for water cleaning 7 future perspectives although there are a limited number of original papers regarding membrane based processes for cytostatics removal from waters these have been proved to be promising alternatives to apply in wwtps as an additional treatment to avoid these pharmaceuticals from entering the environment and pose risks focusing on cyclophosphamide which was the most studied compound when membrane based technologies are applied highly variable results are obtained fig 3 there are many factors which can explain these results i the type of membrane used material mwco configuration etc ii the conditions of operation temperature ph hrt srt etc iii the maintenance of the membrane iv the possibility of fouling and concentration polarization iv the matrix used in the studies etc still removals around 100 were achieved coupling a nf membrane with an anombr 20 25 being around 70 of the results obtained with 60 removals for cyclophosphamide using nf ro and mbr technologies which seems to be slightly higher than the average removal obtained for this compound in a portuguese wwtp with uv as tertiary treatment 106 mbrs showed very high potential and its applicability with fo membranes showed the high potential of this technique 95 6 removal for eight cytostatics the fact that there is only one study which uses fo membranes for cytostatics removal as well as ro membranes demonstrates the lack of studies on this topic and the need for more research 20 30 when hybrid technologies were studied for cyclophosphamide the rejections obtained were all 90 25 30 66 which clearly demonstrates that the combination of a membrane process with another removal technology not only allows a higher removal of the contaminant but also their degradation depending on the process chosen in author s perspective the number of cytostatics that were studied is still very limited actually information regarding the efficacy of membrane based technologies for some of the riskier compounds is not available yet e g mycophenolic acid bicalutamide mycophenolate mofetil tegafur vinorelbine and gemcitabine 2 107 111 more tests regarding membrane processes for cytostatics would be valuable for the scientific community in which several membranes and conditions should be tested their combination with other processes such as aops would be a perfect match for higher removals and further degradation of the cytostatics that are retained in the membranes sludge another aspect of relevance is the study of effluents toxicity since these pharmaceutical byproducts can be more toxic than the original ones 112 8 conclusions nf membranes have shown to provide high rejection efficiencies for cytostatics but the process is highly dependent on different factors regarding their physico chemical properties i moderate to high rejections are expected for uncharged and hydrophilic cytostatics with mw higher than the mwco of the membrane being size exclusion the predominant mechanism ii high to very high rejections are expected for charged cytostatics at typical feed water ph values being charge repulsion the main mechanism involved in the process and iii low to moderate rejections are expected for hydrophobic cytostatics and the hydrophobic interactions are indicated as the controlling step the presence of natural organic matter on natural wastewaters seems to positively impact the rejection of some cytostatics of most concern namely cyclophosphamide 60 versus 20 40 for ultrapure water no obvious effect of the initial pollutant concentration and ionic strength on rejections of uncharged cytostatics was observed nevertheless further investigations are required particularly at concentrations lower than the ones usually tested μg l level and also considering charged cytostatics for which impacts on rejection efficiencies are expected according to the literature ro membranes provided excellent rejections for cyclophosphamide which is classified as carcinogenic to humans regardless of the operating conditions notwithstanding the application of nf or ro membranes isolated or combined with other technologies for the treatment of wastewaters containing cytostatics still faces a challenge of concern the disposal of the retentate stream which is highly concentrated in micropollutants and it was found to induce acute toxicity to freshwater crustaceans furthermore their high energy demand results in a strong impact to the environment e g climate change or fossil resource depletion which needs to be compensated by an adequate reduction of the avoided impacts namely by the production of a high quality permeate another challenge is the seeking for sustainable recycling alternatives for end of life membranes keeping in mind that the direct reuse is the most environmentally friendly option regarding mbrs the presence of certain functional groups in the molecular structure of the target compounds strongly impacts their biodegradability polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing groups are relatively difficult to degrade e g cyclophosphamide anthracyclines and platinum cytostatics anyway relatively high removal efficiencies may be achieved even for these cytostatics if microorganisms acclimation is ensured typically higher srt are needed for the degradation of cytostatics 30 to 70 days moreover there are still gaps on the study of the effect of hrt on cytostatics removal by mbr that warrant further studies furthermore the impact of the operating temperature on the removal of hydrophilic cytostatics is still an unsolved question current findings on the removal of cytostatics by mbrs indicate that this technology could efficiently eliminate cytostatics but a tertiary treatment must be considered if complete elimination of toxicity is targeted in addition the treatment of the sludge contaminated with cytostatics and other cytotoxic compounds is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as

estrone e1 as a steroid hormone highly photosensitive compounds like ndma and tcs were easily degraded by uv 75 and uv h2o2 80 with direct photolysis as the main removal mechanism their removal efficiencies were less affected by the presence of other cecs and the water matrix than the other cecs the effects of competitive adsorption among cecs and the water matrix was more profound for moderately hydrophobic or less hydrophilic compounds e g tmp atz and e1 the laboratory scale results showed the application of a single treatment could not efficiently remove the target cecs hence the combination of treatments was employed in the pilot scale experiments which assessed the effectiveness of uv h2o2 1000 mj cm2 and 4 mg l h2o2 followed by gac empty bed contact time 3 5 28 min in removing target cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations our findings suggest that uv h2o2 followed by gac would serve as an excellent multi barrier for efficiently removing a wide range of cecs in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chemicals of emerging concerns uv uv h2o2 granular activated carbon advanced water treatment pilot scale 1 introduction the occurrence of various classes of chemicals of emerging contaminants cecs such as disinfection by products dbps pharmaceuticals personal care products pcps pesticides hormones etc in domestic wastewater surface water and drinking water is well researched globally 1 2 the elimination of many of these cecs by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes is inefficient leading to their discharge into the aquatic environment and subsequent presence in drinking water 2 4 wastewater effluents are reported to be the primary source of cecs in environmental matrices 4 many of these contaminants have been identified as biologically persistent toxic carcinogenic and endocrine disruptive compounds edcs 5 long term exposure to these various compounds and their mixtures could lead to multiple chronic health concerns 6 many regions are currently facing water stress due to rapid population growth industrialisation urbanisation and climate change 7 wastewater reuse is increasing globally and is now widely practised including in the u s europe asia and africa to overcome water stress 8 the occurrence of many cecs in treated wastewaters raises additional concerns when the wastewater reuse scheme is implemented 9 therefore robust water wastewater treatments are required to prevent the release of cecs into the environment and ensure the contaminant free water necessary for reuse 10 advanced treatment processes such as advanced oxidation processes aops and granular activated carbon gac adsorption are known for their efficiencies and effectiveness in removing organic contaminants in water including pharmaceuticals and hormones 11 ultraviolet uv photolysis and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 oxidation as well as their combined oxidation uv h2o2 could efficiently eliminate certain biologically recalcitrant cecs from wastewater 12 the hydroxyl radicals oh produced by uv h2o2 treatment can break the chemical bonds of several cecs which are persistent to uv treatment 13 the use of uv light with catalyst i e photocatalyst process has been reported to substantially degrade pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water 14 16 although its full scale application is still limited 14 activated carbon has been used widely to efficiently adsorb dbp precursors and certain cecs in water 17 hence gac and uv processes are increasingly seen as two of the most promising solutions for the efficient removal of micropollutants in water and wastewater 18 19 despite previous research on the removal of cecs by advanced treatment processes most studies mainly focused on a group of compounds from one class or one treatment method 3 20 23 dbps 24 26 pesticides and herbicides 27 29 or hormones 30 33 in the past the formation and removal of dbps were not seen as critical issues for wastewater treatment 34 therefore very few studies investigated the simultaneous removal of dbps with other cecs classes e g pharmaceuticals pesticides hormones however with the increasing wastewater reuse globally emerging dbps are becoming a concern for advanced treatment 8 also the majority of the studies were at a laboratory scale using much higher initial cecs concentrations than their actual concentrations in the real world 35 it has been shown that the contaminants behaviour and their removal trends could significantly vary with their initial concentrations highlighting the need for using environmentally relevant concentrations 36 37 more studies on advanced treatment processes for simultaneous removal of a wide range of cecs particularly at their relevant concentrations on a pilot scale would improve our knowledge in designing treatment processes and or upgrading the conventional drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities to achieve efficient removal of cecs hence the specific aims of this research were to 1 assess the efficacy of uv photolysis uv h2o2 oxidation and gac adsorption for the removal of a mixture of different classes of cecs at laboratory and pilot scales and 2 understand the mechanisms and factors affecting cecs removal by the studied treatment processes cecs concentrations and operational parameters were close to the real world scenario for the pilot scale testing to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that investigated the removal of cecs from five different classes by uv h2o2 and gac at laboratory and pilot scales using environmentally realistic concentrations and real world operational parameters to represent the diversity of cecs in the real world five cecs from five different classes i e n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as an emerging dbp trimethoprim tmp as a pharmaceutical triclosan tcs as a pcp atrazine atz as a herbicide and estrone e1 as a steroid hormone were selected as the target cecs these target

it tends to be accumulated in human tissues and is stable in marine sediment for more than 30 years due to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility 3 atz is recorded as one of the world s most

the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted with the addition of h2o2 to the samples and controls immediately before the uv exposure the concentration of h2o2 was set at 3 3 mg l based on the range of hydrogen peroxide dose 3 6 mg l 0 1 mm used in their real world applications 60 62 sodium sulfite in excess was added instantaneously after the experiments to quench the remaining h2o2 in the samples

fine particles then dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h and cooled before use 63 the experiments were conducted in a batch adsorption test activated carbon 2 5 g l was added to milli q water 40 ml spiked with the target cecs at the same initial concentrations as uv and uv h2o2 experiments following the procedure detailed in a previous study 64 these samples were then shaken in a water bath at room temperature at 300 rpm over different contact times 15 30 and 45 min gac adsorption contact times were designed around the range of empty bed contact time ebct in the real gac column applications 65 controlled samples followed the same procedures without the addition of activated carbon to check on the loss of cecs other than by adsorption on activated carbon the experiments were performed at ph 7 5 with the addition of phosphate buffer all experiments were conducted in duplicates at room temperature 2 2 4 sample preparation liquid liquid extraction lle was used to extract ndma from samples to dcm for analysis on a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 66 in this method 2 ml of samples were mixed with 2 ml of dcm in an 8 ml vial the mixture was then vigorously shaken

gc ms analysis this extraction method yielded 70 80 recoveries recovery corrections were applied based on the calculated recoveries of known concentrations of samples undergoing the same lle at the same time as other samples for analysis of tmp tcs atz and e1 samples were directly analysed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms 2 3 pilot scale experiments the pilot scale set up consisted of uv h2o2 units followed by gac columns with a treatment capacity of 1000 l h the pilot plant ran as a side stream process and was located at a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in auckland new zealand the influent water came from a clarified tank after coagulation flocculation unit of the dwtp and it was spiked with a mixture of the selected cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations i e 20 ng l of ndma and 200 ng l of tmp tcs atz and e1 the stock solution containing a mixture of target cecs was injected into the influent system using a materflex peristaltic pump purchased from thermo fisher new zealand the influent had ph of 6 6 and dissolved organic carbon doc of 3 3 mg l the uv and h2o2 dosages applied were 1000 mj cm2 and 4 mg l respectively the uv reactor installed was uv wedeco spektron 15 from xylem new zealand other relevant specifications of the uv reactor are listed in table s1 in supplementary material h2o2 was supplied from ixom nz and was injected into the stream using a peristaltic pump purchased from watson marlow fluid technology group germany the concentration of h2o2 was measured using a pre calibrated h2o2 sensor obtained from grundfos denmark the process flow diagram and treatment units used in the pilot scale experiments are shown in fig 1 in this study only one reactor and one gac column were used for the experiments the effluent from the uv h2o2 treatment was fed to a gac column with a diameter of 15 cm and a bed height of 160 cm gac media was the acticarb bac gs1000n 10 20 mesh from activated carbon technologies ltd new zealand collected from a gac unit at the dwtp the activated carbon media was part of the existing gac unit at the dwtp for around 12 months the pilot gac column was operated in downward flow at a flow rate of 60 l h and velocity of 3 4 m h the ebct was 28 mins the column was equipped with multiple sampling ports i e sampling port 1 2 3 and 4 which corresponded to ebct of 3 5 7 14 and 28 mins respectively the pilot scale set up was running 4 months prior to this test the total test duration was 3 h with 2 h of experiments and an hour of sampling the summary of the experimental parameters used in the laboratory and pilot scale experiments are listed in table 2 water samples 2000 ml in duplicates were collected in amber glass bottles at the influent sampling port a and downstream of uv h2o2 sampling port b and gac gac sampling port 1 to 4 as shown in fig 1 the remaining h2o2 was quenched by excess sodium sulfite immediately upon sampling the samples were then transported to the laboratory and kept in a 4 c refrigerator at ph 5 with the addition of sulfuric acid as recommended by the epa method 1694 67 the samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe in less than 8 days upon sampling 67 the concentrations of cecs ph and dissolved organic carbon doc were analysed for every sample doc was measured by a toc analyser shimadzu model toc vcph ssm 5000a according to the method described by lee et al 34 the spe procedures and analytical methods for the target cecs are explained in the following subsections 2 3 1 solid phase extraction spe a 1000 ml aliquot of each water sample was concentrated by spe the spe for ndma was carried out using thermally modified coconut shell activated carbon as the sorbent material 44 the ndma concentrations in the concentrated samples were analysed by gc ms the spe for tmp tcs atz and e1 were conducted according to the spe method used in an earlier study 68 using waters oasis prime hlb cartridges 6 cc 500 mg alphatech new zealand the cartridges were preconditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml of di water at ph 4 loaded with the samples dried for 15 mins and finally eluted with 10 ml methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml min the eluted samples were then concentrated from 10 ml to 1 ml using a speed vac concentrator thermo scientific new zealand the concentrated samples were analysed on lc ms ms the spe recoveries of the target cecs are listed in table s2 in supplementary material 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of ndma was performed on a gc ms gc 2010 from shimadzu employing an hp5 5ms ultra inert column 29 1 m length 0 25 μm i d 0 25 μm thickness with an analytical method as reported in our earlier published work 44 the analysis of tmp tcs atz and e1 was carried out on a shimadzu lc ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was used to analyse the precursor and the product ions of each compound by employing an ascentis reverse phase amide column 10 cm 2 1 mm 3 μm analysis of tmp and atz both at positive esi mode as well as tcs at negative esi mode were merged into a single analytical method with a binary gradient consisting of 5 mm of ammonium acetate in milli q water a and methanol b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the mobile phase gradient was started with 10 b from 0 01 min to 5 5 min then increased to 50 b at 6 min then further increased to 95 b at 14 5 min and maintained for 2 min before it decreased to 10 b at 17 mins for 5 mins which resulted in the total running time to 22 min a separate method was developed for e1 employing the same column using 0 4 mm of ammonium fluoride buffer in milli q water a and a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol 1 1 b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the total run was 12 min with 85 b the ms acquisition details of target compounds analysed by lc ms ms are listed in supplementary material table s2 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were defined when the ratio between signal to noise s n reached 3 and 10 respectively 44 the lods and loqs of target compounds and their spe recoveries are presented in table s2 in supplementary material 3 results and discussions 3 1 lab scale uv and uv h2o2 controls in all experiments showed a negligible decrease of target cecs which confirmed their removal in the treated samples was due to oxidation by uv and uv h2o2 the removal efficiencies of target compounds by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 are presented in figs 2 a and b respectively the removal patterns of all the compounds consistently showed increasing trends in removal efficiencies with the increase of uv dose which was expected due to the greater energy supplied to degrade the compounds at higher uv dosages 69 70 the results indicated that ndma and tcs were readily removed 75 compared to the other three compounds these results were consistent with earlier studies that classified ndma and tcs as highly uv photosensitive compounds 26 35 hence they could be efficiently removed by photo oxidation stefan and bolton 2002 suggested the degradation of ndma under uv light starts with the breakage of the nn bond 170 kj mol 71 paredes et al 2018 highlighted that tcs contains a phenyl oh bond which has low dissociation energy 470 kj mol causing it to break easily by uv light at 254 nm 472 kj mol 35 although they also mentioned that the degradation of a compound could not be predicted solely based on certain molecular bonds of the compound given the presence of other bonds which can be more or less photostable therefore it has been suggested to consider the level of photosensitivity as a function of molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm of cecs to predict their degradation by uv photolysis 36 our results demonstrated that the removal of highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs by uv and uv h2o2 were less affected by the presence of the other cecs in the samples considering their consistent high removal efficiencies in contrast tmp atz and e1 which have more complex chemical structures were only eliminated by less than 20 even at the highest uv dose applied table 3 presented the comparison of removal efficiencies of the target cecs by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 by this study and those reported in previous studies our results agreed with the earlier studies showing low degradation of tmp atz and e1 performed under the similar range of uv dose used in this study tmp was identified as resistant to uv photolysis with significant degradation 50 recorded only at an extremely high uv dose i e greater than 90 000 mj cm2 13 atz low removal by uv light was mainly attributed to the s triazine ring in its structure known for its stability to photolysis 41 despite having a phenyl oh bond photoactive e1 has a relatively low molar extinction ratio and quantum yield the ratio of moles converted over light absorbed making it less susceptible to uv degradation 72 based on the low removal efficiencies of tmp atz and e1 found in our study it could be inferred that much higher uv dosages are required to eliminate these persistent compounds particularly at high initial concentrations in photolysis the removal of cecs could occur through 1 direct photolysis by uv light causing the decay of the compounds and 2 indirect pathway through the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh which oxidises the compounds 13 the addition of h2o2 in the uv h2o2 process increases the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade cecs 30 our results showed that the removal efficiencies of target cecs increased slightly from 75 to 85 for ndma and tcs with the addition of 0 1 mm 3 3 mg l h2o2 the results corroborate previous studies that reported only a slight improvement in ndma removal by adding h2o2 even at up to 100 mg l h2o2 69 similar behaviour was observed when the degradation of tcs by uv and uv h2o2 were compared 53 our results confirmed that ndma and tcs removal were predominantly due to direct photolysis instead of oxidation by oh the removal efficiencies of tmp atz and e1 by uv h2o2 were still considerably low 30 suggesting the amount of added oxidant was not sufficient to achieve their complete removal which was in accordance with findings by other studies shown in table 3 the removal of tmp by uv at the highest uv dose was only 8 in comparison atz could be removed by 16 suggesting that direct uv photolysis was more effective for atz degradation than for the tmp degradation the minor improvement on the tmp removal with the addition of h2o2 indicated that the amount of h2o2 used in this study representing its real world application was too low for tmp s removal through indirect oxidation e1 removal was found to be the lowest among the target cecs and it improved slightly with h2o2 addition we hypothesise that the presence of other cecs acted as scavengers of light and oh and hence decreased their availability for e1 removal the findings in our study indicated that the removal efficiencies of tmp and e1 could be affected by the presence of the other target cecs overall the removal trends of each compound in our study were consistent with those found in other studies table 3 the difference in removal efficiencies among these data was likely attributed to the difference in oxidant dosages close to the real world in our study initial concentrations of cecs the presence of other cecs mixture in our study and water matrices in a more complex water matrix samples containing higher initial concentrations of multiple cecs would require greater oxidant dosages to achieve a similar range of removal efficiencies and vice versa higher initial concentrations of contaminants could result in a self quenching phenomenon where molecules in excited states by uv light collide with other molecules then return to their ground states 36 reduced degradations of organic compounds in multi component solutions compared with mono component solutions is caused by the decrease in the emitted photons target molecules ratio 30 samples matrix such as dissolved organic matter and carbonate system could result in scavenging effects hence reducing the removal of cecs by uv 34 however the effects of the water matrix could be different for each cec 35 it was worth noting that certain substances in the water matrix could act as a photosensitizer that promotes photodegradation while others could act as scavengers that hinder photodegradation therefore it is essential to investigate the removal efficiencies of cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations in a real water matrix 36 the pseudo first order rate constants for uv photolysis and uv h2o2 were determined from eq 1 30 and eq 2 9 respectively where c represents final concentration upon exposure of uv fluence dose f mj cm2 c 0 represents the initial concentration k uv is the fluence based rate constant cm2 mj uv h2o2 k d k i and k uv h2 o 2 represent the fluence based pseudo first order rate constant for direct uv oxidation indirect uv h2o2 oxidation and overall fluence based first order rate constant cm2 mj accordingly fluence based rate constants were analysed instead of time based rate constants since fluence dose is more practical for comparison in the real uv and uv h2o2 application uv fluence dose is a multiplication of uv intensity mw cm2 with exposure time 9 1 d c df k u v c 2 d c df k d k i c k uv h 2 o 2 c based on the above equations the fluence based rate constants for uv photolysis and the overall fluence based rate constants for uv h2o2 were obtained from the regression linear of ln c 0 c versus uv fluence dose as plotted in fig s1 a and b in supplementary material the k values obtained are shown in table 4 the k values of the target compounds by uv h2o2 were slightly higher than those by uv alone which explained the results of improved removal efficiencies obtained by uv h2o2 treatment the decrease of k values at higher cecs initial concentrations with the same oxidant dosages was reported 9 demonstrating higher oxidant dosages required at higher initial concentrations the ratio between fluence dose rate constant from uv treatment k uv to fluence dose rate constant from uv h2o2 treatment k uv h2 o 2 can be used to determine the main removal mechanisms 34 from our results the ratios for ndma and tcs were higher than 0 80 suggesting direct uv photolysis was the main removal mechanism which was in agreement with findings by lee et al 2016 34 the ratios for tmp atz and e1 were between 0 5 and 0 60 confirming their elimination by both direct uv and oh oxidation although the lower ratio shown by tmp and atz could be an indication that uv had lesser contribution than oh as reported previously 34 in this study comparatively low r2 values of tmp and e1 were due to their considerably low degradation an earlier study documented similar findings i e low to very low r2 values corresponding to low negligible degradation 79 3 2 lab scale gac treatment activated carbon ac possesses large surface areas and well developed pore structures macropores 50 nm mesopores 2 50 nm and micropores 2 nm 80 adsorption occurs through physical and chemical interactions between sorbates cecs and sorbents gac 12 hence the physicochemical properties of the cecs and gac play important roles in the adsorption process 12 the compounds properties that primarily governed the adsorption efficiencies include 1 hydrophobicity represented by the log kow octanol water partition coefficient 2 molecular weight and size 3 degree of dissociations pka 4 solubility 5 certain chemical functional groups and 6 charges 12 18 56 the sorbents characteristics such as bet surface area pore structure and surface chemistry together with the solutions ph and water matrix determine adsorption efficiencies 80 81 one of the key operational parameters in gac adsorption is the ebct represented by contact times in our experiments the removal trends of target cecs by gac as depicted in fig 3 increased with longer contact times longer contact times correspond to prolonged sorbate sorbent interactions which provide more opportunities for adsorption through chemical interactions or physical interactions where the sorbate penetrates the sorbent s outer inner pores hence it subsequently leads to higher removal efficiencies until the equilibrium is reached at the optimal contact time which is sorbate sorbent specific 82 however higher ebct also causes an increase in capital cost 83 and operational cost 56 and hence need to be balanced to achieve optimal operational and treatment efficiencies activated carbon attracts more hydrophobic and less polar compounds 17 as listed in table 1 tcs has the highest log kow among target cecs our results showed that tcs was removed by greater than 90 even at the shortest contact time 15 mins tcs s high removal efficiencies by gac have been reported previously 39 56 in both neutral and ionised forms tcs is efficiently eliminated by gac 56 in contrast ndma being the most hydrophilic was retained poorly 15 even at the longest contact time 45 mins ndma s inadequate removal by adsorption has been attributed to its high solubility and polarity 84 thermal modification of ac has been shown to increase ndma adsorption 44 however their commercial applications are yet to be realised 85 similarly poor adsorption results were observed for e1 tmp and atz with maximum removal efficiencies at 13 20 and 23 respectively among these three compounds tmp has the lowest log kow and is most hydrophilic e1 has a slightly higher log kow than atz but both compounds are considered only moderately hydrophobic 42 86 comparisons of the removal efficiencies of these three compounds with their log kow values indicated that other factors affecting adsorption rates are playing a critical role previous studies investigating adsorption of e1 tmp and atz in a single solute system have reported that these compounds were considerably removed 40 90 by ac 48 86 87 however the simultaneous occurrence of multiple cecs in a solution results in competitive adsorption due to competition for adsorption sites and pore blockage 88 understanding adsorption mechanisms in a solution containing multiple cecs is known to be incredibly challenging considering the vast possible mechanisms involved hence only very few studies have attempted such an approach 18 possible explanations of the slightly higher removal of atz in our study could be due to its lowest molecular weight and smallest size dp among the three compounds as shown in table 1 having the lowest molecular weight atz would be less subjected to direct competition for adsorption sites as compared to tmp and e1 12 additionally cecs with smaller sizes are more likely to diffuse into the ac s micropores through micropore filling adsorption resulting in their higher removal rates 18 89 compounds with larger and similar molecular sizes would likely result in the strongest direct site competitions 12 89 tmp and e1 own very similar molecular weights and sizes thus there was a high possibility that the strongest competitive adsorption occurred between them however tmp being slightly smaller than e1 may have contributed to its higher removal efficiencies by micropore filling adsorption 80 another possibility is that the surface chemistry of ac such as the oxygen containing surface functional groups osfgs could favour the tmp adsorption on ac through its interaction with the amine group of tmp 90 consistent with findings by sumaraj et al 2020 82 for ammonium interaction with osfgs detailed investigation of adsorption mechanisms is required to confirm the interactions and competitive adsorption between multiple cecs 89 however our study demonstrated that adsorption of a broad range of cecs is not a simple process and hydrophobicity alone cannot be used as a criterion to determine cecs removal efficiencies by ac adsorption of extremely hydrophobic compounds such as tcs is less affected by the presence of other cecs while the adsorption of highly hydrophilic compounds like ndma is consistently low regardless of other cecs the adsorption of slight to moderately hydrophobic compounds like tmp atz and e1 is mostly affected by competitive adsorption and the water matrix 3 3 pilot scale uv h2o2 and gac the removal efficiencies of target cecs at the pilot scale uv h2o2 were found to be higher than those obtained at the lab scale confirming that applying the same uv and uv h2o2 dosages at much lower initial concentrations yielded higher removal efficiencies for cecs in general the removal trends of cecs in the pilot scale were consistent with those obtained in the lab both highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs were efficiently removed 100 even though the water matrix contained dissolved organic carbon doc at 3 3 mg l e1 was significantly removed to nearly 80 while tmp and atz were removed to around 60 e1 s higher removal efficiencies than those of tmp and atz could likely be caused by less self quenching and less competition with tmp and atz in consuming the available oxidants at low initial concentrations the removal efficiencies by uv h2o2 in pilot scale experiments are depicted in fig 4a the results also confirmed that uv h2o2 treatment at given oxidant dosages could not completely remove all target cecs the presence of doc in the influent may have acted as an oxidant scavenger 34 cedat et al highlighted that the extremely short hydraulic retention time in pilot and full scale uv reactors generally results in insufficient time for h2o2 activation 30 therefore the addition of h2o2 in excess is often required though it would mean significantly higher operational costs 30 de la cruz et al concluded that the shorter hydraulic retention time in their experiment from 67 s to 33 s was compensated by the higher dose of h2o2 uv irradiation of 700 mw cm2 and 20 30 mg l h2o2 91 considering the hydraulic retention time used in our pilot study was comparable to other studies while the h2o2 was considerably lower than those used in other studies our findings indicated that a significantly higher h2o2 dose than that applied in the real world conditions is required to achieve 80 removal of a broad range of cecs in the real water matrix if uv h2o2 treatment is used by itself as a final barrier since uv h2o2 treatment could not completely remove tmp atz and e1 the effluent was passed through gac subsequent removal of cecs by gac at different ebct is shown in fig 4b data showed that all the compounds were removed by gac at the final gac effluent point ebct 28 min tmp was eliminated nearly by 100 at 3 5 mins ebct and was eliminated further to lower than its lod with 14 min ebct e1 and atz were gradually removed with longer ebct with complete removal recorded at 14 and 28 min ebct respectively interestingly tmp the least hydrophobic was adsorbed the fastest as discussed in the previous section hydrophobicity could not be used as the only factor to explain adsorption on ac tmp also exhibited better removal efficiencies by gac than certain more hydrophobic cecs in previous studies 92 as explained earlier tmp s interactions with the ac surface 93 could be one of the factors it is worth mentioning that the gac media used in the pilot scale study was taken from an active gac unit unlike the ones used in laboratory experiments therefore it was expected that the media could host some biofilm that would further aid in the removal of the cecs through adenosine triphosphate atp measurements it was found that the gac used at the pilot scale was microbially active a previous study has reported a higher adsorption capacity for certain cecs by biologically active gac than those achieved by fresh gac 94 one of the operational conditions which could affect the removal of cecs by uv h2o2 and gac is the solution ph 34 93 in our study the ph remained constant over the course of treatment the difference was less than 0 2 units see fig s2 of supplementary material hence the impact of ph variations was assumed to be minor insignificant changes in doc concentrations upon uv h2o2 treatment indicated that the treatment did not result in doc mineralisation previous studies reported a negligible degree of mineralisation obtained from uv h2o2 treatment applying the same range of uv dose with similar doc initial concentrations 20 95 for gac treatment it was found that doc concentrations decreased gradually from 3 5 min to 28 min ebct the final effluent contained 1 6 mg l which showed total doc removal efficiencies by gac was 50 although degradation by products were not investigated in our study uv h2o2 oxidation was also reported to break larger organics into smaller organic compounds and often form degradation by products that could be more toxic than their original forms 40 81 a prior study 96 concluded there was an 81 chance of more toxic degradation products than their parents compounds formed by uv h2o2 treatment applying gac as a post treatment of uv h2o2 would be beneficial in eliminating these toxic by products and removing any excess h2o2 97 also the combination of uv h2o2 and gac has been shown to minimize any health risk from possible mutagenic by products from medium pressure uv in the uv h2o2 process 98 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the efficiencies of uv uv h2o2 and gac alone and in combination for the simultaneous removal of five cecs from five different classes of emerging contaminants with varying properties the key findings from our study are as follows higher uv and h2o2 dosages as well as higher gac contact times yielded higher removal efficiencies as expected however applying higher oxidant dosages and contact times incur higher capital and operational costs highlighting the importance of studying the efficacy of treatment processes at their practical oxidant dosages and gac contact times in removing cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations in the real water matrix the removal efficiencies by uv and uv h2o2 were highly affected by the compounds physicochemical properties highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs were easily removed by uv and uv h2o2 and were less affected by the presence of other cecs direct photolysis was found as their main removal mechanism less photosensitive compounds tmp atz e1 were removed by less than 30 through combinations of direct photolysis and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and were more likely affected by the presence of other cecs and the water matrix which could act as light and or hydroxyl radicals scavengers adsorption of cecs by gac is a complex process that is mainly influenced by the compounds and the activated carbon s physicochemical properties the interactions competitions between cecs and with other chemical species in the water matrix initial concentrations and ebct these effects were more profound for moderately hydrophobic or less hydrophilic compounds e g tmp atz and e1 with less than 25 removal by gac strongly hydrophobic compounds e g tcs was efficiently adsorbed on gac 90 while highly hydrophilic compound e g ndma 15 was insignificantly retained by gac the pilot scale results showed that combining uv h2o2 at practical dosages and gac at ebct of 28 min effectively removed all the target cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations overall this study showed that uv h2o2 followed by gac treatment could serve as an excellent multi barrier treatment approach to ensure the efficient removal of a wide range of cecs it could be applied as a reliable polishing

13043,this study assessed the efficacy of laboratory and pilot scale 1 uv photolysis 2 combined uv and hydrogen peroxide oxidation uv h2o2 3 granular activated carbon gac adsorption and 4 uv h2o2 followed by gac for simultaneous removal of contaminants of emerging concerns cecs in water five globally relevant cecs from five different contaminant classes were selected as target cecs to represent the wide range i e n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as a disinfection by product trimethoprim tmp as a pharmaceutical triclosan tcs as a personal care product atrazine atz as a herbicide and estrone e1 as a steroid hormone highly photosensitive compounds like ndma and tcs were easily degraded by uv 75 and uv h2o2 80 with direct photolysis as the main removal mechanism their removal efficiencies were less affected by the presence of other cecs and the water matrix than the other cecs the effects of competitive adsorption among cecs and the water matrix was more profound for moderately hydrophobic or less hydrophilic compounds e g tmp atz and e1 the laboratory scale results showed the application of a single treatment could not efficiently remove the target cecs hence the combination of treatments was employed in the pilot scale experiments which assessed the effectiveness of uv h2o2 1000 mj cm2 and 4 mg l h2o2 followed by gac empty bed contact time 3 5 28 min in removing target cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations our findings suggest that uv h2o2 followed by gac would serve as an excellent multi barrier for efficiently removing a wide range of cecs in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chemicals of emerging concerns uv uv h2o2 granular activated carbon advanced water treatment pilot scale 1 introduction the occurrence of various classes of chemicals of emerging contaminants cecs such as disinfection by products dbps pharmaceuticals personal care products pcps pesticides hormones etc in domestic wastewater surface water and drinking water is well researched globally 1 2 the elimination of many of these cecs by conventional water and wastewater treatment processes is inefficient leading to their discharge into the aquatic environment and subsequent presence in drinking water 2 4 wastewater effluents are reported to be the primary source of cecs in environmental matrices 4 many of these contaminants have been identified as biologically persistent toxic carcinogenic and endocrine disruptive compounds edcs 5 long term exposure to these various compounds and their mixtures could lead to multiple chronic health concerns 6 many regions are currently facing water stress due to rapid population growth industrialisation urbanisation and climate change 7 wastewater reuse is increasing globally and is now widely practised including in the u s europe asia and africa to overcome water stress 8 the occurrence of many cecs in treated wastewaters raises additional concerns when the wastewater reuse scheme is implemented 9 therefore robust water wastewater treatments are required to prevent the release of cecs into the environment and ensure the contaminant free water necessary for reuse 10 advanced treatment processes such as advanced oxidation processes aops and granular activated carbon gac adsorption are known for their efficiencies and effectiveness in removing organic contaminants in water including pharmaceuticals and hormones 11 ultraviolet uv photolysis and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 oxidation as well as their combined oxidation uv h2o2 could efficiently eliminate certain biologically recalcitrant cecs from wastewater 12 the hydroxyl radicals oh produced by uv h2o2 treatment can break the chemical bonds of several cecs which are persistent to uv treatment 13 the use of uv light with catalyst i e photocatalyst process has been reported to substantially degrade pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water 14 16 although its full scale application is still limited 14 activated carbon has been used widely to efficiently adsorb dbp precursors and certain cecs in water 17 hence gac and uv processes are increasingly seen as two of the most promising solutions for the efficient removal of micropollutants in water and wastewater 18 19 despite previous research on the removal of cecs by advanced treatment processes most studies mainly focused on a group of compounds from one class or one treatment method 3 20 23 dbps 24 26 pesticides and herbicides 27 29 or hormones 30 33 in the past the formation and removal of dbps were not seen as critical issues for wastewater treatment 34 therefore very few studies investigated the simultaneous removal of dbps with other cecs classes e g pharmaceuticals pesticides hormones however with the increasing wastewater reuse globally emerging dbps are becoming a concern for advanced treatment 8 also the majority of the studies were at a laboratory scale using much higher initial cecs concentrations than their actual concentrations in the real world 35 it has been shown that the contaminants behaviour and their removal trends could significantly vary with their initial concentrations highlighting the need for using environmentally relevant concentrations 36 37 more studies on advanced treatment processes for simultaneous removal of a wide range of cecs particularly at their relevant concentrations on a pilot scale would improve our knowledge in designing treatment processes and or upgrading the conventional drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities to achieve efficient removal of cecs hence the specific aims of this research were to 1 assess the efficacy of uv photolysis uv h2o2 oxidation and gac adsorption for the removal of a mixture of different classes of cecs at laboratory and pilot scales and 2 understand the mechanisms and factors affecting cecs removal by the studied treatment processes cecs concentrations and operational parameters were close to the real world scenario for the pilot scale testing to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that investigated the removal of cecs from five different classes by uv h2o2 and gac at laboratory and pilot scales using environmentally realistic concentrations and real world operational parameters to represent the diversity of cecs in the real world five cecs from five different classes i e n nitrosodimethylamine ndma as an emerging dbp trimethoprim tmp as a pharmaceutical triclosan tcs as a pcp atrazine atz as a herbicide and estrone e1 as a steroid hormone were selected as the target cecs these target compounds were chosen based on their characteristic disparities frequent detection in drinking water and or wastewater globally ecological and human health risk even at trace levels and low removal efficiencies by conventional treatment processes ndma is an emerging dbp and has been frequently detected in drinking water and wastewater in many countries 19 25 this highly soluble compound has a 10 6 lifetime cancer risk level of 0 2 ng l and high genotoxicity 19 tmp in wastewater and surface water has been consistently reported in the top four detected pharmaceuticals in different regions including asia europe america and africa tmp is a polar compound and has been known to be recalcitrant to biodegradation 38 tcs is an extensively used antimicrobial globally classified as an edc 39 40 it tends to be accumulated in human tissues and is stable in marine sediment for more than 30 years due to its high hydrophobicity and low solubility 3 atz is recorded as one of the world s most widely used herbicides 29 41 atz has moderate solubility high persistency in soils and aquatic environments and elevated toxicity to aquatic organisms 27 e1 is the only hormone that was included in

used to quench h2o2 was purchased from sigma aldrich new zealand milli q water used in all experiments was produced by milli q direct 8 16 system from millipore sas resistivity 18 2 mω cm 2 2 lab scale experiments 2 2 1 uv photolysis milli q water 10 ml spiked with the target cecs 1 ppm of tmp tcs atz and e1 and 0 3 ppm of ndma was exposed to uv light at 254 nm wavelength generated by uv irradiation chamber bs 02 from opsytec dr gobel germany the uv chamber was equipped with calibrated radiometric sensors to measure the actual uv intensity inside the chamber six uvc lamps were installed which produced irradiance at 3 45 mw cm2 the uv dosages applied i e 300 600 900 1200 1500 mj cm2 were set close to the range of dosages employed in the full scale uv treatments 60 62 varying time exposures of each run achieved uv dose variations the samples were mixed continuously at 300 rpm by magnetic stirrers during uv exposure the controlled samples were kept in the dark the experiments were performed at ph 7 5 with the addition of phosphate buffer all experiments were conducted in duplicates at room temperature 2 2 2 combined uv photolysis and hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted with the addition of h2o2 to the samples and controls immediately before the uv exposure the concentration of h2o2 was set at 3 3 mg l based on the range of hydrogen peroxide dose 3 6 mg l 0 1 mm used in their real world applications 60 62 sodium sulfite in excess was added instantaneously after the experiments to quench the remaining h2o2 in the samples

fine particles then dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h and cooled before use 63 the experiments were conducted in a batch adsorption test activated carbon 2 5 g l was added to milli q water 40 ml spiked with the target cecs at the same initial concentrations as uv and uv h2o2 experiments following the procedure detailed in a previous study 64 these samples were then shaken in a water bath at room temperature at 300 rpm over different contact times 15 30 and 45 min gac adsorption contact times were designed around the range of empty bed contact time ebct in the real gac column applications 65 controlled samples followed the same procedures without the addition of activated carbon to check on the loss of cecs other than by adsorption on activated carbon the experiments were performed at ph 7 5 with the addition of phosphate buffer all experiments were conducted in duplicates at room temperature 2 2 4 sample preparation liquid liquid extraction lle was used to extract ndma from samples to dcm for analysis on a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 66 in this method 2 ml of samples were mixed with 2 ml of dcm in an 8 ml vial the mixture was then vigorously shaken manually for 3 min then kept aside for 1 min the dcm layer containing extracted ndma from the sample was at the bottom of the vial by using a glass pipet 1 ml volume was taken from the dcm layer for gc ms analysis this extraction method yielded 70 80 recoveries recovery corrections were applied based on the calculated recoveries of known concentrations of samples undergoing the same lle at the same time as other samples for analysis of tmp tcs atz and e1 samples were directly analysed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms 2 3 pilot scale experiments the pilot scale set up consisted of uv h2o2 units followed by gac columns with a treatment capacity of 1000 l h the pilot plant ran as a side stream process and was located at a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in auckland new zealand the influent water came from a clarified tank after coagulation flocculation unit of the dwtp and it was spiked with a mixture of the selected cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations i e 20 ng l of ndma and 200 ng l of tmp tcs atz and e1 the stock solution containing a mixture of target cecs was injected into the influent system using a materflex peristaltic pump purchased from thermo fisher new zealand the influent had ph of 6 6 and dissolved organic carbon doc of 3 3 mg l the uv and h2o2 dosages applied were 1000 mj cm2 and 4 mg l respectively the uv reactor installed was uv wedeco spektron 15 from xylem new zealand other relevant specifications of the uv reactor are listed in table s1 in supplementary material h2o2 was supplied from ixom nz and was injected into the stream using a peristaltic pump purchased from watson marlow fluid technology group germany the concentration of h2o2 was measured using a pre calibrated h2o2 sensor obtained from grundfos denmark the process flow diagram and treatment units used in the pilot scale experiments are shown in fig 1 in this study only one reactor and one gac column were used for the experiments the effluent from the uv h2o2 treatment was fed to a gac column with a diameter of 15 cm and a bed height of 160 cm gac media was the acticarb bac gs1000n 10 20 mesh from activated carbon technologies ltd new zealand collected from a gac unit at the dwtp the activated carbon media was part of the existing gac unit at the dwtp for around 12 months the pilot gac column was operated in downward flow at a flow rate of 60 l h and velocity of 3 4 m h the ebct was 28 mins the column was equipped with multiple sampling ports i e sampling port 1 2 3 and 4 which corresponded to ebct of 3 5 7 14 and 28 mins respectively the pilot scale set up was running 4 months prior to this test the total test duration was 3 h with 2 h of experiments and an hour of sampling the summary of the experimental parameters used in the laboratory and pilot scale experiments are listed in table 2 water samples 2000 ml in duplicates were collected in amber glass bottles at the influent sampling port a and downstream of uv h2o2 sampling port b and gac gac sampling port 1 to 4 as shown in fig 1 the remaining h2o2 was quenched by excess sodium sulfite immediately upon sampling the samples were then transported to the laboratory and kept in a 4 c refrigerator at ph 5 with the addition of sulfuric acid as recommended by the epa method 1694 67 the samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe in less than 8 days upon sampling 67 the concentrations of cecs ph and dissolved organic carbon doc were analysed for every sample doc was measured by a toc analyser shimadzu model toc vcph ssm 5000a according to the method described by lee et al 34 the spe procedures and analytical methods for the target cecs are explained in the following subsections 2 3 1 solid phase extraction spe a 1000 ml aliquot of each water sample was concentrated by spe the spe for ndma was carried out using thermally modified coconut shell activated carbon as the sorbent material 44 the ndma concentrations in the concentrated samples were analysed by gc ms the spe for tmp tcs atz and e1 were conducted according to the spe method used in an earlier study 68 using waters oasis prime hlb cartridges 6 cc 500 mg alphatech new zealand the cartridges were preconditioned with 5 ml methanol and 5 ml of di water at ph 4 loaded with the samples dried for 15 mins and finally eluted with 10 ml methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml min the eluted samples were then concentrated from 10 ml to 1 ml using a speed vac concentrator thermo scientific new zealand the concentrated samples were analysed on lc ms ms the spe recoveries of the target cecs are listed in table s2 in supplementary material 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of ndma was performed on a gc ms gc 2010 from shimadzu employing an hp5 5ms ultra inert column 29 1 m length 0 25 μm i d 0 25 μm thickness with an analytical method as reported in our earlier published work 44 the analysis of tmp tcs atz and e1 was carried out on a shimadzu lc ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was used to analyse the precursor and the product ions of each compound by employing an ascentis reverse phase amide column 10 cm 2 1 mm 3 μm analysis of tmp and atz both at positive esi mode as well as tcs at negative esi mode were merged into a single analytical method with a binary gradient consisting of 5 mm of ammonium acetate in milli q water a and methanol b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the mobile phase gradient was started with 10 b from 0 01 min to 5 5 min then increased to 50 b at 6 min then further increased to 95 b at 14 5 min and maintained for 2 min before it decreased to 10 b at 17 mins for 5 mins which resulted in the total running time to 22 min a separate method was developed for e1 employing the same column using 0 4 mm of ammonium fluoride buffer in milli q water a and a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol 1 1 b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the total run was 12 min with 85 b the ms acquisition details of target compounds analysed by lc ms ms are listed in supplementary material table s2 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were defined when the ratio between signal to noise s n reached 3 and 10 respectively 44 the lods and loqs of target compounds and their spe recoveries are presented in table s2 in supplementary material 3 results and discussions 3 1 lab scale uv and uv h2o2 controls in all experiments showed a negligible decrease of target cecs which confirmed their removal in the treated samples was due to oxidation by uv and uv h2o2 the removal efficiencies of target compounds by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 are presented in figs 2 a and b respectively the removal patterns of all the compounds consistently showed increasing trends in removal efficiencies with the increase of uv dose which was expected due to the greater energy supplied to degrade the compounds at higher uv dosages 69 70 the results indicated that ndma and tcs were readily removed 75 compared to the other three compounds these results were consistent with earlier studies that classified ndma and tcs as highly uv photosensitive compounds 26 35 hence they could be efficiently removed by photo oxidation stefan and bolton 2002 suggested the degradation of ndma under uv light starts with the breakage of the nn bond 170 kj mol 71 paredes et al 2018 highlighted that tcs contains a phenyl oh bond which has low dissociation energy 470 kj mol causing it to break easily by uv light at 254 nm 472 kj mol 35 although they also mentioned that the degradation of a compound could not be predicted solely based on certain molecular bonds of the compound given the presence of other bonds which can be more or less photostable therefore it has been suggested to consider the level of photosensitivity as a function of molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm of cecs to predict their degradation by uv photolysis 36 our results demonstrated that the removal of highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs by uv and uv h2o2 were less affected by the presence of the other cecs in the samples considering their consistent high removal efficiencies in contrast tmp atz and e1 which have more complex chemical structures were only eliminated by less than 20 even at the highest uv dose applied table 3 presented the comparison of removal efficiencies of the target cecs by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 by this study and those reported in previous studies our results agreed with the earlier studies showing low degradation of tmp atz and e1 performed under the similar range of uv dose used in this study tmp was identified as resistant to uv photolysis with significant degradation 50 recorded only at an extremely high uv dose i e greater than 90 000 mj cm2 13 atz low removal by uv light was mainly attributed to the s triazine ring in its structure known for its stability to photolysis 41 despite having a phenyl oh bond photoactive e1 has a relatively low molar extinction ratio and quantum yield the ratio of moles converted over light absorbed making it less susceptible to uv degradation 72 based on the low removal efficiencies of tmp atz and e1 found in our study it could be inferred that much higher uv dosages are required to eliminate these persistent compounds particularly at high initial concentrations in photolysis the removal of cecs could occur through 1 direct photolysis by uv light causing the decay of the compounds and 2 indirect pathway through the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh which oxidises the compounds 13 the addition of h2o2 in the uv h2o2 process increases the amount of hydroxyl radicals available to degrade cecs 30 our results showed that the removal efficiencies of target cecs increased slightly from 75 to 85 for ndma and tcs with the addition of 0 1 mm 3 3 mg l h2o2 the results corroborate previous studies that reported only a slight improvement in ndma removal by adding h2o2 even at up to 100 mg l h2o2 69 similar behaviour was observed when the degradation of tcs by uv and uv h2o2 were compared 53 our results confirmed that ndma and tcs removal were predominantly due to direct photolysis instead of oxidation by oh the removal efficiencies of tmp atz and e1 by uv h2o2 were still considerably low 30 suggesting the amount of added oxidant was not sufficient to achieve their complete removal which was in accordance with findings by other studies shown in table 3 the removal of tmp by uv at the highest uv dose was only 8 in comparison atz could be removed by 16 suggesting that direct uv photolysis was more effective for atz degradation than for the tmp degradation the minor improvement on the tmp removal with the addition of h2o2 indicated that the amount of h2o2 used in this study representing its real world application was too low for tmp s removal through indirect oxidation e1 removal was found to be the lowest among the target cecs and it improved slightly with h2o2 addition we hypothesise that the presence of other cecs acted as scavengers of light and oh and hence decreased their availability for e1 removal the findings in our study indicated that the removal efficiencies of tmp and e1 could be affected by the presence of the other target cecs overall the removal trends of each compound in our study were consistent with those found in other studies table 3 the difference in removal efficiencies among these data was likely attributed to the difference in oxidant dosages close to the real world in our study initial concentrations of cecs the presence of other cecs mixture in our study and water matrices in a more complex water matrix samples containing higher initial concentrations of multiple cecs would require greater oxidant dosages to achieve a similar range of removal efficiencies and vice versa higher initial concentrations of contaminants could result in a self quenching phenomenon where molecules in excited states by uv light collide with other molecules then return to their ground states 36 reduced degradations of organic compounds in multi component solutions compared with mono component solutions is caused by the decrease in the emitted photons target molecules ratio 30 samples matrix such as dissolved organic matter and carbonate system could result in scavenging effects hence reducing the removal of cecs by uv 34 however the effects of the water matrix could be different for each cec 35 it was worth noting that certain substances in the water matrix could act as a photosensitizer that promotes photodegradation while others could act as scavengers that hinder photodegradation therefore it is essential to investigate the removal efficiencies of cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations in a real water matrix 36 the pseudo first order rate constants for uv photolysis and uv h2o2 were determined from eq 1 30 and eq 2 9 respectively where c represents final concentration upon exposure of uv fluence dose f mj cm2 c 0 represents the initial concentration k uv is the fluence based rate constant cm2 mj uv h2o2 k d k i and k uv h2 o 2 represent the fluence based pseudo first order rate constant for direct uv oxidation indirect uv h2o2 oxidation and overall fluence based first order rate constant cm2 mj accordingly fluence based rate constants were analysed instead of time based rate constants since fluence dose is more practical for comparison in the real uv and uv h2o2 application uv fluence dose is a multiplication of uv intensity mw cm2 with exposure time 9 1 d c df k u v c 2 d c df k d k i c k uv h 2 o 2 c based on the above equations the fluence based rate constants for uv photolysis and the overall fluence based rate constants for uv h2o2 were obtained from the regression linear of ln c 0 c versus uv fluence dose as plotted in fig s1 a and b in supplementary material the k values obtained are shown in table 4 the k values of the target compounds by uv h2o2 were slightly higher than those by uv alone which explained the results of improved removal efficiencies obtained by uv h2o2 treatment the decrease of k values at higher cecs initial concentrations with the same oxidant dosages was reported 9 demonstrating higher oxidant dosages required at higher initial concentrations the ratio between fluence dose rate constant from uv treatment k uv to fluence dose rate constant from uv h2o2 treatment k uv h2 o 2 can be used to determine the main removal mechanisms 34 from our results the ratios for ndma and tcs were higher than 0 80 suggesting direct uv photolysis was the main removal mechanism which was in agreement with findings by lee et al 2016 34 the ratios for tmp atz and e1 were between 0 5 and 0 60 confirming their elimination by both direct uv and oh oxidation although the lower ratio shown by tmp and atz could be an indication that uv had lesser contribution than oh as reported previously 34 in this study comparatively low r2 values of tmp and e1 were due to their considerably low degradation an earlier study documented similar findings i e low to very low r2 values corresponding to low negligible degradation 79 3 2 lab scale gac treatment activated carbon ac possesses large surface areas and well developed pore structures macropores 50 nm mesopores 2 50 nm and micropores 2 nm 80 adsorption occurs through physical and chemical interactions between sorbates cecs and sorbents gac 12 hence the physicochemical properties of the cecs and gac play important roles in the adsorption process 12 the compounds properties that primarily governed the adsorption efficiencies include 1 hydrophobicity represented by the log kow octanol water partition coefficient 2 molecular weight and size 3 degree of dissociations pka 4 solubility 5 certain chemical functional groups and 6 charges 12 18 56 the sorbents characteristics such as bet surface area pore structure and surface chemistry together with the solutions ph and water matrix determine adsorption efficiencies 80 81 one of the key operational parameters in gac adsorption is the ebct represented by contact times in our experiments the removal trends of target cecs by gac as depicted in fig 3 increased with longer contact times longer contact times correspond to prolonged sorbate sorbent interactions which provide more opportunities for adsorption through chemical interactions or physical interactions where the sorbate penetrates the sorbent s outer inner pores hence it subsequently leads to higher removal efficiencies until the equilibrium is reached at the optimal contact time which is sorbate sorbent specific 82 however higher ebct also causes an increase in capital cost 83 and operational cost 56 and hence need to be balanced to achieve optimal operational and treatment efficiencies activated carbon attracts more hydrophobic and less polar compounds 17 as listed in table 1 tcs has the highest log kow among target cecs our results showed that tcs was removed by greater than 90 even at the shortest contact time 15 mins tcs s high removal efficiencies by gac have been reported previously 39 56 in both neutral and ionised forms tcs is efficiently eliminated by gac 56 in contrast ndma being the most hydrophilic was retained poorly 15 even at the longest contact time 45 mins ndma s inadequate removal by adsorption has been attributed to its high solubility and polarity 84 thermal modification of ac has been shown to increase ndma adsorption 44 however their commercial applications are yet to be realised 85 similarly poor adsorption results were observed for e1 tmp and atz with maximum removal efficiencies at 13 20 and 23 respectively among these three compounds tmp has the lowest log kow and is most hydrophilic e1 has a slightly higher log kow than atz but both compounds are considered only moderately hydrophobic 42 86 comparisons of the removal efficiencies of these three compounds with their log kow values indicated that other factors affecting adsorption rates are playing a critical role previous studies investigating adsorption of e1 tmp and atz in a single solute system have reported that these compounds were considerably removed 40 90 by ac 48 86 87 however the simultaneous occurrence of multiple cecs in a solution results in competitive adsorption due to competition for adsorption sites and pore blockage 88 understanding adsorption mechanisms in a solution containing multiple cecs is known to be incredibly challenging considering the vast possible mechanisms involved hence only very few studies have attempted such an approach 18 possible explanations of the slightly higher removal of atz in our study could be due to its lowest molecular weight and smallest size dp among the three compounds as shown in table 1 having the lowest molecular weight atz would be less subjected to direct competition for adsorption sites as compared to tmp and e1 12 additionally cecs with smaller sizes are more likely to diffuse into the ac s micropores through micropore filling adsorption resulting in their higher removal rates 18 89 compounds with larger and similar molecular sizes would likely result in the strongest direct site competitions 12 89 tmp and e1 own very similar molecular weights and sizes thus there was a high possibility that the strongest competitive adsorption occurred between them however tmp being slightly smaller than e1 may have contributed to its higher removal efficiencies by micropore filling adsorption 80 another possibility is that the surface chemistry of ac such as the oxygen containing surface functional groups osfgs could favour the tmp adsorption on ac through its interaction with the amine group of tmp 90 consistent with findings by sumaraj et al 2020 82 for ammonium interaction with osfgs detailed investigation of adsorption mechanisms is required to confirm the interactions and competitive adsorption between multiple cecs 89 however our study demonstrated that adsorption of a broad range of cecs is not a simple process and hydrophobicity alone cannot be used as a criterion to determine cecs removal efficiencies by ac adsorption of extremely hydrophobic compounds such as tcs is less affected by the presence of other cecs while the adsorption of highly hydrophilic compounds like ndma is consistently low regardless of other cecs the adsorption of slight to moderately hydrophobic compounds like tmp atz and e1 is mostly affected by competitive adsorption and the water matrix 3 3 pilot scale uv h2o2 and gac the removal efficiencies of target cecs at the pilot scale uv h2o2 were found to be higher than those obtained at the lab scale confirming that applying the same uv and uv h2o2 dosages at much lower initial concentrations yielded higher removal efficiencies for cecs in general the removal trends of cecs in the pilot scale were consistent with those obtained in the lab both highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs were efficiently removed 100 even though the water matrix contained dissolved organic carbon doc at 3 3 mg l e1 was significantly removed to nearly 80 while tmp and atz were removed to around 60 e1 s higher removal efficiencies than those of tmp and atz could likely be caused by less self quenching and less competition with tmp and atz in consuming the available oxidants at low initial concentrations the removal efficiencies by uv h2o2 in pilot scale experiments are depicted in fig 4a the results also confirmed that uv h2o2 treatment at given oxidant dosages could not completely remove all target cecs the presence of doc in the influent may have acted as an oxidant scavenger 34 cedat et al highlighted that the extremely short hydraulic retention time in pilot and full scale uv reactors generally results in insufficient time for h2o2 activation 30 therefore the addition of h2o2 in excess is often required though it would mean significantly higher operational costs 30 de la cruz et al concluded that the shorter hydraulic retention time in their experiment from 67 s to 33 s was compensated by the higher dose of h2o2 uv irradiation of 700 mw cm2 and 20 30 mg l h2o2 91 considering the hydraulic retention time used in our pilot study was comparable to other studies while the h2o2 was considerably lower than those used in other studies our findings indicated that a significantly higher h2o2 dose than that applied in the real world conditions is required to achieve 80 removal of a broad range of cecs in the real water matrix if uv h2o2 treatment is used by itself as a final barrier since uv h2o2 treatment could not completely remove tmp atz and e1 the effluent was passed through gac subsequent removal of cecs by gac at different ebct is shown in fig 4b data showed that all the compounds were removed by gac at the final gac effluent point ebct 28 min tmp was eliminated nearly by 100 at 3 5 mins ebct and was eliminated further to lower than its lod with 14 min ebct e1 and atz were gradually removed with longer ebct with complete removal recorded at 14 and 28 min ebct respectively interestingly tmp the least hydrophobic was adsorbed the fastest as discussed in the previous section hydrophobicity could not be used as the only factor to explain adsorption on ac tmp also exhibited better removal efficiencies by gac than certain more hydrophobic cecs in previous studies 92 as explained earlier tmp s interactions with the ac surface 93 could be one of the factors it is worth mentioning that the gac media used in the pilot scale study was taken from an active gac unit unlike the ones used in laboratory experiments therefore it was expected that the media could host some biofilm that would further aid in the removal of the cecs through adenosine triphosphate atp measurements it was found that the gac used at the pilot scale was microbially active a previous study has reported a higher adsorption capacity for certain cecs by biologically active gac than those achieved by fresh gac 94 one of the operational conditions which could affect the removal of cecs by uv h2o2 and gac is the solution ph 34 93 in our study the ph remained constant over the course of treatment the difference was less than 0 2 units see fig s2 of supplementary material hence the impact of ph variations was assumed to be minor insignificant changes in doc concentrations upon uv h2o2 treatment indicated that the treatment did not result in doc mineralisation previous studies reported a negligible degree of mineralisation obtained from uv h2o2 treatment applying the same range of uv dose with similar doc initial concentrations 20 95 for gac treatment it was found that doc concentrations decreased gradually from 3 5 min to 28 min ebct the final effluent contained 1 6 mg l which showed total doc removal efficiencies by gac was 50 although degradation by products were not investigated in our study uv h2o2 oxidation was also reported to break larger organics into smaller organic compounds and often form degradation by products that could be more toxic than their original forms 40 81 a prior study 96 concluded there was an 81 chance of more toxic degradation products than their parents compounds formed by uv h2o2 treatment applying gac as a post treatment of uv h2o2 would be beneficial in eliminating these toxic by products and removing any excess h2o2 97 also the combination of uv h2o2 and gac has been shown to minimize any health risk from possible mutagenic by products from medium pressure uv in the uv h2o2 process 98 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the efficiencies of uv uv h2o2 and gac alone and in combination for the simultaneous removal of five cecs from five different classes of emerging contaminants with varying properties the key findings from our study are as follows higher uv and h2o2 dosages as well as higher gac contact times yielded higher removal efficiencies as expected however applying higher oxidant dosages and contact times incur higher capital and operational costs highlighting the importance of studying the efficacy of treatment processes at their practical oxidant dosages and gac contact times in removing cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations in the real water matrix the removal efficiencies by uv and uv h2o2 were highly affected by the compounds physicochemical properties highly photosensitive compounds ndma and tcs were easily removed by uv and uv h2o2 and were less affected by the presence of other cecs direct photolysis was found as their main removal mechanism less photosensitive compounds tmp atz e1 were removed by less than 30 through combinations of direct photolysis and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals and were more likely affected by the presence of other cecs and the water matrix which could act as light and or hydroxyl radicals scavengers adsorption of cecs by gac is a complex process that is mainly influenced by the compounds and the activated carbon s physicochemical properties the interactions competitions between cecs and with other chemical species in the water matrix initial concentrations and ebct these effects were more profound for moderately hydrophobic or less hydrophilic compounds e g tmp atz and e1 with less than 25 removal by gac strongly hydrophobic compounds e g tcs was efficiently adsorbed on gac 90 while highly hydrophilic compound e g ndma 15 was insignificantly retained by gac the pilot scale results showed that combining uv h2o2 at practical dosages and gac at ebct of 28 min effectively removed all the target cecs at their environmentally relevant concentrations overall this study showed that uv h2o2 followed by gac treatment could serve as an excellent multi barrier treatment approach to ensure the efficient removal of a wide range of cecs it could be applied as a reliable polishing

13044,the rapid development of large scale animal husbandry has led to an increase in the quantities of tetracycline tc cu ii and pollutants resulting from the complexation of these substances in wastewater that is severely damaging to the environment novel environmental technology to treat tc cu ii mixed polluted wastewater is urgently required in this study a novel process was developed combining tio2 photocatalysis with tp207 adsorption to treat tc cu ii mixed wastewater and recover copper resources the concentrations of tc and cu ii in the treated wastewater were 1 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively meeting emission standards the copper recovery efficiency for tp207 desorption reached 81 both tio2 and tp207 maintained good stability over five treatment cycles the tc cu ii mixed wastewater was treated without any harmful effects and copper resources were recovered using the aforementioned combined process an alternative treatment for mixed wastewater containing antibiotics and heavy metals was proposed in this study keywords photocatalysis adsorption tp207 tetracycline copper ii 1 introduction improvements in the quality of modern life have resulted in a gradually increasing demand for poultry meat products this situation has promoted the rapid development and expansion of animal husbandry 1 however to accelerate poultry growth and prevent epidemics suppliers often add excessive quantities of antibiotics and heavy metals to feed during the process of livestock production residual metals and antibiotics that cannot be absorbed by the soil enter wastewater resulting in severe water pollution 2 3 tetracycline antibiotics and copper ions are the representative sources of domestic aquaculture wastewater pollution 4 6 an effective process to treat tc cu ii mixed wastewater produced by animal husbandry is proposed in this study tetracycline is a typical pollutant in complex and multicomponent wastewater produced by breeding and animal husbandry that can interfere with soil respiration 7 nitrification 8 fe iii reduction and phosphatase activity 9 the most lethal effects are produced by a variety of drug resistant strains in tc containing livestock wastewater 10 the environmental risk posed by the heavy metal ion cu ii in wastewater has been studied using the dynamic mass balance model 11 over the next 10 50 years soil pollution from copper ions in wastewater will exceed the threshold level for agricultural soil resulting in severe poisoning 12 adsorption biological processes membrane separation chemical oxidation and photocatalysis are typically used to separately remove cu ii or tc from livestock wastewater 13 15 56 in recent years photocatalysis has become an effective method for removing tc or cu ii because of the mild and environmental conditions involved high efficiency and economy tio2 table s1 16 17 is one of the most widely used photocatalytic reagents reyes 18 et al demonstrated that p25 degraded 40 mg l tc in 1 h under uv light which verified the feasibility of using tio2 for photocatalytic inactivation of tetracycline in the presence of bacteria kabra et al 19 used tio2 as a photocatalysis and lemon acid as a sacrificial agent to obtain a 97 photoreduction deposition rate for cu ii which was the highest among four investigated metal ions however tc and cu ii are two typical components in livestock wastewater that do not occur separately and may affect each other researchers found that tc and cu ii coexisted in many farm wastewaters in china at contents exceeding discharge standards 20 21 it has been reported that tc contains many groups that can coordinate with cu ii tc and cu ii start to form complexes at phs 2 for phs ranging from 5 to 7 tc and cu ii mainly exist in the form of cuhtc 22 moreover studies have shown that when cu ii and tc coexist as a complex the presence of cu ii can increase the occurrence probability of antibiotic resistance genes args all these problems make environmental issues more complex and increase the risk of environmental pollution 23 25 therefore treatment of pollution of tc cu ii and associated complexes is urgently needed lu et al attempted to remove tc cu ii complexes by electrocoagulation 26 wang studied the treatment efficiency of tc and cu ii for separate and coexisting pollutants 27 the study results showed that a photocatalyst could be used to completely remove tc but not cu ii from wastewater wang proposed the use of tio2 as a photocatalyst assisted by formic acid to treat tc cu ii wastewater 28 the proposed treatment completely removed tc and copper ions in the wastewater wang s study showed that photocatalytic technology can effectively treat tc cu ii wastewater however copper is not considered as a recyclable resource in tc cu ii treatment processes cu ions easily deposit on the surface of a catalyst or electrode resulting in photocatalyst deactivation or destruction of the electrode material 29 copper is a metal that is widely used by humans in many fields 30 therefore it would be useful to develop a process that can effectively control the pollution of tc cu ii and recover copper 31 32 conventional methods used to recover copper from wastewater resources include precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange resin adsorption 33 35 adsorption is a relatively simple very safety and environmentally friendly process however it is difficult to achieve 100 adsorption and recovery of multicomponent copper 36 the variable and complex composition of real aquaculture wastewater can affect copper ion adsorption therefore a multistage coupling treatment method is required to increase the copper recovery yield and deal with the multiple components in actual wastewater 37 tc can be first degraded by photocatalysis copper ions can then be recovered by adsorption lewatit tp207 38 is a weakly acidic macroporous cation exchange resin containing functional groups that can effectively remove cu ii the adsorption capacity of tp207 is not affected by the presence of nitrogen atoms polyvalent organic acids phosphoric acid and other compounds in wastewater these characteristics make tp207 suitable adsorbent for ion exchange adsorption in the treatment of complex aquaculture wastewater in this study a two step process coupling photocatalysis with adsorption was proposed to treat with tc cu ii mixed wastewater as a typical wastewater produced by livestock husbandry the selectivity of tio2 for tc resulted in the effective separation of the two types of pollutants that met the regulatory standard for the tc concentration then tp207 was introduced to recover cu ii from the photocatalytic residual solution thereby meeting the cu ii emission standard the effects of the coexistence of pollutants the quantity of resin used and the solution ph on cu ii adsorption were investigated the proposed joint treatment process coupled photocatalysis and resin adsorption to effectively treat of tc cu ii mixed wastewater and recover cu ii combined tio2 photocatalysis tp207 adsorption is a simple and feasible method of recovering heavy metal ions after the degradation of organic matter that can serve as a reference for the treatment of real complex wastewater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials butyl titanate isopropanol sodium hydroxide and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab of analytical grade were purchased from chengdu kelon reagent co ltd chengdu china tetracycline tc ar and copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o ar were obtained from aladdin industrial co shanghai china all chemical reagents were directly used without further purification ultrapure water was used for all preparation and washing stages lewatit tp207 ion exchange resin was obtained from yijiayuan environmental protection technology co ltd shenzhen china 2 2 synthesis of tio2 in this paper tio2 was first prepared by a sol gel method then 10 ml of butyl titanate 40 ml of isopropanol and 0 04 g of ctab were successively added to a beaker containing tio2 the solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min 20 ml of an isopropanol solution containing 10 water by volume were slowly added and the resulting solution was stirred continuously for 4 h the resulting white precipitate was washed with ultra pure water centrifuged and dried at 80 c for 24 h the product was calcined in a muffle furnace for 4 h at a final temperature of 500 c which was reached using a heating rate of 2 c min 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic and adsorption performances a simulated wastewater solution containing tc cu ii tc 20 mg l cu ii 10 mg l was prepared in a volumetric flask a mixture of 30 mg of tio2 and 30 ml of tc cu ii was added to a 50 ml quartz tube which was placed in a photochemical reactor aulight ce lab500e4 beijing irradiated using a 500 w mercury lamp for photocatalysis the solution was reacted in the dark until adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached before exposure to light the supernatant was collected the concentration of tc was determined by tu 1901 uv vis spectrophotometer and the concentration of cu ii was determined by aa320n atomic absorption spectrophotometer the adsorption performance of tp207 was tested tp207 and 20 ml of a cu ii solution were placed in a quartz tube and stirred continuously at a prescribed temperature the residual solution obtained after adsorption was removed and the measured kinetic curve was fitted the entire adsorption process was carried out in a thermostatic oscillator a mass of tp207 was added to conical flasks with containing 20 ml of cu ii solutions of different concentrations oscillating adsorption was performed for 24 h at different temperatures and a thermodynamic curve was generated the tp207 stability was tested recycle experiment a prescribed mass of tp207 and 20 ml of the treated solution were weighed into a conical flask which was stoppered and placed in an oscillating chamber a constant temperature water bath at 298 15 k adsorption was allowed to proceed in the dark for 24 h the supernatant was removed and the cu content was analyzed regeneration experiment after the reaction was complete tp207 was separated from the reaction solution and an appropriate quantity of 10 nitric acid was added to the residual solution then the residual solution was soaked in naoh solution with an appropriate concentration for a period of time finally the residual solution was washed with deionized water until the upper liquid had a neutral ph the cu content of the residual solution was analyzed by an aa320n flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer fig 1 the following formula was used to calculate the adsorption capacity of tp207 for copper 1 q v c 0 c m where q mg g is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent v l is the solution volume and m g is the mass of the adsorbent 2 4 characterization jsm 7610f scanning electron microscope sem was used to observe the morphology and element distribution of tp207 and tio2 before and after the reaction fig s1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis dandong haoyuan dx2700 china was conducted to study the structures of the photocatalyst the chemical changes before and after the reaction of tp207 and tio2 were characterized and measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi from thermo scientific the excitation source of the spectrometer was al kα e 1486 6 ev the binding energy results were calibrated with c1s 284 8 ev as the benchmark the functional groups on the surface of tp207 were characterized and measured by model spectrum two li10014 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir in a range of 500 4000 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption characteristics of tp207 for a cu ii solution 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics it is necessary to prevent the potential environmental problems caused by using chemicals and organic solvents to treat animal husbandry wastewater lewatit tp207 is a commercial ion exchange resin that is effective for recovering cu ii from aquaculture wastewater as cu ii generally occurs in low concentrations in aquaculture wastewater the adsorption ability of the tp207 ion exchange resin was evaluated for low cu ii concentrations fig 2c shows that the color of tp207 from light yellow to peacock blue after adsorbing cu ii the blue color is associated with the presence of copper ions the adsorption rate of tp207 for cu ii was initially very high and 50 of the cu ii ions were removed from the solution within 2 min the adsorption rate then gradually slowed after 15 min the concentration of residual cu ii was less than 0 5 mg l which met the first level discharge standard 0 5 mg l gb8978 1996 to further analyze the adsorption characteristics of tp207 for cu ii the abovementioned data were fitted pseudo first order kinetics fig 2a 39 and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 2b 40 table 1 shows that both pseudo first order and second order kinetics can describe the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 where the r2 values are 0 995 and 0 986 respectively the theoretical adsorption capacity obtained from the primary and secondary kinetic models is 4 98 mg g and 5 22 mg g respectively whereas the experimental value is 5 04 mg g therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model describes adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 better than the secondary kinetic model indicating a diffusion controlled process consistent with other studies 41 42 the adsorption isotherm for tp207 in a solution of pure copper ions was also analyzed pure copper solutions with concentrations of 2 4 6 8 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were used the adsorbent concentration was fixed at 0 5 g l to ensure that the tp207 saturated adsorption capacity was being measured the adsorption time was extended to 24 h the results are shown in fig 2d at a fixed temperature the adsorption capacity of tp207 in 50 mg l pure copper solution has still not fully saturated the adsorption capacity of tp207 for copper at low concentrations far exceeds the actual requirement the quantity of tp207 used can fully meets the required capacity for the treatment of copper ions in livestock wastewater the adsorption of copper at low concentrations by tp207 is independent of temperature to conserve heat energy adsorption is carried out at 298 15 k 3 1 2 effect of coexisting pollutants the aforementioned experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of tp207 to treat a tc cu ii solution by adsorption however the adsorption performance of tp207 for wastewater from actual livestock production is not only affected by the presence of heavy metals and antibiotics but also by nitrogen containing organic matter phosphorous organic matter high cod surfactants and other pollutants therefore to verify the practicability of using tp207 to treat tc cu ii mixed solutions it is necessary to study the influence of coexisting pollutants on the adsorption performance of tp207 to simulate real livestock wastewater 40 mg of tp207 were added to a 10 mg l cu ii mixed solution mixed solutions were made up containing a photocatalytic residue dtc zn ii 10 mg l n n dimethylformamide 500 mg l tributyl phosphate 30 mg l chloramphenicol cpl 10 mg l and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs 2000 mg l the concentration of cu ii in the different solutions was analyzed after stirring at a constant temperature for 15 min fig 3 shows the adsorption by tp207 for cu ii coexisting with pollutants such as zn ii n chloramphenicol p and a tc cu ii photocatalytic residue the residual quantity of cu ii in the solution reaches the specified standard within 15 min thus the other pollutants have little effect on the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 the removal efficiency of cu ii can be affected by coexisting tc sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and other macromolecules in the solution it is difficult to obtain a cu ii removal of 100 the cu ii concentrations in the two solutions after 15 min of stirring remained at 2 0 mg l and 8 1 mg l the experimental results show that the presence of macromolecular organic matter affects cu ii adsorption therefore cu ii can only be completely adsorbed after tc has been completely degraded the wastewater treated by the proposed two step process met the regulatory standards tc was first degraded by photocatalysis using tio2 and then tp207 was used to adsorb cu ii whereby the treated aquaculture sewage met the regulatory standards only the residual solution obtained using photocatalysis was investigated in subsequent experiments 3 2 adsorption of tc cu ii from a photocatalytic residual solution 3 2 1 photodegradation of mixed wastewater by tio2 following a procedure reported in the literature 30 mg of tio2 were added to 30 ml of a tc cu ii mixed solution tc 20 mg l cu ii 10 mg l the solution was placed in the dark until equilibrium was reached and then illuminated under a mercury lamp without the addition of any reagents wang reported a treatment without harmful effects in which formic acid was added as a sacrificial agent however formic acid and tc have competitive photooxidation effects which wastes photodegradation capacity and increases the treatment time and cost formic acid was used to facilitate the reduction of cu ii to cu 0 which was deposited on the catalyst surface under photoreduction thereby decreasing the photocatalytic performance and wasting copper resources 28 for this reason an experiment was designed to ensure the complete reaction of tc and no sacrificial agent was added fig 4a shows that approximately 30 of the tc in the solution is adsorbed on the surface of tio2 after 30 min of illumination the removal rate of tc from the solution is as high as 85 and the residual tc concentration in the solution after 40 min of illumination is only 1 mg l a small number of copper ions are lost in the process of illumination and dark adsorption fig 4b shows that approximately 20 of the copper ions adsorb onto tio2 during the dark adsorption stage is only 2 1 the residual tc cu ii solution collected after the photocatalytic reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min almost no tc was detected in the solution the cod of the solution was 13 5 mg l the copper ion concentration of the photocatalytic residue was 6 94 mg l which was also consistent with wang s report 28 photoreduction resulted in a very small quantity of cu 0 being deposited on the tio2 surface fig s5 sem mapping of tio2 was performed before and after the reaction fig s1 in the sem mapping the densities of ti and o after the reaction are uniformly distributed and significantly higher than that of cu fig 5 elemental copper is highly dispersed on the tio2 surface this result shows that a small quantity of cu 0 was deposited on the photocatalyst surface as supported by xps fig s3 43 cu exists in the form of cu 0 and not cu i on tio2 no cu 0 can be observed on the tio2 surface after use fig 6c the presence of copper is almost undetectable by eds 0 01 fig s2 there is no diffraction peak corresponding to copper oxide or cuprous oxide in the xrd diffractogram fig 6a consistent with the xps results thus without a sacrificial agent there is no discernible removal of cu ii using a single photocatalytic stage it is necessary to find an economical method that can be used to treat tc without harmful effects and also recover and utilize copper fig 4c shows that the removal rate of tio2 from the tc cu ii mixed solution remains above 97 after 5 cycles demonstrating the stability of the proposed process the diffraction peaks of 25 58 37 80 and 48 05 in the xrd images correspond to the crystal planes of 101 0 0 4 and 200 anatase type tio2 fig 6a respectively the photocatalyst retains the anatase structure after the photocatalytic process is completed in fig 6 b c the crystallinity and morphology do not change significantly and the granular appearance is unchanged these results indicate that tio2 remains highly stable during the tc removal process 3 2 2 effect of the tp207 dosage and initial solution ph the results of the experiments described above showed that tp207 adsorbed copper ions effectively and quickly from the investigated solution to realize the recovery of copper ions and meet wastewater standards to optimize the conditions for tp207 use the influence of the adsorbent and the initial solution ph were investigated tp207 masses corresponding to concentrations of 1 g l 2 g l 3 g l 4 g l and 5 g l were placed in conical bottles containing 30 ml of the photocatalytic residue the conical vials were placed in a shaker for 24 h at 298 15 k samples were collected for analysis parallel experiments were repeated three times and the data were used to generate error bars the results are shown in fig 7a for a tp207 concentration of 1 g l the initial cu ii concentration in the solution was reduced to 1 87 mg l after 24 h that is the solution could not be processed to meet the regulatory discharge standard for tp207 concentration above 1 g l the residual cu ii concentration in the solution was less than 0 2 mg l and the cod was 13 54 mg l which met the standards specified for wastewater discharge considering both the cu ii removal effect and cost savings the optimal dosage of tp207 was 2 g l animal husbandry wastewater is often acidic and the solution ph may affect the complexation mechanism for tc cu ii and therefore the ion exchange performance of tp207 thus to simulate real wastewater conditions the ph of the tc cu ii solution was adjusted to 1 2 3 4 and 5 using a prepared dilute hno3 solution the tp207 concentration was fixed at 2 g l the simulated wastewater solution with added tp207 was shaken continuously for 24 h at 298 15 k parallel experiments were repeated three times and the data were used to generate error bars the results are shown in fig 7b for solution phs in the range of 1 to 5 the difference in the quantity of cu ions absorbed by tp207 is less than 1 mg g which is consistent with the theoretical adsorbed quantity the macromolecular organic matter in the tc cu ii residual solution has been degraded by photocatalysis and the influence of the ph on the state of the cu ions is weakened therefore the adsorption of cu ii by tp207 is almost unaffected by the solution ph the residual solution after photocatalysis can be directly treated object in subsequent experiments without adjusting the ph 3 2 3 adsorption of tc cu ii in photocatalytic residual solution by tp207 the next step after determining the influence of the solution ph and tp207 dosage on the adsorption process was to explore the effect of tc on adsorption of tc cu ii mixed wastewater in real aquaculture wastewater the presence of tc and macromolecular pollutants can affect the adsorption of copper a two step method tc photodegration by tio2 coupled with adsorption of copper ions by tp207 was proposed to solve this problem in this study it has previously been demonstrated that photocatalysis process can be used to meet the tc regulatory standard whereas the cu ii concentration of the treated solution cannot reach the corresponding regulatory standard therefore the adsorption of copper ions in the residue by tp207 was investigated specifically 40 mg of tp207 particles were added to 20 ml of the tc cu ii photocatalyzed residual solution the resulting solution was continuously stirred and sampled at intervals to obtain kinetic data which were used to extract parameters for subsequent process design in fig 8a the cu ii concentration in the solution changes with time the adsorption rate of cu ii onto tp207 is relatively high after 2 min 78 of cu ii in the solution has been removed after 5 min the residual cu ii concentration in the solution is 0 5 mg l which meets the first grade emission standard gb8978 1996 the data presented above were fitted with pseudo first order fig 8c and pseudo second order kinetics fig 8d a higher degree of fit was obtained by fitting the pseudo first order kinetic model to the cu ii concentration in the tp207 adsorption residue where the r2 was 0 999 table 2 shows a theoretical adsorption capacity of 3 73 mg g for the first stage is obtained using the experimental data whereas the experimentally measured value is 3 70 mg g indicating a high adsorption efficiency for the first stage therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model describes the adsorption of cu ii from the photocatalytic residue by tp207 better than the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating a diffusion controlled 29 this conclusion is consistent with the aforementioned results for tp207 for adsorbing pure cu ii from an aqueous solution indicating the adsorption effect for copper ions by tp207 from both the pure copper solution and the photocatalytic residue solution to reduce costs and pollution material stability should be considered in adsorbent selection in this study the solution condition remained the same over five treatment cycles using tp207 in fig 8b the removal rate of cu ii from the residue remains higher than 95 after 5 cycles the cu ii concentration is only 0 3 mg l which meets the first level emission standard 44 45 the maximum desorption rate of cu ii from tp207 by acid leaching was 81 4 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism to further prove the effectiveness of tp207 adsorption several tests were carried out on tp207 before and after adsorption the sem mapping presented in fig 9e shows the presence of a large number of uniformly distributed na elements a na type ion exchange tp207 resin was used mainly for consistency with reports in the literature the absorption peak of tp207 in ftir spectra is different before and after adsorption 46 before adsorption the tp207 resin spectrum does not exhibit a characteristic absorption peak for carbon in from cooh at 1725 1700 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks corresponding to a carboxylate coona carbon base appear at 1633 02 and 1422 04 cm 1 respectively fig 10a a a second observation is that the absorption peak for tp207 after absorbing cu ions from the pure copper solution is offset to 1408 93 cm 1 fig 10a b this result implies that the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group can contribute a pair of electrons to form a coordination bond with cu2 third the same peak shift to 1408 93 cm 1 occurs after cu ions from the light residual liquid in addition after cu ions have been adsorbed from the light residual liquid by tp207 the peak at 1051 99 cm 1 shifts to 1113 82 cm 1 fig 10a c 47 48 this result implies that a coordination covalent bond forms between the nitrogen atom in the amino group and the copper ion therefore copper ions are chemisorbed onto the tp207 surface rather than being physisorbed chemisorption mainly occurs via a coordination reaction involving iminodiacetic acid functional groups copper ions replace sodium ions and are absorbed by na type tp207 the adsorption mechanism of tp207 for cu ii was confirmed the xps characterization results for tp207 before and after cu ii adsorption from the light residual solution are shown in fig 10b the spectrum for the tp207 resin surface after adsorption exhibited a clear cu 2p orbital signal that was not present in the spectrum of tp207 before adsorption this result indicates that cu ii was successfully adsorbed by tp207 the signals for the sodium ions on the tp207 surface weakened significantly after adsorption indicating that an ion exchange process may occur between cu and na the cu 2p orbitals on the tp207 surface were further analyzed no cu characteristic peak was detected in the tp207 spectrum before adsorption fig 10c the spectrum of tp207 after adsorption exhibited a binding energy peak 49 of 954 2 ev for cu 2p1 2 and 934 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 fig 10d this result indicates that tp207 can effectively adsorb copper ions and the cu adsorbed on the tp207 surface is a divalent ion a satellite peak 50 of cu 2p was observed at 942 8 ev and 962 6 ev it is thus confirmed that the cu adsorbed onto tp207 exists in the form of divalent ions the o 1 s orbitals before fig 10e and after fig 10f tp207 adsorption of cu ii from the mixed solution were detected using xps 51 55 before adsorption the binding energy peaks at 530 7 ev and 531 2 ev correspond to cooh and co respectively the binding energy peak at 535 6 ev before adsorption is na kl2 auger indicating that the effective functional group in tp207 is coona the area ratio of co to cooh on the tp207 surface before adsorption is 1 39 after adsorption a new binding energy peak appears at 532 5 ev resulting from the interaction between cooh and cu ii the peak area ratio of co to cooh increases to 1 63 and no na kl2 auger is detected this result indicates that an ion exchange process occurs between the na in the coona group on the tp207 surface and cu ii in the mixed solution leading to a decrease in the cu content in the mixed solution these results suggest that the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 occurs via ion exchange and chemisorption this conclusion is consistent with the detection of copper by sem mapping fig 9c therefore tp207 has stable physical and chemical properties that do not change during the adsorption process and can be used to effectively and quickly recover cu ii resources 3 3 hybrid process of photocatalysis and adsorption the aforementioned experimental results for tc cu ii mixed wastewater generated from real livestock production showed that the coexistence of pollutants with tc can affect copper adsorption therefore the sequence of photocatalysis and adsorption is particularly important the adsorbed copper concentration was used to evaluate the three different technical routes shown in fig 11a to treat wastewater in this study in path 1 tp207 was first used as an adsorbent for the tc cu ii solution tp207 was filtered out of the solution and tio2 was added to perform photocatalytic adsorption on the residual solution in path 2 tio2 was first added to a photocatalytic tc cu ii solution and followed by adding tp207 for adsorption of the photocatalytic residual solution in path 3 tp207 and tio2 were added at the same time to perform photocatalysis and adsorption simultaneously the wastewater was treated using the three aforementioned schemes the tc and cu ii concentrations and the cod of the treated solution were measured the results are shown in fig 11b and table 3 the residual cu ii concentrations in the solution treated by the three schemes were 0 17 mg l 0 20 mg l and 0 46 mg l the concentration of cu ions in the treated wastewater meets the first class emission standard however the residual tc concentration in the solution treated using the three schemes were 7 2 mg l 1 1 mg l and 6 9 mg l thus only the second scheme can sufficiently purify the tc cu ii solution the cod of the solution treated by the three processes was also evaluated the initial cod of the tc cu ii mixed solution was 48 2 mg l the lowest cod of 13 5 mg l corresponded to the solution treated by the second scheme the cod removal rate was 72 the cod of the solution treated obtained by the first and third processes was 39 1 mg l and 37 6 mg l respectively this result could be attributed to the transformation of macromolecular organic matter into small molecules rather than being completely degraded resulting in an insignificant reduction of the cod by the two aforementioned processes changing the process sequence resulted in different required processing times for the different treatment schemes in the first scheme complexation between tc and the copper ions affected the copper adsorption performance and the adsorption time was considerably prolonged up to 1650 min although the total adsorption time was reduced to 210 min by performing photocatalysis and adsorption simultaneously the processing time was more than 4 times that of the second method to determine the reasons for the different treatment efficiencies of the three schemes the photocatalytic coupling adsorption process was further investigated the relationship between the adsorbent and adsorbent was analyzed in depth a total of 40 mg of tp207 were added to the tc cu ii mixed wastewater and the reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark for 24 h ultraviolet visible spectrum scans of the solution before and after the reaction were obtained in fig 11c the characteristic peak of tc in the spectrum for the untreated tc cu ii mixed wastewater appears at 372 nm indicating complexation between tc and cu ii fig s4 after adsorption the characteristic peak at 372 nm is redshifted to 402 nm and becomes wider and smaller this result indicates that tp207 mainly adsorbed tc from the mixed wastewater causing the shift of the characteristic peak tp207 adsorbs tc and cu ii at the same time which can reduce the selectivity of tp207 therefore the second scheme should be selected to eliminate this effect tp207 played a major role in the removal of cu ii from the mixed solution by the first process however the interaction between tp207 and the tc cu ii mixed wastewater considerably reduced the adsorption rate of cu ii and prolonged the adsorption time in the second scheme photocatalysis by tio2 completely degraded tc and reduced the influence of tc on adsorption by tp207 as the ability of tp207 to adsorb cu ii is diffusion controlled equilibrium was reached in 15 min in the third process tp207 adsorbed tc and cu ii simultaneously during the reaction fig 4b shows that tio2 also has a photocatalytic effect on cu ii the complex interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbed ions increases the difficulty of using tp207 to remove tc and cu ii in summary the treatment process was selected in which tio2 was first used to completely photocatalytic degrade tc followed by adding tp207 for complete adsorption of cu ii thereby the treated wastewater met the discharge standards for a short treatment time coupling photocatalytic degradation of tc by tio2 with adsorption of copper ions by tp207 is the best choice for tc cu ii mixed wastewater treatment both the tc and cu ii concentrations in the treated wastewater meet the first level emission standards the cod of the treated wastewater is 13 54 mg l and no auxiliary sacrificial agent is needed copper resources can be recycled the treatment time is short and the treatment process is environment friendly 4 conclusions to realize the environmentally and economically feasible treatment of antibiotics and heavy metal ions in livestock wastewater a novel process for treating tc cu ii mixed wastewater is developed based on coupling photocatalysis with adsorption first the tc in the mixed wastewater is degraded by tio2 photocatalysis then tp207 is introduced to realize the treatment treat cu ii the factors affecting the adsorption performance of tp207 for cu ii are discussed in detail and copper resources recovered the adsorption performance of tp207 is found to be inhibited by the presence of macromolecular organics based on the experimental results an optimal process coupling tio2 photocatalysis with tp207 adsorption is proposed after the reaction the concentrations of tc and cu ii are 1 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively which meet the first level emission standards after desorption the copper recovery rate of tp207 reaches 81 tio2 and tp207 maintain good stability after five treatment cycles a novel process for treating tc cu ii wastewater is developed in this study that serves as a reference for developing an environmentally friendly and economically feasible

13044,the rapid development of large scale animal husbandry has led to an increase in the quantities of tetracycline tc cu ii and pollutants resulting from the complexation of these substances in wastewater that is severely damaging to the environment novel environmental technology to treat tc cu ii mixed polluted wastewater is urgently required in this study a novel process was developed combining tio2 photocatalysis with tp207 adsorption to treat tc cu ii mixed wastewater and recover copper resources the concentrations of tc and cu ii in the treated wastewater were 1 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively meeting emission standards the copper recovery efficiency for tp207 desorption reached 81 both tio2 and tp207 maintained good stability over five treatment cycles the tc cu ii mixed wastewater was treated without any harmful effects and copper resources were recovered using the aforementioned combined process an alternative treatment for mixed wastewater containing antibiotics and heavy metals was proposed in this study keywords photocatalysis adsorption tp207 tetracycline copper ii 1 introduction improvements in the quality of modern life have resulted in a gradually increasing demand for poultry meat products this situation has promoted the rapid development and expansion of animal husbandry 1 however to accelerate poultry growth and prevent epidemics suppliers often add excessive quantities of antibiotics and heavy metals to feed during the process of livestock production residual metals and antibiotics that cannot be absorbed by the soil enter wastewater resulting in severe water pollution 2 3 tetracycline antibiotics and copper ions are the representative sources of domestic aquaculture wastewater pollution 4 6 an effective process to treat tc cu ii mixed wastewater produced by animal husbandry is proposed in this study tetracycline is a typical pollutant in complex and multicomponent wastewater produced by breeding and animal husbandry that can interfere with soil respiration 7 nitrification 8 fe iii reduction and phosphatase activity 9 the most lethal effects are produced by a variety of drug resistant strains in tc containing livestock wastewater 10 the environmental risk posed by the heavy metal ion cu ii in wastewater has been studied using the dynamic mass balance model 11 over the next 10 50 years soil pollution from copper ions in wastewater will exceed the threshold level for agricultural soil resulting in severe poisoning 12 adsorption biological processes membrane separation chemical oxidation and photocatalysis are typically used to separately remove cu ii or tc from livestock wastewater 13 15 56 in recent years photocatalysis has become an effective method for removing tc or cu ii because of the mild and environmental conditions involved high efficiency and economy tio2 table s1 16 17 is one of the most widely used photocatalytic reagents reyes 18 et al demonstrated that p25 degraded 40 mg l tc in 1 h under uv light which verified the feasibility of using tio2 for photocatalytic inactivation of tetracycline in the presence of bacteria kabra et al 19 used tio2 as a photocatalysis and lemon acid as a sacrificial agent to obtain a 97 photoreduction deposition rate for cu ii which was the highest among four investigated metal ions however tc and cu ii are two typical components in livestock wastewater that do not occur separately and may affect each other researchers found that tc and cu ii coexisted in many farm wastewaters in china at contents exceeding discharge standards 20 21 it has been reported that tc contains many groups that can coordinate with cu ii tc and cu ii start to form complexes at phs 2 for phs ranging from 5 to 7 tc and cu ii mainly exist in the form of cuhtc 22 moreover studies have shown that when cu ii and tc coexist as a complex the presence of cu ii can increase the occurrence probability of antibiotic resistance genes args all these problems make environmental issues more complex and increase the risk of environmental pollution 23 25 therefore treatment of pollution of tc cu ii and associated complexes is urgently needed lu et al attempted to remove tc cu ii complexes by electrocoagulation 26 wang studied the treatment efficiency of tc and cu ii for separate and coexisting pollutants 27 the study results showed that a photocatalyst could be used to completely remove tc but not cu ii from wastewater wang proposed the use of tio2 as a photocatalyst assisted by formic acid to treat tc cu ii wastewater 28 the proposed treatment completely removed tc and copper ions in the wastewater wang s study showed that photocatalytic technology can effectively treat tc cu ii wastewater however copper is not considered as a recyclable resource in tc cu ii treatment processes cu ions easily deposit on the surface of a catalyst or electrode resulting in photocatalyst deactivation or destruction of the electrode material 29 copper is a metal that is widely used by humans in many fields 30 therefore it would be useful to develop a process that can effectively control the pollution of tc cu ii and recover copper 31 32 conventional methods used to recover copper from wastewater resources include precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange resin adsorption 33 35 adsorption is a relatively simple very safety and environmentally friendly process however it is difficult to achieve 100 adsorption and recovery of multicomponent copper 36 the variable and complex composition of real aquaculture wastewater can affect copper ion adsorption therefore a multistage coupling treatment method is required to increase the copper recovery yield and deal with the multiple components in actual wastewater 37 tc can be first degraded by photocatalysis copper ions can then be recovered by adsorption lewatit tp207 38 is a weakly acidic macroporous cation exchange resin containing functional groups that can effectively remove cu ii the adsorption capacity of tp207 is not affected by the presence of nitrogen atoms polyvalent organic acids phosphoric acid and other compounds in wastewater these characteristics make tp207 suitable adsorbent for ion exchange adsorption in the treatment of complex aquaculture wastewater in this study a two step process coupling photocatalysis with adsorption was proposed to treat with tc cu ii mixed wastewater as a typical wastewater produced by livestock husbandry the selectivity of tio2 for tc resulted in the effective separation of the two types of pollutants that met the regulatory standard for the tc concentration then tp207 was introduced to recover cu ii from the photocatalytic residual solution thereby meeting the cu ii emission standard the effects of the coexistence of pollutants the quantity of resin used and the solution ph on cu ii adsorption were investigated the proposed joint treatment process coupled photocatalysis and resin adsorption to effectively treat of tc cu ii mixed wastewater and recover cu ii combined tio2 photocatalysis tp207 adsorption is a simple and feasible method of recovering heavy metal ions after the degradation of organic matter that can serve as a reference for the treatment of real complex wastewater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials butyl titanate isopropanol sodium hydroxide and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab of analytical grade were purchased from chengdu kelon reagent co ltd chengdu china tetracycline tc ar and copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o ar were obtained from aladdin industrial co shanghai china all chemical reagents were directly used without further purification ultrapure water was used for all preparation and washing stages lewatit tp207 ion exchange resin was obtained from yijiayuan environmental protection technology co ltd shenzhen china 2 2 synthesis of tio2 in this paper tio2 was first prepared by a sol gel method then 10 ml of butyl titanate 40 ml of isopropanol and 0 04 g of ctab were successively added to a beaker containing tio2 the solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min 20 ml of an isopropanol solution containing 10 water by volume were slowly added and the resulting solution was stirred continuously for 4 h the resulting white precipitate was washed with ultra pure water centrifuged and dried at 80 c for 24 h the product was calcined in a muffle furnace for 4 h at a final temperature of 500 c which was reached using a heating rate of 2 c min 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic and adsorption performances a simulated wastewater solution containing tc cu ii tc 20 mg l cu ii 10 mg l was prepared in a volumetric flask a mixture of 30 mg of tio2 and 30 ml of tc cu ii was added to a 50 ml quartz tube which was placed in a photochemical reactor aulight ce lab500e4 beijing irradiated using a 500 w mercury lamp for photocatalysis the solution was reacted in the dark until adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached before exposure to light the supernatant was collected the concentration of tc was determined by tu 1901 uv vis spectrophotometer and the concentration of cu ii was determined by aa320n atomic absorption spectrophotometer the adsorption performance of tp207 was tested tp207 and 20 ml of a cu ii solution were placed in a quartz tube and stirred continuously at a prescribed temperature the residual solution obtained after adsorption was removed and the measured kinetic curve was fitted the entire adsorption process was carried out in a thermostatic oscillator a mass of tp207 was added to conical flasks with containing 20 ml of cu ii solutions of different concentrations oscillating adsorption was performed for 24 h at different temperatures and a thermodynamic curve was generated the tp207 stability was tested recycle experiment a prescribed mass of tp207 and 20 ml of the treated solution were weighed into a conical flask which was stoppered and placed in an oscillating chamber a constant temperature water bath at 298 15 k adsorption was allowed to proceed in the dark for 24 h the supernatant was removed and the cu content was analyzed regeneration experiment after the reaction was complete tp207 was separated from the reaction solution and an appropriate quantity of 10 nitric acid was added to the residual solution then the residual solution was soaked in naoh solution with an appropriate concentration for a period of time finally the residual solution was washed with deionized water until the upper liquid had a neutral ph the cu content of the residual solution was analyzed by an aa320n flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer fig 1 the following formula was used to calculate the adsorption capacity of tp207 for copper 1 q v c 0 c m where q mg g is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent v l is the solution volume and m g is the mass of the adsorbent 2 4 characterization jsm 7610f scanning electron microscope sem was used to observe the morphology and element distribution of tp207 and tio2 before and after the reaction fig s1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis dandong haoyuan dx2700 china was conducted to study the structures of the photocatalyst the chemical changes before and after the reaction of tp207 and tio2 were characterized and measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi from thermo scientific the excitation source of the spectrometer was al kα e 1486 6 ev the binding energy results were calibrated with c1s 284 8 ev as the benchmark the functional groups on the surface of tp207 were characterized and measured by model spectrum two li10014 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir in a range of 500 4000 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption characteristics of tp207 for a cu ii solution 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics it is necessary to prevent the potential environmental problems caused by using chemicals and organic solvents to treat animal husbandry wastewater lewatit tp207 is a commercial ion exchange resin that is effective for recovering cu ii from aquaculture wastewater as cu ii generally occurs in low concentrations in aquaculture wastewater the adsorption ability of the tp207 ion exchange resin was evaluated for low cu ii concentrations fig 2c shows that the color of tp207 from light yellow to peacock blue after adsorbing cu ii the blue color is associated with the presence of copper ions the adsorption rate of tp207 for cu ii was initially very high and 50 of the cu ii ions were removed from the solution within 2 min the adsorption rate then gradually slowed after 15 min the concentration of residual cu ii was less than 0 5 mg l which met the first level discharge standard 0 5 mg l gb8978 1996 to further analyze the adsorption characteristics of tp207 for cu ii the abovementioned data were fitted pseudo first order kinetics fig 2a 39 and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 2b 40 table 1 shows that both pseudo first order and second order kinetics can describe the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 where the r2 values are 0 995 and 0 986 respectively the theoretical adsorption capacity obtained from the primary and secondary kinetic models is 4 98 mg g and 5 22 mg g respectively whereas the experimental value is 5 04 mg g therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model describes adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 better than the secondary kinetic model indicating a diffusion controlled process consistent with other studies 41 42 the adsorption isotherm for tp207 in a solution of pure copper ions was also analyzed pure copper solutions with concentrations of 2 4 6 8 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l were used the adsorbent concentration was fixed at 0 5 g l to ensure that the tp207 saturated adsorption capacity was being measured the adsorption time was extended to 24 h the results are shown in fig 2d at a fixed temperature the adsorption capacity of tp207 in 50 mg l pure copper solution has still not fully saturated the adsorption capacity of tp207 for copper at low concentrations far exceeds the actual requirement the quantity of tp207 used can fully meets the required capacity for the treatment of copper ions in livestock wastewater the adsorption of copper at low concentrations by tp207 is independent of temperature to conserve heat energy adsorption is carried out at 298 15 k 3 1 2 effect of coexisting pollutants the aforementioned experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of tp207 to treat a tc cu ii solution by adsorption however the adsorption performance of tp207 for wastewater from actual livestock production is not only affected by the presence of heavy metals and antibiotics but also by nitrogen containing organic matter phosphorous organic matter high cod surfactants and other pollutants therefore to verify the practicability of using tp207 to treat tc cu ii mixed solutions it is necessary to study the influence of coexisting pollutants on the adsorption performance of tp207 to simulate real livestock wastewater 40 mg of tp207 were added to a 10 mg l cu ii mixed solution mixed solutions were made up containing a photocatalytic residue dtc zn ii 10 mg l n n dimethylformamide 500 mg l tributyl phosphate 30 mg l chloramphenicol cpl 10 mg l and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs 2000 mg l the concentration of cu ii in the different solutions was analyzed after stirring at a constant temperature for 15 min fig 3 shows the adsorption by tp207 for cu ii coexisting with pollutants such as zn ii n chloramphenicol p and a tc cu ii photocatalytic residue the residual quantity of cu ii in the solution reaches the specified standard within 15 min thus the other pollutants have little effect on the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 the removal efficiency of cu ii can be affected by coexisting tc sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and other macromolecules in the solution it is difficult to obtain a cu ii removal of 100 the cu ii concentrations in the two solutions after 15 min of stirring remained at 2 0 mg l and 8 1 mg l the experimental results show that the presence of macromolecular organic matter affects cu ii adsorption therefore cu ii can only be completely adsorbed after tc has been completely degraded the wastewater treated by the proposed two step process met the regulatory standards tc was first degraded by photocatalysis using tio2 and then tp207 was used to adsorb cu ii whereby the treated aquaculture sewage met the regulatory standards only the residual solution obtained using photocatalysis was investigated in subsequent experiments 3 2 adsorption of tc cu ii from a photocatalytic residual solution 3 2 1 photodegradation of mixed wastewater by tio2 following a procedure reported in the literature 30 mg of tio2 were added to 30 ml of a tc cu ii mixed solution tc 20 mg l cu ii 10 mg l the solution was placed in the dark until equilibrium was reached and then illuminated under a mercury lamp without the addition of any reagents wang reported a treatment without harmful effects in which formic acid was added as a sacrificial agent however formic acid and tc have competitive photooxidation effects which wastes photodegradation capacity and increases the treatment time and cost formic acid was used to facilitate the reduction of cu ii to cu 0 which was deposited on the catalyst surface under photoreduction thereby decreasing the photocatalytic performance and wasting copper resources 28 for this reason an experiment was designed to ensure the complete reaction of tc and no sacrificial agent was added fig 4a shows that approximately 30 of the tc in the solution is adsorbed on the surface of tio2 after 30 min of illumination the removal rate of tc from the solution is as high as 85 and the residual tc concentration in the solution after 40 min of illumination is only 1 mg l a small number of copper ions are lost in the process of illumination and dark adsorption fig 4b shows that approximately 20 of the copper ions adsorb onto tio2 during the dark adsorption stage is only 2 1 the residual tc cu ii solution collected after the photocatalytic reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min almost no tc was detected in the solution the cod of the solution was 13 5 mg l the copper ion concentration of the photocatalytic residue was 6 94 mg l which was also consistent with wang s report 28 photoreduction resulted in a very small quantity of cu 0 being deposited on the tio2 surface fig s5 sem mapping of tio2 was performed before and after the reaction fig s1 in the sem mapping the densities of ti and o after the reaction are uniformly distributed and significantly higher than that of cu fig 5 elemental copper is highly dispersed on the tio2 surface this result shows that a small quantity of cu 0 was deposited on the photocatalyst surface as supported by xps fig s3 43 cu exists in the form of cu 0 and not cu i on tio2 no cu 0 can be observed on the tio2 surface after use fig 6c the presence of copper is almost undetectable by eds 0 01 fig s2 there is no diffraction peak corresponding to copper oxide or cuprous oxide in the xrd diffractogram fig 6a consistent with the xps results thus without a sacrificial agent there is no discernible removal of cu ii using a single photocatalytic stage it is necessary to find an economical method that can be used to treat tc without harmful effects and also recover and utilize copper fig 4c shows that the removal rate of tio2 from the tc cu ii mixed solution remains above 97 after 5 cycles demonstrating the stability of the proposed process the diffraction peaks of 25 58 37 80 and 48 05 in the xrd images correspond to the crystal planes of 101 0 0 4 and 200 anatase type tio2 fig 6a respectively the photocatalyst retains the anatase structure after the photocatalytic process is completed in fig 6 b c the crystallinity and morphology do not change significantly and the granular appearance is unchanged these results indicate that tio2 remains highly stable during the tc removal process 3 2 2 effect of the tp207 dosage and initial solution ph the results of the experiments described above showed that tp207 adsorbed copper ions effectively and quickly from the investigated solution to realize the recovery of copper ions and meet wastewater standards to optimize the conditions for tp207 use the influence of the adsorbent and the initial solution ph were investigated tp207 masses corresponding to concentrations of 1 g l 2 g l 3 g l 4 g l and 5 g l were placed in conical bottles containing 30 ml of the photocatalytic residue the conical vials were placed in a shaker for 24 h at 298 15 k samples were collected for analysis parallel experiments were repeated three times and the data were used to generate error bars the results are shown in fig 7a for a tp207 concentration of 1 g l the initial cu ii concentration in the solution was reduced to 1 87 mg l after 24 h that is the solution could not be processed to meet the regulatory discharge standard for tp207 concentration above 1 g l the residual cu ii concentration in the solution was less than 0 2 mg l and the cod was 13 54 mg l which met the standards specified for wastewater discharge considering both the cu ii removal effect and cost savings the optimal dosage of tp207 was 2 g l animal husbandry wastewater is often acidic and the solution ph may affect the complexation mechanism for tc cu ii and therefore the ion exchange performance of tp207 thus to simulate real wastewater conditions the ph of the tc cu ii solution was adjusted to 1 2 3 4 and 5 using a prepared dilute hno3 solution the tp207 concentration was fixed at 2 g l the simulated wastewater solution with added tp207 was shaken continuously for 24 h at 298 15 k parallel experiments were repeated three times and the data were used to generate error bars the results are shown in fig 7b for solution phs in the range of 1 to 5 the difference in the quantity of cu ions absorbed by tp207 is less than 1 mg g which is consistent with the theoretical adsorbed quantity the macromolecular organic matter in the tc cu ii residual solution has been degraded by photocatalysis and the influence of the ph on the state of the cu ions is weakened therefore the adsorption of cu ii by tp207 is almost unaffected by the solution ph the residual solution after photocatalysis can be directly treated object in subsequent experiments without adjusting the ph 3 2 3 adsorption of tc cu ii in photocatalytic residual solution by tp207 the next step after determining the influence of the solution ph and tp207 dosage on the adsorption process was to explore the effect of tc on adsorption of tc cu ii mixed wastewater in real aquaculture wastewater the presence of tc and macromolecular pollutants can affect the adsorption of copper a two step method tc photodegration by tio2 coupled with adsorption of copper ions by tp207 was proposed to solve this problem in this study it has previously been demonstrated that photocatalysis process can be used to meet the tc regulatory standard whereas the cu ii concentration of the treated solution cannot reach the corresponding regulatory standard therefore the adsorption of copper ions in the residue by tp207 was investigated specifically 40 mg of tp207 particles were added to 20 ml of the tc cu ii photocatalyzed residual solution the resulting solution was continuously stirred and sampled at intervals to obtain kinetic data which were used to extract parameters for subsequent process design in fig 8a the cu ii concentration in the solution changes with time the adsorption rate of cu ii onto tp207 is relatively high after 2 min 78 of cu ii in the solution has been removed after 5 min the residual cu ii concentration in the solution is 0 5 mg l which meets the first grade emission standard gb8978 1996 the data presented above were fitted with pseudo first order fig 8c and pseudo second order kinetics fig 8d a higher degree of fit was obtained by fitting the pseudo first order kinetic model to the cu ii concentration in the tp207 adsorption residue where the r2 was 0 999 table 2 shows a theoretical adsorption capacity of 3 73 mg g for the first stage is obtained using the experimental data whereas the experimentally measured value is 3 70 mg g indicating a high adsorption efficiency for the first stage therefore the pseudo first order kinetic model describes the adsorption of cu ii from the photocatalytic residue by tp207 better than the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating a diffusion controlled 29 this conclusion is consistent with the aforementioned results for tp207 for adsorbing pure cu ii from an aqueous solution indicating the adsorption effect for copper ions by tp207 from both the pure copper solution and the photocatalytic residue solution to reduce costs and pollution material stability should be considered in adsorbent selection in this study the solution condition remained the same over five treatment cycles using tp207 in fig 8b the removal rate of cu ii from the residue remains higher than 95 after 5 cycles the cu ii concentration is only 0 3 mg l which meets the first level emission standard 44 45 the maximum desorption rate of cu ii from tp207 by acid leaching was 81 4 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism to further prove the effectiveness of tp207 adsorption several tests were carried out on tp207 before and after adsorption the sem mapping presented in fig 9e shows the presence of a large number of uniformly distributed na elements a na type ion exchange tp207 resin was used mainly for consistency with reports in the literature the absorption peak of tp207 in ftir spectra is different before and after adsorption 46 before adsorption the tp207 resin spectrum does not exhibit a characteristic absorption peak for carbon in from cooh at 1725 1700 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks corresponding to a carboxylate coona carbon base appear at 1633 02 and 1422 04 cm 1 respectively fig 10a a a second observation is that the absorption peak for tp207 after absorbing cu ions from the pure copper solution is offset to 1408 93 cm 1 fig 10a b this result implies that the oxygen atom in the carboxyl group can contribute a pair of electrons to form a coordination bond with cu2 third the same peak shift to 1408 93 cm 1 occurs after cu ions from the light residual liquid in addition after cu ions have been adsorbed from the light residual liquid by tp207 the peak at 1051 99 cm 1 shifts to 1113 82 cm 1 fig 10a c 47 48 this result implies that a coordination covalent bond forms between the nitrogen atom in the amino group and the copper ion therefore copper ions are chemisorbed onto the tp207 surface rather than being physisorbed chemisorption mainly occurs via a coordination reaction involving iminodiacetic acid functional groups copper ions replace sodium ions and are absorbed by na type tp207 the adsorption mechanism of tp207 for cu ii was confirmed the xps characterization results for tp207 before and after cu ii adsorption from the light residual solution are shown in fig 10b the spectrum for the tp207 resin surface after adsorption exhibited a clear cu 2p orbital signal that was not present in the spectrum of tp207 before adsorption this result indicates that cu ii was successfully adsorbed by tp207 the signals for the sodium ions on the tp207 surface weakened significantly after adsorption indicating that an ion exchange process may occur between cu and na the cu 2p orbitals on the tp207 surface were further analyzed no cu characteristic peak was detected in the tp207 spectrum before adsorption fig 10c the spectrum of tp207 after adsorption exhibited a binding energy peak 49 of 954 2 ev for cu 2p1 2 and 934 3 ev for cu 2p3 2 fig 10d this result indicates that tp207 can effectively adsorb copper ions and the cu adsorbed on the tp207 surface is a divalent ion a satellite peak 50 of cu 2p was observed at 942 8 ev and 962 6 ev it is thus confirmed that the cu adsorbed onto tp207 exists in the form of divalent ions the o 1 s orbitals before fig 10e and after fig 10f tp207 adsorption of cu ii from the mixed solution were detected using xps 51 55 before adsorption the binding energy peaks at 530 7 ev and 531 2 ev correspond to cooh and co respectively the binding energy peak at 535 6 ev before adsorption is na kl2 auger indicating that the effective functional group in tp207 is coona the area ratio of co to cooh on the tp207 surface before adsorption is 1 39 after adsorption a new binding energy peak appears at 532 5 ev resulting from the interaction between cooh and cu ii the peak area ratio of co to cooh increases to 1 63 and no na kl2 auger is detected this result indicates that an ion exchange process occurs between the na in the coona group on the tp207 surface and cu ii in the mixed solution leading to a decrease in the cu content in the mixed solution these results suggest that the adsorption of cu ii from the solution by tp207 occurs via ion exchange and chemisorption this conclusion is consistent with the detection of copper by sem mapping fig 9c therefore tp207 has stable physical and chemical properties that do not change during the adsorption process and can be used to effectively and quickly recover cu ii resources 3 3 hybrid process of photocatalysis and adsorption the aforementioned experimental results for tc cu ii mixed wastewater generated from real livestock production showed that the coexistence of pollutants with tc can affect copper adsorption therefore the sequence of photocatalysis and adsorption is particularly important the adsorbed copper concentration was used to evaluate the three different technical routes shown in fig 11a to treat wastewater in this study in path 1 tp207 was first used as an adsorbent for the tc cu ii solution tp207 was filtered out of the solution and tio2 was added to perform photocatalytic adsorption on the residual solution in path 2 tio2 was first added to a photocatalytic tc cu ii solution and followed by adding tp207 for adsorption of the photocatalytic residual solution in path 3 tp207 and tio2 were added at the same time to perform photocatalysis and adsorption simultaneously the wastewater was treated using the three aforementioned schemes the tc and cu ii concentrations and the cod of the treated solution were measured the results are shown in fig 11b and table 3 the residual cu ii concentrations in the solution treated by the three schemes were 0 17 mg l 0 20 mg l and 0 46 mg l the concentration of cu ions in the treated wastewater meets the first class emission standard however the residual tc concentration in the solution treated using the three schemes were 7 2 mg l 1 1 mg l and 6 9 mg l thus only the second scheme can sufficiently purify the tc cu ii solution the cod of the solution treated by the three processes was also evaluated the initial cod of the tc cu ii mixed solution was 48 2 mg l the lowest cod of 13 5 mg l corresponded to the solution treated by the second scheme the cod removal rate was 72 the cod of the solution treated obtained by the first and third processes was 39 1 mg l and 37 6 mg l respectively this result could be attributed to the transformation of macromolecular organic matter into small molecules rather than being completely degraded resulting in an insignificant reduction of the cod by the two aforementioned processes changing the process sequence resulted in different required processing times for the different treatment schemes in the first scheme complexation between tc and the copper ions affected the copper adsorption performance and the adsorption time was considerably prolonged up to 1650 min although the total adsorption time was reduced to 210 min by performing photocatalysis and adsorption simultaneously the processing time was more than 4 times that of the second method to determine the reasons for the different treatment efficiencies of the three schemes the photocatalytic coupling adsorption process was further investigated the relationship between the adsorbent and adsorbent was analyzed in depth a total of 40 mg of tp207 were added to the tc cu ii mixed wastewater and the reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark for 24 h ultraviolet visible spectrum scans of the solution before and after the reaction were obtained in fig 11c the characteristic peak of tc in the spectrum for the untreated tc cu ii mixed wastewater appears at 372 nm indicating complexation between tc and cu ii fig s4 after adsorption the characteristic peak at 372 nm is redshifted to 402 nm and becomes wider and smaller this result indicates that tp207 mainly adsorbed tc from the mixed wastewater causing the shift of the characteristic peak tp207 adsorbs tc and cu ii at the same time which can reduce the selectivity of tp207 therefore the second scheme should be selected to eliminate this effect tp207 played a major role in the removal of cu ii from the mixed solution by the first process however the interaction between tp207 and the tc cu ii mixed wastewater considerably reduced the adsorption rate of cu ii and prolonged the adsorption time in the second scheme photocatalysis by tio2 completely degraded tc and reduced the influence of tc on adsorption by tp207 as the ability of tp207 to adsorb cu ii is diffusion controlled equilibrium was reached in 15 min in the third process tp207 adsorbed tc and cu ii simultaneously during the reaction fig 4b shows that tio2 also has a photocatalytic effect on cu ii the complex interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbed ions increases the difficulty of using tp207 to remove tc and cu ii in summary the treatment process was selected in which tio2 was first used to completely photocatalytic degrade tc followed by adding tp207 for complete adsorption of cu ii thereby the treated wastewater met the discharge standards for a short treatment time coupling photocatalytic degradation of tc by tio2 with adsorption of copper ions by tp207 is the best choice for tc cu ii mixed wastewater treatment both the tc and cu ii concentrations in the treated wastewater meet the first level emission standards the cod of the treated wastewater is 13 54 mg l and no auxiliary sacrificial agent is needed copper resources can be recycled the treatment time is short and the treatment process is environment friendly 4 conclusions to realize the environmentally and economically feasible treatment of antibiotics and heavy metal ions in livestock wastewater a novel process for treating tc cu ii mixed wastewater is developed based on coupling photocatalysis with adsorption first the tc in the mixed wastewater is degraded by tio2 photocatalysis then tp207 is introduced to realize the treatment treat cu ii the factors affecting the adsorption performance of tp207 for cu ii are discussed in detail and copper resources recovered the adsorption performance of tp207 is found to be inhibited by the presence of macromolecular organics based on the experimental results an optimal process coupling tio2 photocatalysis with tp207 adsorption is proposed after the reaction the concentrations of tc and cu ii are 1 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively which meet the first level emission standards after desorption the copper recovery rate of tp207 reaches 81 tio2 and tp207 maintain good stability after five treatment cycles a novel process for treating tc cu ii wastewater is developed in this study that serves as a reference for developing an environmentally friendly and economically feasible
