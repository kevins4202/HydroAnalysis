19980,emissions of ce from anthropogenic activities anthropogenic ce into urban wastewater systems and the environment result from its widespread industrial use abrasives catalysts nanotechnology because ce in sewage sludge can also be of geogenic origin the quantification of anthropogenic ce in sewage sludge remains elusive in this study we evaluated the suitability of ce oxidation state and rare earth element ree patterns for the quantification of anthropogenic ce fractions in sewage sludge a diverse set of soil samples served to gain baseline information on geogenic ce geogenic ce in the soils was characterized by high ce iii fractions 70 and their ree patterns were comparable to the ree patterns of the upper continental crust the sewage sludges contained on average 80 ce iv range 18 108 pointing to the importance of anthropogenic inputs of ce iv the quantification of the anthropogenic ce fraction based on ce oxidation state however was associated with considerable uncertainty because geogenic and anthropogenic ce cannot exclusively be assigned to ce iii and ce iv respectively the ree patterns of most sewage sludges indicated a clear enrichment of ce compared to heavier ree based on the assumption that the industrially used ce is free of most other ree we estimated the fraction of anthropogenic ce in the sludges based on individual ce ree ratios for the individual sludges the anthropogenic contributions were very variable 10 100 but consistent fractions were obtained for individual sludges when calculated based on ce dy dysprosium ce er erbium and ce eu europium ratios electron microscopy analysis of sludges dominated by anthropogenic ce revealed that the ce was mostly contained in nanoscale particles devoid of elements characteristic of ce bearing minerals thus anthropogenic ce contents derived from ree patterns may be used to validate current mass flow models for engineered ceo2 nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords engineered

ree are exclusively present in the trivalent state but ce may also occur in the tetravalent state marcus et al 2018 takahashi et al 2000 2002 2005 cerium iii resulting from weathering of rocks can precipitate as ce iv under oxidizing conditions resulting in a distinct transport fractionation and enrichment behaviour of ce compared to other ree which is referred to as the ce anomaly henderson 2013 however in terrestrial systems ce occurs mainly as ce iii in accessory minerals of igneous rocks such as phosphates silicates carbonates and oxides dahle and arai 2015 henderson 2013 kabata pendias 2010 schreiber et al 1980 for industrial uses ce is extracted mostly from the minerals bastnaesite ce co3 f and monazite cepo4 and separated from other ree by oxidation to ce iv and precipitation as ceria ce iv o2 hence ce iv o2 is considered the most widely industrially used ce compound voncken 2016 the industrial use of ce in catalysts e g in fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons automotive catalysts abrasives chemical mechanical planarization cmp additives glass production and alloys mischmetall voncken 2016 results in the emission of ce over the last two decades also an increasing number of applications of nanoscale ceo2 have been developed especially as catalyst and cmp agent however anthropogenic activities can also emit geogenic ce e g mining via acid mine drainage merten and büchel 2004 or the burning of coal kabata pendias 2010 in this work we therefore use the term anthropogenic ce to refer to anthropogenic ce emitted from industrial commercial ce applications unless stated otherwise wastewater treatment plants wwtp efficiently remove particulate matter from the wastewater stream which in turn leads to an accumulation of the respective material in the sewage sludge therefore anthropogenic ce discharged to municipal sewer systems is mixed with geogenic ce inputs resulting for example from surface run off including eroded soil material or extraneous water or mine drainage cerium contents in sewage sludge from wwtp have been quantified in several studies cerium concentrations of up to 153 mg kg 1 were reported from the uk and were attributed to inputs from the glass industry vivian 1986 more recently a monitoring study of three wwtp in china suanon et al 2017 and a survey of the metal contents in sewage sludge from switzerland vriens et al 2017 revealed that sewage sludge can contain up to 800 mg kg 1 ce in the total suspended solids tss the median ce content of municipal sewage sludge from switzerland 20 mg kg 1 n 64 however was below its average crustal abundance 60 mg kg 1 voncken 2016 thus elevated ce concentrations 100 mg kg 1 clearly point to industrial ce inputs the ability to discriminate between geogenic and anthropogenic ce is crucial for the assessment of potential environmental impacts of anthropogenic ce as well as for our understanding of global ce mass flows based on the notion that industrial applications of ce mainly result in emission of ce iv o2 and geogenic ce is mainly ce iii henderson 2013 voncken 2016 we hypothesize that the oxidation state of ce in sewage sludge can be used to quantify the fractions of ce of anthropogenic and geogenic origin trivalent ce in natural ce bearing minerals such as monazite and allanite occurs together with other ree whereas industrial ceo2 nano particles are expected to contain only negligible amounts of impurities laycock et al 2016 based on a consistent ce la ratio of 2 1 observed in soils worldwide ce la based on world average 1 9 kabata pendias 2010 the ce la ratios were recently suggested as a proxy to identify anthropogenic ce inputs into natural environments praetorius et al 2017 we therefore hypothesize that the ratio of ce over la and over other ree can be used to identify and eventually quantify anthropogenic ce inputs into wastewater systems in this study we evaluated to which extent the oxidation state of ce and ce ree ratios can be used to identify and quantify anthropogenic ce inputs into wwtp systems a suite of sewage sludge samples were investigated that cover a wide range of ce concentrations 10 1111 mg kg 1 and potentially variable anthropogenic and geogenic ce fractions using ce liii edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy the fractions of ce iii and ce iv in sewage sludge samples and in soil samples as proxies for geogenic ce were quantified in addition ce ree ratios were determined in total digests using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and used to estimate the fraction of anthropogenic ce finally analytical electron microscopy was employed to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic ce particles and to assess the size fraction in which anthropogenic ce particles dominantly occur 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil samples soil samples were obtained from the swiss soil monitoring network nationale bodenbeobachtung nabo 2019 all samples

samples were analyzed in triplicates all concentrations soils and sludges for ce and the other ree are tabulated table s3 2 3 2 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas samples were measured at the ce liii edge 5723 ev at the superxas x10da beamline at the swiss light source sls villigen switzerland the samples were prepared as pellets by mixing 90 mg of the dry and ball milled sample with 4 mg boron carbide and 4 mg quartz sand in an agate mortar and subsequent mixing with 10 mg cellulose from this mixture 80 mg were pressed into a 7 mm pellet using a handheld press during the measurements all samples and references were cooled with a n2 gas stream set to 100 k using a cryojet oxford instruments the energy of the x ray beam was calibrated by setting the first inflection point of the ce liii edge spectrum of ce iv o2 to 5723 ev all sample spectra and reference spectra of bulk ce iv o2 and ce iii allanite were measured in fluorescence mode using a 5 element silicon drift detector sgx sensortech buckinghamshire uk the structure of the reference materials has previously been confirmed by x ray diffraction gogos et al 2019 the software code sixpack webb 2005 was used to process the xas data following standard procedures to quantify the different ce species by linear combination fit lcf analysis for lcf analysis the xanes data between 5703 and 5843 ev were evaluated the fractions of individual ce species in the lcf analysis were constrained to values between 0 and 1 but the sum of the fractions was not constrained due to interferences at the la lii edge 5891 ev the exafs data were not evaluated 2 3 3 electron microscopy samples for electron microscopy em analyses were prepared by dispersing 15 mg of powdered sample in 1 5 ml 0 2 novachem postnova gmbh landsberg germany

onto a 0 1 poly l lysine functionalized carbon cu grid em resolutions ltd sheffield uk at 14 000 g for 1 h subsequently the grids were washed three times in a drop of nanopure water and air dried electron microscopy images were recorded on a scanning transmission electron microscope stem hd 2700 cs hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv using either a secondary electron se or a high angle annular dark field haadf detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 ce oxidation state in soils the ce liii edge xanes spectra of soil samples showed a clear ce iii signature at 5727 ev fig 1 a dashed line comparable to the ce allanite reference however except for soil so6 each spectrum also showed a slightly increased shoulder at 5739 ev fig 1 a right dotted line which is a characteristic feature for ce iv these observations were substantiated by lcf analyses fig 1 b and table s4 as the ce liii xanes is more sensitive to ce oxidation state than structural variations especially for ce iii species takahashi et al 2002 we only used ce allanite and ce iv o2 as references to quantify the fractions of ce iii and ce iv by lcf the inclusion of further reference spectra of ce iii parisite or ce iii po4 gogos et al 2019 did not improve fit quality in general the redox speciation of ce in soils was dominated by ce iii regardless of the soil type with ce iv fractions of up to 30 on average the topsoil samples contained 84 15 ce iii and 18 11 ce iv one standard deviation over all soil samples table s4 in good agreement with a xanes study returning 88 90 ce iii in the top 50 cm of a paddy soil takahashi et al 2005 3 2 ce oxidation state in sewage sludge the xanes spectra of the sludges slg1 to slg3 were almost identical to the spectrum of the ce iv o2 reference indicated by the two characteristic oscillations at 5732 and 5739 ev ce iv dotted lines fig 1 a furthermore in the spectra of slg1 and slg3 the characteristic feature for ce iii oscillation at 5727 ev was lacking suggesting that within the uncertainty of the method ce in these sludges was exclusively ce iv sludge slg2 however showed a pronounced shoulder at 5727 ev indicating the presence of ce iii the sludges slg4 and slg5 also showed features characteristic of both ce iii and ce iv quantitative lcf results confirmed these qualitative interpretations fig 1 b and table s4 with the exception of slg6 lcf analysis of all sludge spectra returned higher ce iv fractions compared to the soil spectra based on the assumption that anthropogenic ce is dominated by ce iv its input into wastewater should be accompanied by an increase in ce iv in the sewage sludge however there was no apparent correlation between ce contents and the ce iv fractions fig 2 a indicating that ce oxidation state alone is not sufficient to assess anthropogenic ce inputs 3 3 ce la ratios and rare earth element patterns 3 3 1 ce la ratios the ce la ratios of soils and sludges were distinctly different fig 1 c whereas soils had an average ce la ratio of 2 1 0 3 the ce la ratios in the sludges were much higher 10 6 6 5 for slg1 to slg4 and sl6 except for slg5 ce la 1 1 pointing to anthropogenic ce inputs if anthropogenic ce inputs were dominated by ce iv and free of la a positive correlation between the ce iv fraction and the ce la ratio would be observable however the ce la ratio was not well correlated to the ce oxidation state fig 2 b this is most evident when comparing the ce oxidation state and the ce la ratio of slg1 and slg6 although the ce concentrations and ce la ratios of these two sludges were high the ce iv fractions were 100 and 18 respectively a possible explanation for these considerable variabilities are individual point sources discharging either particulate ce iv or ce iii into the wastewater possible anthropogenic sources of ce iii include for example the glass industry darab et al 1998 but also pharmaceutical research and industry martin et al 1988 the latter one is most likely responsible for the high ce iii fractions observed in slg6 furthermore possible anthropogenic emissions of la may additionally modify the ce la ratio this is supported by fig 2 c an increase in anthropogenic ce inputs should lead to a corresponding increase of the ce la ratio if anthropogenic ce is free of la however the ce la ratio of the sludges did not scale with the ce concentration for example slg3 showed a comparatively low ce la ratio but a rather high ce concentration 181 mg kg 1 pointing to anthropogenic la inputs as recently described by kulaksız and bau 2011 such anthropogenic la inputs affect the ce la ratio and thus hamper the quantification of anthropogenic ce fractions based on ce la ratios 3 3 2 rare earth element patterns rare earth elements other than la may be more suitable for the quantification of anthropogenic ce in sewage sludge as they are much less used than la haque et al 2014 we therefore investigated whether the contents of the ree eu dy and er representing medium and heavy ree allow for a more reliable identification and quantification of the anthropogenic ce in sewage sludge for that purpose the contents of the ree in the sludges and soils were normalized over their contents in post archean australian shale paas which represents the average upper continental crust pourmand et al 2012 the resulting ree patterns of soils were very similar to each other and closely resembled the ree pattern of paas fig 3 a with paas normalized values from 0 8 1 0 in the sewage sludge samples the ree contents showed a much higher variability and different degrees of enrichment or attenuation relative to paas fig 3 b and c the medium to heavy ree eu dy er showed consistently lower concentrations relative to the paas paas normalized values of 0 1 0 3 reflecting their dilution in organic matter and other sludge components and resulting in correspondingly flat paas normalized ree patterns for slg5 the ree pattern also including ce and la was very comparable to the ree pattern of paas although shifted to lower concentrations in general agreement with these observations kawasaki et al 1998 reported shale crust normalized values of 0 1 0 6 for 14 different sewage sludges with rather flat normalized ree patterns for most sludge samples one sludge however showed higher normalized values for la and ce 0 45 and 0 6 respectively which was attributed to elevated concentrations of these elements in the wastewater sludge investigated by suanon et al 2017 also revealed crust normalized ree ratios smaller than 0 6 in different digested sludges from the us verplanck et al 2010 and paas normalized ree patterns appeared flat without any pronounced ce enrichments therefore the consistently flat ree patterns especially reported for the medium to heavy ree indicated that the concentrations of these elements in sewage sludge were less likely to be influenced by anthropogenic contributions and thus reflect variable fractions of geogenic materials in the sewage sludge in contrast to the flat normalized ree patterns reported in the literature for other sludges including slg5 from this study the paas normalized ree patterns of all other sludges except slg5 revealed a pronounced enrichment of ce relative to eu dy and er fig 3 c as ce or other ree inputs from a geological source would have increased the normalized ree ratios of the other ree to a comparable extent resulting in a vertical shift of the ree pattern this clearly indicates anthropogenic ce inputs to these sludges in addition to the high normalized ce concentrations high normalized la concentrations were observed for the samples slg1 3 and 6 relative to eu dy and er this further suggests that the anthropogenic ce inputs were paralleled by anthropogenic la inputs fig 3 c in these sludges the sludge samples slg2 and slg4 showed ce concentrations comparable to paas but la and the heavier ree were strongly depleted compared to paas fig 3 c with the exception of ce the normalized ree patterns were rather flat with a shape comparable to the flat ree patterns observed for the normalized ree patterns from the soil samples this suggests that slg2 and slg4 received ce from anthropogenic applications with negligible contributions of other rees the similarity of the ree patterns observed for slg1 and 6 and their contrasting oxidation states further support the finding that anthropogenic ce can be present both in the iv and iii oxidation state the normalized ree pattern of sludge slg5 is very different compared to the normalized ree patterns of the other sludges showing a subtle increase from normalized ce to normalized la instead of a pronounced peak as observed for all other sludge samples fig 3 c as a variable contribution of geological material can only shift the normalized ree patterns vertically but cannot cause any intensity variations between the normalized rees the higher normalized la values compared to the normalized ce values may indicate a selective input of la to the wastewater the enrichments of ce relative to the medium to heavy ree c e sample c e paas re e sample re e paas c e n r e e n can best be observed based on fig 3 d soils red triangles in fig 3 d generally showed values close to one reflecting their similarity to the paas assuming that the ree patterns in the sewage sludge were determined by variable inputs of crustal materials and anthropogenic ce a selective contribution of anthropogenic ce will result in a vertical upward shift of the flat line defined by the crustal material and a kink or a change of the slope on this line indicates additional anthropogenic sources of the respective rees fig 3 d sludge samples slg1 slg4 and slg6 showed a considerable enrichment of normalized ce relative to the other normalized rees reflected by the vertical shift of the normalized ree patterns in fig 3 d only the normalized ree ratios of slg5 remain close to the line defined by the soil samples therefore suggesting that ce in this sludge is dominantly geogenic the clear kink in the cen lan for slg1 6 and to a lesser extent also for slg3 reflects an additional la source fig 3 d as already discussed for the paas normalized ree patterns fig 3 c for the other sludge samples slg2 slg4 and slg5 only a slight drop at the cen lan can be observed which therefore suggests only a very limited contribution of anthropogenic la nevertheless the cen lan of 0 55 for sludge slg5 is clearly smaller than the cen lan observed for both the other sludge samples ratios 1 and the soil samples ratios 1 fig 3 d which is worth noting as the normalized ratios of ce to the other ree eu dy er for this sample were very comparable to the average cen reen observed in the soil samples this may suggest a specific input of la as already discussed based on fig 3 c however considering the uncertainties and assumptions behind these data interpretations and most importantly the invariant ree patterns of the background such small differences have to be treated with great care 3 5 quantifying anthropogenic ce fractions associated with industrial applications in sewage sludge the ratio of ree to ce in the sludge samples r e e c e s l g can be calculated based on the sum of the ratios of ree to ce in the soils geogenic background index g r e e c e g and in anthropogenic sources index a r e e c e a weighted by the respective mass fractions f s l g g f s l g a eq 1 1 r e e c e s l g f s l g g r e e c e g f s l g a r e e c e a assuming a constant r e e c e g ratio in soils as suggested based on the ree patterns of several soils investigated and negligible contents of other ree in the anthropogenic ce particles r e e c e a 0 the geogenic component in the sludge samples f s l g g can be calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 f s l g g r e e c e s l g r e e c e g 3 f s l g a f s l g g 1 consistently high fractions of anthropogenic ce were obtained for sludges slg1 slg4 fig 4 the fractions derived from the eu dy and er ratios ranging from 80 to 100 were in excellent agreement with each other the fractions derived from the la ce ratio were always lower compared to the fractions derived from the other ree ratios as discussed based on the ree patterns this likely reflects an additional input of la not necessarily associated with ce resulting in an increased la ce ratio following our quantification scheme an increased la ce ratio in the sewage sludge is directly translating into an increasing fraction of geogenic ce and concomitantly into a decreasing fraction of anthropogenic ce the fractions of anthropogenic ce obtained for sludge slg5 were considerably lower as compared to the fraction obtained for the other sludge samples it has to be mentioned that the la ce and eu ce ratios were below the respective ratios determined for the background soil resulting in even negative fractions of anthropogenic ce and the respective fraction were thus set to 0 based on these findings we conclude that the most robust and reliable estimate of the fraction of anthropogenic ce in wastewater systems can be derived from ce ree ratios of rarely used ree excluding ce la ratios because la very likely has additional inputs from anthropogenic sources for the investigated sludge samples generally high anthropogenic fractions of close to 100 were obtained but also sewage sludge with dominantly geogenic contributions of ce was observed 3 6 morphological characteristics of ce containing particles in sewage sludge to evaluate the morphology and size range of ce bearing particles analytical electron microscopy analyses were conducted on sludge slg1 with an anthropogenic ce fraction of close to 100 ce containing particles observed in the sludge generally showed idiomorphically shaped crystals with sharp edges fig 5 some particles were free of ree other than ce and additional elements expected for ce bearing minerals such as p monazite or al and si ce allanite were only present in minor amounts fig 5 a these particles are therefore likely representing ceo2 nanoparticles of anthropogenic origin however also particles of supposedly geogenic origin were observed for example the particle in fig 5 b containing la and considerable amounts of f suggesting that the particle is a bastnaesite particle fig 5 b and fig s3 irrespective of their notional origin the majority of the ce bearing particles observed in the sludge would be classified as nanomaterials following the eu recommendation commission recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial 2011 4 conclusions our results show that the determination of multiple ree and ce ree ratios allows for a robust quantification of engineered ce fractions in sewage sludge in contrast estimates based on ce oxidation state are unreliable because the oxidation state of both anthropogenic and natural ce is variable and the use of ce la ratios is limited because of la accumulation in sewage sludge possibly from additional anthropogenic la inputs in fact based on the analysis of full ree patterns not only industrial ce fractions but also industrial fractions of other ree may be readily detectable although the results from the electron microscopy are only of qualitative nature and a particle size distribution cannot be extracted from the data our observations suggest that the majority of anthropogenic ce seems to fall into the nanosize range thus the anthropogenic fraction derived from ree patterns might serve as a first estimate for the input of engineered ceo2 np into wastewater systems and may thus be used to validate current mass flow models for ceo2 np giese et al 2018 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

samples were analyzed in triplicates all concentrations soils and sludges for ce and the other ree are tabulated table s3 2 3 2 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas samples were measured at the ce liii edge 5723 ev at the superxas x10da beamline at the swiss light source sls villigen switzerland the samples were prepared as pellets by mixing 90 mg of the dry and ball milled sample with 4 mg boron carbide and 4 mg quartz sand in an agate mortar and subsequent mixing with 10 mg cellulose from this mixture 80 mg were pressed into a 7 mm pellet using a handheld press during the measurements all samples and references were cooled with a n2 gas stream set to 100 k using a cryojet oxford instruments the energy of the x ray beam was calibrated by setting the first inflection point of the ce liii edge spectrum of ce iv o2 to 5723 ev all sample spectra and reference spectra of bulk ce iv o2 and ce iii allanite were measured in fluorescence mode using a 5 element silicon drift detector sgx sensortech buckinghamshire uk the structure of the reference materials has previously been confirmed by x ray diffraction gogos et al 2019 the software code sixpack webb 2005 was used to process the xas data following standard procedures to quantify the different ce species by linear combination fit lcf analysis for lcf analysis the xanes data between 5703 and 5843 ev were evaluated the fractions of individual ce species in the lcf analysis were constrained to values between 0 and 1 but the sum of the fractions was not constrained due to interferences at the la lii edge 5891 ev the exafs data were not evaluated 2 3 3 electron microscopy samples for electron microscopy em analyses were prepared by dispersing 15 mg of powdered sample in 1 5 ml 0 2 novachem postnova gmbh landsberg germany using ultrasonication for 5 min 10 s on and 20 s off 200 w amplitude of 100 vial tweeter hielscher ultrasonics gmbh germany the resulting dispersion was diluted 1 100 in 0 02 novachem and centrifuged onto a 0 1 poly l lysine functionalized carbon cu grid em resolutions ltd sheffield uk at 14 000 g for 1 h subsequently the grids were washed three times in a drop of nanopure water and air dried electron microscopy images were recorded on a scanning transmission electron microscope stem hd 2700 cs hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv using either a secondary electron se or a high angle annular dark field haadf detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 ce oxidation state in soils the ce liii edge xanes spectra of soil samples showed a clear ce iii signature at 5727 ev fig 1 a dashed line comparable to the ce allanite reference however except for soil so6 each spectrum also showed a slightly increased shoulder at 5739 ev fig 1 a right dotted line which is a characteristic feature for ce iv these observations were substantiated by lcf analyses fig 1 b and table s4 as the ce liii xanes is more sensitive to ce oxidation state than structural variations especially for ce iii species takahashi et al 2002 we only used ce allanite and ce iv o2 as references to quantify the fractions of ce iii and ce iv by lcf the inclusion of further reference spectra of ce iii parisite or ce iii po4 gogos et al 2019 did not improve fit quality in general the redox speciation of ce in soils was dominated by ce iii regardless of the soil type with ce iv fractions of up to 30 on average the topsoil samples contained 84 15 ce iii and 18 11 ce iv one standard deviation over all soil samples table s4 in good agreement with a xanes study returning 88 90 ce iii in the top 50 cm of a paddy soil takahashi et al 2005 3 2 ce oxidation state in sewage sludge the xanes spectra of the sludges slg1 to slg3 were almost identical to the spectrum of the ce iv o2 reference indicated by the two characteristic oscillations at 5732 and 5739 ev ce iv dotted lines fig 1 a furthermore in the spectra of slg1 and slg3 the characteristic feature for ce iii oscillation at 5727 ev was lacking suggesting that within the uncertainty of the method ce in these sludges was exclusively ce iv sludge slg2 however showed a pronounced shoulder at 5727 ev indicating the presence of ce iii the sludges slg4 and slg5 also showed features characteristic of both ce iii and ce iv quantitative lcf results confirmed these qualitative interpretations fig 1 b and table s4 with the exception of slg6 lcf analysis of all sludge spectra returned higher ce iv fractions compared to the soil spectra based on the assumption that anthropogenic ce is dominated by ce iv its input into wastewater should be accompanied by an increase in ce iv in the sewage sludge however there was no apparent correlation between ce contents and the ce iv fractions fig 2 a indicating that ce oxidation state alone is not sufficient to assess anthropogenic ce inputs 3 3 ce la ratios and rare earth element patterns 3 3 1 ce la ratios the ce la ratios of soils and sludges were distinctly different fig 1 c whereas soils had an average ce la ratio of 2 1 0 3 the ce la ratios in the sludges were much higher 10 6 6 5 for slg1 to slg4 and sl6 except for slg5 ce la 1 1 pointing to anthropogenic ce inputs if anthropogenic ce inputs were dominated by ce iv and free of la a positive correlation between the ce iv fraction and the ce la ratio would be observable however the ce la ratio was not well correlated to the ce oxidation state fig 2 b this is most evident when comparing the ce oxidation state and the ce la ratio of slg1 and slg6 although the ce concentrations and ce la ratios of these two sludges were high the ce iv fractions were 100 and 18 respectively a possible explanation for these considerable variabilities are individual point sources discharging either particulate ce iv or ce iii into the wastewater possible anthropogenic sources of ce iii include for example the glass industry darab et al 1998 but also pharmaceutical research and industry martin et al 1988 the latter one is most likely responsible for the high ce iii fractions observed in slg6 furthermore possible anthropogenic emissions of la may additionally modify the ce la ratio this is supported by fig 2 c an increase in anthropogenic ce inputs should lead to a corresponding increase of the ce la ratio if anthropogenic ce is free of la however the ce la ratio of the sludges did not scale with the ce concentration for example slg3 showed a comparatively low ce la ratio but a rather high ce concentration 181 mg kg 1 pointing to anthropogenic la inputs as recently described by kulaksız and bau 2011 such anthropogenic la inputs affect the ce la ratio and thus hamper the quantification of anthropogenic ce fractions based on ce la ratios 3 3 2 rare earth element patterns rare earth elements other than la may be more suitable for the quantification of anthropogenic ce in sewage sludge as they are much less used than la haque et al 2014 we therefore investigated whether the contents of the ree eu dy and er representing medium and heavy ree allow for a more reliable identification and quantification of the anthropogenic ce in sewage sludge for that purpose the contents of the ree in the sludges and soils were normalized over their contents in post archean australian shale paas which represents the average upper continental crust pourmand et al 2012 the resulting ree patterns of soils were very similar to each other and closely resembled the ree pattern of paas fig 3 a with paas normalized values from 0 8 1 0 in the sewage sludge samples the ree contents showed a much higher variability and different degrees of enrichment or attenuation relative to paas fig 3 b and c the medium to heavy ree eu dy er showed consistently lower concentrations relative to the paas paas normalized values of 0 1 0 3 reflecting their dilution in organic matter and other sludge components and resulting in correspondingly flat paas normalized ree patterns for slg5 the ree pattern also including ce and la was very comparable to the ree pattern of paas although shifted to lower concentrations in general agreement with these observations kawasaki et al 1998 reported shale crust normalized values of 0 1 0 6 for 14 different sewage sludges with rather flat normalized ree patterns for most sludge samples one sludge however showed higher normalized values for la and ce 0 45 and 0 6 respectively which was attributed to elevated concentrations of these elements in the wastewater sludge investigated by suanon et al 2017 also revealed crust normalized ree ratios smaller than 0 6 in different digested sludges from the us verplanck et al 2010 and paas normalized ree patterns appeared flat without any pronounced ce enrichments therefore the consistently flat ree patterns especially reported for the medium to heavy ree indicated that the concentrations of these elements in sewage sludge were less likely to be influenced by anthropogenic contributions and thus reflect variable fractions of geogenic materials in the sewage sludge in contrast to the flat normalized ree patterns reported in the literature for other sludges including slg5 from this study the paas normalized ree patterns of all other sludges except slg5 revealed a pronounced enrichment of ce relative to eu dy and er fig 3 c as ce or other ree inputs from a geological source would have increased the normalized ree ratios of the other ree to a comparable extent resulting in a vertical shift of the ree pattern this clearly indicates anthropogenic ce inputs to these sludges in addition to the high normalized ce concentrations high normalized la concentrations were observed for the samples slg1 3 and 6 relative to eu dy and er this further suggests that the anthropogenic ce inputs were paralleled by anthropogenic la inputs fig 3 c in these sludges the sludge samples slg2 and slg4 showed ce concentrations comparable to paas but la and the heavier ree were strongly depleted compared to paas fig 3 c with the exception of ce the normalized ree patterns were rather flat with a shape comparable to the flat ree patterns observed for the normalized ree patterns from the soil samples this suggests that slg2 and slg4 received ce from anthropogenic applications with negligible contributions of other rees the similarity of the ree patterns observed for slg1 and 6 and their contrasting oxidation states further support the finding that anthropogenic ce can be present both in the iv and iii oxidation state the normalized ree pattern of sludge slg5 is very different compared to the normalized ree patterns of the other sludges showing a subtle increase from normalized ce to normalized la instead of a pronounced peak as observed for all other sludge samples fig 3 c as a variable contribution of geological material can only shift the normalized ree patterns vertically but cannot cause any intensity variations between the normalized rees the higher normalized la values compared to the normalized ce values may indicate a selective input of la to the wastewater the enrichments of ce relative to the medium to heavy ree c e sample c e paas re e sample re e paas c e n r e e n can best be observed based on fig 3 d soils red triangles in fig 3 d generally showed values close to one reflecting their similarity to the paas assuming that the ree patterns in the sewage sludge were determined by variable inputs of crustal materials and anthropogenic ce a selective contribution of anthropogenic ce will result in a vertical upward shift of the flat line defined by the crustal material and a kink or a change of the slope on this line indicates additional anthropogenic sources of the respective rees fig 3 d sludge samples slg1 slg4 and slg6 showed a considerable enrichment of normalized ce relative to the other normalized rees reflected by the vertical shift of the normalized ree patterns in fig 3 d only the normalized ree ratios of slg5 remain close to the line defined by the soil samples therefore suggesting that ce in this sludge is dominantly geogenic the clear kink in the cen lan for slg1 6 and to a lesser extent also for slg3 reflects an additional la source fig 3 d as already discussed for the paas normalized ree patterns fig 3 c for the other sludge samples slg2 slg4 and slg5 only a slight drop at the cen lan can be observed which therefore suggests only a very limited contribution of anthropogenic la nevertheless the cen lan of 0 55 for sludge slg5 is clearly smaller than the cen lan observed for both the other sludge samples ratios 1 and the soil samples ratios 1 fig 3 d which is worth noting as the normalized ratios of ce to the other ree eu dy er for this sample were very comparable to the average cen reen observed in the soil samples this may suggest a specific input of la as already discussed based on fig 3 c however considering the uncertainties and assumptions behind these data interpretations and most importantly the invariant ree patterns of the background such small differences have to be treated with great care 3 5 quantifying anthropogenic ce fractions associated with industrial applications in sewage sludge the ratio of ree to ce in the sludge samples r e e c e s l g can be calculated based on the sum of the ratios of ree to ce in the soils geogenic background index g r e e c e g and in anthropogenic sources index a r e e c e a weighted by the respective mass fractions f s l g g f s l g a eq 1 1 r e e c e s l g f s l g g r e e c e g f s l g a r e e c e a assuming a constant r e e c e g ratio in soils as suggested based on the ree patterns of several soils investigated and negligible contents of other ree in the anthropogenic ce particles r e e c e a 0 the geogenic component in the sludge samples f s l g g can be calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 f s l g g r e e c e s l g r e e c e g 3 f s l g a f s l g g 1 consistently high fractions of anthropogenic ce were obtained for sludges slg1 slg4 fig 4 the fractions derived from the eu dy and er ratios ranging from 80 to 100 were in excellent agreement with each other the fractions derived from the la ce ratio were always lower compared to the fractions derived from the other ree ratios as discussed based on the ree patterns this likely reflects an additional input of la not necessarily associated with ce resulting in an increased la ce ratio following our quantification scheme an increased la ce ratio in the sewage sludge is directly translating into an increasing fraction of geogenic ce and concomitantly into a decreasing fraction of anthropogenic ce the fractions of anthropogenic ce obtained for sludge slg5 were considerably lower as compared to the fraction obtained for the other sludge samples it has to be mentioned that the la ce and eu ce ratios were below the respective ratios determined for the background soil resulting in even negative fractions of anthropogenic ce and the respective fraction were thus set to 0 based on these findings we conclude that the most robust and reliable estimate of the fraction of anthropogenic ce in wastewater systems can be derived from ce ree ratios of rarely used ree excluding ce la ratios because la very likely has additional inputs from anthropogenic sources for the investigated sludge samples generally high anthropogenic fractions of close to 100 were obtained but also sewage sludge with dominantly geogenic contributions of ce was observed 3 6 morphological characteristics of ce containing particles in sewage sludge to evaluate the morphology and size range of ce bearing particles analytical electron microscopy analyses were conducted on sludge slg1 with an anthropogenic ce fraction of close to 100 ce containing particles observed in the sludge generally showed idiomorphically shaped crystals with sharp edges fig 5 some particles were free of ree other than ce and additional elements expected for ce bearing minerals such as p monazite or al and si ce allanite were only present in minor amounts fig 5 a these particles are therefore likely representing ceo2 nanoparticles of anthropogenic origin however also particles of supposedly geogenic origin were observed for example the particle in fig 5 b containing la and considerable amounts of f suggesting that the particle is a bastnaesite particle fig 5 b and fig s3 irrespective of their notional origin the majority of the ce bearing particles observed in the sludge would be classified as nanomaterials following the eu recommendation commission recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial 2011 4 conclusions our results show that the determination of multiple ree and ce ree ratios allows for a robust quantification of engineered ce fractions in sewage sludge in contrast estimates based on ce oxidation state are unreliable because the oxidation state of both anthropogenic and natural ce is variable and the use of ce la ratios is limited because of la accumulation in sewage sludge possibly from additional anthropogenic la inputs in fact based on the analysis of full ree patterns not only industrial ce fractions but also industrial fractions of other ree may be readily detectable although the results from the electron microscopy are only of qualitative nature and a particle size distribution cannot be extracted from the data our observations suggest that the majority of anthropogenic ce seems to fall into the nanosize range thus the anthropogenic fraction derived from ree patterns might serve as a first estimate for the input of engineered ceo2 np into wastewater systems and may thus be used to validate current mass flow models for ceo2 np giese et al 2018 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

particles of 1 μm consisted of lower elemental concentrations and more water due to low evaporation deposition fraction in pulmonary region was 2 fold higher and deposited particulate mass was 3 5 fold higher for children than adults indicating greater inhalation exposure to children compared to adults modeled data of total particles mass per body weight bw that will deposit in adult and child

contaminants is a focus of traditional investigations and regulations an increasing concern area for researchers and human population is exposure to contaminants transporting from water to air which may pose adverse health effects to humans who breathe aerosolized and vaporized aqueous chemicals the exposure to volatile organic chemicals during showers is an acknowledged area for air water interface exposure vocs from industrial chemicals gallagher et al 2015 disinfection by products gordon et al 2006 and microbial metabolites ömür özbek et al 2010 are transported from water to air when showering and then inhaled by humans portable household ultrasonic humidifiers which aerosolize water to alleviate dryness are a less investigated inhalation exposure pathway to children and adults for chemicals in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2011 reported about 20 of portable humidifiers were ultrasonic devices and that at least 15 of american households use ultrasonic humidifiers ultrasonic humidifiers constituted 34 5 of the global humidifier market in 2016 technavio 2017 baby list 2019 a registry site for expecting parents lists humidifiers among the top items for a new baby three of four of its top recommendations are ultrasonic versions the site states ultrasonic humidifiers are recommended for use around small children and to only consider using the alternative warm mist humidifiers if you are able to find a safe spot to keep a warm mist humidifier far away from little hands prior research indicated that asbestos fibers present in naturally contaminated water were emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers and increased exposure time led to higher inhalation risk roccaro and vagliasindi 2018 additionally disinfectants marketed specifically for humidifier use have caused more than 100 deaths of pregnant women and children and illness in over 1000 people positive associations existed between lung injuries and humidifier disinfectant exposure kim et al 2014a ryu et al 2019 humidifier disinfectant usage was also associated with interstitial lung disease in children kim et al 2014b yang et al 2013 confirming that humidifier use can have adverse health effects ultrasonic humidifiers are designed to emit fine water droplets pm2 5 and pm10 particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2 5 μm and 10 μm respectively concentrations reached 6307 μg m3 and 7078 μg m3 when using 303 mg l total dissolved solids tds tap water to fill ultrasonic humidifier with a water consumption rate at 0 48 l h in a closed bedroom of 25 m3 and air exchange rate of 1 16 hr 1 highsmith et al 1988 pm10 of 118 and 966 μg m3 were emitted in a closed dormitory room of 33 5 m3 and air exchange rate of 0 87 hr 1when using 75 and 510 mg l tds tap water to fill the humidifiers of water consumption rate at 0 21 l h respectively sain and dietrich 2015 soluble minerals and insoluble metal oxide particles when present in fill water in the humidifiers are emitted as sub micron inhalable particulates sain et al 2018 yao et al 2019 particles 1 μm can penetrate deeper into the lower lung region and cause mild to severe inflammatory responses depending on the chemical composition particles in the alveolar region can transport across epithelia and enter blood and lymphatic circulations and thus distribute throughout the body oberdörster et al 2005 toxicology of particles is determined by various factors e g their shape size concentration and chemical composition risk assessments of emitted particles from ultrasonic humidifiers and other devices generating aerosols should consider these factors data are not available for the types of water that consumers actually use to fill their ultrasonic humidifiers as it requires approximately 2 5 l of water per 8 h cycle it is likely that consumers may use local tap water for convenience davis et al 2016 even though about three decades ago the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1991 recommended using distilled or low mineral water select ultrasonic humidifiers manufacturers make recommendations of water type to use in their products recommended water types for the 10 best humidifiers to buy in 2020 according to experts good housekeeping 2020 are presented in table s1 three manufacturers recommended cool or cold tap water and two of them suggested using a filter for hard water three manufacturers recommended water without further specifications and one manufacturer recommended only distilled water for three other models the user manuals were not readily available on line and the recommendation is not known in summary humidifier manufactures are directly recommending the use of tap water or simply recommending water and thus consumers are likely using tap water rather than distilled water globally tap water will have variable mineral water quality as total dissolved solids is typically in the range of 50 500 mg l tds dietrich and devesa 2019 calcium and magnesium hardness also vary ong et al 2009 interestingly global freshwaters and their corresponding tap waters that are not treated by membrane filtration are undergoing increased salinization leading to more minerals being present in tap water herbert et al 2015 kaushal 2016 kaushal et al 2019 since humidifiers are often used for children a concern is the particulate exposure these children may receive from ultrasonic humidifiers the following epidemiology studies indicate associations between adverse health outcomes and early life exposure to non humidifier particulate air pollution clark et al 2009 revealed association between childhood asthma and pm10 exposure in utero and during first year of life studies indicate adverse health effects for particulate exposure during fetal and early postnatal life stocks and sonnappa 2013 and exposure to particulates in ambient air caused increased morbidity and mortality rates in compromised people pope et al 2004 the international agency for research on cancer iarc 2015 classifies outdoor air pollution and particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans loomis et al 2013 pm2 5 pm10 in ambient air are regulated respectively at 35 and 150 μg m3 during 24 h period usepa 2010 previous studies show lung injuries in young children daftary and deterding 2011 and mice umezawa et al 2013 from exposure to ultrasonic humidifiers in the former case a 6 month child exposed to an ultrasonic humidifier in a closed room for 2 h started coughing after hospitalization he was diagnosed with peribronchial thickening with mild hyperinflation and symptoms of fast breathing and hypoxemia lasted for 2 weeks suspected white dust settling on room surfaces was sent for elemental analysis and large quantities of calcium magnesium sodium and chloride as well as small quantities of fluoride nitrate phosphate sulfate aluminum copper and iron were found these elements are commonly seen in tap water in the latter case high silica 104 mg l tds and tap water 73 mg l tds were used to fill the ultrasonic humidifier and mice were exposed for 7 day or 14 day periods particles generated with tap water and high silica water were composed of sodium magnesium silica sulfate and calcium from fill water in the humidifier which were typical elements in tap water as well particles in the experimental chamber of 0 765 m3 water consumption rate at 60 ml h and aer of 11 5 m3 h reached 580 and 460 μg m3 when using high silica water and tap water respectively the airborne particles induced cellular response in the alveolar macrophages but not inflammation or tissue injury in mouse lungs the two cases involved detection of high levels of calcium magnesium and sodium in emitted particles and corresponding anions illustrating potential risks to inhalation of white dust produced from ultrasonic humidifier filled with tap water longer term epidemiologic study or toxicity testing of particles emitted from humidifiers is lacking and should be addressed the exposure and risk assessment of inhaled particulate matter is facilitated by the multiple path particle dosimetry model referred to as mppd available from applied research associates inc ara 2020 the model became publicly deployed in 2002 and has many applications for calculating particle deposition within the human airway for 0 001 100 μm diameter particles the model can account for individual breathing parameters and patterns for children and adults lyu et al 2018 measured concentrations of quinones and metals bounded in ambient particulates utilized mppd model to predict their deposited mass in human respiratory tract and estimated the extent of oxidative stress based on the deposited mass sarigiannis et al 2015 estimated the inhalation risks from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed on ambient particulates for human child and adult and the mppd model showed higher normalized to bodyweight exposure dose to child than adult when applied to ultrasonic humidification of a conference room the mppd model demonstrated that inhaled and lung deposited mass was greater when the fill water tds was higher and that both hard and soft waters influence lung deposited mass for high tds waters yao et al 2020 mppd is widely employed to evaluate human exposure to particulate matter see table s2 in supporting information for summary of environmental applications involving the mppd model previous research sain and dietrich 2015 yao et al 2019 demonstrates that over time the metals and inorganic elements in the humidifier reservoir increase in concentration indicating that more pure water is emitted and the metals and elements concentrate within the reservoir this suggests that particles emitted from the humidifier do not have the same elemental concentrations as the initial fill water this article aims to evaluate inhalation exposure and risk for particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers filled with tap water the objectives of this study are 1 investigate the relationship between metal and elemental concentrations as a function of particle sizes emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers 2 use the mppd model to quantify metal and elemental deposition fraction in child and adult respiratory tracts from breathing aerosolized water from ultrasonic humidifiers 3 estimate calcium and mineral dosages for children and adults from inhaling aerosolized tap water from ultrasonic humidifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental design and calculations as shown in fig 1 this study collected airborne particles generated from aerosolized water and characterized their sizes and chemical composition from measured data particle properties were calculated

known volume of tap water or di water controls on ptfe filters evaporating the water in a desiccator then extracting and measuring with icp ms as previously described percent recovery calculations subtracted the metals for the di control filters from the tap water filters 2 3 calculating particle size density concentration and elemental composition the mppd inhalation exposure assessment requires properties of aerosol count median diameter cmd and geometric standard deviation gsd for the various sizes of inhaled particles particle density is another important determinant of particle deposition fraction these properties were calculated with equations presented in supporting information text s1 tsi inc 2012 metal and elemental concentrations in fill water and in airborne particles collected by bin size on filters in the cascade impactor were measured by icp ms in this study which focused on metal exposure metal ratio is defined as the ratio of mass of an individual metal to mass of total metals in either fill water or in airborne particles the metal ratio in fill water was calculated by the concentration of an individual metal ion in fill water divided by the sum of concentrations of all metal ions measured in fill water metal ratio in air was calculated by dividing the mass of an individual metal ion collected on each impactor bin for specific particle sizes by the sum of mass of all metals in that size bin if the metal ratio in fill water is the same as airborne particles in a certain bin size relative metal composition can be considered identical for that defined size of particles if the metal ratio in fill water is higher than that in a defined size airborne particle bin the particles consist of more water than metals this analysis is necessary to determine if the ratio and mass of metals in each particle size bins is the same or different the results are critical to calculate the amount of metal inhaled 2 4 inhalation exposure assessment multiple path particle dosimetry model mppd v3 04 ara is software applicable for calculating deposition of inhaled particles in respiratory tracts of human children and adults human airway morphometry

inhalation and exhalation are provided in default settings or can be manually entered as modeling parameters refer to table s5 there are eight human exposure models in the mppd software for this study the age specific 5 lobe model was used to estimate child exposure based on previous studies mortensen 1988 phalen et al 1985 the yeh schum 5 lobe airway model yeh and schum 1980 was chosen to estimate adult exposure in this study ages of 3 21 months and 3 8 14 18 and 21 years were selected in addition appropriate frc altman and dittmer 1971 dunhill 1962 overton and graham 1989 phalen et al 1985

of laying on the back was chosen to represent sleeping conditions the mppd software generated results for deposition fractions in head oral and nasal tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions deposition fraction is the ratio of deposited mass in each region to the total mass inhaled anjilvel and asgharian 1995 thus the denominator e g total mass inhaled accounts for losses of exhaled mass humans had airway morphometry data as shown in table s5 experimentally determined aerosol properties concentration diameter density and aspect ratio were entered manually to predict particle deposition fraction in the respiratory tract aerosol properties i e cmd gsd and density were essential inputs to determine the deposition fractions in human respiratory tracts the cmd and gsd of inhaled particles were calculated using steady state size distribution curves from smps 2 5 statistical analysis the calculations of airborne particles properties and graphs were performed in r core team 2019 a kolmogorov smirnov k s test on the size distribution from the beginning of humidifier operation to the end of 8 h was done to determine steady state size distribution a non parametric spearman correlation test on total particle number and mass concentrations over time was conducted to determine the association between the two parameters linear regression of metal ratio in airborne particles and metal ratio in fill water in ultrasonic humidifier reservoir was performed in addition linear regression with indicator variable analysis was used to determine significant differences between the slopes and intercepts of two linear models reported metal ratio and particle mass fraction were mean values from 5 replicates an alpha value of 0 05 was used for all statistical tests 3 results 3 1 particle concentrations and size distribution at steady state before turning on the ultrasonic humidifier conditions in the experimental room were 24 c 28 relative humidity a cmd at 38 nm and very low particle concentrations of 4366 particles cm3 and 2 μg m3 when the humidifier was filled with distilled water the particle concentration was 12 100 particles cm3 the mass concentration was 25 μg m3 with a cmd at 89 nm the background indoor air and distilled water produced particles contained few metals sodium magnesium potassium and calcium as representative tap water metals were 2 μg m3 in the room see fig s3 in si therefore the metals in background air were very low after operating the humidifier with tap water for 2 h the room air temperature remained at approximately 24 c during the 8 h operation period while relative humidity increased from 28 to 45 see fig s2 the relative humidity suggested rapid evaporation of emitted water droplets as the lifetime of a 10 μm water droplet particle in air is 0 27 s under condition of 60 rh and 5 c temperature difference between ambient air and pure water droplet particle holterman 2003 the particles reached steady state in the room after 2 h operation as the size distribution of emitted particles did not change significantly after 2 h and at 8 h fig 2 particle number concentration and mass concentration were constant approximately at 56 500 particles cm3 and 320 μg m3 reported by smps mathematical models as indicated in fig 2a and b describe the changes of particle number and mass concentrations over humidifier operation time the spearman s rank correlation test showed 0 899 and 0 919 between time intervals versus particle number and mass concentrations respectively which suggested strong association between humidifier operation time and concentrations of emitted particles 3 2 size distribution of emitted particles over 8 h operation the size distributions of emitted particles after operating the humidifier for 0 1 h 1 h 2 h and at the end of 8 h operation were shown in fig 2c cmd is identical to geometric mean diameter in lognormal distributions and gsd describes the spread of a distribution 95 of the particles will fall into the range of cmd gsd2 to cmd gsd2 during the first 6 min after turning on the humidifier 95 of emitted particles were between 32 and 265 nm and particles grew larger to 46 388 nm after 1 h k s tests indicated that the particle size distribution changed between the background to the first 6 min distribution and that particle size distributions at the end of 1 2 h were statistically identical as that of the end of 8 h at steady state indicated by the 8th hour data 95 of particles fell into the size range of 51 424 nm large particles of size 1 μm 2 5 μm 5 μm and 10 μm were measured by the aerotrak and had significantly lower concentrations than the 0 014 0 750 μm particles measured by smps the concentrations of larger particles did not affect the cmd and gsd as the cmd using only smps is 146 36 nm gsd 1 74 and with aerotrak the cmd is 146 49 nm gsd 1 74 3 3 elemental metal composition of emitted particles the approach of measuring humidifier particle constituents and masses using icp ms data allowed for a direct measure of the μg amounts of elements and metals from particles collected on the five cascade impactor filters thus total icp ms elements are representative of but not the same as tds since icp ms measures major anions including chloride and sulfate but cannot measure bicarbonate which is another major anion in blacksburg tap water fig 3 a shows the fraction of particle mass in each of the five size bins for small diameter particles 0 25 μm 0 25 0 50 μm 0 50 1 μm 1 2 5 μm and 2 5 μm the result indicates that 50 of airborne particles were smaller than 0 25 μm 35 were 0 25 0 50 μm and 10 were 0 5 1 0 μm regardless of initial concentrations of metal concentrations in fill water in other words 95 of emitted airborne particles were smaller than 1 μm on mass basis fig 3b demonstrates that the mass fraction distribution was comparable across the 5 particle size bins for both metals and metalloids in the fill water sodium magnesium potassium and calcium are important metals and si an important metalloid with concentrations typically in the range of 1000 10 000 ppb in fill water as indicated by fig 3a and b approximately 50 of the metal mass occurred in 0 25 μm emitted airborne particles and 35 occurred in 0 25 0 5 μm particles fig 3c is a heatmap representative of relative air concentrations of the metals and si as a function of particle size fig 3c shows relative concentration as standard deviation from the mean with red indicating higher than mean concentration and blue lower than mean concentration the two smallest particle sizes 0 25 and 0 25 0 50 μm were highest in mass concentrations of all metals and the metalloid and the mass concentrations of particles 1 μm were consistently low for these elements due to the presence of water in the larger particles the airborne particle concentration after 8 h at steady state was 211 μg m3 based on total icp ms elements collected on impactor while the total calculated mass concentration from smps was 320 μg m3 this difference may be explained through bicarbonate which cannot be measured by icp ms and constitutes about 35 of the total dissolved solids in blackburg tap water sain and dietrich 2015 yao et al 2019 if bicarbonate is assumed to be 35 of tds and total icp ms elements measures all anions cations except bicarbonate then total icp ms elements plus bicarbonate would be 324 μg m3 a value very similar to that measured by smps this difference may also be explained by the increased humidity in the room during the experiment absolute humidity was 0 006 kg m3 when rh was 28 and 0 010 kg m3 when 45 emitted particles can be considered as wet particles in air containing water and metals elements wet airborne particles were collected by the cascade impactor and only metals elements in the particles were measured by icp ms smps collected wet airborne particles the instrument calculated mass concentration based on assuming a density of 1 g cm3 and spherical shape for the particles therefore smps may report higher mass concentration because it included both aerosolized water and all aerosolized metal elements fig 4 corroborated fig 3 to demonstrate that small particles contain more metals and the interference of background metals is negligible this is essential information for modeling human inhalation exposure as particle size determines deposition location and therefore metal dose additionally fig 4 shows that the smallest particles are essentially dried tap water the 1 1 dash line is representative of dried tap water particles in air the corresponding metal fractions of different particle sizes in air over metal fraction in water indicated that larger airborne particles contained more water than small airborne particles evidenced by less sloped lines lower concentration of metals are in air compared to water the metal compositions of particles of 0 25 μm and of 0 25 0 50 μm were very similar to that of the tap water that filled the reservoir linear regression model parameters and the statistical model comparisons are as shown in fig 4 the model comparisons indicated the metal composition slopes for emitted particles of 0 25 μm and particles of 0 25 0 5 μm were statistically identical when using metal ratio in tap water as independent variable but significantly different for larger size bins rodes et al 1990 predicted the count median diameter of initially formed water droplet particles by 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifiers was approximately 3 μm when assuming pure water surface tension and density this suggested that large wet particles were emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers first and then water evaporated forming small particles in air the evaporation process happened rapidly when the rh in the room was below 50 as mentioned in the steady state room conditions section above the chemical analysis of metals on impactor filters indicated that airborne particles 1 μm had more of the total mass compared to larger particles and their metal composition was equivalent to fill water the particle density in this study was 1 74 g cm3 the value was close to densities of aerosolized inorganic salts i e ammonia sulfate of 1 76 g cm3 ammonia nitrate of 1 69 g cm3 and sodium chloride of 2 08 g cm3 calculated from a similar method sarangi et al 2016 3 4 inhalation exposure to the emitted particles the critical aerosol properties described in previous sections are used to determine inhalation exposure by mppd different age exposure models were used to calculate regional deposition fractions of inhaled particles within human child and adult respiratory tracts aerosol cmd was 146 nm gsd was 1 7 density was 1 74 g cm3 and particles were assumed spherical table 1 indicates the regional deposition in human respiratory tract using mppd for younger humans more particles inhaled would deposit in the respiratory tract especially in the pulmonary region where the inhaled particles would clear more slowly than the trachea region stuart 1984 for resting adults breathing 12 breaths per minute and 625 ml per breath predicted total deposition fraction of 0 22 was similar to other findings when a non resting adult has 1000 ml tidal volume and breathing frequency of 15 per minute total deposition fraction was reported to be 0 25 for sodium chloride particles blanchard and willeke 1984 heyder et al 1986 found the total deposition fraction of 0 1 and 0 2 μm particles were 0 26 and 0 15 respectively under the same exposure scenario particle deposition fraction is 2 fold higher in pulmonary region and the sum of three regions for 3 month infants compared to 21 year adults mature adults experience low particle deposition in the head region nose and mouth tracheobronchial deposition fraction does not change significantly over age particles mass deposited in the pulmonary region increase with age for humans under 21 years old while particle deposition fraction in the pulmonary region has a descending trend when age increases when adjusted for body weight the deposited mass μg kg body weight has a decreasing trend when age increases the results indicate that exposure to particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifier poses greater inhalation risk to infants and young children than adults pulmonary deposition may impair lung development in early exposure new alveoli develops in the first 3 years and after first 3 years the lung grows by expansion grigg 2009 stocks and sonnappa 2013 3 5 prediction of inhaled metal mass for children and adults this study provides an approach to predict inhalation exposure from fill water quality and size distribution of emitted particles since calcium exposure as white dust is a concern the predicted calcium ratios in air in different particle size bins were calculated by linear regression equations shown in fig 4 assuming calcium being 0 2 fraction of total elements in fill water based on icp ms measurements the total elemental mass concentration in particle was measured by icp ms and calcium mass concentration was predicted by multiplying measured total elements and predicted calcium ratio in air in respective size bins total accumulated deposited mass was generated from the mppd model by assuming 8 h humidifier operation time when the fill water contains detectable metal ions using the calculated cmd and gsd the deposited mass in adult and 3 month old child are predicted and presented in table 2 the deposited mass indicated that both adult and child exposure doses increased with increased airborne particle mass concentrations and children are exposed to 3 5 fold more total elements than adults when inhaled particles were normalized over body weight 4 discussion this study characterized detailed size and elemental composition of airborne particles emitted to a room from an ultrasonic humidifier the particle data were input to an established mppd model to predict human inhalation exposure to calcium and total icp ms elements for children and adults the fractional deposition of calcium and elements was calculated for the head tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions the results show that for an adult 199 6 μg and for a 3 month old child 58 8 μg of metals and elements deposited in the lungs after 8 h exposure to particles emitted from an ultrasonic humidifier filled with tap water ultrasonic cavitation creates air bubbles containing water vapor and impurities such as vocs and minerals the mechanism may contribute to the observation that proportionally more water is emitted from the humidifier than metals or elements as previously demonstrated by sain and dietrich 2015 and yao et al 2019 the humidifier emits aerosols with slightly lower concentrations of minerals e g 85 90 than present in the fill water thus more water is emitted and the mineral concentrations increase in the humidifier reservoir over time for smaller emitted aerosols the water evaporates quickly forming essentially dried tap water particles while the larger particles contain more water rodes et al 1990 our measurements indicated emitted particles reached 211 μg m3 air averaged over 8 h operation which was 6 times higher than regulated pm2 5 and 1 4 times higher than regulated pm10 usepa 2010 studies show association between pm2 5 and lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cardiopulmonary diseases e g ischemic heart disease and even lung cancer burnett et al 2014 thurston et al 2016 both short term a few hours to weeks and long term years exposures to pms are linked with increased mortality the longer the exposure period lasts the higher mortality rate due to increased pm2 5 brook et al 2010 in addition residential and commercial pm2 5 contributed to mortality of 675 thousand deaths out of 2 23 million total deaths related to anthropogenic pm2 5 globally silva et al 2016 in the present study the measured concentrations and the modeled deposited particle mass of total elements or calcium exposure doses generated from mppd model can be informative for future toxicity testing when evaluating adverse health effects of white dust emitted from ultrasonic humidifier in addition since humans with asthma and young children are more vulnerable to exposure of air pollution the use of distilled water to fill ultrasonic humidifier is important especially for them usepa 1991 when looking into the metal composition in airborne particles a few studies showed the association between inhaled metal ions bound in pms from various sources and human diseases meng et al 2013 found significant association between 17 metal ions including calcium bound in pms and human cardiovascular diseases and ion properties e g ion size solubility oxidation potential and ability to form covalent and ionic bonds were identified as critical factors affecting the association thurston et al 2016 analyzed the relation of specific metals in pm2 5 and ischemic heart disease calcium as representative of soil particles had an estimated hazard ratio for ischemic disease of 1 01 95 confidence interval 0 98 1 03 per interquartile range of 43 8 ng m3 while pm2 5 was 1 03 95 confidence interval 1 00 1 06 per interquartile range of 3134 6 ng m3 the lower hazard ratio of calcium versus pm2 5 suggests potential lower risks to inhalation exposure to calcium however the concentration of calcium tested was extremely low 10th 90th percentile of 29 6 100 4 ng m3 compared to our study 35 μg m3 the much higher dose could lead to a greater hazard ratio for inhaling calcium containing particles lyu et al 2018 estimated the deposition fraction of aspirated particles within human respiratory tract by mppd model and investigated their oxidative potential results showed that inhaled water soluble metals bound in airborne pms contributed 1 2 fold greater capacity to generate oxidative stress than inhaled quinones epidemiological evidence suggests that children exposed to metals in dust from a mining region have a higher relative risk of respiratory disease in an associated study mice were exposed to pm10 collected from this mining region this exposure resulted in some degree of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury in the mice due to inhaling metals in airborne particles zychowski et al 2019 collectively metal ions bound in airborne particles pose adverse health effects to mice and humans and the oftentimes overlooked residential scenario could lead to unexpected risks this study provides potential for future biological study of inhalation risk from inorganic metal containing airborne particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers limitations of this novel study are the lack of inclusion of other fill water qualities for example high hardness water and high tds water and exposure to anions in water such as carbonate chloride or sulfate even though the concentrations of backgrounds metals elements were low in the experimental room they were combined with water from the ultrasonic humidifier and included in the modeled exposures from filling the humidifier with tap water this is realistic as a room will have background levels of particles metals elements that will be combined with the humidifier emitted particles this study focused on the investigation of a typical tap water that is low hardness and low tds therefore the linear regression and statistical analysis may not apply to other water types that may lead to extrapolation retained mass within human respiratory tract is also affected by dissolution alveolar clearance and translocation thus the determination of deposited mass is complicated and may not be fully explained by deposition mechanism only 5 conclusions this study presents detailed particle size concentration composition and exposure data when a typical tap water of 75 mg l tds is used to charge an ultrasonic humidifier in order to change air quality through humidification in a 33 5 m3 room with air exchange rate of 0 8 0 86 hr 1 emitted 1 0 μm particles account for 90 of total emitted particles and 85 were essentially dried tap water and 0 5 μm while 1 μm particles comprised 10 and contained less metals and more water the concentrations of metals elements varies based on particle size and particle water content nonetheless the same relative amounts of metals elements are present in each particle thus inhalation of small particles increased mass exposure to common tap water metals e g calcium sodium magnesium and also associated anions average indoor air particle concentrations were 211 μg m3 air based on icp ms metals and elements without bicarbonate which exceed usepa pm2 5 and pm10 values for ambient air the size and chemical composition characterization of airborne particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifier can be combined with an inhalation model to predict deposited particle mass in the human respiratory tract relatively higher deposition fractions of emitted particles in adult and child pulmonary region than head and tracheobronchial regions indicated increased risks to lower region respiratory injury greater inhalation risk is confirmed for child compared to adult a precautionary measure is to use distilled water to fill the ultrasonic humidifier author contributions the

19981,fine particulates and aerosols emitted by commonly used room sized ultrasonic humidifiers may pose adverse health effects to children and adults the literature documents adverse effects for children exposed to minerals emitted from humidifiers this study performs novel and comprehensive characterization of bivariate particle size and element concentrations of emitted airborne aerosols and particles from ultrasonic humidifiers filled with tap water including size distribution from 0 014 to 10 μm by scanning mobility particle sizer and aerotrak corresponding metal and elemental concentrations as a function of particle size by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and calculations of deposition fraction in human lungs for age specific groups using the multi path particle dosimetry model mppd deposition fraction is the ratio of mass deposited to total mass inhaled when filled with tap water water evaporated from emitted aerosols to form submicron particles that became essentially dried tap water with median size 146 nm and mean concentration of 211 μg total elements m3 air including 35 μg calcium m3 air in a room of 33 5 m3 and air exchange rate at 0 8 hr 1 approximately 90 of emitted particles deposited in human lungs were 1 μm as shown by mppd model the smaller particles contained little water and higher concentration of minerals while larger particles of 1 μm consisted of lower elemental concentrations and more water due to low evaporation deposition fraction in pulmonary region was 2 fold higher and deposited particulate mass was 3 5 fold higher for children than adults indicating greater inhalation exposure to children compared to adults modeled data of total particles mass per body weight bw that will deposit in adult and child lungs after 8 h humidifier exposure were respectively 2 8 μg kg bw and 9 8 μg kg bw where calcium contributes 0 4 μg kg bw and 1 6 μg kg bw this comprehensive study of bivariate inorganic chemical

contaminants is a focus of traditional investigations and regulations an increasing concern area for researchers and human population is exposure to contaminants transporting from water to air which may pose adverse health effects to humans who breathe aerosolized and vaporized aqueous chemicals the exposure to volatile organic chemicals during showers is an acknowledged area for air water interface exposure vocs from industrial chemicals gallagher et al 2015 disinfection by products gordon et al 2006 and microbial metabolites ömür özbek et al 2010 are transported from water to air when showering and then inhaled by humans portable household ultrasonic humidifiers which aerosolize water to alleviate dryness are a less investigated inhalation exposure pathway to children and adults for chemicals in drinking water the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2011 reported about 20 of portable humidifiers were ultrasonic devices and that at least 15 of american households use ultrasonic humidifiers ultrasonic humidifiers constituted 34 5 of the global humidifier market in 2016 technavio 2017 baby list 2019 a registry site for expecting parents lists humidifiers among the top items for a new baby three of four of its top recommendations are ultrasonic versions the site states ultrasonic humidifiers are recommended for use around small children and to only consider using the alternative warm mist humidifiers if you are able to find a safe spot to keep a warm mist humidifier far away from little hands prior research indicated that asbestos fibers present in naturally contaminated water were emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers and increased exposure time led to higher inhalation risk roccaro and vagliasindi 2018 additionally disinfectants marketed specifically for humidifier use have caused more than 100 deaths of pregnant women and children and illness in over 1000 people positive associations existed between lung injuries and humidifier disinfectant exposure kim et al 2014a ryu et al 2019 humidifier disinfectant usage was also associated with interstitial lung disease in children kim et al 2014b yang et al 2013 confirming that humidifier use can have adverse health effects ultrasonic humidifiers are designed to emit fine water droplets pm2 5 and pm10 particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2 5 μm and 10 μm respectively concentrations reached 6307 μg m3 and 7078 μg m3 when using 303 mg l total dissolved solids tds tap water to fill ultrasonic humidifier with a water consumption rate at 0 48 l h in a closed bedroom of 25 m3 and air exchange rate of 1 16 hr 1 highsmith et al 1988 pm10 of 118 and 966 μg m3 were emitted in a closed dormitory room of 33 5 m3 and air exchange rate of 0 87 hr 1when using 75 and 510 mg l tds tap water to fill the humidifiers of water consumption rate at 0 21 l h respectively sain and dietrich 2015 soluble minerals and insoluble metal oxide particles when present in fill water in the humidifiers are emitted as sub micron inhalable particulates sain et al 2018 yao et al 2019 particles 1 μm can penetrate deeper into the lower lung region and cause mild to severe inflammatory responses depending on the chemical composition particles in the alveolar region can transport across epithelia and enter blood and lymphatic circulations and thus distribute throughout the body oberdörster et al 2005 toxicology of particles is determined by various factors e g their shape size concentration and chemical composition risk assessments of emitted particles from ultrasonic humidifiers and other devices generating aerosols should consider these factors data are not available for the types of water that consumers actually use to fill their ultrasonic humidifiers as it requires approximately 2 5 l of water per 8 h cycle it is likely that consumers may use local tap water for convenience davis et al 2016 even though about three decades ago the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1991 recommended using distilled or low mineral water select ultrasonic humidifiers manufacturers make recommendations of water type to use in their products recommended water types for the 10 best humidifiers to buy in 2020 according to experts good housekeeping 2020 are presented in table s1 three manufacturers recommended cool or cold tap water and two of them suggested using a filter for hard water three manufacturers recommended water without further specifications and one manufacturer recommended only distilled water for three other models the user manuals were not readily available on line and the recommendation is not known in summary humidifier manufactures are directly recommending the use of tap water or simply recommending water and thus consumers are likely using tap water rather than distilled water globally tap water will have variable mineral water quality as total dissolved solids is typically in the range of 50 500 mg l tds dietrich and devesa 2019 calcium and magnesium hardness also vary ong et al 2009 interestingly global freshwaters and their corresponding tap waters that are not treated by membrane filtration are undergoing increased salinization leading to more minerals being present in tap water herbert et al 2015 kaushal 2016 kaushal et al 2019 since humidifiers are often used for children a concern is the particulate exposure these children may receive from ultrasonic humidifiers the following epidemiology studies indicate associations between adverse health outcomes and early life exposure to non humidifier particulate air pollution clark et al 2009 revealed association between childhood asthma and pm10 exposure in utero and during first year of life studies indicate adverse health effects for particulate exposure during fetal and early postnatal life stocks and sonnappa 2013 and exposure to particulates in ambient air caused increased morbidity and mortality rates in compromised people pope et al 2004 the international agency for research on cancer iarc 2015 classifies outdoor air pollution and particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans loomis et al 2013 pm2 5 pm10 in ambient air are regulated respectively at 35 and 150 μg m3 during 24 h period usepa 2010 previous studies show lung injuries in young children daftary and deterding 2011 and mice umezawa et al 2013 from exposure to ultrasonic humidifiers in the former case a 6 month child exposed to an ultrasonic humidifier in a closed room for 2 h started coughing after hospitalization he was diagnosed with peribronchial thickening with mild hyperinflation and symptoms of fast breathing and hypoxemia lasted for 2 weeks suspected white dust settling on room surfaces was sent for elemental analysis and large quantities of calcium magnesium sodium and chloride as well as small quantities of fluoride nitrate phosphate sulfate aluminum copper and iron were found these elements are commonly seen in tap water in the latter case high silica 104 mg l tds and tap water 73 mg l tds were used to fill the ultrasonic humidifier and mice were exposed for 7 day or 14 day periods particles generated with tap water and high silica water were composed of sodium magnesium silica sulfate and calcium from fill water in the humidifier which were typical elements in tap water as well particles in the experimental chamber of 0 765 m3 water consumption rate at 60 ml h and aer of 11 5 m3 h reached 580 and 460 μg m3 when using high silica water and tap water respectively the airborne particles induced cellular response in the alveolar macrophages but not inflammation or tissue injury in mouse lungs the two cases involved detection of high levels of calcium magnesium and sodium in emitted particles and corresponding anions illustrating potential risks to inhalation of white dust produced from ultrasonic humidifier filled with tap water longer term epidemiologic study or toxicity testing of particles emitted from humidifiers is lacking and should be addressed the exposure and risk assessment of inhaled particulate matter is facilitated by the multiple path particle dosimetry model referred to as mppd available from applied research associates inc ara 2020 the model became publicly deployed in 2002 and has many applications for calculating particle deposition within the human airway for 0 001 100 μm diameter particles the model can account for individual breathing parameters and patterns for children and adults lyu et al 2018 measured concentrations of quinones and metals bounded in ambient particulates utilized mppd model to predict their deposited mass in human respiratory tract and estimated the extent of oxidative stress based on the deposited mass sarigiannis et al 2015 estimated the inhalation risks from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons absorbed on ambient particulates for human child and adult and the mppd model showed higher normalized to bodyweight exposure dose to child than adult when applied to ultrasonic humidification of a conference room the mppd model demonstrated that inhaled and lung deposited mass was greater when the fill water tds was higher and that both hard and soft waters influence lung deposited mass for high tds waters yao et al 2020 mppd is widely employed to evaluate human exposure to particulate matter see table s2 in supporting information for summary of environmental applications involving the mppd model previous research sain and dietrich 2015 yao et al 2019 demonstrates that over time the metals and inorganic elements in the humidifier reservoir increase in concentration indicating that more pure water is emitted and the metals and elements concentrate within the reservoir this suggests that particles emitted from the humidifier do not have the same elemental concentrations as the initial fill water this article aims to evaluate inhalation exposure and risk for particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers filled with tap water the objectives of this study are 1 investigate the relationship between metal and elemental concentrations as a function of particle sizes emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers 2 use the mppd model to quantify metal and elemental deposition fraction in child and adult respiratory tracts from breathing aerosolized water from ultrasonic humidifiers 3 estimate calcium and mineral dosages for children and adults from inhaling aerosolized tap water from ultrasonic humidifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental design and calculations as shown in fig 1 this study collected airborne particles generated from aerosolized water and characterized their sizes and chemical composition from measured data particle properties were calculated and served as inputs in the inhalation exposure model detailed information on the instrumentation and the model is discussed in following sections 2 2 aerosol sample collection experiments were conducted in an unoccupied dorm room during winter season when relative humidity is low and humidifiers are used in households to alleviate dryness a commercially available portable ultrasonic humidifier with water consumption rate at 0 21 l h and run time of about 14 h was placed at the corner of an unoccupied dorm room on a stand of 0 9 m height and maximum output setting was chosen to represent high humidity scenario the dorm room is 3 m 4 3 m x 2 6 m l x w x h 33 5 m3 volume and is not mechanically ventilated the door and window were closed during the experiment and the air exchange rate aer ranged from 0 8 0 86 per hour for measurements on three different days the humidifier was filled with 3 l of blacksburg va tap water and operated for 8 h blacksburg tap water had a

collected aerosols during the 8 h humidifier operation period for control samples background air of experimental room was measured using smps and aerotrak for 30 min before turning on the humidifier metals in distilled water produced aerosols in the experimental room were also sampled using the cascade impactor 2 3 measuring metals and elements by icp ms cascade impactor filters were acid

125 us epa 1996 us epa 2014 specifically the recovery for ca was 120 na was 114 k was 96 mg was 104 mn was 114 and pb was 80 overall the metal recovery was 104 recoveries were determined by placing a known volume of tap water or di water controls on ptfe filters evaporating the water in a desiccator then extracting and measuring with icp ms as previously described percent recovery calculations subtracted the metals for the di control filters from the tap water filters 2 3 calculating particle size density concentration and elemental composition the mppd inhalation exposure assessment requires properties of aerosol count median diameter cmd and geometric standard deviation gsd for the various sizes of inhaled particles particle density is another important determinant of particle deposition fraction these properties were calculated with equations presented in supporting information text s1 tsi inc 2012 metal and elemental concentrations in fill water and in airborne particles collected by bin size on filters in the cascade impactor were measured by icp ms in this study which focused on metal exposure metal ratio is defined as the ratio of mass of an individual metal to mass of total metals in either fill water or in airborne particles the metal ratio in fill water was calculated by the concentration of an individual metal ion in fill water divided by the sum of concentrations of all metal ions measured in fill water metal ratio in air was calculated by dividing the mass of an individual metal ion collected on each impactor bin for specific particle sizes by the sum of mass of all metals in that size bin if the metal ratio in fill water is the same as airborne particles in a certain bin size relative metal composition can be considered identical for that defined size of particles if the metal ratio in fill water is higher than that in a defined size airborne particle bin the particles consist of more water than metals this analysis is necessary to determine if the ratio and mass of metals in each particle size bins is the same or different the results are critical to calculate the amount of metal inhaled 2 4 inhalation exposure assessment

the age specific 5 lobe model was used to estimate child exposure based on previous studies mortensen 1988 phalen et al 1985 the yeh schum 5 lobe airway model yeh and schum 1980 was chosen to estimate adult exposure in this study ages of 3 21 months and 3 8 14 18 and 21 years were selected in addition appropriate frc altman and dittmer 1971 dunhill 1962 overton and graham 1989 phalen et al 1985

of laying on the back was chosen to represent sleeping conditions the mppd software generated results for deposition fractions in head oral and nasal tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions deposition fraction is the ratio of deposited mass in each region to the total mass inhaled anjilvel and asgharian 1995 thus the denominator e g total mass inhaled accounts for losses of exhaled mass humans had airway morphometry data as shown in table s5 experimentally determined aerosol properties concentration diameter density and aspect ratio were entered manually to predict particle deposition fraction in the respiratory tract aerosol properties i e cmd gsd and density were essential inputs to determine the deposition fractions in human respiratory tracts the cmd and gsd of inhaled particles were calculated using steady state size distribution curves from smps 2 5 statistical analysis the calculations of airborne particles properties and graphs were performed in r core team 2019 a kolmogorov smirnov k s test on the size distribution from the beginning of humidifier operation to the end of 8 h was done to determine steady state size distribution a non parametric spearman correlation test on total particle number and mass concentrations over time was conducted to determine the association between the two parameters linear regression of metal ratio in airborne particles and metal ratio in fill water in ultrasonic humidifier reservoir was performed in addition linear regression with indicator variable analysis was used to determine significant differences between the slopes and intercepts of two linear models reported metal ratio and particle mass fraction were mean values from 5 replicates an alpha value of 0 05 was used for all statistical tests 3 results 3 1 particle concentrations and size distribution at steady state before turning on the ultrasonic humidifier conditions in the experimental room were 24 c 28 relative humidity a cmd at 38 nm and very low particle concentrations of 4366 particles cm3 and 2 μg m3 when the humidifier was filled with distilled water the particle concentration was 12 100 particles cm3 the mass concentration was 25 μg m3 with a cmd at 89 nm the background indoor air and distilled water produced particles contained few metals sodium magnesium potassium and calcium as representative tap water metals were 2 μg m3 in the room see fig s3 in si therefore the metals in background air were very low after operating the humidifier with tap water for 2 h the room air temperature remained at approximately 24 c during the 8 h operation period while relative humidity increased from 28 to 45 see fig s2 the relative humidity suggested rapid evaporation of emitted water droplets as the lifetime of a 10 μm water droplet particle in air is 0 27 s under condition of 60 rh and 5 c temperature difference between ambient air and pure water droplet particle holterman 2003 the particles reached steady state in the room after 2 h operation as the size distribution of emitted particles did not change significantly after 2 h and at 8 h fig 2 particle number concentration and mass concentration were constant approximately at 56 500 particles cm3 and 320 μg m3 reported by smps mathematical models as indicated in fig 2a and b describe the changes of particle number and mass concentrations over humidifier operation time the spearman s rank correlation test showed 0 899 and 0 919 between time intervals versus particle number and mass concentrations respectively which suggested strong association between humidifier operation time and concentrations of emitted particles 3 2 size distribution of emitted particles over 8 h operation the size distributions of emitted particles after operating the humidifier for 0 1 h 1 h 2 h and at the end of 8 h operation were shown in fig 2c cmd is identical to geometric mean diameter in lognormal distributions and gsd describes the spread of a distribution 95 of the particles will fall into the range of cmd gsd2 to cmd gsd2 during the first 6 min after turning on the humidifier 95 of emitted particles were between 32 and 265 nm and particles grew larger to 46 388 nm after 1 h k s tests indicated that the particle size distribution changed between the background to the first 6 min distribution and that particle size distributions at the end of 1 2 h were statistically identical as that of the end of 8 h at steady state indicated by the 8th hour data 95 of particles fell into the size range of 51 424 nm large particles of size 1 μm 2 5 μm 5 μm and 10 μm were measured by the aerotrak and had significantly lower concentrations than the 0 014 0 750 μm particles measured by smps the concentrations of larger particles did not affect the cmd and gsd as the cmd using only smps is 146 36 nm gsd 1 74 and with aerotrak the cmd is 146 49 nm gsd 1 74 3 3 elemental metal composition of emitted particles the approach of measuring humidifier particle constituents and masses using icp ms data allowed for a direct measure of the μg amounts of elements and metals from particles collected on the five cascade impactor filters thus total icp ms elements are representative of but not the same as tds since icp ms measures major anions including chloride and sulfate but cannot measure bicarbonate which is another major anion in blacksburg tap water fig 3 a shows the fraction of particle mass in each of the five size bins for small diameter particles 0 25 μm 0 25 0 50 μm 0 50 1 μm 1 2 5 μm and 2 5 μm the result indicates that 50 of airborne particles were smaller than 0 25 μm 35 were 0 25 0 50 μm and 10 were 0 5 1 0 μm regardless of initial concentrations of metal concentrations in fill water in other words 95 of emitted airborne particles were smaller than 1 μm on mass basis fig 3b demonstrates that the mass fraction distribution was comparable across the 5 particle size bins for both metals and metalloids in the fill water sodium magnesium potassium and calcium are important metals and si an important metalloid with concentrations typically in the range of 1000 10 000 ppb in fill water as indicated by fig 3a and b approximately 50 of the metal mass occurred in 0 25 μm emitted airborne particles and 35 occurred in 0 25 0 5 μm particles fig 3c is a heatmap representative of relative air concentrations of the metals and si as a function of particle size fig 3c shows relative concentration as standard deviation from the mean with red indicating higher than mean concentration and blue lower than mean concentration the two smallest particle sizes 0 25 and 0 25 0 50 μm were highest in mass concentrations of all metals and the metalloid and the mass concentrations of particles 1 μm were consistently low for these elements due to the presence of water in the larger particles the airborne particle concentration after 8 h at steady state was 211 μg m3 based on total icp ms elements collected on impactor while the total calculated mass concentration from smps was 320 μg m3 this difference may be explained through bicarbonate which cannot be measured by icp ms and constitutes about 35 of the total dissolved solids in blackburg tap water sain and dietrich 2015 yao et al 2019 if bicarbonate is assumed to be 35 of tds and total icp ms elements measures all anions cations except bicarbonate then total icp ms elements plus bicarbonate would be 324 μg m3 a value very similar to that measured by smps this difference may also be explained by the increased humidity in the room during the experiment absolute humidity was 0 006 kg m3 when rh was 28 and 0 010 kg m3 when 45 emitted particles can be considered as wet particles in air containing water and metals elements wet airborne particles were collected by the cascade impactor and only metals elements in the particles were measured by icp ms smps collected wet airborne particles the instrument calculated mass concentration based on assuming a density of 1 g cm3 and spherical shape for the particles therefore smps may report higher mass concentration because it included both aerosolized water and all aerosolized metal elements fig 4 corroborated fig 3 to demonstrate that small particles contain more metals and the interference of background metals is negligible this is essential information for modeling human inhalation exposure as particle size determines deposition location and therefore metal dose additionally fig 4 shows that the smallest particles are essentially dried tap water the 1 1 dash line is representative of dried tap water particles in air the corresponding metal fractions of different particle sizes in air over metal fraction in water indicated that larger airborne particles contained more water than small airborne particles evidenced by less sloped lines lower concentration of metals are in air compared to water the metal compositions of particles of 0 25 μm and of 0 25 0 50 μm were very similar to that of the tap water that filled the reservoir linear regression model parameters and the statistical model comparisons are as shown in fig 4 the model comparisons indicated the metal composition slopes for emitted particles of 0 25 μm and particles of 0 25 0 5 μm were statistically identical when using metal ratio in tap water as independent variable but significantly different for larger size bins rodes et al 1990 predicted the count median diameter of initially formed water droplet particles by 1 6 mhz ultrasonic humidifiers was approximately 3 μm when assuming pure water surface tension and density this suggested that large wet particles were emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers first and then water evaporated forming small particles in air the evaporation process happened rapidly when the rh in the room was below 50 as mentioned in the steady state room conditions section above the chemical analysis of metals on impactor filters indicated that airborne particles 1 μm had more of the total mass compared to larger particles and their metal composition was equivalent to fill water the particle density in this study was 1 74 g cm3 the value was close to densities of aerosolized inorganic salts i e ammonia sulfate of 1 76 g cm3 ammonia nitrate of 1 69 g cm3 and sodium chloride of 2 08 g cm3 calculated from a similar method sarangi et al 2016 3 4 inhalation exposure to the emitted particles the critical aerosol properties described in previous sections are used to determine inhalation exposure by mppd different age exposure models were used to calculate regional deposition fractions of inhaled particles within human child and adult respiratory tracts aerosol cmd was 146 nm gsd was 1 7 density was 1 74 g cm3 and particles were assumed spherical table 1 indicates the regional deposition in human respiratory tract using mppd for younger humans more particles inhaled would deposit in the respiratory tract especially in the pulmonary region where the inhaled particles would clear more slowly than the trachea region stuart 1984 for resting adults breathing 12 breaths per minute and 625 ml per breath predicted total deposition fraction of 0 22 was similar to other findings when a non resting adult has 1000 ml tidal volume and breathing frequency of 15 per minute total deposition fraction was reported to be 0 25 for sodium chloride particles blanchard and willeke 1984 heyder et al 1986 found the total deposition fraction of 0 1 and 0 2 μm particles were 0 26 and 0 15 respectively under the same exposure scenario particle deposition fraction is 2 fold higher in pulmonary region and the sum of three regions for 3 month infants compared to 21 year adults mature adults experience low particle deposition in the head region nose and mouth tracheobronchial deposition fraction does not change significantly over age particles mass deposited in the pulmonary region increase with age for humans under 21 years old while particle deposition fraction in the pulmonary region has a descending trend when age increases when adjusted for body weight the deposited mass μg kg body weight has a decreasing trend when age increases the results indicate that exposure to particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifier poses greater inhalation risk to infants and young children than adults pulmonary deposition may impair lung development in early exposure new alveoli develops in the first 3 years and after first 3 years the lung grows by expansion grigg 2009 stocks and sonnappa 2013 3 5 prediction of inhaled metal mass for children and adults this study provides an approach to predict inhalation exposure from fill water quality and size distribution of emitted particles since calcium exposure as white dust is a concern the predicted calcium ratios in air in different particle size bins were calculated by linear regression equations shown in fig 4 assuming calcium being 0 2 fraction of total elements in fill water based on icp ms measurements the total elemental mass concentration in particle was measured by icp ms and calcium mass concentration was predicted by multiplying measured total elements and predicted calcium ratio in air in respective size bins total accumulated deposited mass was generated from the mppd model by assuming 8 h humidifier operation time when the fill water contains detectable metal ions using the calculated cmd and gsd the deposited mass in adult and 3 month old child are predicted and presented in table 2 the deposited mass indicated that both adult and child exposure doses increased with increased airborne particle mass concentrations and children are exposed to 3 5 fold more total elements than adults when inhaled particles were normalized over body weight 4 discussion this study characterized detailed size and elemental composition of airborne particles emitted to a room from an ultrasonic humidifier the particle data were input to an established mppd model to predict human inhalation exposure to calcium and total icp ms elements for children and adults the fractional deposition of calcium and elements was calculated for the head tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions the results show that for an adult 199 6 μg and for a 3 month old child 58 8 μg of metals and elements deposited in the lungs after 8 h exposure to particles emitted from an ultrasonic humidifier filled with tap water ultrasonic cavitation creates air bubbles containing water vapor and impurities such as vocs and minerals the mechanism may contribute to the observation that proportionally more water is emitted from the humidifier than metals or elements as previously demonstrated by sain and dietrich 2015 and yao et al 2019 the humidifier emits aerosols with slightly lower concentrations of minerals e g 85 90 than present in the fill water thus more water is emitted and the mineral concentrations increase in the humidifier reservoir over time for smaller emitted aerosols the water evaporates quickly forming essentially dried tap water particles while the larger particles contain more water rodes et al 1990 our measurements indicated emitted particles reached 211 μg m3 air averaged over 8 h operation which was 6 times higher than regulated pm2 5 and 1 4 times higher than regulated pm10 usepa 2010 studies show association between pm2 5 and lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cardiopulmonary diseases e g ischemic heart disease and even lung cancer burnett et al 2014 thurston et al 2016 both short term a few hours to weeks and long term years exposures to pms are linked with increased mortality the longer the exposure period lasts the higher mortality rate due to increased pm2 5 brook et al 2010 in addition residential and commercial pm2 5 contributed to mortality of 675 thousand deaths out of 2 23 million total deaths related to anthropogenic pm2 5 globally silva et al 2016 in the present study the measured concentrations and the modeled deposited particle mass of total elements or calcium exposure doses generated from mppd model can be informative for future toxicity testing when evaluating adverse health effects of white dust emitted from ultrasonic humidifier in addition since humans with asthma and young children are more vulnerable to exposure of air pollution the use of distilled water to fill ultrasonic humidifier is important especially for them usepa 1991 when looking into the metal composition in airborne particles a few studies showed the association between inhaled metal ions bound in pms from various sources and human diseases meng et al 2013 found significant association between 17 metal ions including calcium bound in pms and human cardiovascular diseases and ion properties e g ion size solubility oxidation potential and ability to form covalent and ionic bonds were identified as critical factors affecting the association thurston et al 2016 analyzed the relation of specific metals in pm2 5 and ischemic heart disease calcium as representative of soil particles had an estimated hazard ratio for ischemic disease of 1 01 95 confidence interval 0 98 1 03 per interquartile range of 43 8 ng m3 while pm2 5 was 1 03 95 confidence interval 1 00 1 06 per interquartile range of 3134 6 ng m3 the lower hazard ratio of calcium versus pm2 5 suggests potential lower risks to inhalation exposure to calcium however the concentration of calcium tested was extremely low 10th 90th percentile of 29 6 100 4 ng m3 compared to our study 35 μg m3 the much higher dose could lead to a greater hazard ratio for inhaling calcium containing particles lyu et al 2018 estimated the deposition fraction of aspirated particles within human respiratory tract by mppd model and investigated their oxidative potential results showed that inhaled water soluble metals bound in airborne pms contributed 1 2 fold greater capacity to generate oxidative stress than inhaled quinones epidemiological evidence suggests that children exposed to metals in dust from a mining region have a higher relative risk of respiratory disease in an associated study mice were exposed to pm10 collected from this mining region this exposure resulted in some degree of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury in the mice due to inhaling metals in airborne particles zychowski et al 2019 collectively metal ions bound in airborne particles pose adverse health effects to mice and humans and the oftentimes overlooked residential scenario could lead to unexpected risks this study provides potential for future biological study of inhalation risk from inorganic metal containing airborne particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifiers limitations of this novel study are the lack of inclusion of other fill water qualities for example high hardness water and high tds water and exposure to anions in water such as carbonate chloride or sulfate even though the concentrations of backgrounds metals elements were low in the experimental room they were combined with water from the ultrasonic humidifier and included in the modeled exposures from filling the humidifier with tap water this is realistic as a room will have background levels of particles metals elements that will be combined with the humidifier emitted particles this study focused on the investigation of a typical tap water that is low hardness and low tds therefore the linear regression and statistical analysis may not apply to other water types that may lead to extrapolation retained mass within human respiratory tract is also affected by dissolution alveolar clearance and translocation thus the determination of deposited mass is complicated and may not be fully explained by deposition mechanism only 5 conclusions this study presents detailed particle size concentration composition and exposure data when a typical tap water of 75 mg l tds is used to charge an ultrasonic humidifier in order to change air quality through humidification in a 33 5 m3 room with air exchange rate of 0 8 0 86 hr 1 emitted 1 0 μm particles account for 90 of total emitted particles and 85 were essentially dried tap water and 0 5 μm while 1 μm particles comprised 10 and contained less metals and more water the concentrations of metals elements varies based on particle size and particle water content nonetheless the same relative amounts of metals elements are present in each particle thus inhalation of small particles increased mass exposure to common tap water metals e g calcium sodium magnesium and also associated anions average indoor air particle concentrations were 211 μg m3 air based on icp ms metals and elements without bicarbonate which exceed usepa pm2 5 and pm10 values for ambient air the size and chemical composition characterization of airborne particles emitted from ultrasonic humidifier can be combined with an inhalation model to predict deposited particle mass in the human respiratory tract relatively higher deposition fractions of emitted particles in adult and child pulmonary region than head and tracheobronchial regions indicated increased risks to lower region respiratory injury greater inhalation risk is confirmed for child compared to adult a precautionary measure is to use distilled water to fill the ultrasonic humidifier author contributions the

the first time for akaganéite based granular ferric hydroxide with a competitive multi solute system the results indicated that v v is less prone to competitive adsorption effects and use of the homogeneous surface diffusion model to predict the btcs requires then the kinetic mass transfer biot number to be used as the only fitting parameter on the other hand a concentration overshoot could be observed for the two weaker absorbed oxo anions arsenate and phosphate because of displacement by the vanadate results of pilot scale test column btcs of vanadate for three waterworks with

predictions of breakthrough curves btcs as important prerequisite to allow waterworks staff to estimate future operating costs unfortunately it is not just trivial to predict the lifetime of an fba with any confidence because of the complex interaction of the many co factors and competitive co adsorbates in groundwater pincus et al 2020 for example a small change in ph can markedly affect the mobility of oxo anions such as as iii and as v in contaminated groundwater biswas et al 2014 as many oxo anions share similar adsorbate structures their adsorptive mechanisms also tend to be alike thus promoting competition for adsorption sites background oxo anions such as phosphate po4 3 and silicic acid h4sio4 0 are known to compete with the trace as for similar adsorption sites contributing to failure in achieving regulatory limits for the target contaminant within expected lifetime of an fba nguyen et al 2011 while there is lots of information about adsorption selectivity and competition between the oxo anions arsenite arsenate selenite selenate phosphate and silicic acid pincus et al 2020 there has been less focus on selective and competitive adsorption behavior of the target contaminant vanadate elevated vanadium concentrations of up to 0 2 mg l 1 were found in groundwater of volcanic areas throughout the world hamada 1998 arena et al 2015 koh et al 2016 v bearing fluorapatite with up to 5 wt of the phosphate substituted by vanadate was recently found as geogenic source härter et al 2020 this implies also high phosphate concentrations but their effect on vanadate removal by fbas is virtually unknown enhanced v concentrations may also correlate with enhanced silicic acid and as concentrations in tertiary and quaternary fluvial and aeolian alluvial deposits in argentina where the potential sources were found to be layers of volcanic ash with 90 of rhyolitic glass dispersed in the sediments bundschuh et al 2004 battacharya et al 2006 individual and combined effects on adsorbents such as gfh under environmentally relevant conditions have been studied systematically in only a few laboratory studies nguyen et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 hilbrandt et al 2019 and only in one of them vanadate was considered outcompeting the as adsorption by gfh kolbe et al 2011 however not only a multitude of chemical groundwater components may affect the lifetime of fbas but also physical parameters like the empty bed contact time ebct the ebct is defined as the bv divided by the volumetric flow rate the arsenate removal rate for an fba has been found to be improved by decreasing the flow rate vaughan et al 2007 zeng et al 2008 the lifetime in terms of the number of bvs defined as the volume of water treated divided by the adsorbent bed volume may reach tens to hundreds of thousands before the adsorbent needs to be replaced meaning that an fba may be used continually for two or more years high adsorption capacities require large volumes of water or extremely high initial contaminant concentrations in feasibility studies using pilot scale test columns in waterworks it is therefore laborious and time consuming to conduct field scale experiments to study competitive ion interactions for lifetime estimation however rapid small scale column tests rsscts have been used successfully to simulate the btcs for full scale fba columns crittenden et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2005 sperlich et al 2005 2008 nguyen et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 systematic investigations of the effects of different ph values and phosphate silicic acid and vanadate concentrations on as breakthrough are scarce nguyen et al 2011 kolbe et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 the ph and oxo anion concentrations used in the study first cited were selected to reflect environmental conditions three commercially available adsorbents including a goethite based gfh and an akaganéite based gfh used to remove as were tested a factorial experimental design was used in which all oxo anion concentrations and ph were varied so that a relatively small number of column runs were required nonetheless the number of runs was still challenging and a major finding was that the akaganéite based gfh was more susceptible than the goethite based gfh to changes in water quality under the conditions tested although the column efficiency in terms of adsorption capacity was better for the akaganéite based gfh it was affected most strongly by ph due to the by one unit lower ph point of zero charge phpzc 9 2 for goethite based gfh vs 8 2 for akaganéite based gfh a decrease in ph of around a half unit from 7 6 to 7 0 caused a doubling of the number of bvs required for 10 μg l 1 arsenic breakthrough as bv10 for the akaganéite based gfh and vice versa but an insignificant effect on goethite based gfh it is not surprising that a low ph favored oxo anion removal but it is intriguing to note the greater sensitivity of as bv10 to changes in the influent as concentration at the lower ph for both gfh adsorbents in fact the as bv10 was more affected by a change in ph when the inflow as concentration was 15 μg l 1 than when it was 35 or 55 μg l 1 nguyen et al 2011 the main conclusion of this study was that water quality affects adsorbent media in different and hardly predictable ways and column tests must therefore be performed using local sources of water before selecting an appropriate adsorbent and before the operational and maintenance costs can be estimated nguyen et al 2011 nonetheless this approach is severely hampered by the fact that laboratory scale column test results cannot as easily be extrapolated to conditions other than those of the original experiment an alternative approach to quantify target contaminant selectivity is equilibrium surface complexation modelling scm not only antagonistic but also synergistic effects can occur for example ca2 mitigates the effects of increasing ph by decreasing the total surface negative charge stachowicz et al 2008 such charge effects can only be simulated using an advanced scm approach such as the charge distribution cd multi site surface complexation music model stachowicz et al 2008 unlike the adsorption isotherms used by nguyen et al 2011 surface complexation model parameters are independent of the experimental conditions e g ph once parameterized with a set of batch equilibrium experiment data scms are able to predict the nature of selectivity or competition in a multiple oxo anion system in a wide range of conditions beyond those studied in limited isotherm tests effects like changes in the influent concentration ph and ebct on as breakthrough curves for a goethite based gfh can be successfully predicted using a homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm as an alternative to laborious column testings sperlich et al 2005 2008 the hsdm concept is based on the relationship between chemical equilibrium adsorption and kinetic mass transfer crittenden and weber 1978 in fact the solute concentration gradient between the bulk solution and adsorbent surface creates a driving force across the stagnant film surrounding an adsorbent grain and in particular within the tortuous pores of high surface area adsorbents such as gfh an hsdm is a dual resistance adsorption model that includes these effects of both mass transfer onto the adsorbent surface film mass transfer and into the adsorbent grains intra particle mass transfer the textbook by worch 2012 describes the hsdm concept and various practical applications relating to water treatment the hsdm approach is by far superior to simple second order kinetic models once parameterized it can be applied to predict adsorption kinetics across a range of solution conditions or presence of competing background solutes for akaganéite based fbas which are some of the most frequently used technologies for removing target toxic oxo anions worldwide kanematsu et al 2012 first proposed that rssct results could be simulated if to allow the arsenate adsorption isotherms to be predicted using a simplified scm for the first time we will show here that an advanced cd music model can be used to predict the lifetimes of fbas used to treat v enriched groundwater with complex chemical background composition in following this approach we provide a sound basis for reliable hsdm model parameterization allowing the prediction of akaganéite based fba lifetimes for v enriched groundwater with different chemical compositions the aim of the present study was to extend the approach to simulating the combined effects of all solutes potentially affecting the lifetime of akaganéite based fba used to remove vanadate from groundwater a coupled surface complexation model hsdm model was developed and verified using data from pilot scale fba columns in real but anonymized german waterworks 2 experimental section 2 1 characterization of the gfh adsorption efficiency the akaganéite based gfh used in this study was a commercial product geh 102 produced by geh wasserchemie osnabrück germany with product quality according to en din 15029 and sold for use in fbas worldwide driehaus et al 1998 the fresh granular gfh was subjected to sieving analysis the grain size range was 0 2 2 0 mm and the median grain size was 0 7 mm fig 1s in the supporting information the gfh contained 45 5 akaganéite and 55 5 ferrihydrite determined by rietveld analysis kersten et al 2014 the nanoparticulate ferric hydroxide precipitate was granulated by a freeze thaw procedure this procedure gave a material with an inner microporosity of about 80 a pore size distribution of 2 10 nm kumar et al 2019 and a residual porewater content of about 45 5 wt while the mineral density determined by gas pycnometer using he as the measuring gas din 51913 was 3 67 g cm 3 the bulk density determined by water pycnometry was only 1 6 g cm 3 saha et al 2005 streat et al 2008 kersten et al 2014 the gfh was not dried but it was gently disaggregated in an agate mortar and pestle before use in batch adsorption equilibrium experiments the material was not subjected to milling or heating which might have caused ageing and phase transformation barrios et al 1986 the specific surface area determined using the classical n2 bet method after freeze drying the material was 300 30 m2 g 1 adsorption equilibrium experiments using the gfh were preferred using a slow completely mixed small batch reactor approach allowing the experiments to be performed in triplicate capped 50 ml low density polyethylene centrifuge tubes were filled with freshly boiled deionized high purity water each stock reagent solution was freshly prepared from deionized water acidified to ph 4 and bubbled co2 free using humidified ar gas technical grade ar was chosen because it is virtually free of o2 and co2 whereas even pure nitrogen gas contains traces of o2 and co2 moreover ar is heavier than air which enables an easy draining of air from bottles gfh background electrolyte stock solutions containing 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 m nano3 merck p a quality were adjusted to ph 3 by adding conc hno3 merck suprapure quality stock 0 1 m naoh titrisol merck solutions were prepared in nano3 solutions of respective molarity in co2 free water a 40 ml aliquot of the background electrolyte solution was added to each test tube and sodium orthovanadate na3vo4 sigma aldrich was added as adsorbate then an amount of gfh was added to give a concentration in the solution of 1 g dry weight l 1 to each tube in a series of tests with the same background electrolyte concentrations but different adsorbate concentrations the naoh solution was added dropwise to give a series of ph 11 each series contained tests at three different total adsorbate concentrations and three different ionic strengths the tubes were shaken horizontally 200 rpm for 48 h at 25 3 c then the final ph of the suspension and the residual dissolved ion concentrations in each tube were determined the shaking time was long enough for equilibrium between the solid and solution to be achieved banerjee et al 2008 a standard combination cell was not used to make the ph measurements instead a thermo scientific orion 9101bn 900200 half cell ph probe with a separate kno3 double junction reference electrode thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was used to avoid interference by cl ion leaching kersten et al 2014 the electrode couple was calibrated using three commercial ph buffers certipur merck and the electrode readings were obtained using a stability criterion of 0 1 mv min 1 this together with the linearity criterion gave an overall uncertainty of ph 0 02 each tube was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 min then the supernatant was passed through a single use 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane syringe filter the first few millilitres to pass through it were discarded for conditioning the membranes except for phosphate and silicic acid adsorbate tests as described in supporting information each filtered sample was acidified and stored at 4 c until analysis the residual solute concentrations were determined by an agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa which had a limit of detection for v of 1 μg l 1 the precision and accuracy of the analytical procedure were assessed by analysing a water reference material nist 1643e with a certified v concentration the batch equilibrium adsorption experiments using phosphate and silicic acid are described in detail in the supporting information 2 2 adsorption modelling models of surface complexation like the cd music used here require a number of fixed parameters including specific surface area reactive site density and adsorbent surface charge as well as proton electrolyte and adsorbate ion equilibrium constants as discussed in detail in the supporting information the pest optimization code coupled to the geochemical speciation code visual minteq 3 1 was used to fit the data and parameterize the models gustafsson 2018 the laborious cd music modelling exercises performed in this and our previous studies ultimately allowed a thermodynamic data set to be constructed for 15 different surface complexes table 1 including those for phosphate and silicic acid as described in the supporting information this dataset enabled competing effects between all major and toxic oxo anions onto the akaganéite based gfh to be predicted at any ph this was because gfh adsorbs all oxo anions at the same surface binding sites this extended set of cd music model parameters allows competing effect model scenarios to be set up as demonstrated here for competition between vanadate and arsenate silicic acid and phosphate all together 2 3 adsorbent column test experiments rscct experiments were performed using laboratory scale columns with the gfh but of original grain size distribution thus deviating somewhat from the original rscct concept by westerhoff et al 2005 each column had an inner diameter of 25 mm and a length of 200 mm and contained 65 g of gfh giving a bed depth of 105 mm the inflow rate was 16 ml min 1 resulting in an ebct of 3 2 min the hydraulic parameters are compiled in table 1 the influent was milli q water adjusted to ph 7 5 and contained 10 μmol l 1 each of arsenate phosphate and vanadate each experiment was performed until 50 000 bvs had been treated effluent samples taken at time intervals were passed through disposable 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane syringe filters the first few millilitres to pass through the filter were discarded and the remaining filtrate was analysed directly for p or acidified by adding 0 1 analytical reagent grade hcl before analysis for as and v the as v and v v concentrations in the effluent were determined using an agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer following standard methods din en iso 17294 2 and the phosphate concentrations were determined using a methrohm 790 ion chromatograph pilot scale adsorbent column tests were performed at three german groundwater treatment works denoted in an anonymized way k w and p high v concentrations of up to 50 μg l 1 have been found in well waters treated at these waterworks bahr et al 2019 the aquifers supplying the raw water contain v bearing fluorapatite as geogenic source for v in many volcanic rocks härter et al 2020 that leaches v v to the groundwater exceeding the threshold values the phosphate concentrations in the waters are therefore also high and the molar p v ratio of about 10 is the same as that of the solid v bearing fluorapatite phase indicating stoichiometric dissolution hydrogeochemical modelling using phreeplot indicates that vanadate v species dominate the v enriched water härter et al 2020 however the as concentrations were low 3 μg l 1 in these oxic waters meaning that as does not need to be removed at these sites the v concentrations were correlated with the silicic acid concentrations which were also high up to 40 mg l 1 due to dissolution of amorphous glass phases in the volcanic aquifer rocks table 2 each fba test column was filled with 80 100 kg of gfh and the columns were used in bypass pipes beside the main water treatment lines at k and w waterworks fba columns with inner diameters of 300 mm were used but at p a wider column of a pool filter type with a diameter of 500 mm was used the design parameters for the pilot fbas are compiled in table 2 the inflow and outflow water compositions were monitored each week for a minimum of 1 y using the analytical methods described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface complexation modelling of adsorbate competition effects dissolved v occurs in different coordination environments depending on ph gustafsson 2019 in an aerobic solution v is pentavalent and forms more or less protonated vanadate oxyanion species h2vo4 or hvo4 2 at ph values 4 fig s3 supporting information however at low ph values ph 4 the pentavalent v is present as the vanadyl cation vo2 rather than orthovanadic acid h3vo4 as is the case for other oxo anions the thermodynamic stability constants for the protonation equilibria of the more than a dozen mononuclear and oligomer vanadate species were updated using data published by gustafsson 2019 however only mononuclear vanadate species were considered in the adsorption modelling exercise because monomeric vanadate species are predominant at low v concentrations in groundwater oligomeric vanadate species may become important at v concentrations 0 1 mmol l 1 and at low ph gustafsson 2019 as is typical for oxo anions plots of the percentage vanadate adsorbed vs ph indicated that maximum adsorption occurred in the acidic to circumneutral ph range but the adsorption edge at low v concentrations was shifted until it reaches above ph 10 fig 1 meaning that vanadate is one of the oxo anions that most strongly adsorbs to fe oxyhydroxides the adsorption edge shifted to less alkaline ph values as the v concentrations increased surface complex formation was analysed by synchrotron based xanes and it was confirmed that v v remained as tetrahedral vanadate and had not reduced or had its coordination changed by its adsorption to ferrihydrite and exafs indicated that there were edge sharing bidentate complexes of v o oh 4 tetrahedra with fe o oh 6 octahedra on the ferrihydrite surfaces larsson et al 2017 larsson et al 2017 used their spectroscopic results to constrain a cd music adsorption model for v v surface complexes representing different degrees of protonation 1 2feoh 0 5 3h hvo4 2 feo 2v oh 2 0 2h2o 2 2feoh 0 5 2h hvo4 2 feo 2vooh 1 2h2o 3 2feoh 0 5 h hvo4 2 feo 2vo2 2 2h2o although the h2vo4 species dominates at circumneutral ph conditions the stoichiometric equations are formulated with the hvo4 2 species since it is default input in the visual minteq code used for data fitting the first two complexes dominate the surface speciation of vanadate across a wide ph range but the third least protonated complex is important only at high ph for high surface coverage in principle vanadate could be re formulated as a mono dentate surface complex like other oxo anions as discussed by larsson et al 2017 4 feoh 0 5 h2vo4 feovo2 1 5 h2o however this surface complex also does not play an important role our model was fitted using the surface complexation reactions 1 and 2 and was of good quality overall as shown by the solid and dotted lines in fig 1 the fitted complexation constants for the gfh are compiled in table 1 the cd coefficients were slightly altered when the charge in the zero plane became more positive because of decreasing protonation this occurred through more of the negative charge of the vanadate complex being shifted into the first outer sphere plane δz 0 0 9 v u and δz 1 1 9 v u for the most protonated third complex larsson et al 2017 suggested that the opposite charging behavior would occur however a final conclusion on this cannot be made without advanced molecular modelling nonetheless the complexation constants that we derived were similar to those found by larsson et al 2017 same approach was used to derive at cd music data for phosphate and silicic acid figs s4 and s5 in the supporting information published data on phosphate silicic acid and vanadate adsorption can favorably be re fitted using our parameter set figs s6 s8 in the supporting information all these data result in an affinity sequence of h2vo4 h4sio4 0 h2po4 h2aso4 for the gfh adsorbent fig s8 in the supporting information if to quantify the selectivity for the target oxo anion vanadate in comparison to the other competitive oxo anions a selectivity coefficient β t k d t k d c can be introduced where k d t is the distribution coefficient of the target oxo anion and k d c is the distribution coefficient of the background oxo anion pincus et al 2020 selectivity coefficient values of β t 1 2 for phosphate and 2 5 for arsenate calculated from the batch equilibrium data shown in fig 2 with equal equilibrium solute concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 are all above unity and thus demonstrate high selectivity of the gfh towards the target oxo anion vanadate this selectivity can be understood on a theoretical basis if to recall the pearson hard soft acid base hsab principle pincus et al 2020 according to this principle the oxo anions as hard lewis bases electron donors are adsorbed by the iron hydroxide surface as a hard lewis acid electron acceptor the selectivity varies with the relative lewis base hardness which can be assessed by the pk a values of the deprotonation of the respective oxo anion species and suggests the same ranking of pk a 8 75 h2vo4 7 20 h2po4 7 0 h2aso4 3 2 hsdm simulation of the rssct breakthrough curves the hsdm approach used to model the btcs was described in the textbook by worch 2012 several simplifying assumptions were made when developing the hsdm these were that i adsorbent grains occur as spheres of homogeneous composition the h in hsdm ii both linear aqueous phase mass transfer and solid phase mass transfer occur only through surface diffusion the sd in hsdm iii plug flow conditions occur in the adsorbent bed iv the hydraulic loading rate and diffusion coefficients are constant and v adsorption isotherms are used to describe the adsorption equilibrium three essential intrinsic dimensionless parameters of the hsdm the biot number bi the modified stanton number st and the solute distribution coefficient d g define the shape of the btc and are derived from in total 10 operational equilibrium and kinetic input parameters as shown previously for arsenate removal by gfh adsorbent columns badruzzaman et al 2004 sperlich et al 2008 pérez foguet et al 2013 the operational parameters include the adsorbent mass m the filter bed porosity e b the bulk density of the adsorbent grain particles including the inner porosity filled by water ρp the mean diameter of the adsorbent grains determined by sieve analysis d p the aqueous influent concentration of the solute c 0 and the constant volumetric flow rate through the adsorbent column q all these physical and chemical parameters can be measured for the rssct experiment and are compiled in table 2 aim of this research was to reduce the remaining free parameters for fitting of the btcs to only one which is the solute intra particle diffusion coefficient or biot number in our hsdm model adsorbate competition was considered only with regard to the description of the multi solute adsorption equilibrium and the effects of this competition on mass transfer and therefore the adsorption kinetics were assumed at first approximation to be negligible as also suggested by worch 2012 the same single solute mass transfer coefficients were therefore used for all of the oxo anions at first approximation to predict the btcs for the multi solute systems in this respect the method used to estimate the hsdm model parameters was not different from those used previously to estimate parameters for a single solute arsenate or phosphate system sperlich et al 2005 2008 the fixed bed adsorption simulation tool fast v 2 1 www fast software de typical screenshot shown in fig s9 of the supporting information was used to perform the hsdm simulations a simulation iteration typically took a few min when run as four parallel threads on a laptop the bed density and the ebct were calculated using this software code on basis of the hydrodynamic parameters chosen for the experiments table 2 further kinetic hsdm model parameters include the film diffusion coefficient k l and the surface diffusion coefficient d s the film diffusion coefficient influences the slope at beginning of the btc curve worch 2012 the diffusion coefficient for all three oxo anions was fixed at k l 2 5 10 6 m s 1 as first guess this is reasonable because the film diffusion depends on the advective flow rate more than on the solute and the flow rate will be the same for all oxo anions a stanton number st of between 1 1 and 3 0 as the ratio between the rate of transport by film mass transfer and the measured rate of transport by advection used in this study and also by pérez foguet et al 2013 indicates that film mass transfer is slightly faster than advection and therefore not rate limiting this appears reasonable for the relatively fast inflow rate of a vr 2 7 m h 1 applied during the rssct and pilot scale column tests the intra particle diffusion coefficient d s on the other hand strongly depends on the characteristics of the adsorbate and is between 10 16 and 10 14 m2 s 1 badruzzaman et al 2004 sperlich et al 2005 2008 the surface diffusion coefficient may be estimated experimentally for each single adsorbent system by using a differential column batch reactor dcbr test or used as fit parameter in a multi solute system worch 2012 adsorption in the hsdm is commonly described by the freundlich adsorption isotherm c ads k f c 0 n freundlich coefficients are often used as free fitting parameters in hsdm systems for example sperlich et al 2008 suggested that strongly non linear freundlich exponents of n 0 19 should be used for arsenate and phosphate which we adopted here for vanadate the non linearity mimics the limited adsorption capacity that is a necessary pre condition for constructing a btc the freundlich constants were used to differentiate between adsorption affinities of the solutes however the freundlich constant for arsenate was found to be double that of phosphate by sperlich et al 2008 which contradicts our general understanding of affinity series in the adsorption of oxo anions by iron hydroxides just the opposite should be the case as shown in fig 2 and also by the increase of the solute distribution coefficient d g in the order arsenate phosphate vanadate table 3 the cd music model can be used to study competitive effects on the adsorption equilibrium the model can be used to predict freundlich adsorption isotherm parameters but not a langmuir adsorption isotherm model due to its limitation of equal activity of the various v surface complexes the key parameter for a competitive multi solute adsorbate system with a strong adsorbent is the surface saturation effect an adsorbate with a lower affinity tends to be outcompeted by and therefore has a lower saturation level than an adsorbate with a higher affinity to model these data the adsorption isotherms were first simulated using our cd music model for this the equal inflow concentrations for all three adsorbates the adsorbent amounts in the test columns 65 4 g wet weight or 37 3 g dry weight and volume of water treated during the whole rcsst experiment run 50 000 times 51 5 ml bv 2500 l table 2 were used as expected for a strong adsorbent high solute distribution coefficient d g in the order of 105 table 3 the gfh adsorbed almost 100 of all three oxo anions at low concentrations the isotherm slope at low oxyanion concentrations was therefore the same for all the oxo anions and was determined only by the amount of adsorbent present for the total water volume treated at higher concentrations however the oxo anion with highest affinity vanadate in this case may outcompete an oxo anion with lower affinity phosphate silicic acid and arsenate in that order and therefore limit the adsorbent capacity for the latter adsorbates the freundlich isotherms must therefore be strongly non linear with freundlich exponent n 1 to represent the quite different adsorption limits in a multi solute system predicted by the cd music model the exponent was therefore fixed at n 0 19 for all three oxo anions as suggested by sperlich et al 2008 as shown in fig 2a the slope of the curves could not well be reproduced by the non linear freundlich isotherms however the different degrees of saturation in the competitive multi component system could well be represented by the freundlich constants thus predicted they increased in the order arsenate k f 4 phosphate k f 8 vanadate k f 36 according to the order in which the adsorption affinity increased in the competitive multi solute system since fba performance is a combination of adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics the freundlich constants describing adsorption capacity rather than the exponents describing the slope are key parameters for modelling of the btcs by the hsdm approach sperlich et al 2008 worch 2012 the thus fixed hsdm parameters tables 2 and 3 enabled btcs for arsenate phosphate and vanadate to be fitted to the rssct data fig 3 a sperlich et al 2008 and pérez foguet et al 2013 did not report film mass transfer rate numbers but surface diffusion constants and biot numbers only pérez foguet et al 2013 pointed out that film mass transfer dominates when bi 100 and surface diffusion is dominant when bi 102 hence the higher the biot number bi the higher is the rate of film diffusion in comparison to surface diffusion if bi 50 the influence of the film diffusion on the overall adsorption rate becomes negligible worch 2012 in our study the best fit bi numbers were in the range 40 90 table 3 so surface diffusion must influence the btcs the most relatively slow and therefore rate limiting intra particle mass transfer d s 1 10 16 m2 s 1 or 1 10 12 cm2 s 1 caused the btc slope to be smoother for vanadate than for arsenate and phosphate fig 3a element maps of gfh grains indicated that there was an adsorbate distribution gradient throughout the grain interior even after use for 2 y as a fba in a waterworks fig s2 in the supporting information fig 3a shows also that a displacement process takes place leading to a quite different breakthrough behaviour of the three oxo anions as a typical result of competition and displacement a slight concentration overshoot could be observed for the two weaker absorbed oxo anions arsenate and phosphate this effect has not yet been reported in literature but can in principle be explained by their different traveling velocities within the adsorbent column worch 2012 since the traveling velocity depends on the adsorption affinity of the solute the weaker absorbed oxo anion travels faster through the adsorbent column while the stronger adsorbed oxo anion lacks behind later when the stronger adsorbed oxo anion reaches the same layers a new equilibrium state is established resulting in partial displacement of the previously adsorbed oxo anion of weaker affinity as a result of this displacement process the concentration of the latter component becomes higher than its initial inflow concentration except of the vanadate with highest adsorption affinity the other two oxo anions are obviously subject to this displacement process and hence concentration overshoot whereby the weaker adsorbed arsenate shows the overshoot effect first followed by the phosphate a bit later fig 3a unfortunately this overshoot effect cannot be simulated by a model btc which must run asymptotically towards c c 0 1 because of the high initial concentrations of about 10 μmol l 1 the overshoot effect leads to an extensive plateau at about c c 0 1 2 in between 10 000 and 40 000 bvs and levels out after about 40 000 bvs towards c c 0 1 fig 3a 3 3 hsdm simulation of pilot scale column btcs for the three water treatment works the water supplied to water treatment works k and w had similar and relatively high phosphate and silicic acid concentrations and also similar v concentrations but more than twice as high than inflow concentrations in waterworks p table 2 it has previously been found that elevated phosphate and vanadate concentrations in groundwater of the study area are of geogenic source härter et al 2020 the as concentrations in the oxic waters supplied to all three waterworks were relatively low 3 μg l 1 arsenate therefore did not compete with vanadate but phosphate with by one order of magnitude higher concentrations may eventually compete with vanadate the vanadate btcs for the pilot test columns in the three waterworks are shown in fig 3b the btcs were asymptotic so accurate breakthrough times could not be determined from a theoretical point of view the time at c c0 0 05 is conventionally used as the breakthrough point worch 2012 but in practice the time at which the concentration exceeds the relevant regulatory value 4 μg l 1 for vanadate is of most interest all three btcs followed typical trends the outflow v concentration being below the limit of detection 1 μg l 1 at the beginning and then slowly but steadily increasing until the threshold was exceeded at about 30 000 bvs at location w 40 000 bvs at location k and 110 000 bvs at location p the fba service lifetime would therefore be reached at 16 months at k at 7 months at p and only 3 months at w this rather different lifetimes clearly warrant further explanation there is a huge scatter in data for p site which also warrants explanation first of all the sampling intervals were a bit excessively long therefore the data density was not as good as for the other two sites second reason was the relatively low bed height of only 36 cm even though the design parameters were correct ebct and flow rate the relatively low bed height in the pool filter means that the filter bed is more susceptible to short circuit effects if the bed was blocked somewhat by the introduction of turbid substances from the raw water preferred flow channels were formed and an earlier breakthrough occurred if the filter is then backwashed the flow conditions became more even and the adsorption capacity improved again this is a phenomenon that can sometimes be observed in practice also with large fba systems in the case of the pilot filter at site p glitches in the btc at approximately 60 000 bv and at 80 000 bv can be attributed to this backwashing effect all of the water samples were in a similar ph range of 7 4 7 6 table 2 it appears that the different groundwater chemistries at the three selected waterworks affect the btcs and hence the lifetime of the fba test columns however the situation becomes more complex considering the cd music predictions for the freundlich adsorption isotherms for all three sites with their different chemical compositions fig 2b first of all the different concentrations of the co adsorbing solutes like phosphate and silicic acid do obviously not play a role because the freundlich coefficients predicted for vanadate by the cd music model are the same at all three sites k f 3 2 0 05 for n 0 19 the v concentration in the influent water at site p was just half those in the influents to the other two waterworks and this clearly renders the processing capacity at p higher than if it received the same water as the other works in spite of the lowest ebct chosen table 2 however the rather different lifetimes for k and w which received water with similar v concentrations cannot as easily be explained from a chemical point of view the similar co solute concentrations do obviously not play a role the difference in capacity can rather be attributed to the physical difference in dimension of the columns used which gave an ebct twice higher and therefore more favourable adsorption conditions for k than for w the twice longer ebct lower flow rate for k than for w clearly caused the vanadate removal in the presence of competing ions to be much more successful furthermore the adsorbent bed was not homogeneously loaded with v chemical analysis of the adsorbent material after the end of the test runs at site p indicated a vertical concentration gradient and that the maximum v loading was 7 5 mg g 1 dry weight in the topmost bed horizon and the minimum v loading was 2 mg g 1 dry weight in the bottommost bed horizon bahr et al 2019 with an average of 4 mg g 1 dry weight just as predicted by the cd music model fig 2b 4 conclusion the effects of the phosphate and silicic acid concentration ph and ebct on v v breakthrough curves were predicted using the hsdm approach the freundlich adsorption isotherm data required for the hsdm were predicted by the cd music surface complexation model it was set up by adsorption equilibrium data for all oxo anions and then applied on the compositions of the influent water of three different water treatment works the pilot test column btcs for all three water treatment works were predicted well using a unique freundlich constant derived on basis of the multi solute cd music model a single surface diffusion coefficient derived from the rssct column test and therefore the same biot number fixed at bi 37 for all three sites the coupled model approach was thereby demonstrated to predict the individual effects of these parameters on oxo anion removal performance of the gfh it was also shown that gfh removal performance for vanadate is not much influenced by arsenate phosphate and silicic acid contents of the groundwater whereas vanadate may lead to a btc overshoot for the other oxo anions the fba lifetimes for removal of the vanadate are therefore controlled by operational parameters such as the v concentration in the effluent waters and the ebcts rather than the groundwater chemistries moreover our combined equilibrium and kinetic model approach allows any combinations of environmental conditions to be used in scenario models to predict lifetimes of the adsorbent columns the approach demonstrated here can be extended to include other relevant chemicals in water such as dissolved uranium or even organic chemicals provided that the relevant cd music model parameters are available the approach is suitable for predicting equilibrium parameters for hsdm models and reduces the fitting to the kinetic parameters determined by the individual column design the large number of interferences that have to be studied imply that such a modelling approach could help to optimize the designs of factorial experiments to identify the most important interferences and to minimize the number of test columns required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

19982,granular ferric hydroxide gfh is often used for fixed bed adsorbent fba columns in groundwater purification units around the world to remove arsenate contaminations groundwater can contain also other toxic e g antimonite and vanadate and non toxic oxo anions phosphate and silicic acid that are known to affect fba lifetimes therefore understanding the breakthrough of toxic compounds intended for removal by fba is essential to their design and is important to predict accurately breakthrough curves btcs for fbas in waterworks to plan future operating costs rapid small scale column tests rscct and pilot scale fba were used to simulate vanadate btcs for complex groundwater chemistries the btcs were simulated successfully using a homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm combining equilibrium chemical adsorption and kinetic mass transfer adsorption parameters for various groundwater compositions were predicted using the cd music surface complexation model which was set up for the first time for akaganéite based granular ferric hydroxide with a competitive multi solute system the results indicated that v v is less prone to competitive adsorption effects and use of the homogeneous surface diffusion model to predict the btcs requires then the kinetic mass transfer biot number to be used as the only fitting parameter on the other hand a concentration overshoot could be observed for the two weaker absorbed oxo anions arsenate and phosphate because of displacement by the vanadate results of pilot scale test column btcs of vanadate for three waterworks with different groundwater compositions could be favorably extrapolated with a unique freundlich constant kf of 3 2 derived on basis of the multi solute cd music model and a unique biot number of 37 fixed for all three different test sites graphical abstract image 1 keywords vanadate adsorption fba hsdm rscct cd music 1 introduction ferric hydroxide based adsorbents can be used very efficiently to remove hazardous oxo anions from contaminated groundwater weidner and ciesielczyk 2019 such materials are often used as filler in fixed bed adsorbent fba columns for water purification facilities deliyanni et al 2003 2009 daus et al 2004 badruzzaman et al 2004 saha et al 2005 sperlich et al 2005 2008 naeem et al 2007 banerjee et al 2008 streat et al 2008 guan et al 2008 kolbe et al 2011 hilbrandt et al 2019 fbas packed with granular ferric hydroxide gfh have high adsorption capacities but when used for a long time the adsorbent may become saturated or even overloaded and the contaminant concentrations in the effluent increase above acceptable values the adsorbent used in an fba must therefore be replaced regularly to keep contaminant concentrations below the relevant thresholds e g in germany 10 μg l 1 for as and 4 μg l 1 for v lawa 2004 this implies limited lifetimes of typically 100 1000 d whereby 20 000 300 000 bed volumes bvs of groundwater can typically be treated worch 2012 in designing an fba breakthrough for the toxic compounds to be removed must be properly understood for a vast variety of groundwater compositions which may enable for accurate predictions of breakthrough curves btcs as important prerequisite to allow waterworks staff to estimate future operating costs unfortunately it is not just trivial to predict the lifetime of an fba with any confidence because of the complex interaction of the many co factors and competitive co adsorbates in groundwater pincus et al 2020 for example a small change in ph can markedly affect the mobility of oxo anions such as as iii and as v in contaminated groundwater biswas et al 2014 as many oxo anions share similar adsorbate structures their adsorptive mechanisms also tend to be alike thus promoting competition for adsorption sites background oxo anions such as phosphate po4 3 and silicic acid h4sio4 0 are known to compete with the trace as for similar adsorption sites contributing to failure in achieving regulatory limits for the target contaminant within expected lifetime of an fba nguyen et al 2011 while there is lots of information about adsorption selectivity and competition between the oxo anions arsenite arsenate selenite selenate phosphate and silicic acid pincus et al 2020 there has been less focus on selective and competitive adsorption behavior of the target contaminant vanadate elevated vanadium concentrations of up to 0 2 mg l 1 were found in groundwater of volcanic areas throughout the world hamada 1998 arena et al 2015 koh et al 2016 v bearing fluorapatite with up to 5 wt of the phosphate substituted by vanadate was recently found as geogenic source härter et al 2020 this implies also high phosphate concentrations but their effect on vanadate removal by fbas is virtually unknown enhanced v concentrations may also correlate with enhanced silicic acid and as concentrations in tertiary and quaternary fluvial and aeolian alluvial deposits in argentina where the potential sources were found to be layers of volcanic ash with 90 of rhyolitic glass dispersed in the sediments bundschuh et al 2004 battacharya et al 2006 individual and combined effects on adsorbents such as gfh under environmentally relevant conditions have been studied systematically in only a few laboratory studies nguyen et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 hilbrandt et al 2019 and only in one of them vanadate was considered outcompeting the as adsorption by gfh kolbe et al 2011 however not only a multitude of chemical groundwater components may affect the lifetime of fbas but also physical parameters like the empty bed contact time ebct the ebct is defined as the bv divided by the volumetric flow rate the arsenate removal rate for an fba has been found to be improved by decreasing the flow rate vaughan et al 2007 zeng et al 2008 the lifetime in terms of the number of bvs defined as the volume of water treated divided by the adsorbent bed volume may reach tens to hundreds of thousands before the adsorbent needs to be replaced meaning that an fba may be used continually for two or more years high adsorption capacities require large volumes of water or extremely high initial contaminant concentrations in feasibility studies using pilot scale test columns in waterworks it is therefore laborious and time consuming to conduct field scale experiments to study competitive ion interactions for lifetime estimation however rapid small scale column tests rsscts have been used successfully to simulate the btcs for full scale fba columns crittenden et al 1987 westerhoff et al 2005 sperlich et al 2005 2008 nguyen et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 systematic investigations of the effects of different ph values and phosphate silicic acid and vanadate concentrations on as breakthrough are scarce nguyen et al 2011 kolbe et al 2011 kanematsu et al 2012 the ph and oxo anion concentrations used in the study first cited were selected to reflect environmental conditions three commercially available adsorbents including a goethite based gfh and an akaganéite based gfh used to remove as were tested a factorial experimental design was used in which all oxo anion concentrations and ph were varied so that a relatively small number of column runs were required nonetheless the number of runs was still challenging and a major finding was that the akaganéite based gfh was more susceptible than the goethite based gfh to changes in water quality under the conditions tested although the column efficiency in terms of adsorption capacity was better for the akaganéite based gfh it was affected most strongly by ph due to the by one unit lower ph point of zero charge phpzc 9 2 for goethite based gfh vs 8 2 for akaganéite based gfh a decrease in ph of around a half unit from 7 6 to 7 0 caused a doubling of the number of bvs required for 10 μg l 1 arsenic breakthrough as bv10 for the akaganéite based gfh and vice versa but an insignificant effect on goethite based gfh it is not surprising that a low ph favored oxo anion removal but it is intriguing to note the greater sensitivity of as bv10 to changes in the influent as concentration at the lower ph for both gfh adsorbents in fact the as bv10 was more affected by a change in ph when the inflow as concentration was 15 μg l 1 than when it was 35 or 55 μg l 1 nguyen et al 2011 the main conclusion of this study was that water quality affects adsorbent media in different and hardly predictable ways and column tests must therefore be performed using local sources of water before selecting an appropriate adsorbent and before the operational and maintenance costs can be estimated nguyen et al 2011 nonetheless this approach is severely hampered by the fact that laboratory scale column test results cannot as easily be extrapolated to conditions other than those of the original experiment an alternative approach to quantify target contaminant selectivity is equilibrium surface complexation modelling scm not only antagonistic but also synergistic effects can occur for example ca2 mitigates the effects of increasing ph by decreasing the total surface negative charge stachowicz et al 2008 such charge effects can only be simulated using an advanced scm approach such as the charge distribution cd multi site surface complexation music model stachowicz et al 2008 unlike the adsorption isotherms used by nguyen et al 2011 surface complexation model parameters are independent of the experimental conditions e g ph once parameterized with a set of batch equilibrium experiment data scms are able to predict the nature of selectivity or competition in a multiple oxo anion system in a wide range of conditions beyond those studied in limited isotherm tests effects like changes in the influent concentration ph and ebct on as breakthrough curves for a goethite based gfh can be successfully predicted using a homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm as an alternative to laborious column testings sperlich et al 2005 2008 the hsdm concept is based on the relationship between chemical equilibrium adsorption and kinetic mass transfer crittenden and weber 1978 in fact the solute concentration gradient between the bulk solution and adsorbent surface creates a driving force across the stagnant film surrounding an adsorbent grain and in particular within the tortuous pores of high surface area adsorbents such as gfh an hsdm is a dual resistance adsorption model that includes these effects of both mass transfer onto the adsorbent surface film mass transfer and into the adsorbent grains intra particle mass transfer the textbook by worch 2012 describes the hsdm concept and various practical applications relating to water treatment the hsdm approach is by far superior to simple second order kinetic models once parameterized it can be applied to predict adsorption kinetics across a range of solution conditions or presence of competing background solutes for akaganéite based fbas which are some of the most frequently used technologies for removing target toxic oxo anions worldwide kanematsu et al 2012 first proposed that rssct results could be simulated if to allow the arsenate adsorption isotherms to be predicted using a simplified scm for the first time we will show here that an advanced cd music model can be used to predict the lifetimes of fbas used to treat v enriched groundwater with complex chemical background composition in following this approach we provide a sound basis for reliable hsdm model parameterization allowing the prediction of akaganéite based fba lifetimes for v enriched groundwater with different chemical compositions the aim of the present study was to extend the approach to simulating the combined effects of all solutes potentially affecting the lifetime of akaganéite based fba used to remove vanadate from groundwater a coupled surface complexation model hsdm model was developed and verified using data from pilot scale fba columns in real but anonymized german waterworks 2 experimental section 2 1 characterization of the gfh adsorption efficiency the akaganéite based gfh used in this study was a commercial product geh 102 produced by geh wasserchemie osnabrück germany with product quality according to en din 15029 and sold for use in fbas worldwide driehaus et al 1998 the fresh granular gfh was subjected to sieving analysis the grain size range was 0 2 2 0 mm and the median grain size was 0 7 mm fig 1s in the supporting information the gfh contained 45 5 akaganéite and 55 5 ferrihydrite determined by rietveld analysis kersten et al 2014 the nanoparticulate ferric hydroxide precipitate was granulated by a freeze thaw procedure this procedure gave a material with an inner microporosity of about 80 a pore size distribution of 2 10 nm kumar et al 2019 and a residual porewater content of about 45 5 wt while the mineral density determined by gas pycnometer using he as the measuring gas din 51913 was 3 67 g cm 3 the bulk density determined by water pycnometry was only 1 6 g cm 3 saha et al 2005 streat et al 2008 kersten et al 2014 the gfh was not dried but it was gently disaggregated in an agate mortar and pestle before use in batch adsorption equilibrium experiments the material was not subjected to milling or heating which might have caused ageing and phase transformation barrios et al 1986 the specific surface area determined using the classical n2 bet method after freeze drying the material was 300 30 m2 g 1 adsorption equilibrium experiments using the gfh were preferred using a slow completely mixed small batch reactor approach allowing the experiments to be performed in triplicate capped 50 ml low density polyethylene centrifuge tubes were filled with freshly boiled deionized high purity water each stock reagent solution was freshly prepared from deionized water acidified to ph 4 and bubbled co2 free using humidified ar gas technical grade ar was chosen because it is virtually free of o2 and co2 whereas even pure nitrogen gas contains traces of o2 and co2 moreover ar is heavier than air which enables an easy draining of air from bottles gfh background electrolyte stock solutions containing 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 m nano3 merck p a quality were adjusted to ph 3 by adding conc hno3 merck suprapure quality stock 0 1 m naoh titrisol merck solutions were prepared in nano3 solutions of respective molarity in co2 free water a 40 ml aliquot of the background electrolyte solution was added to each test tube and sodium orthovanadate na3vo4 sigma aldrich was added as adsorbate then an amount of gfh was added to give a concentration in the solution of 1 g dry weight l 1 to each tube in a series of tests with the same background electrolyte concentrations but different adsorbate concentrations the naoh solution was added dropwise to give a series of ph 11 each series contained tests at three different total adsorbate concentrations and three different ionic strengths the tubes were shaken horizontally 200 rpm for 48 h at 25 3 c then the final ph of the suspension and the residual dissolved ion concentrations in each tube were determined the shaking time was long enough for equilibrium between the solid and solution to be achieved banerjee et al 2008 a standard combination cell was not used to make the ph measurements instead a thermo scientific orion 9101bn 900200 half cell ph probe with a separate kno3 double junction reference electrode thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was used to avoid interference by cl ion leaching kersten et al 2014 the electrode couple was calibrated using three commercial ph buffers certipur merck and the electrode readings were obtained using a stability criterion of 0 1 mv min 1 this together with the linearity criterion gave an overall uncertainty of ph 0 02 each tube was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 min then the supernatant was passed through a single use 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane syringe filter the first few millilitres to pass through it were discarded for conditioning the membranes except for phosphate and silicic acid adsorbate tests as described in supporting information each filtered sample was acidified and stored at 4 c until analysis the residual solute concentrations were determined by an agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa which had a limit of detection for v of 1 μg l 1 the precision and accuracy of the analytical procedure were assessed by analysing a water reference material nist 1643e with a certified v concentration the batch equilibrium adsorption experiments using phosphate and silicic acid are described in detail in the supporting information 2 2 adsorption modelling models of surface complexation like the cd music used here require a number of fixed parameters including specific surface area reactive site density and adsorbent surface charge as well as proton electrolyte and adsorbate ion equilibrium constants as discussed in detail in the supporting information the pest optimization code coupled to the geochemical speciation code visual minteq 3 1 was used to fit the data and parameterize the models gustafsson 2018 the laborious cd music modelling exercises performed in this and our previous studies ultimately allowed a thermodynamic data set to be constructed for 15 different surface complexes table 1 including those for phosphate and silicic acid as described in the supporting information this dataset enabled competing effects between all major and toxic oxo anions onto the akaganéite based gfh to be predicted at any ph this was because gfh adsorbs all oxo anions at the same surface binding sites this extended set of cd music model parameters allows competing effect model scenarios to be set up as demonstrated here for competition between vanadate and arsenate silicic acid and phosphate all together 2 3 adsorbent column test experiments rscct experiments were performed using laboratory scale columns with the gfh but of original grain size distribution thus deviating somewhat from the original rscct concept by westerhoff et al 2005 each column had an inner diameter of 25 mm and a length of 200 mm and contained 65 g of gfh giving a bed depth of 105 mm the inflow rate was 16 ml min 1 resulting in an ebct of 3 2 min the hydraulic parameters are compiled in table 1 the influent was milli q water adjusted to ph 7 5 and contained 10 μmol l 1 each of arsenate phosphate and vanadate each experiment was performed until 50 000 bvs had been treated effluent samples taken at time intervals were passed through disposable 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane syringe filters the first few millilitres to pass through the filter were discarded and the remaining filtrate was analysed directly for p or acidified by adding 0 1 analytical reagent grade hcl before analysis for as and v the as v and v v concentrations in the effluent were determined using an agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer following standard methods din en iso 17294 2 and the phosphate concentrations were determined using a methrohm 790 ion chromatograph pilot scale adsorbent column tests were performed at three german groundwater treatment works denoted in an anonymized way k w and p high v concentrations of up to 50 μg l 1 have been found in well waters treated at these waterworks bahr et al 2019 the aquifers supplying the raw water contain v bearing fluorapatite as geogenic source for v in many volcanic rocks härter et al 2020 that leaches v v to the groundwater exceeding the threshold values the phosphate concentrations in the waters are therefore also high and the molar p v ratio of about 10 is the same as that of the solid v bearing fluorapatite phase indicating stoichiometric dissolution hydrogeochemical modelling using phreeplot indicates that vanadate v species dominate the v enriched water härter et al 2020 however the as concentrations were low 3 μg l 1 in these oxic waters meaning that as does not need to be removed at these sites the v concentrations were correlated with the silicic acid concentrations which were also high up to 40 mg l 1 due to dissolution of amorphous glass phases in the volcanic aquifer rocks table 2 each fba test column was filled with 80 100 kg of gfh and the columns were used in bypass pipes beside the main water treatment lines at k and w waterworks fba columns with inner diameters of 300 mm were used but at p a wider column of a pool filter type with a diameter of 500 mm was used the design parameters for the pilot fbas are compiled in table 2 the inflow and outflow water compositions were monitored each week for a minimum of 1 y using the analytical methods described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface complexation modelling of adsorbate competition effects dissolved v occurs in different coordination environments depending on ph gustafsson 2019 in an aerobic solution v is pentavalent and forms more or less protonated vanadate oxyanion species h2vo4 or hvo4 2 at ph values 4 fig s3 supporting information however at low ph values ph 4 the pentavalent v is present as the vanadyl cation vo2 rather than orthovanadic acid h3vo4 as is the case for other oxo anions the thermodynamic stability constants for the protonation equilibria of the more than a dozen mononuclear and oligomer vanadate species were updated using data published by gustafsson 2019 however only mononuclear vanadate species were considered in the adsorption modelling exercise because monomeric vanadate species are predominant at low v concentrations in groundwater oligomeric vanadate species may become important at v concentrations 0 1 mmol l 1 and at low ph gustafsson 2019 as is typical for oxo anions plots of the percentage vanadate adsorbed vs ph indicated that maximum adsorption occurred in the acidic to circumneutral ph range but the adsorption edge at low v concentrations was shifted until it reaches above ph 10 fig 1 meaning that vanadate is one of the oxo anions that most strongly adsorbs to fe oxyhydroxides the adsorption edge shifted to less alkaline ph values as the v concentrations increased surface complex formation was analysed by synchrotron based xanes and it was confirmed that v v remained as tetrahedral vanadate and had not reduced or had its coordination changed by its adsorption to ferrihydrite and exafs indicated that there were edge sharing bidentate complexes of v o oh 4 tetrahedra with fe o oh 6 octahedra on the ferrihydrite surfaces larsson et al 2017 larsson et al 2017 used their spectroscopic results to constrain a cd music adsorption model for v v surface complexes representing different degrees of protonation 1 2feoh 0 5 3h hvo4 2 feo 2v oh 2 0 2h2o 2 2feoh 0 5 2h hvo4 2 feo 2vooh 1 2h2o 3 2feoh 0 5 h hvo4 2 feo 2vo2 2 2h2o although the h2vo4 species dominates at circumneutral ph conditions the stoichiometric equations are formulated with the hvo4 2 species since it is default input in the visual minteq code used for data fitting the first two complexes dominate the surface speciation of vanadate across a wide ph range but the third least protonated complex is important only at high ph for high surface coverage in principle vanadate could be re formulated as a mono dentate surface complex like other oxo anions as discussed by larsson et al 2017 4 feoh 0 5 h2vo4 feovo2 1 5 h2o however this surface complex also does not play an important role our model was fitted using the surface complexation reactions 1 and 2 and was of good quality overall as shown by the solid and dotted lines in fig 1 the fitted complexation constants for the gfh are compiled in table 1 the cd coefficients were slightly altered when the charge in the zero plane became more positive because of decreasing protonation this occurred through more of the negative charge of the vanadate complex being shifted into the first outer sphere plane δz 0 0 9 v u and δz 1 1 9 v u for the most protonated third complex larsson et al 2017 suggested that the opposite charging behavior would occur however a final conclusion on this cannot be made without advanced molecular modelling nonetheless the complexation constants that we derived were similar to those found by larsson et al 2017 same approach was used to derive at cd music data for phosphate and silicic acid figs s4 and s5 in the supporting information published data on phosphate silicic acid and vanadate adsorption can favorably be re fitted using our parameter set figs s6 s8 in the supporting information all these data result in an affinity sequence of h2vo4 h4sio4 0 h2po4 h2aso4 for the gfh adsorbent fig s8 in the supporting information if to quantify the selectivity for the target oxo anion vanadate in comparison to the other competitive oxo anions a selectivity coefficient β t k d t k d c can be introduced where k d t is the distribution coefficient of the target oxo anion and k d c is the distribution coefficient of the background oxo anion pincus et al 2020 selectivity coefficient values of β t 1 2 for phosphate and 2 5 for arsenate calculated from the batch equilibrium data shown in fig 2 with equal equilibrium solute concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 are all above unity and thus demonstrate high selectivity of the gfh towards the target oxo anion vanadate this selectivity can be understood on a theoretical basis if to recall the pearson hard soft acid base hsab principle pincus et al 2020 according to this principle the oxo anions as hard lewis bases electron donors are adsorbed by the iron hydroxide surface as a hard lewis acid electron acceptor the selectivity varies with the relative lewis base hardness which can be assessed by the pk a values of the deprotonation of the respective oxo anion species and suggests the same ranking of pk a 8 75 h2vo4 7 20 h2po4 7 0 h2aso4 3 2 hsdm simulation of the rssct breakthrough curves the hsdm approach used to model the btcs was described in the textbook by worch 2012 several simplifying assumptions were made when developing the hsdm these were that i adsorbent grains occur as spheres of homogeneous composition the h in hsdm ii both linear aqueous phase mass transfer and solid phase mass transfer occur only through surface diffusion the sd in hsdm iii plug flow conditions occur in the adsorbent bed iv the hydraulic loading rate and diffusion coefficients are constant and v adsorption isotherms are used to describe the adsorption equilibrium three essential intrinsic dimensionless parameters of the hsdm the biot number bi the modified stanton number st and the solute distribution coefficient d g define the shape of the btc and are derived from in total 10 operational equilibrium and kinetic input parameters as shown previously for arsenate removal by gfh adsorbent columns badruzzaman et al 2004 sperlich et al 2008 pérez foguet et al 2013 the operational parameters include the adsorbent mass m the filter bed porosity e b the bulk density of the adsorbent grain particles including the inner porosity filled by water ρp the mean diameter of the adsorbent grains determined by sieve analysis d p the aqueous influent concentration of the solute c 0 and the constant volumetric flow rate through the adsorbent column q all these physical and chemical parameters can be measured for the rssct experiment and are compiled in table 2 aim of this research was to reduce the remaining free parameters for fitting of the btcs to only one which is the solute intra particle diffusion coefficient or biot number in our hsdm model adsorbate competition was considered only with regard to the description of the multi solute adsorption equilibrium and the effects of this competition on mass transfer and therefore the adsorption kinetics were assumed at first approximation to be negligible as also suggested by worch 2012 the same single solute mass transfer coefficients were therefore used for all of the oxo anions at first approximation to predict the btcs for the multi solute systems in this respect the method used to estimate the hsdm model parameters was not different from those used previously to estimate parameters for a single solute arsenate or phosphate system sperlich et al 2005 2008 the fixed bed adsorption simulation tool fast v 2 1 www fast software de typical screenshot shown in fig s9 of the supporting information was used to perform the hsdm simulations a simulation iteration typically took a few min when run as four parallel threads on a laptop the bed density and the ebct were calculated using this software code on basis of the hydrodynamic parameters chosen for the experiments table 2 further kinetic hsdm model parameters include the film diffusion coefficient k l and the surface diffusion coefficient d s the film diffusion coefficient influences the slope at beginning of the btc curve worch 2012 the diffusion coefficient for all three oxo anions was fixed at k l 2 5 10 6 m s 1 as first guess this is reasonable because the film diffusion depends on the advective flow rate more than on the solute and the flow rate will be the same for all oxo anions a stanton number st of between 1 1 and 3 0 as the ratio between the rate of transport by film mass transfer and the measured rate of transport by advection used in this study and also by pérez foguet et al 2013 indicates that film mass transfer is slightly faster than advection and therefore not rate limiting this appears reasonable for the relatively fast inflow rate of a vr 2 7 m h 1 applied during the rssct and pilot scale column tests the intra particle diffusion coefficient d s on the other hand strongly depends on the characteristics of the adsorbate and is between 10 16 and 10 14 m2 s 1 badruzzaman et al 2004 sperlich et al 2005 2008 the surface diffusion coefficient may be estimated experimentally for each single adsorbent system by using a differential column batch reactor dcbr test or used as fit parameter in a multi solute system worch 2012 adsorption in the hsdm is commonly described by the freundlich adsorption isotherm c ads k f c 0 n freundlich coefficients are often used as free fitting parameters in hsdm systems for example sperlich et al 2008 suggested that strongly non linear freundlich exponents of n 0 19 should be used for arsenate and phosphate which we adopted here for vanadate the non linearity mimics the limited adsorption capacity that is a necessary pre condition for constructing a btc the freundlich constants were used to differentiate between adsorption affinities of the solutes however the freundlich constant for arsenate was found to be double that of phosphate by sperlich et al 2008 which contradicts our general understanding of affinity series in the adsorption of oxo anions by iron hydroxides just the opposite should be the case as shown in fig 2 and also by the increase of the solute distribution coefficient d g in the order arsenate phosphate vanadate table 3 the cd music model can be used to study competitive effects on the adsorption equilibrium the model can be used to predict freundlich adsorption isotherm parameters but not a langmuir adsorption isotherm model due to its limitation of equal activity of the various v surface complexes the key parameter for a competitive multi solute adsorbate system with a strong adsorbent is the surface saturation effect an adsorbate with a lower affinity tends to be outcompeted by and therefore has a lower saturation level than an adsorbate with a higher affinity to model these data the adsorption isotherms were first simulated using our cd music model for this the equal inflow concentrations for all three adsorbates the adsorbent amounts in the test columns 65 4 g wet weight or 37 3 g dry weight and volume of water treated during the whole rcsst experiment run 50 000 times 51 5 ml bv 2500 l table 2 were used as expected for a strong adsorbent high solute distribution coefficient d g in the order of 105 table 3 the gfh adsorbed almost 100 of all three oxo anions at low concentrations the isotherm slope at low oxyanion concentrations was therefore the same for all the oxo anions and was determined only by the amount of adsorbent present for the total water volume treated at higher concentrations however the oxo anion with highest affinity vanadate in this case may outcompete an oxo anion with lower affinity phosphate silicic acid and arsenate in that order and therefore limit the adsorbent capacity for the latter adsorbates the freundlich isotherms must therefore be strongly non linear with freundlich exponent n 1 to represent the quite different adsorption limits in a multi solute system predicted by the cd music model the exponent was therefore fixed at n 0 19 for all three oxo anions as suggested by sperlich et al 2008 as shown in fig 2a the slope of the curves could not well be reproduced by the non linear freundlich isotherms however the different degrees of saturation in the competitive multi component system could well be represented by the freundlich constants thus predicted they increased in the order arsenate k f 4 phosphate k f 8 vanadate k f 36 according to the order in which the adsorption affinity increased in the competitive multi solute system since fba performance is a combination of adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics the freundlich constants describing adsorption capacity rather than the exponents describing the slope are key parameters for modelling of the btcs by the hsdm approach sperlich et al 2008 worch 2012 the thus fixed hsdm parameters tables 2 and 3 enabled btcs for arsenate phosphate and vanadate to be fitted to the rssct data fig 3 a sperlich et al 2008 and pérez foguet et al 2013 did not report film mass transfer rate numbers but surface diffusion constants and biot numbers only pérez foguet et al 2013 pointed out that film mass transfer dominates when bi 100 and surface diffusion is dominant when bi 102 hence the higher the biot number bi the higher is the rate of film diffusion in comparison to surface diffusion if bi 50 the influence of the film diffusion on the overall adsorption rate becomes negligible worch 2012 in our study the best fit bi numbers were in the range 40 90 table 3 so surface diffusion must influence the btcs the most relatively slow and therefore rate limiting intra particle mass transfer d s 1 10 16 m2 s 1 or 1 10 12 cm2 s 1 caused the btc slope to be smoother for vanadate than for arsenate and phosphate fig 3a element maps of gfh grains indicated that there was an adsorbate distribution gradient throughout the grain interior even after use for 2 y as a fba in a waterworks fig s2 in the supporting information fig 3a shows also that a displacement process takes place leading to a quite different breakthrough behaviour of the three oxo anions as a typical result of competition and displacement a slight concentration overshoot could be observed for the two weaker absorbed oxo anions arsenate and phosphate this effect has not yet been reported in literature but can in principle be explained by their different traveling velocities within the adsorbent column worch 2012 since the traveling velocity depends on the adsorption affinity of the solute the weaker absorbed oxo anion travels faster through the adsorbent column while the stronger adsorbed oxo anion lacks behind later when the stronger adsorbed oxo anion reaches the same layers a new equilibrium state is established resulting in partial displacement of the previously adsorbed oxo anion of weaker affinity as a result of this displacement process the concentration of the latter component becomes higher than its initial inflow concentration except of the vanadate with highest adsorption affinity the other two oxo anions are obviously subject to this displacement process and hence concentration overshoot whereby the weaker adsorbed arsenate shows the overshoot effect first followed by the phosphate a bit later fig 3a unfortunately this overshoot effect cannot be simulated by a model btc which must run asymptotically towards c c 0 1 because of the high initial concentrations of about 10 μmol l 1 the overshoot effect leads to an extensive plateau at about c c 0 1 2 in between 10 000 and 40 000 bvs and levels out after about 40 000 bvs towards c c 0 1 fig 3a 3 3 hsdm simulation of pilot scale column btcs for the three water treatment works the water supplied to water treatment works k and w had similar and relatively high phosphate and silicic acid concentrations and also similar v concentrations but more than twice as high than inflow concentrations in waterworks p table 2 it has previously been found that elevated phosphate and vanadate concentrations in groundwater of the study area are of geogenic source härter et al 2020 the as concentrations in the oxic waters supplied to all three waterworks were relatively low 3 μg l 1 arsenate therefore did not compete with vanadate but phosphate with by one order of magnitude higher concentrations may eventually compete with vanadate the vanadate btcs for the pilot test columns in the three waterworks are shown in fig 3b the btcs were asymptotic so accurate breakthrough times could not be determined from a theoretical point of view the time at c c0 0 05 is conventionally used as the breakthrough point worch 2012 but in practice the time at which the concentration exceeds the relevant regulatory value 4 μg l 1 for vanadate is of most interest all three btcs followed typical trends the outflow v concentration being below the limit of detection 1 μg l 1 at the beginning and then slowly but steadily increasing until the threshold was exceeded at about 30 000 bvs at location w 40 000 bvs at location k and 110 000 bvs at location p the fba service lifetime would therefore be reached at 16 months at k at 7 months at p and only 3 months at w this rather different lifetimes clearly warrant further explanation there is a huge scatter in data for p site which also warrants explanation first of all the sampling intervals were a bit excessively long therefore the data density was not as good as for the other two sites second reason was the relatively low bed height of only 36 cm even though the design parameters were correct ebct and flow rate the relatively low bed height in the pool filter means that the filter bed is more susceptible to short circuit effects if the bed was blocked somewhat by the introduction of turbid substances from the raw water preferred flow channels were formed and an earlier breakthrough occurred if the filter is then backwashed the flow conditions became more even and the adsorption capacity improved again this is a phenomenon that can sometimes be observed in practice also with large fba systems in the case of the pilot filter at site p glitches in the btc at approximately 60 000 bv and at 80 000 bv can be attributed to this backwashing effect all of the water samples were in a similar ph range of 7 4 7 6 table 2 it appears that the different groundwater chemistries at the three selected waterworks affect the btcs and hence the lifetime of the fba test columns however the situation becomes more complex considering the cd music predictions for the freundlich adsorption isotherms for all three sites with their different chemical compositions fig 2b first of all the different concentrations of the co adsorbing solutes like phosphate and silicic acid do obviously not play a role because the freundlich coefficients predicted for vanadate by the cd music model are the same at all three sites k f 3 2 0 05 for n 0 19 the v concentration in the influent water at site p was just half those in the influents to the other two waterworks and this clearly renders the processing capacity at p higher than if it received the same water as the other works in spite of the lowest ebct chosen table 2 however the rather different lifetimes for k and w which received water with similar v concentrations cannot as easily be explained from a chemical point of view the similar co solute concentrations do obviously not play a role the difference in capacity can rather be attributed to the physical difference in dimension of the columns used which gave an ebct twice higher and therefore more favourable adsorption conditions for k than for w the twice longer ebct lower flow rate for k than for w clearly caused the vanadate removal in the presence of competing ions to be much more successful furthermore the adsorbent bed was not homogeneously loaded with v chemical analysis of the adsorbent material after the end of the test runs at site p indicated a vertical concentration gradient and that the maximum v loading was 7 5 mg g 1 dry weight in the topmost bed horizon and the minimum v loading was 2 mg g 1 dry weight in the bottommost bed horizon bahr et al 2019 with an average of 4 mg g 1 dry weight just as predicted by the cd music model fig 2b 4 conclusion the effects of the phosphate and silicic acid concentration ph and ebct on v v breakthrough curves were predicted using the hsdm approach the freundlich adsorption isotherm data required for the hsdm were predicted by the cd music surface complexation model it was set up by adsorption equilibrium data for all oxo anions and then applied on the compositions of the influent water of three different water treatment works the pilot test column btcs for all three water treatment works were predicted well using a unique freundlich constant derived on basis of the multi solute cd music model a single surface diffusion coefficient derived from the rssct column test and therefore the same biot number fixed at bi 37 for all three sites the coupled model approach was thereby demonstrated to predict the individual effects of these parameters on oxo anion removal performance of the gfh it was also shown that gfh removal performance for vanadate is not much influenced by arsenate phosphate and silicic acid contents of the groundwater whereas vanadate may lead to a btc overshoot for the other oxo anions the fba lifetimes for removal of the vanadate are therefore controlled by operational parameters such as the v concentration in the effluent waters and the ebcts rather than the groundwater chemistries moreover our combined equilibrium and kinetic model approach allows any combinations of environmental conditions to be used in scenario models to predict lifetimes of the adsorbent columns the approach demonstrated here can be extended to include other relevant chemicals in water such as dissolved uranium or even organic chemicals provided that the relevant cd music model parameters are available the approach is suitable for predicting equilibrium parameters for hsdm models and reduces the fitting to the kinetic parameters determined by the individual column design the large number of interferences that have to be studied imply that such a modelling approach could help to optimize the designs of factorial experiments to identify the most important interferences and to minimize the number of test columns required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

19983,this study investigated the potential of membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs for mainstream nitrogen removal via partial nitration anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox four laboratory scale mabrs were operated with real municipal wastewater characterized by low concentrations of nitrogen varying between 31 and 120 mg nh4 n l 1 and the presence of biodegradable organic carbon soluble cod scod between 7 and 230 mg o2 l 1 two reactors were operated with different aeration strategies intermittent vs continuous the other two with differences in biomass retention recirculation or removal of detached biomass keeping a constant hrt caused instabilities due to difficulties with setting the optimal oxygen flux for the respective surface loadings 1 6 6 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 operating the mabrs with a constant surface loading 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 resulted in higher and more stable total nitrogen tn removal independent of the aeration strategy the intermittently aerated mabr improved from an average tn removal of 23 69 the continuously aerated mabr from 20 to 50 tn removal independent of the feeding strategy the continuously aerated reactor removed slightly more ammonium 80 95 compared to the intermittently aerated reactor 74 93 limiting the oxygen supply by intermittent aeration proofed successful to favor partial nitritation and anammox continuous aeration did not achieve stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob of the removed ammonium approx 26 were left in the effluent as nitrate only 10 with intermittent aeration recirculation of the detached biomass resulted in reattachment onto the biofilm or membrane surface this recirculation led to significantly higher biomass retention times and thus to better performance removing detached biofilm from the reactor caused a slightly lower tn removal of 33 compared to 45 with reattachment while average ammonium removal was 58 compared to 63 respectively scouring events had a significant impact on the overall operation resulting in short term losses of tn removal capacities of 50 100 the microbial community composition was different depending on the aeration strategy and biomass retention the continuously aerated reactor contained significantly more aob than the intermittently aerated mabr the reactor with biomass retention contained less ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob compared to the reactor with low biomass retention in all mabrs anammox bacteria established in the biofilm after an initial drop in abundance graphical abstract image 1 keywords mabr pn a deammonification intermittent aeration biofilm age sewage treatment 1 introduction the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr concept relies on biofilms growing on a permeable membrane and oxygen supply at the bottom of the biofilm whereas the other substrates i e ammonium or organic carbon are supplied from the liquid bulk phase to the top of the biofilm this so called counter diffusion concept has already been successfully implemented for nitrification and denitrification n dn hibiya et al 2003 satoh et al 2004 and for partial nitritation and anammox pn a in lab scale with synthetic feed and without organic carbon gilmore et al 2013 pellicer nacher et al 2010 however there are no studies yet which have explored mabrs for pn a using real municipal wastewater and test these systems under mainstream conditions i e treating municipal wastewater with low ammonium concentrations 100 mg l 1 and temperatures typically between 10 and 25 c under these mainstream pn a is still a challenge the anammox process is key and requires nitrite and ammonium while at the same time dissolved oxygen do must be absent seuntjens et al 2018 in single stage processes effective oxygen limitation usually protects anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob from oxygen inhibition lotti et al 2015 successful implementation of pn a however requires the combination of aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidation aob activity mostly being the limiting factor when operating systems under oxygen limitation cao et al 2018 lotti et al 2015 joss et al 2009 successfully operated single stage sidestream reactors with continuous aeration at low do concentration 1 mgo2 l 1 in addition a study with municipal wastewater also achieved nitritation with low oxygen concentrations 0 4 0 7 mg l 1 in the aerobic zone while nitrate production was inhibited successfully ma et al 2009 intermittent aeration with low oxygen concentrations can also suppress nob while effectively removing nitrogen from municipal wastewater lackner et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 as nob show significant reduction in performance after periodic anoxic phases kornaros et al 2010 such lag phase phenomena were described by gilbert et al 2014 and supported aob over nob activity when the anoxic phases lasted longer than 15 20 min furthermore the introduction of non aerated phases has shown to enhance the activity of anaob in single stage pn a systems yang et al 2015 however corbala robles et al 2016 determined a reduction in anaob performance during periods of high oxygen concentration using intermittent aeration in municipal wastewater also the cod n ratio can become critical for the implementation of pn a a modeling study by lackner et al 2008 revealed that for cod n ratios of 2 or higher anaob cannot compete with heterotrophs anymore and longer periods 50 days with high cod n ratios cause a loss of anammox activity which can only be restored after long periods of time especially in mabrs with increasing cod n ratios the activity and abundance of anaob decreased steadily and srt becomes key in floc based systems jenni et al 2014 the generally lower growth rates under real conditions disadvantageous substrate availability and temperature require efficient biomass retention biofilm systems are advantages due to their higher sludge ages and less biomass loss however mabr biofilms might be more susceptible to biomass anaob loss because in case of counter diffusion biofilms the anaob grow on the outer side top of the biofilm pellicer nacher et al 2014 this makes them more vulnerable to detachment events lackner et al 2008 the least experience for implementing pn a exists with mabrs so far mabrs were successfully tested using n dn for mainstream municipal wastewater treatment processes downing and nerenberg 2008 semmens et al 2003 feng et al 2007 showed that partial nitritation is achievable using mabr under suitable conditions limited oxygen availability elevated temperature and ph appropriate initial alkalinity with high strength artificial wastewater 250 and 510 mg nh4 n l 1 achieving nitrogen removal via pn a using an mabr system inoculated with conventional activated sludge and charged with low strength synthetic wastewater 50 and 100 mg nh4 n l 1 is possible as reported by augusto et al 2018 the suppression of nob as one of the key factors to successfully operate pn a systems was also achieved with a low strength synthetic wastewater 75 mg nh4 n l 1 by ma 2018 employed intermittent aeration strategies and used modelling tools as well as experimental work to study mabrs for partial nitritation these two studies showed a higher anammox activity under intermittent aeration than under continuous aeration there are no studies yet that explored the applicability of the mabr concept for short cut nitrogen removal neither with pn a nor with nitritation and denitritation ni dni under real mainstream conditions with municipal sewage low ammonium concentrations organic carbon present low temperatures the objective of this study was therefore to explore the feasibility of mabrs for mainstream short cut nitrogen removal processes and to determine suitable operating conditions the main difference to previous studies as mentioned above is the use of real municipal wastewater with organic carbon and low nitrogen concentrations and thus a fluctuating feed composition three aspects were considered and evaluated in detail the feeding strategy constant hydraulic retention time hrt vs constant nitrogen surface load the aeration pattern continuous vs intermittent and the effect of the retention of suspended biomass and detached biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 mabr setup and operation 2 1 1 reactor set up and online measurements four lab scale mabrs supplied by suez suez water

overview over the feed concentration and scod n ratio is given in fig 2 2 1 3 reactor operation table 1 summarizes the operational settings for all four mabrs the reactors operated at room temperature and no ph control was applied in the first 183 days of operation the hydraulic retention time hrt of mabr 1 and mabr 2 was kept constant at 0 5 days comparable to wei et al 2012 after 183 days the feeding strategy was switched to a constant ammonium surface load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 this surface load was adjusted manually with each fresh feed batch by measuring the ammonium concentration of the batch and setting the feed pump to the desired flow rate mabr 1 operated with intermittent aeration while mabr 2 operated with continuous aeration mabr 3 and mabr 4 already started with a constant load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 and ran for more than 183 days both reactors were aerated intermittently identical to the aeration pattern and pressure of mabr 1 the operation of mabrs 3 and 4 started when mabrs 1 and 2 had already been operated for 183 days from this time onwards all four reactors were fed with the same feed composition and surface load aeration of all intermittently aerated reactors mabr 1 3 and 4 was adjusted to the same intervals and pressures scouring events were induced after taking biomass samples for molecular analysis shear force was increased by blowing dinitrogen gas into the bottom of the reactor dinitrogen gas was used instead of air to prevent large amounts of dissolved oxygen entering the bulk liquid phase the biomass detached during scouring was not removed intentionally in mabrs 1 3 and only left the system via the effluent in mabr 4 the detached biomass was almost directly removed with the sieves in the recirculation line see section 2 2 1 2 2 oxygen transfer rate otr the oxygen transfer rates of the clean membranes were determined with tap water in mabr 1 prior to inoculation with biomass sodium

weil am rhein germany further the otr was estimated after some time of operation with existing biofilm on the membranes in all reactors to measure the otr with biofilm on the membrane the outflow

ammonium every sample was filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters before further analysis samples were stored in the fridge at 5 c if not analyzed directly samples for ammonium were acidified 20 μl nitric acid hno3 per 10 ml sample to stabilize the ammonium before storage suspended solids were determined by filtration of the sample through glass fiber filters according to en 872 2005 british

oxygen transfer to achieve pn a through oxygen flux control limiting oxygen availability effective otr control is required the total oxygen transfer through the membrane at defined pressures was first determined without biofilm and in tap water to estimate the otr of the reactor systems the applied inlet pressure ranged from 0 to 0 4 bar relative pressure and the results of these otr experiments are shown in fig si 1 a given relative to the membrane surface area with clean membranes and tap water the otr reached values of up to 8 g o2 m 2 d 1 however the experiments with clean membranes are problematic because several researchers already determined much higher otrs when biofilm was present on the membrane casey et al 2000 jácome et al 2006 lackner et al 2010 shanahan and semmens 2006 under operating conditions with biofilm on the membrane the oxygen transfer rate reached values between 15 and 25 g o2 m 2 d 1 even with low input pressure 0 1 bar the otr was almost double the otr with high pressure 0 6 bar in the clean system fig si 1 b otr tests with backpressure showed a linear increase of the otr the open end configuration showed higher otrs with low pressure compared to the operation with backpressure the relationship between pressure and airflow was proportional the open end configuration showed a significantly higher airflow and a lower oxygen gradient in the gas phase 0 1 bar 5 7 ml min 1 δo2 4 0 2 bar 11 9 ml min 1 δo2 2 25 compared to the operation with backpressure 0 1 bar 1 43 ml min 1 δo2 8 75 0 2 bar 2 7 ml min 1 δo2 8 25 this behavior showed that especially with low pressure the airflow had a significant influence on the oxygen transfer rate important to note is that the reactors did not operate with the maximum possible oxygen surface load of up to 25 g o2 m 2 d 1 the oxygen surface load was lower due to the non aerated phases in the intermittently aerated reactors and low input pressure in the continuously aerated reactor mabr 2 the values were adjusted to fit the respective substrate surface load while keeping the liquid bulk phase anoxic the applied oxygen surface loads for the intermittently as well as the continuously aerated reactors are provided in fig si 2 3 2 reactor startup and operation startup times of 30 days with activated sludge and 20 days with pn a sludge were achieved to reach ammonium removal rates above 80 and this is consistent with other studies augusto et al 2018 using real municipal wastewater resulted in fluctuations of the feed composition the ammonium concentration varied between 31 and 120 mg nh4 n l 1 average 57 mg nh4 n l 1 while the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod varied between 7 and 230 mg o2 l 1 average 82 mg o2 l 1 as shown in fig 2 the scod n ratio varied between 0 13 and 5 5 average 1 44 the readily biodegradable cod rbcod accounted for approximately 60 estimated by comparing the influent scod concentrations to data of the final effluent of the wwtp assuming the scod leaving the activated sludge tank is the non biodegradable fraction overall the average tn removal per surface area and day of 0 5 1 4 g n m 2 d 1 and the maximum tn removal rates of 2 2 g n m 2 d 1 3 4 g n m 2 d 1 with high surface loads in phase 1 reached values comparable to other mabr systems gilmore et al 2013 hibiya et al 2003 the theoretical tn removal via the anammox pathway was estimated considering either aerobic heterotrophs ahet nitrification denitrification n dn or nitritation denitritation ni dni as the sink for scod calculations are provided in the supplementary information these estimates allow some insight into the possible tn removal activity via anammox with the maximum share considering ahet minimum share considering ni dni while the share considering n dn lays in between the calculations didn t consider any internal carbon sources from the biomass n emissions of nitrous oxide via the gas phase or other stripping effects as these parameters have not been measured this results in only a simplified determination of the tn removal via the anammox pathway anyway these calculations allowed for a comparison of the reactor systems within this study under the given circumstances the calculated theoretical tn removal via the anammox pathway up to 1 5 2 0 g n m 2 d 1 proved that denitritation and or anammox occurred in some of the reactors average 72 92 of overall tn removal scouring events in the early phases of reactor operation caused a loss of activity because the biomass had not yet grown firmly to the membrane biomass removal for microbiological analysis might have also contributed to a certain loss in activity 3 2 1 mabr 1 and mabr 2 constant hrt vs constant loading mabrs 1 and 2 were operated with a constant hrt 0 5 days for the first 183 days similar to previous studies that also worked with constant feed flow rates augusto et al 2018 gilmore et al 2013 hibiya et al 2003 wei et al 2012 but also with constant influent concentrations in our case the ammonium 1 6 6 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 and scod 1 9 13 3 g o2 m 2 d 1 surface load varied depending on the composition of the municipal wastewater ammonium removal was relatively high in both reactor systems mabr 1 74 93 mabr 2 80 95 while approximately 50 of the scod average 2 3 g o2 m 2 d 1 in both reactors was removed after the startup phase in both reactors feed batches with very low or high scod and ammonium concentration resulted in an imbalance between substrate loading and oxygen flux especially with lower concentrations oxygen was sometimes measurable in the bulk liquid resulting in the absence of anoxic conditions operating with constant hrt thus caused difficulties in the adjustment of the oxygen flux in relation to the ammonium and scod surface loads this resulted in low tn removal mabr 1 11 31 mabr 2 8 30 as summarized in table 2 due to the low tn removal the feeding strategy was changed to constant surface loads similar to most previous mabr studies all of which worked with synthetic feed with constant inflow and stable concentrations augusto et al 2018 ma 2018 wei et al 2012 from day 183 onwards the nitrogen load was thus kept constant at approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 comparable to gilmore et al 2013 thus the hrt varied between 0 31 and 1 18 days average 0 66 days fig 3 a switching to constant nitrogen loads the overall nitrogen removal performance of both reactors improved significantly leading to higher tn removal rates fig 3 c d with on average 68 in mabr 1 and 40 in mabr 2 before activity loss after day 257 the scod loads still fluctuated from 0 4 to 7 2 g o2 m 2 d 1 as only the nitrogen loads were kept constant this resulted in lower and more varying scod removal between 20 and 60 on average 1 0 g o2 m 2 d 1 for mabr 1 and 0 5 g o2 m 2 d 1 for mabr 2 these results show that fluctuating feed concentrations and flow rates require either a control of the nitrogen load for example by adding process water to buffer low ammonium loads or an automated aeration control system that adjusts the o2 flux according to the substrate concentrations in the first phase the contribution of anammox to the tn removal varied significantly depending on the assumptions for the potential scod sink because of the high scod removal rate in relation to the low tn removal as mentioned above this suggested possibly more tn removal via n dn mabr 1 47 mabr 2 50 or ni dni mabr 1 79 mabr 2 84 in the second phase the overall tn removal rates increased while the scod removal rates decreased thus the estimates of the contribution of anammox to the tn removal were more similar indicating potentially higher anammox activity fig si 8 fig si 9 and less tn removal occurred via n dn mabr 1 11 mabr 2 12 or ni dni mabr 1 18 mabr 2 21 this data however only allows a rough estimation about the potential anammox activity in the mabrs as the calculated removal pathways are influenced by the actual scod removal 3 2 2 mabr 1 and mabr 2 intermittent vs continuous aeration mabr 1 and mabr 2 operated with different aeration patterns which resulted in different behavior and reactor performance mabr 1 was aerated intermittently employing a cycling pattern with a short aeration phase 5 10 min 0 4 bar aeration pressure followed by a nitrogen flush 1 min and a longer non aerated phase 20 25 min the length of the aerated and non aerated phase varied depending on the feed composition to convert as much ammonium as possible and to suppress nob growth and therefore nitrate production mabr 2 was aerated continuously with low pressure 0 05 0 2 bar to limit the oxygen availability for both aeration strategies the aim was a maximum tn removal and with a low use of oxygen therefore the pressure and timings were adjusted to the surface loads resulting in 4 10 g o2 m 2 d 1 for intermittent aeration and 8 16 g o2 m 2 d 1 for continuous aeration fig si 2 the oxygen to substrate ratio was calculated based on the aeration settings and ammonium load fig 3 b due to the variability in the feed composition the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen fluxes in mabr 1 and mabr 2 varied between 0 7 and 5 g o2 per g nh4 n in the first phase days 0 183 from day 183 onwards the nitrogen load was kept constant at approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 therefore the need of oxygen for ammonium conversion was more stable and this made a more sustainable adjustment of aeration pressure and timings possible intermittent aeration resulted in a cyclic change between high oxygen availability and low no oxygen availability at the base of the biofilm which is representatively shown by the off gas oxygen concentration fig si 3 measured directly at the exhaust of the membrane bundle with an immature biofilm these conditions can be monitored in the bulk liquid with ise showing a cycling pattern of ammonium reduction and accumulation depending on the oxygen availability fig si 4 this conversely also applies to nitrate with a mature biofilm the direct effects of aeration were no longer visible in the bulk liquid fig si 5 intermittent aeration seemed to be an effective tool for higher nitrogen removal rates in mabr 1 because average nitrogen removal rates exceeded the nitrogen removal rates of mabr 2 after longer operation 270 days the average nitrogen removal of mabr 1 70 was twice as high as the one in mabr 2 32 the absence of anoxic conditions in the majority of the biofilm caused by continuous aeration might have been one possible explanation for this observation the lack of anoxic phases caused limited potentials for denitritation denitrification and anammox activity and led to an uncontrolled growth of nob and after all unwanted nitrate production with the intermittent aeration the biofilm was completely anoxic at certain times which favored either denitritation denitrification or anammox and at the same time limited nob activity this result coincides with the observations of ma 2018 who operated mabrs with synthetic feed without organic carbon and found that nob suppression occurred under intermittent aeration but not under continuous aeration overall the ammonium removal in the continuously aerated reactor was slightly higher mabr 2 80 92 than in the intermittently aerated reactor mabr 1 74 89 table 2 in phase 1 the tn removal of mabr 1 and mabr 2 was not significantly different 0 4 1 4 g n m 2d 1 and 0 3 1 5 g n m 2d 1 respectively in phase 2 mabr 1 1 4 1 8 g n m 2d 1 outperformed mabr 2 0 2 1 0 g n m 2d 1 in terms of tn removal table 2 in terms of scod removal no significant difference between intermittent and continuous aeration was observable as summarized in fig 4 a b except a longer period for regaining scod removal performance for mabr 2 after scouring on day 257 scouring events had a big impact on the performance as shown by the loss of tn removal activity fig 3 c f especially after the scouring event on day 257 the nitrogen removal performance of mabr 2 could not be restored within a short period the performance of mabr 2 only started to recover towards the end of the experimental phase around day 313 3 2 3 mabr 3 and mabr 4 influence of biofilm age on reactor performance the operation of mabr 3 and 4 started only after mabr 1 and mabr 2 had already been operating for 183 days the feed was provided with a constant load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 with mabr 3 and 4 the focus was on biomass retention and due to the positive experience with mabr 1 these systems were also operated with intermittent aeration employing the same patterns and pressures as in mabr 1 at the respective times the setup i e inoculum biomass and operating time differed from the other reactors which made a direct comparison somewhat difficult mabr 3 operated with a higher biofilm age accomplished by the biomass retention in the system and reattachment of detached biomass in mabr 4 the biofilm age was lower due to sieving and effective removal of detached biomass which prevented reattachment or entrapment of the biomass while the ammonium removal was almost equal in both reactors with 49 79 in mabr 3 and 49 75 in mabr 4 both reactors could not keep up with the performance of mabr 1 78 89 in the same operating phase table 3 the tn removal rate was slightly higher with higher biofilm age with 0 6 1 2 g n m 2d 1 in mabr 3 compared to mabr 4 with 0 3 1 1 g n m 2d 1 table 3 further the average tn removal was higher 40 50 than with continuous aeration in mabr 2 but lower than in mabr 1 after the scouring event on day 257 mabr 4 needed more time to regain its tn and scod removal performance in terms of scod removal there was no further difference between both reactors as summarized in fig 4 c d calculating the potential tn removal via the anammox pathway in mabr 3 and mabr 4 the results show a clear difference between both reactors fig si 8 mabr 3 showed higher tn removal rates through the anammox pathway from the start 0 9 g n m 2d 1 compared to mabr 4 0 7 g n m 2d 1 fig si 9 183 270 days the differences became clearer after prolonged operation because potential tn removal through the anammox pathway mabr 3 increased to 1 0 g n m 2d 1 while mabr 4 remained at the same level fig si 9 270 360 days estimating the percentage share of anammox on the tn removal the values indicated potentially high anammox activity and an almost equal percentage of tn removal via n dn mabr 3 14 mabr 4 15 or ni dni mabr 3 23 mabr 4 25 the amount of biomass in the biofilm was estimated assuming an average biofilm thickness of 500 μm and a biomass density of 40 kg m 3 this resulted in 4 17 g of total biomass in mabr 3 and 4 27 g in mabr 4 with the measured values of effluent total suspended solids tss and sieved solids of mabr 4 the sludge removal 200 mg tss d 1 and approximate biofilm age 120 days were calculated fig 5 within the first weeks after inoculation the effluent tss concentrations were higher due to detachment and washout of inoculum biomass with approximately 38 mg tss l 1 for both reactors fig si 7 from day 230 onwards the effluent tss reduced to 4 5 mg tss l 1 the reactor tss was the same as the effluent tss due to good mixing of the liquid phase and low settling ability of the solids on average the daily sieved solids of mabr 4 had a mass of 0 16 g fig si 7 with these values the sludge ages in mabr 3 and 4 were estimated to maximum values of 148 and 22 days respectively fig 5 the observed difference between the system with high biomass retention mabr 3 and the system with low biomass retention mabr 4 were small ammonium and tn removal of both systems were almost equal 60 70 with slightly higher values for mabr 3 compared to mabr 4 this slightly better performance of mabr 3 could be attributed to the higher biomass age and amount of biomass in the reactor because of the reattachment of detached biofilm additionally mabr 3 showed shorter recovery periods after scouring events which can be attributed to the higher biomass age as well as the reattachment of biomass theoretically systems with suspended biomass retention should have higher tn removal potential as detached biomass can remain in the anoxic bulk liquid performing denitritation denitrification and or anammox divided from the temporarily aerobic biofilm the suspended biomass is not inhibited by oxygen to examine the difference between a hybrid system and a pure biofilm system in more detail the biofilm reactor should be coupled with a suspended sludge reactor in the recirculation line to provide a higher volume for the suspended biomass vs the membrane surface 3 3 biofilm composition the abundance of total eubacteria eub aob anaob and nob i e nitrobacter and nitrospira was monitored using qpcr in all four reactors the microbial community composition in mabr 1 and mabr 2 intermittent vs continuous aeration as well as in mabr 3 and mabr 4 with and without biomass retention evolved similarly in mabr 1 and mabr 2 the abundance of aob and anaob recovered i e reaching values similar to the inoculum after approximately 260 days from their initial drop after inoculation fig 6 nitrobacter showed no clear trend whereas the concentration of nitrospira increased over time in both mabr 1 and mabr 2 data provided in table si 2 the anaob populations of mabr 3 and mabr 4 almost recovered to their initial abundance after around 100 days fig 7 in mabr 3 the abundance of nitrobacter and nitrospira decreased during the reactor operation in mabr 4 nitrobacter and nitrospira behaved differently nitrobacter decreased and nitrospira increased although in all four reactors an initial loss of anaob was observed the operational conditions supported the growth of anaob and allowed the establishment of anaob in the mabr biofilms pellicer nacher et al 2014 observed significant shifts in the microbial community after switching the mabr high nitrogen load without cod from continuous aeration with almost full ammonium to nitrate conversion to sequential aeration resulting in an overall decrease of nob and increase of anaob abundance in the biofilm in this study the different aeration strategies did not affect the abundance of nob and anaob significantly which might have been caused by the oxygen limitation also when aerating continuously but with low pressures the microbial community analysis in this study did not give any information about the spatial distribution of the bacteria in the biofilm analyzing the distribution of the bacteria in the different layers however might provide further insight about the effects of the aeration strategy the detached biomass of mabr 4 was sieved out of the recirculation line and the biomass was analyzed with qpcr on operation day 230 and 357 to compare the microbial community of the detached biomass with the one of the biofilm at the same sampling day the abundance of all analyzed species in the suspended biomass was lower as in the biofilm but with a comparable distribution fig 8 with the exception of the abundance of anaob the anaob abundance was under the detection limit on day 230 on day 357 the anaob abundance was measureable but significantly lower compared to the value in the biofilm this suggests that anaob did not primarily grow on the bulk liquid side of the membrane aerated biofilm but must have been present also in deeper layers closer to the membrane and thereby protected from detachment this observation contradicts earlier simulation results by lackner et al 2008 who experienced high losses of anaob due to the theoretical stratification of mabr biofilms with the anaob mostly on the bulk side the intermittent aeration allowed for an expansion of the anoxic zones to deeper layers of the biofilm during non aerated phases and thereby enabled anaob to establish themselves in these layers and to remain in the biofilm 4 conclusions this study evaluated the feasibility of mabrs for short cut nitrogen removal under mainstream conditions with four lab scale reactors nitrogen removal was affected by several operational parameters in these mabrs our main findings were the achieved ammonium removal was between 70 and 90 and tn removal between 60 and 80 with average tn removal rates of approximately 1 2 g n m 2 d 1 and maximum tn removal rates of 2 g n m 2 d 1 operating the systems with constant surface load of 2 g n m 2 d 1 resulted in a higher and more stable nitrogen removal independent of the aeration strategy operating with constant hrt caused difficulties in the adjustment of the oxygen flux in relation to the substrate surface loads limiting the oxygen supply with intermittent aeration was a powerful tool to reduce nitrate production and to favor short cut nitrogen removal under continuous aeration ammonium removal but no stable nob suppression was achieved removing detached biofilm from the reactor caused a slightly lower overall turnover recirculation of the detached biomass resulted in reattachment to the biofilm surface with recirculation the biomass age in the mabr was significantly higher resulting in a more stable operation the microbial community composition was different in dependence of the aeration strategy although in all four reactors initial loss of anaob was observed the operational conditions favored the growth of anaob and allowed the establishment of anaob in the mabr biofilms scouring events had a significant impact on the overall operation causing a loss of nitrogen removal activity the short and long term effects in dependency of strength and frequency of the scouring events require further research the results of this study show that mainstream pn a is possible with mabrs if the oxygen to substrate ratio can be controlled effectively future research should address the long term effects of periodic scouring to the mabr performance microbial community and sludge production declaration of competing

19983,this study investigated the potential of membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs for mainstream nitrogen removal via partial nitration anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox four laboratory scale mabrs were operated with real municipal wastewater characterized by low concentrations of nitrogen varying between 31 and 120 mg nh4 n l 1 and the presence of biodegradable organic carbon soluble cod scod between 7 and 230 mg o2 l 1 two reactors were operated with different aeration strategies intermittent vs continuous the other two with differences in biomass retention recirculation or removal of detached biomass keeping a constant hrt caused instabilities due to difficulties with setting the optimal oxygen flux for the respective surface loadings 1 6 6 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 operating the mabrs with a constant surface loading 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 resulted in higher and more stable total nitrogen tn removal independent of the aeration strategy the intermittently aerated mabr improved from an average tn removal of 23 69 the continuously aerated mabr from 20 to 50 tn removal independent of the feeding strategy the continuously aerated reactor removed slightly more ammonium 80 95 compared to the intermittently aerated reactor 74 93 limiting the oxygen supply by intermittent aeration proofed successful to favor partial nitritation and anammox continuous aeration did not achieve stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob of the removed ammonium approx 26 were left in the effluent as nitrate only 10 with intermittent aeration recirculation of the detached biomass resulted in reattachment onto the biofilm or membrane surface this recirculation led to significantly higher biomass retention times and thus to better performance removing detached biofilm from the reactor caused a slightly lower tn removal of 33 compared to 45 with reattachment while average ammonium removal was 58 compared to 63 respectively scouring events had a significant impact on the overall operation resulting in short term losses of tn removal capacities of 50 100 the microbial community composition was different depending on the aeration strategy and biomass retention the continuously aerated reactor contained significantly more aob than the intermittently aerated mabr the reactor with biomass retention contained less ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob compared to the reactor with low biomass retention in all mabrs anammox bacteria established in the biofilm after an initial drop in abundance graphical abstract image 1 keywords mabr pn a deammonification intermittent aeration biofilm age sewage treatment 1 introduction the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr concept relies on biofilms growing on a permeable membrane and oxygen supply at the bottom of the biofilm whereas the other substrates i e ammonium or organic carbon are supplied from the liquid bulk phase to the top of the biofilm this so called counter diffusion concept has already been successfully implemented for nitrification and denitrification n dn hibiya et al 2003 satoh et al 2004 and for partial nitritation and anammox pn a in lab scale with synthetic feed and without organic carbon gilmore et al 2013 pellicer nacher et al 2010 however there are no studies yet which have explored mabrs for pn a using real municipal wastewater and test these systems under mainstream conditions i e treating municipal wastewater with low ammonium concentrations 100 mg l 1 and temperatures typically between 10 and 25 c under these mainstream pn a is still a challenge the anammox process is key and requires nitrite and ammonium while at the same time dissolved oxygen do must be absent seuntjens et al 2018 in single stage processes effective oxygen limitation usually protects anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob from oxygen inhibition lotti et al 2015 successful implementation of pn a however requires the combination of aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidation aob activity mostly being the limiting factor when operating systems under oxygen limitation cao et al 2018 lotti et al 2015 joss et al 2009 successfully operated single stage sidestream reactors with continuous aeration at low do concentration 1 mgo2 l 1 in addition a study with municipal wastewater also achieved nitritation with low oxygen concentrations 0 4 0 7 mg l 1 in the aerobic zone while nitrate production was inhibited successfully ma et al 2009 intermittent aeration with low oxygen concentrations can also suppress nob while effectively removing nitrogen from municipal wastewater lackner et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 as nob show significant reduction in performance after periodic anoxic phases kornaros et al 2010 such lag phase phenomena were described by gilbert et al 2014 and supported aob over nob activity when the anoxic phases lasted longer than 15 20 min furthermore the introduction of non aerated phases has shown to enhance the activity of anaob in single stage pn a systems yang et al 2015 however corbala robles et al 2016 determined a reduction in anaob performance during periods of high oxygen concentration using intermittent aeration in municipal wastewater also the cod n ratio can become critical for the implementation of pn a a modeling study by lackner et al 2008 revealed that for cod n ratios of 2 or higher anaob cannot compete with heterotrophs anymore and longer periods 50 days with high cod n ratios cause a loss of anammox activity which can only be restored after long periods of time especially in mabrs with increasing cod n ratios the activity and abundance of anaob decreased steadily and srt becomes key in floc based systems jenni et al 2014 the generally lower growth rates under real conditions disadvantageous substrate availability and temperature require efficient biomass retention biofilm systems are advantages due to their higher sludge ages and less biomass loss however mabr biofilms might be more susceptible to biomass anaob loss because in case of counter diffusion biofilms the anaob grow on the outer side top of the biofilm pellicer nacher et al 2014 this makes them more vulnerable to detachment events lackner et al 2008 the least experience for implementing pn a exists with mabrs so far mabrs were successfully tested using n dn for mainstream municipal wastewater treatment processes downing and nerenberg 2008 semmens et al 2003 feng et al 2007 showed that partial nitritation is achievable using mabr under suitable conditions limited oxygen availability elevated temperature and ph appropriate initial alkalinity with high strength artificial wastewater 250 and 510 mg nh4 n l 1 achieving nitrogen removal via pn a using an mabr system inoculated with conventional activated sludge and charged with low strength synthetic wastewater 50 and 100 mg nh4 n l 1 is possible as reported by augusto et al 2018 the suppression of nob as one of the key factors to successfully operate pn a systems was also achieved with a low strength synthetic wastewater 75 mg nh4 n l 1 by ma 2018 employed intermittent aeration strategies and used modelling tools as well as experimental work to study mabrs for partial nitritation these two studies showed a higher anammox activity under intermittent aeration than under continuous aeration there are no studies yet that explored the applicability of the mabr concept for short cut nitrogen removal neither with pn a nor with nitritation and denitritation ni dni under real mainstream conditions with municipal sewage low ammonium concentrations organic carbon present low temperatures the objective of this study was therefore to explore the feasibility of mabrs for mainstream short cut nitrogen removal processes and to determine suitable operating conditions the main difference to previous studies as mentioned above is the use of real municipal wastewater with organic carbon and low nitrogen concentrations and thus a fluctuating feed composition three aspects were considered and evaluated in detail the feeding strategy constant hydraulic retention time hrt vs constant nitrogen surface load the aeration pattern continuous vs intermittent and the effect of the retention of suspended biomass and detached biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 mabr setup and operation 2 1 1 reactor set up and online measurements four lab scale mabrs supplied by suez suez water

100 μm were used to reduce the load of particulate matter and protect the lab equipment to prevent biological activity in the storage tank the feed was cooled to 6 c and renewed two times per week an overview over the feed concentration and scod n ratio is given in fig 2 2 1 3 reactor operation table 1 summarizes the operational settings for all four mabrs the reactors operated at room temperature and no ph control was applied in the first 183 days of operation the hydraulic retention time hrt of mabr 1 and mabr 2 was kept constant at 0 5 days comparable to wei et al 2012 after 183 days the feeding strategy was switched to a constant ammonium surface load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 this surface load was adjusted manually with each fresh feed batch by measuring the ammonium concentration of the batch and setting the feed pump to the desired flow rate mabr 1 operated with intermittent aeration while mabr 2 operated with continuous aeration mabr 3 and mabr 4 already started with a constant load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 and ran for more than 183 days both reactors were aerated intermittently identical to the aeration pattern and pressure of mabr 1 the operation of mabrs 3 and 4 started when mabrs 1 and 2 had already been operated for 183 days from this time onwards all four reactors were fed with the same feed composition and surface load aeration of all intermittently aerated reactors mabr 1 3 and 4 was adjusted to the same intervals and pressures scouring events were induced after taking biomass samples for molecular analysis shear force was increased by blowing dinitrogen gas into the bottom of the reactor dinitrogen gas was used instead of air to prevent large amounts of dissolved oxygen entering the bulk liquid phase the biomass detached during scouring was not removed intentionally in mabrs 1 3 and only left the system via the effluent in mabr 4 the detached biomass was almost directly removed with the sieves in the recirculation line see section 2 2 1 2 2 oxygen transfer rate otr the oxygen transfer rates of the clean membranes were determined with tap water in mabr 1 prior to inoculation with biomass sodium sulfate na2so3 was used to remove the oxygen from the water bulk before pressurizing the membrane with compressed air at different inlet pressures experiments were carried out with a backpressure of

weil am rhein germany further the otr was estimated after some time of operation with existing biofilm on the membranes in all reactors to measure the otr with biofilm on the membrane the outflow

greisinger gmh3695 with greisinger ggo381 sensor ghm messtechnik gmbh regenstauf germany detailed calculations of the otr are included in the supplementary information 2 3 physicochemical analyses

ammonium every sample was filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters before further analysis samples were stored in the fridge at 5 c if not analyzed directly samples for ammonium were acidified 20 μl nitric acid hno3 per 10 ml sample to stabilize the ammonium before storage suspended solids were determined by filtration of the sample through glass fiber filters according to en 872 2005 british

mixture contained 12 5 μl perfecta sybr green supermix 2x quantabio 5 μl dna template 10 ng μl 1 water pcr grade and 0 5 μl of each primer 10 μm as shown in table si 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxygen transfer to achieve pn a through oxygen flux control limiting oxygen availability effective otr control is required the total oxygen transfer through the membrane at defined pressures was first determined without biofilm and in tap water to estimate the otr of the reactor systems the applied inlet pressure ranged from 0 to 0 4 bar relative pressure and the results of these otr experiments are shown in fig si 1 a given relative to the membrane surface area with clean membranes and tap water the otr reached values of up to 8 g o2 m 2 d 1 however the experiments with clean membranes are problematic because several researchers already determined much higher otrs when biofilm was present on the membrane casey et al 2000 jácome et al 2006 lackner et al 2010 shanahan and semmens 2006 under operating conditions with biofilm on the membrane the oxygen transfer rate reached values between 15 and 25 g o2 m 2 d 1 even with low input pressure 0 1 bar the otr was almost double the otr with high pressure 0 6 bar in the clean system fig si 1 b otr tests with backpressure showed a linear increase of the otr the open end configuration showed higher otrs with low pressure compared to the operation with backpressure the relationship between pressure and airflow was proportional the open end configuration showed a significantly higher airflow and a lower oxygen gradient in the gas phase 0 1 bar 5 7 ml min 1 δo2 4 0 2 bar 11 9 ml min 1 δo2 2 25 compared to the operation with backpressure 0 1 bar 1 43 ml min 1 δo2 8 75 0 2 bar 2 7 ml min 1 δo2 8 25 this behavior showed that especially with low pressure the airflow had a significant influence on the oxygen transfer rate important to note is that the reactors did not operate with the maximum possible oxygen surface load of up to 25 g o2 m 2 d 1 the oxygen surface load was lower due to the non aerated phases in the intermittently aerated reactors and low input pressure in the continuously aerated reactor mabr 2 the values were adjusted to fit the respective substrate surface load while keeping the liquid bulk phase anoxic the applied oxygen surface loads for the intermittently as well as the continuously aerated reactors are provided in fig si 2 3 2 reactor startup and operation startup times of 30 days with activated sludge and 20 days with pn a sludge were achieved to reach ammonium removal rates above 80 and this is consistent with other studies augusto et al 2018 using real municipal wastewater resulted in fluctuations of the feed composition the ammonium concentration varied between 31 and 120 mg nh4 n l 1 average 57 mg nh4 n l 1 while the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod varied between 7 and 230 mg o2 l 1 average 82 mg o2 l 1 as shown in fig 2 the scod n ratio varied between 0 13 and 5 5 average 1 44 the readily biodegradable cod rbcod accounted for approximately 60 estimated by comparing the influent scod concentrations to data of the final effluent of the wwtp assuming the scod leaving the activated sludge tank is the non biodegradable fraction overall the average tn removal per surface area and day of 0 5 1 4 g n m 2 d 1 and the maximum tn removal rates of 2 2 g n m 2 d 1 3 4 g n m 2 d 1 with high surface loads in phase 1 reached values comparable to other mabr systems gilmore et al 2013 hibiya et al 2003 the theoretical tn removal via the anammox pathway was estimated considering either aerobic heterotrophs ahet nitrification denitrification n dn or nitritation denitritation ni dni as the sink for scod calculations are provided in the supplementary information these estimates allow some insight into the possible tn removal activity via anammox with the maximum share considering ahet minimum share considering ni dni while the share considering n dn lays in between the calculations didn t consider any internal carbon sources from the biomass n emissions of nitrous oxide via the gas phase or other stripping effects as these parameters have not been measured this results in only a simplified determination of the tn removal via the anammox pathway anyway these calculations allowed for a comparison of the reactor systems within this study under the given circumstances the calculated theoretical tn removal via the anammox pathway up to 1 5 2 0 g n m 2 d 1 proved that denitritation and or anammox occurred in some of the reactors average 72 92 of overall tn removal scouring events in the early phases of reactor operation caused a loss of activity because the biomass had not yet grown firmly to the membrane biomass removal for microbiological analysis might have also contributed to a certain loss in activity 3 2 1 mabr 1 and mabr 2 constant hrt vs constant loading mabrs 1 and 2 were operated with a constant hrt 0 5 days for the first 183 days similar to previous studies that also worked with constant feed flow rates augusto et al 2018 gilmore et al 2013 hibiya et al 2003 wei et al 2012 but also with constant influent concentrations in our case the ammonium 1 6 6 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 and scod 1 9 13 3 g o2 m 2 d 1 surface load varied depending on the composition of the municipal wastewater ammonium removal was relatively high in both reactor systems mabr 1 74 93 mabr 2 80 95 while approximately 50 of the scod average 2 3 g o2 m 2 d 1 in both reactors was removed after the startup phase in both reactors feed batches with very low or high scod and ammonium concentration resulted in an imbalance between substrate loading and oxygen flux especially with lower concentrations oxygen was sometimes measurable in the bulk liquid resulting in the absence of anoxic conditions operating with constant hrt thus caused difficulties in the adjustment of the oxygen flux in relation to the ammonium and scod surface loads this resulted in low tn removal mabr 1 11 31 mabr 2 8 30 as summarized in table 2 due to the low tn removal the feeding strategy was changed to constant surface loads similar to most previous mabr studies all of which worked with synthetic feed with constant inflow and stable concentrations augusto et al 2018 ma 2018 wei et al 2012 from day 183 onwards the nitrogen load was thus kept constant at approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 comparable to gilmore et al 2013 thus the hrt varied between 0 31 and 1 18 days average 0 66 days fig 3 a switching to constant nitrogen loads the overall nitrogen removal performance of both reactors improved significantly leading to higher tn removal rates fig 3 c d with on average 68 in mabr 1 and 40 in mabr 2 before activity loss after day 257 the scod loads still fluctuated from 0 4 to 7 2 g o2 m 2 d 1 as only the nitrogen loads were kept constant this resulted in lower and more varying scod removal between 20 and 60 on average 1 0 g o2 m 2 d 1 for mabr 1 and 0 5 g o2 m 2 d 1 for mabr 2 these results show that fluctuating feed concentrations and flow rates require either a control of the nitrogen load for example by adding process water to buffer low ammonium loads or an automated aeration control system that adjusts the o2 flux according to the substrate concentrations in the first phase the contribution of anammox to the tn removal varied significantly depending on the assumptions for the potential scod sink because of the high scod removal rate in relation to the low tn removal as mentioned above this suggested possibly more tn removal via n dn mabr 1 47 mabr 2 50 or ni dni mabr 1 79 mabr 2 84 in the second phase the overall tn removal rates increased while the scod removal rates decreased thus the estimates of the contribution of anammox to the tn removal were more similar indicating potentially higher anammox activity fig si 8 fig si 9 and less tn removal occurred via n dn mabr 1 11 mabr 2 12 or ni dni mabr 1 18 mabr 2 21 this data however only allows a rough estimation about the potential anammox activity in the mabrs as the calculated removal pathways are influenced by the actual scod removal 3 2 2 mabr 1 and mabr 2 intermittent vs continuous aeration mabr 1 and mabr 2 operated with different aeration patterns which resulted in different behavior and reactor performance mabr 1 was aerated intermittently employing a cycling pattern with a short aeration phase 5 10 min 0 4 bar aeration pressure followed by a nitrogen flush 1 min and a longer non aerated phase 20 25 min the length of the aerated and non aerated phase varied depending on the feed composition to convert as much ammonium as possible and to suppress nob growth and therefore nitrate production mabr 2 was aerated continuously with low pressure 0 05 0 2 bar to limit the oxygen availability for both aeration strategies the aim was a maximum tn removal and with a low use of oxygen therefore the pressure and timings were adjusted to the surface loads resulting in 4 10 g o2 m 2 d 1 for intermittent aeration and 8 16 g o2 m 2 d 1 for continuous aeration fig si 2 the oxygen to substrate ratio was calculated based on the aeration settings and ammonium load fig 3 b due to the variability in the feed composition the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen fluxes in mabr 1 and mabr 2 varied between 0 7 and 5 g o2 per g nh4 n in the first phase days 0 183 from day 183 onwards the nitrogen load was kept constant at approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 therefore the need of oxygen for ammonium conversion was more stable and this made a more sustainable adjustment of aeration pressure and timings possible intermittent aeration resulted in a cyclic change between high oxygen availability and low no oxygen availability at the base of the biofilm which is representatively shown by the off gas oxygen concentration fig si 3 measured directly at the exhaust of the membrane bundle with an immature biofilm these conditions can be monitored in the bulk liquid with ise showing a cycling pattern of ammonium reduction and accumulation depending on the oxygen availability fig si 4 this conversely also applies to nitrate with a mature biofilm the direct effects of aeration were no longer visible in the bulk liquid fig si 5 intermittent aeration seemed to be an effective tool for higher nitrogen removal rates in mabr 1 because average nitrogen removal rates exceeded the nitrogen removal rates of mabr 2 after longer operation 270 days the average nitrogen removal of mabr 1 70 was twice as high as the one in mabr 2 32 the absence of anoxic conditions in the majority of the biofilm caused by continuous aeration might have been one possible explanation for this observation the lack of anoxic phases caused limited potentials for denitritation denitrification and anammox activity and led to an uncontrolled growth of nob and after all unwanted nitrate production with the intermittent aeration the biofilm was completely anoxic at certain times which favored either denitritation denitrification or anammox and at the same time limited nob activity this result coincides with the observations of ma 2018 who operated mabrs with synthetic feed without organic carbon and found that nob suppression occurred under intermittent aeration but not under continuous aeration overall the ammonium removal in the continuously aerated reactor was slightly higher mabr 2 80 92 than in the intermittently aerated reactor mabr 1 74 89 table 2 in phase 1 the tn removal of mabr 1 and mabr 2 was not significantly different 0 4 1 4 g n m 2d 1 and 0 3 1 5 g n m 2d 1 respectively in phase 2 mabr 1 1 4 1 8 g n m 2d 1 outperformed mabr 2 0 2 1 0 g n m 2d 1 in terms of tn removal table 2 in terms of scod removal no significant difference between intermittent and continuous aeration was observable as summarized in fig 4 a b except a longer period for regaining scod removal performance for mabr 2 after scouring on day 257 scouring events had a big impact on the performance as shown by the loss of tn removal activity fig 3 c f especially after the scouring event on day 257 the nitrogen removal performance of mabr 2 could not be restored within a short period the performance of mabr 2 only started to recover towards the end of the experimental phase around day 313 3 2 3 mabr 3 and mabr 4 influence of biofilm age on reactor performance the operation of mabr 3 and 4 started only after mabr 1 and mabr 2 had already been operating for 183 days the feed was provided with a constant load of approximately 2 g nh4 n m 2 d 1 with mabr 3 and 4 the focus was on biomass retention and due to the positive experience with mabr 1 these systems were also operated with intermittent aeration employing the same patterns and pressures as in mabr 1 at the respective times the setup i e inoculum biomass and operating time differed from the other reactors which made a direct comparison somewhat difficult mabr 3 operated with a higher biofilm age accomplished by the biomass retention in the system and reattachment of detached biomass in mabr 4 the biofilm age was lower due to sieving and effective removal of detached biomass which prevented reattachment or entrapment of the biomass while the ammonium removal was almost equal in both reactors with 49 79 in mabr 3 and 49 75 in mabr 4 both reactors could not keep up with the performance of mabr 1 78 89 in the same operating phase table 3 the tn removal rate was slightly higher with higher biofilm age with 0 6 1 2 g n m 2d 1 in mabr 3 compared to mabr 4 with 0 3 1 1 g n m 2d 1 table 3 further the average tn removal was higher 40 50 than with continuous aeration in mabr 2 but lower than in mabr 1 after the scouring event on day 257 mabr 4 needed more time to regain its tn and scod removal performance in terms of scod removal there was no further difference between both reactors as summarized in fig 4 c d calculating the potential tn removal via the anammox pathway in mabr 3 and mabr 4 the results show a clear difference between both reactors fig si 8 mabr 3 showed higher tn removal rates through the anammox pathway from the start 0 9 g n m 2d 1 compared to mabr 4 0 7 g n m 2d 1 fig si 9 183 270 days the differences became clearer after prolonged operation because potential tn removal through the anammox pathway mabr 3 increased to 1 0 g n m 2d 1 while mabr 4 remained at the same level fig si 9 270 360 days estimating the percentage share of anammox on the tn removal the values indicated potentially high anammox activity and an almost equal percentage of tn removal via n dn mabr 3 14 mabr 4 15 or ni dni mabr 3 23 mabr 4 25 the amount of biomass in the biofilm was estimated assuming an average biofilm thickness of 500 μm and a biomass density of 40 kg m 3 this resulted in 4 17 g of total biomass in mabr 3 and 4 27 g in mabr 4 with the measured values of effluent total suspended solids tss and sieved solids of mabr 4 the sludge removal 200 mg tss d 1 and approximate biofilm age 120 days were calculated fig 5 within the first weeks after inoculation the effluent tss concentrations were higher due to detachment and washout of inoculum biomass with approximately 38 mg tss l 1 for both reactors fig si 7 from day 230 onwards the effluent tss reduced to 4 5 mg tss l 1 the reactor tss was the same as the effluent tss due to good mixing of the liquid phase and low settling ability of the solids on average the daily sieved solids of mabr 4 had a mass of 0 16 g fig si 7 with these values the sludge ages in mabr 3 and 4 were estimated to maximum values of 148 and 22 days respectively fig 5 the observed difference between the system with high biomass retention mabr 3 and the system with low biomass retention mabr 4 were small ammonium and tn removal of both systems were almost equal 60 70 with slightly higher values for mabr 3 compared to mabr 4 this slightly better performance of mabr 3 could be attributed to the higher biomass age and amount of biomass in the reactor because of the reattachment of detached biofilm additionally mabr 3 showed shorter recovery periods after scouring events which can be attributed to the higher biomass age as well as the reattachment of biomass theoretically systems with suspended biomass retention should have higher tn removal potential as detached biomass can remain in the anoxic bulk liquid performing denitritation denitrification and or anammox divided from the temporarily aerobic biofilm the suspended biomass is not inhibited by oxygen to examine the difference between a hybrid system and a pure biofilm system in more detail the biofilm reactor should be coupled with a suspended sludge reactor in the recirculation line to provide a higher volume for the suspended biomass vs the membrane surface 3 3 biofilm composition the abundance of total eubacteria eub aob anaob and nob i e nitrobacter and nitrospira was monitored using qpcr in all four reactors the microbial community composition in mabr 1 and mabr 2 intermittent vs continuous aeration as well as in mabr 3 and mabr 4 with and without biomass retention evolved similarly in mabr 1 and mabr 2 the abundance of aob and anaob recovered i e reaching values similar to the inoculum after approximately 260 days from their initial drop after inoculation fig 6 nitrobacter showed no clear trend whereas the concentration of nitrospira increased over time in both mabr 1 and mabr 2 data provided in table si 2 the anaob populations of mabr 3 and mabr 4 almost recovered to their initial abundance after around 100 days fig 7 in mabr 3 the abundance of nitrobacter and nitrospira decreased during the reactor operation in mabr 4 nitrobacter and nitrospira behaved differently nitrobacter decreased and nitrospira increased although in all four reactors an initial loss of anaob was observed the operational conditions supported the growth of anaob and allowed the establishment of anaob in the mabr biofilms pellicer nacher et al 2014 observed significant shifts in the microbial community after switching the mabr high nitrogen load without cod from continuous aeration with almost full ammonium to nitrate conversion to sequential aeration resulting in an overall decrease of nob and increase of anaob abundance in the biofilm in this study the different aeration strategies did not affect the abundance of nob and anaob significantly which might have been caused by the oxygen limitation also when aerating continuously but with low pressures the microbial community analysis in this study did not give any information about the spatial distribution of the bacteria in the biofilm analyzing the distribution of the bacteria in the different layers however might provide further insight about the effects of the aeration strategy the detached biomass of mabr 4 was sieved out of the recirculation line and the biomass was analyzed with qpcr on operation day 230 and 357 to compare the microbial community of the detached biomass with the one of the biofilm at the same sampling day the abundance of all analyzed species in the suspended biomass was lower as in the biofilm but with a comparable distribution fig 8 with the exception of the abundance of anaob the anaob abundance was under the detection limit on day 230 on day 357 the anaob abundance was measureable but significantly lower compared to the value in the biofilm this suggests that anaob did not primarily grow on the bulk liquid side of the membrane aerated biofilm but must have been present also in deeper layers closer to the membrane and thereby protected from detachment this observation contradicts earlier simulation results by lackner et al 2008 who experienced high losses of anaob due to the theoretical stratification of mabr biofilms with the anaob mostly on the bulk side the intermittent aeration allowed for an expansion of the anoxic zones to deeper layers of the biofilm during non aerated phases and thereby enabled anaob to establish themselves in these layers and to remain in the biofilm 4 conclusions this study evaluated the feasibility of mabrs for short cut nitrogen removal under mainstream conditions with four lab scale reactors nitrogen removal was affected by several operational parameters in these mabrs our main findings were the achieved ammonium removal was between 70 and 90 and tn removal between 60 and 80 with average tn removal rates of approximately 1 2 g n m 2 d 1 and maximum tn removal rates of 2 g n m 2 d 1 operating the systems with constant surface load of 2 g n m 2 d 1 resulted in a higher and more stable nitrogen removal independent of the aeration strategy operating with constant hrt caused difficulties in the adjustment of the oxygen flux in relation to the substrate surface loads limiting the oxygen supply with intermittent aeration was a powerful tool to reduce nitrate production and to favor short cut nitrogen removal under continuous aeration ammonium removal but no stable nob suppression was achieved removing detached biofilm from the reactor caused a slightly lower overall turnover recirculation of the detached biomass resulted in reattachment to the biofilm surface with recirculation the biomass age in the mabr was significantly higher resulting in a more stable operation the microbial community composition was different in dependence of the aeration strategy although in all four reactors initial loss of anaob was observed the operational conditions favored the growth of anaob and allowed the establishment of anaob in the mabr biofilms scouring events had a significant impact on the overall operation causing a loss of nitrogen removal activity the short and long term effects in dependency of strength and frequency of the scouring events require further research the results of this study show that mainstream pn a is possible with mabrs if the oxygen to substrate ratio can be controlled effectively future research should address the long term effects of periodic scouring to the mabr performance microbial community and sludge production declaration of competing

19984,fecal indicator bacteria fib are typically used to monitor microbial water quality but are poor representatives of viruses due to different environmental fate viral fecal indicators have been proposed as alternatives to fib however data evaluating the persistence of emerging viral fecal indicators under realistic environmental conditions is necessary to evaluate their potential application in this study we examined the persistence of five viral fecal indicators including crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and three bacterial fecal indicators e coli enterococci and hf183 bacr287 in large scale experimental ponds and freshwater mesocosms observed inactivation rate constants were highly variable and ranged from a minimum of 0 09 d 1 for pmmov to a maximum of 3 5 d 1 for hf183 bacr287 in uncovered mesocosms overall viral fecal indicators had slower inactivation than bacterial fecal indicators and pmmov was inactivated more slowly than all other targets these results demonstrate that bacterial fecal indicators inadequately represent viral fate following aging of sewage contaminated water due to differential persistence and that currently used fecal indicator monitoring targets demonstrate highly variable persistence that should be considered during water quality monitoring and risk assessment keywords fecal indicator virus persistence water quality pmmov crassphage introduction globally at least 80 of wastewater enters the environment untreated unwwap 2017 and approximately 40 of the united states waterways do not meet the clean water act criteria primarily due to low microbial water quality wade et al 2006 sewage contaminated waters are responsible for more than two million deaths per year globally betancourt et al 2014 microbial water quality monitoring therefore is necessary to protect human health however sewage contaminated waters may contain a large diversity of pathogens including bacteria viruses and protozoa to overcome challenges associated with monitoring all pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli and enterococci are typically used as indicators of fecal pollution in water fib have significant limitations despite their widespread application studies have also shown that fib have differing persistence than viral pathogens in water hjelmsø et al 2017 viruses are predicted to be the greatest source of infectious risk due to exposure from sewage contaminated waters boehm et al 2015 crank et al 2019 viral indicators have been proposed to better represent viruses in sewage contaminated water than fib bibby et al 2019 hjelmsø et al 2017 indicator organisms do not necessarily have to be nonpathogenic they can be any microorganism pathogenic or nonpathogenic that is present in sewage previous studies have investigated human pathogenic viruses such as polyomaviruses hpyv and adenoviruses adv as possible viral indicators ahmed et al 2014 liang et al 2015 however the low concentrations in sewage and varying prevalence by region have limited the suitability of hpyv and adv as viral indicators harwood et al 2013 viral indicators that are both abundant and highly sewage associated have been recently proposed including crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov stachler et al 2017 crassphage is a double stranded dna virus discovered though the cross assembly of unknown sequences of human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 pmmov is a single stranded rna tobamovirus discovered in 1983 to infect peppers wetter et al 1984 both are highly abundant and widely present in wastewater globally but are measured using molecular assays dutilh et al 2014 hamza et al 2011 prior fecal indicator persistence studies have focused on smaller experimental scales ranging between laboratory microcosms to small scale experimental mesocosms less than 100 l ahmed et al 2019 experimental scale may influence fecal indicator marker persistence through multiple mechanisms including altered biological activity and diversity and sunlight exposure additional investigations are necessary to explore emerging fecal indicator inactivation characteristics at scales larger than previously done including emerging viral fecal indicators in addition the environmental persistence of both crassphage and pmmov has been relatively understudied and they have yet to be comparatively studied in the same system the goal of the current study is to examine the inactivation rate constants of emerging viral fecal pollution indicators under representative surface water conditions and compare observed inactivation rate constants with other microbial indicators of human fecal pollution in this study three culturable indicators along with five molecular based indicators were examined molecular indicators in this study do not represent microorganism viability however molecular measures would be directly applied in environmental monitoring purposes crank et al 2019 a large scale pond study and a smaller scale mesocosm study were used to examine fecal indicator persistence wastewater was added to either the test ponds or mesocosms as a representative source of fecal pollution and the concentrations of each fecal indicator were monitored the inactivation characteristics for each fecal pollution indicator will help inform water quality monitoring efforts the development of viral fecal pollution indicators

pumped water supplying the ponds were turned off to allow for a closed system wastewater primary influent samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and released at different points along each pond to reach a dilution of 0 01 previous studies have shown this level of contamination to be close to real world scenarios malla et al 2019 nguyen et al 2016 this level of contamination also helps us understand the benefit of highly abundant fecal indicators such as pmmov and crassphage sodium bromide was also released into each pond to a final concentration of 0 5 mg l

silverman et al 2013 for crassphage and pmmov a pseudo first order inactivation rate constant k u v m2 j 1 can be calculated the depth averaged uv fluence can be calculated by first calculating the average light irradiance at total depth z using the equation employed by silverman et al maraccini et al 2016 silverman et al 2013 i λ z i λ 0 1 10 α λ z 2 303 α λ z i λ 0 s λ where i λ 0 is the wavelength specific irradiance incident on the water surface w m2 α λ is the decadic absorbance of the water matrix z is the path length and s λ is the light screening factor due to the uv meter measurements being a cumulative value for the wavelength range from 280 to 400 nm the equation above was modified by summing s λ to the following i z i 0 280 400 s λ where i z is the average light irradiance at depth z the depth averaged uv fluence j m2 can then be calculated by the following f z i z t a pseudo first order inactivation rate constant k u v m2 j 1 can then be calculated as the slope of the line ln n t n 0 versus the depth averaged uv fluence all inactivation rate constants were calculated using graphpad prism 7 0d la jolla california usa fixing the y intercept to zero statistical correlation between pond and mesocosm pseudo first order inactivation rate constants were performed using two way anova followed by fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test statistical correlation between microbial inactivation rate constants in the mesocosm study was performed using multiple linear regression and two way anova followed by a fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test there were two mesocosms per treatment uncovered or covered each inactivation value from each treatment was used as a variable in the two way anova analysis and each inactivation curve from each treatment was used as replicates in the multiple linear regression to compare between treatments and among microbes k o b s values from the mesocosm experiment were used in the comparison between treatments due to the similar setups water depths and matrices systematic review we performed a short systematic review using search methods described in previously published meta analyses identifying a total of 64 unique inactivation rate constants across the seven different microbes tested in this study table s4 boehm et al 2018 2019 briefly web of science core collection and pubmed were searched in february 2019 the search items used were x and water or seawater or freshwater and persistence or decay or inactivation where x represents one of the seven indicators used in this study details of

assumed to be well mixed wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and added into each pond with wastewater at a 0 01 total concentration samples were collected approximately 0 3 m below the water surface daily at two separate locations in each pond at each sampling time point for water quality characterization and microbial quantification crassphage pmmov and hf183 bacr287 were measured in the ponds because of their high concentrations in wastewater the culturable microbes e coli coliphage and enterococci were tested and not detectable in the pond after 2 h adv and hpyv were not measured in the ponds since they would not be detectable in the ponds based on pond sewage dilution and calculated detection limit sample conductivity and turbidity averaged 0 32 ms cm and 0 08 ntu respectively mean water temperature in the ponds was 24 7 c the ph of initial samples before wastewater release was 8 6 no culturable indicators were detected in the initial pond samples before or following wastewater release in the initial wastewater samples crassphage pmmov and hf183 bacr287 had concentrations of 1 03 109 1 38 108 and 4 26 108 genome copies l respectively crassphage and pmmov were detectable for five and eight days respectively in both ponds fig 1 hf183 bacr287 was only detectable for the 2 h and one day time points so inactivation rate constants were not calculated molecular fecal indicator target concentrations following wastewater release were normalized to a conservative bromide tracer concentration by simply dividing by the concentration of bromide in each sample to account for dilution k o b s and k u v were then calculated based on these normalized values the mean k o b s values for pmmov and crassphage were 0 41 d 1 and 0 98 d 1 respectively table 1 the mean k u v values for pmmov and crassphage were 0 009 m2 j 1 and 0 023 m2 j 1 respectively table 2 mesocosm study mesocosm experiments were conducted from july 31st 2018 to august 28th 2018 four 300 l tanks were filled with 200 l of pond water and two of the four tanks were covered with shade cloth which blocks 96 7 of uva uvb due to the high reduction in incident light by the shade cloth the covered mesocosms were assumed to be in little to no sunlight throughout the experiment wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and added into each mesocosm at a 1 total concentration a single sample was collected daily from each tank for water quality characterization and microbial quantification water conductivity and turbidity averaged 0 34 ms cm and 0 16 ntu respectively the mean water temperature in the covered tanks was 24 2 c and in the uncovered tanks was 26 2 c daily peak uv intensity varied from 3000 to

concentrations were 3 82 106 pfu l 3 20 106 cfu l and 9 67 106 cfu l respectively crassphage and hf183 bacr287 concentrations were 1 93 108 and 4 83 108 genome copies l respectively adv hpyv and pmmov concentrations were 9 98 105 1 57 106 and 2 22 107 genome copies l respectively culturable target inactivation in the mesocosm experiments is shown in fig 2 and inactivation rate constants are shown in table 3 fecal pollution indicator concentrations were corrected for dilution e g rain following initial release using the bromide tracer enterococci and somatic coliphage were detectable for 2 h first sampling time point and two days respectively in the uncovered mesocosms and both were detectable for five days in the covered mesocosms e coli was detectable for two days in the covered mesocosm and 2 h in the uncovered mesocosms inactivation rate constants for enterococci in the uncovered mesocosm and e coli in both the covered and uncovered mesocosms were not calculated as insufficient data was available in the quantifiable range enterococci and somatic coliphage had mean k o b s values of 1 20 d 1 and 0 62 d 1 respectively in the covered mesocosm while somatic coliphage had a mean k o b s value of 1 23 d 1 in the uncovered mesocosm molecular target inactivation for mesocosm experiments is shown in fig 3 and inactivation rate constants are shown in table 3 crassphage was detectable for 10 days in the covered mesocosms and eight days in the uncovered mesocosms crassphage had mean k o b s values of 0 74 d 1 and 1 01 d 1 in the covered and uncovered mesocosms respectively and had a mean k u v value of 0 006 m2 j 1 in the uncovered mesocosm table 2 hf183 bacr287 was detectable for five days in the covered mesocosms and three days in the uncovered

k o b s values of 0 54 d 1 and 1 16 d 1 in the covered and uncovered mesocosms respectively pmmov was detectable for at least 28 days end of experiment for both uncovered and covered mesocosms pmmov had mean k o b s values of 0 20 d 1 and 0 09 d 1 in the covered and uncovered mesocosms respectively pmmov also had a mean k u v value of 0 002 m2 j 1 in the uncovered mesocosm k u v values were only calculated for crassphage and pmmov because they are the only microbes quantifiable after one day in the pond experiments statistical correlation pond and uncovered mesocosm k u v values were compared using a two way anova followed by a fischer s lsd multiple comparisons test to evaluate potential differences due to experimental setup in the pond study pmmov k u v values were statistically smaller than pmmov uncovered mesocosm k u v values whereas crassphage k u v values were not statistically different from crassphage uncovered mesocosm k u v values p 0 1 for crassphage and p 0 04 for pmmov all fecal indicator duplicate k o b s values for the uncovered mesocosm study were compared using two way anova followed by fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test fig s3 all fecal pollution indicators were also compared using multiple linear regression s correlation coefficient to evaluate correlation fig s4 anova results comparing fecal indicator k o b s values are presented in fig s3 anova

showed all viral fecal indicators had significant correlations p 0 05 with each other in the covered mesocosms except for comparison between crassphage and pmmov fig s4 hf183 was significantly p 0 05 correlated with enterococci in the covered mesocosms fig s4 discussion literature comparison of inactivation rate constants for fecal pollution indicators fecal pollution indicator inactivation rate constants in water are essential to inform risk interpretation associated with fecal pollution monitoring in surface water in this study we investigated the inactivation of seven fecal pollution indicators including the emerging viral indicators crassphage and pmmov in order to provide enhanced context for our study results we performed a short systematic review to identify literature value inactivation rate constants across the seven different microbes tested then compared them to the k o b s values determined in this study this systematic review will help us to understand research gaps and recognize best practices associated with performing inactivation experiments boehm et al 2019 we were able to briefly compare hf183 bacr287 and uncovered enterococci values with previous literature but we were unable to develop literature comparisons for e coli in either condition or enterococci in the uncovered mesocosms due to insufficient data to calculate inactivation rate constants in our study enterococci k o b s values for the covered condition in the current study were smaller than five out of the six inactivation rate constants from previous studies in the absence of sunlight fig 4 ranging from 0 130 to 2 4 d 1 ahmed et al 2014 anderson et al 2005 craig et al 2019 eichmiller et al 2014 jeanneau et al 2012 kirs et al 2016 hf183 bacr287 k o b s values in the uncovered mesocosm were smaller than all 16 literature value inactivation rate constants whereas in the covered mesocosm mean k o b s values were smaller than seven out of the nine literature value inactivation rate constants fig 4 ranging from 0 03 to 2 55 d 1 ahmed et al 2014 2019 bae and wuertz 2015 balleste et al 2018 2019 dick et al 2010 eichmiller et al 2014 gilpin et al 2013 green et al 2011 he et al 2016 jeanneau et al 2012 kirs et al 2016 liang et al 2012 walters and field 2009 two previous studies that reported inactivation rate constants for pmmov in the absence of sunlight were identified the current study pmmov k o b s values in the absence of sunlight was smaller than these two inactivation rate constants 0 05 d 1 and 0 053 d 1 hamza 2011 rachmadi et al 2016 literature values on crassphage inactivation in the absence of sunlight were also not available to develop literature comparisons with crassphage in the covered condition in the presence of sunlight however crassphage had mean k o b s values that were smaller than all three inactivation rate constants reported in previous studies ahmed et al 2019 balleste et al 2019 we were able to compare all other viral inactivation rate constants with previous studies done in both the absence and presence of sunlight somatic coliphage adv and hpyv had k o b s values that were slightly smaller not significant than the mean value from the literature review fig 4 ahmed et al 2014 2019 bae and wuertz 2015 balleste et al 2019 chendorain et al 1998 craig et al 2019 elmahdy et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2019 kirs et al 2016 prevost et al 2016 wu et al 2016 when we compared k u v values between pond and mesocosm study we determined pond crassphage k u v values were slightly smaller not statistically than uncovered mesocosm crassphage k u v values p 0 1 and that pmmov pond k u v values were significantly smaller than the mesocosm values the faster inactivation in the current pond study compared to the mesocosm study may be due to multiple factors that can appear with scaling up that can affect microbial inactivation such as microbiota sagarin et al 2016 while biological activity was not directly tested at the different scales scaling up may introduce changes in the microbial community diversity that may not have been present or possible at the lower scales this could also explain why decay in our study was faster than previously observed the model systems in our study were significantly larger and more exposed to the environmental factors than other model systems we used ponds with a volume of 925 000 l and mesocosms with a volume of 300 l whereas previous study approaches have used dialysis bags microcosms and smaller mesocosms 10 20l these results may demonstrate that it is important to not overextend inactivation rate constants from smaller scale studies to larger scale applications the larger inactivation rate constants in the presence of sunlight compared to the absence of sunlight shows that sunlight has an effect on indicator persistence previous studies however do not account for or measure uv fluence in their experiments hence this could also be a reason for the differences between this study and previous literature other physical characteristics such as ph temperature and salinity could play a role in the differences between this study and previous literature comparison however most studies did not report values for all physical characteristics hence we cannot determine the role these parameters play on the differential inactivation rate constants it is important for future studies to report all relevant conditions additional research is also needed to understand how these different physical factors affect the inactivation of fecal indicators under large scale conditions comparison between viral and bacterial persistence a significant motivation for developing a viral fecal pollution indicator is the inadequacy of bacterial fecal pollution indicators to represent viral fate in this study the bacterial fecal indicators enterococci e coli and hf183 bacr287 decayed faster in the uncovered mesocosms compared to viral indicators suggesting that bacterial fecal indicators were more susceptible to inactivation stressors than the viral fecal indicators prior studies have observed similar relationships between viral and bacterial fecal indicators attributed to a number of factors ahmed et al 2019 one factor is the smaller size of viruses that may adsorb to larger particles which can shield the virus from uv radiation rao et al 1984 viruses such as phages e g crassphage somatic coliphage can also be shielded from uv when present in a bacterial host or if host cell debris is adsorbed onto the virus inactivation of viral fecal indicators were also slower than the inactivation of bacterial fecal indicators in the covered mesocosm one previously suggested reason for this is that bacteria are more susceptible to predation than viruses due to the presence of eukaryotes such as protozoa and bacteriophages in surface waters chen and williams 2012 further research into the mechanisms of fecal indicator inactivation is still necessary to interpret the differences between viral and bacterial indicators in addition these results demonstrate the differential fate of bacterial and viral indicators and highlight the necessity of viral indicators to accurately demonstration viral fate in the environment extended persistence of pmmov inactivation of pmmov was significantly slower than all other microbial targets tested in this experiment the pmmov k o b s values between the covered and uncovered mesocosm were also not significantly different p value 0 7186 a potential contributing factor to the extended persistence of pmmov is its single stranded rna genome previous studies have shown dna is more photoreactive than rna hence making rna genomes more uv resistant kundu et al 2004 qiao and wigginton 2016 however a recent study by qiao et al suggested that ssrna viruses such as norovirus have equal resistance to uv degradation as dsdna viruses such as adv hpyv somatic coliphage and crassphage qiao et al 2018 additional research is needed to parse out the differences between these two different types of viruses in more realistic conditions the extended persistence of pmmov could also be due to its long rod shaped protein capsid approximate length of 312 nm which could influence inactivation hamza 2011 kitajima et al 2018 these results demonstrate that the extended persistence of pmmov should be considered during viral indicator evaluation and when including viral indicators into quantitative microbial risk assessment we used a ratio approach to examine the differential persistence of crassphage and pmmov fig 5 the predicted crassphage pmmov ratio varied over orders of magnitude within a week of sewage release highlighting the significantly differential persistence of crassphage and pmmov in aged sewage this analysis also highlights the limitations associated with using only one fecal indicator to assess risk these results also highlight the value of using multiple fecal indicators to assess microbial water quality in a toolbox approach to account for differential fate and inactivation study limitations the primary limitation of the current study is the consideration of a single set of water quality parameters and weather conditions as differing water quality and weather conditions would provide a more complete picture of fecal indicator persistence in addition both crassphage and pmmov have only been applied as molecular indicators to date future research should evaluate how these molecular identifications correlate with viable human pathogens another limitation of the current study is that the majority of the targets used are molecular targets hence there is uncertainty around whether organisms are viable future research should investigate ways to assess viability of molecular targets through the development of culturable assays or the use of propidium monoazide another limitation of our study is the inability to demonstrate mechanisms driving the significant differences between the pond and mesocosm study additional research is needed to reveal how scaling up experiments affects decay the calculations used in this study assumed ponds and mesocosms to be well mixed but this was not directly assessed the final limitation of our study is that visible light was not measured throughout the experiment visible light has been shown to contribute to the inactivation of microorganisms though the reaction with colored dissolved organic matter traving et al 2017 further research should investigate the effects of visible light on these viral fecal indicators and compare them to human pathogens conclusion bacterial indicators hf183 bacr287 e coli and enterococci inactivated more rapidly than viral indicators crassphage hpyv adv somatic coliphage and pmmov demonstrating the importance of including viral indicators in the microbial water quality toolkit pmmov an ssrna virus has extended persistence compared to other viral indicators in water this suggests that the extended persistence should be taken into account during risk and exposure modeling all targets except pmmov decayed faster in the presence of sunlight than in the absence of sunlight emphasizing sunlight as a primary driver of fecal indicator persistence in surface waters ultimately the relative inactivation observed between fib and the promising viral indicators used in

19984,fecal indicator bacteria fib are typically used to monitor microbial water quality but are poor representatives of viruses due to different environmental fate viral fecal indicators have been proposed as alternatives to fib however data evaluating the persistence of emerging viral fecal indicators under realistic environmental conditions is necessary to evaluate their potential application in this study we examined the persistence of five viral fecal indicators including crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and three bacterial fecal indicators e coli enterococci and hf183 bacr287 in large scale experimental ponds and freshwater mesocosms observed inactivation rate constants were highly variable and ranged from a minimum of 0 09 d 1 for pmmov to a maximum of 3 5 d 1 for hf183 bacr287 in uncovered mesocosms overall viral fecal indicators had slower inactivation than bacterial fecal indicators and pmmov was inactivated more slowly than all other targets these results demonstrate that bacterial fecal indicators inadequately represent viral fate following aging of sewage contaminated water due to differential persistence and that currently used fecal indicator monitoring targets demonstrate highly variable persistence that should be considered during water quality monitoring and risk assessment keywords fecal indicator virus persistence water quality pmmov crassphage introduction globally at least 80 of wastewater enters the environment untreated unwwap 2017 and approximately 40 of the united states waterways do not meet the clean water act criteria primarily due to low microbial water quality wade et al 2006 sewage contaminated waters are responsible for more than two million deaths per year globally betancourt et al 2014 microbial water quality monitoring therefore is necessary to protect human health however sewage contaminated waters may contain a large diversity of pathogens including bacteria viruses and protozoa to overcome challenges associated with monitoring all pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli and enterococci are typically used as indicators of fecal pollution in water fib have significant limitations despite their widespread application studies have also shown that fib have differing persistence than viral pathogens in water hjelmsø et al 2017 viruses are predicted to be the greatest source of infectious risk due to exposure from sewage contaminated waters boehm et al 2015 crank et al 2019 viral indicators have been proposed to better represent viruses in sewage contaminated water than fib bibby et al 2019 hjelmsø et al 2017 indicator organisms do not necessarily have to be nonpathogenic they can be any microorganism pathogenic or nonpathogenic that is present in sewage previous studies have investigated human pathogenic viruses such as polyomaviruses hpyv and adenoviruses adv as possible viral indicators ahmed et al 2014 liang et al 2015 however the low concentrations in sewage and varying prevalence by region have limited the suitability of hpyv and adv as viral indicators harwood et al 2013 viral indicators that are both abundant and highly sewage associated have been recently proposed including crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov stachler et al 2017 crassphage is a double stranded dna virus discovered though the cross assembly of unknown sequences of human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 pmmov is a single stranded rna tobamovirus discovered in 1983 to infect peppers wetter et al 1984 both are highly abundant and widely present in wastewater globally but are measured using molecular assays dutilh et al 2014 hamza et al 2011 prior fecal indicator persistence studies have focused on smaller experimental scales ranging between laboratory microcosms to small scale experimental mesocosms less than 100 l ahmed et al 2019 experimental scale may influence fecal indicator marker persistence through multiple mechanisms including altered biological activity and diversity and sunlight exposure additional investigations are necessary to explore emerging fecal indicator inactivation characteristics at scales larger than previously done including emerging viral fecal indicators in addition the environmental persistence of both crassphage and pmmov has been relatively understudied and they have yet to be comparatively studied in the same system the goal of the current study is to examine the inactivation rate constants of emerging viral fecal pollution indicators under representative surface water conditions and compare observed inactivation rate constants with other microbial indicators of human fecal pollution in this study three culturable indicators along with five molecular based indicators were examined molecular indicators in this study do not represent microorganism viability however molecular measures would be directly applied in environmental monitoring purposes crank et al 2019 a large scale pond study and a smaller scale mesocosm study were used to examine fecal indicator persistence wastewater was added to either the test ponds or mesocosms as a representative source of fecal pollution and the concentrations of each fecal indicator were monitored the inactivation characteristics for each fecal pollution indicator will help inform water quality monitoring efforts the development of viral fecal pollution indicators

prevent seepage into groundwater the pond was filled with groundwater two years prior to the start of experiment then allowed to remain exposed to the environment prior to the start of this study all pumped water supplying the ponds were turned off to allow for a closed system wastewater primary influent samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and released at different points along each pond to reach a dilution of 0 01 previous studies have shown this level of contamination to be close to real world scenarios malla et al 2019 nguyen et al 2016 this level of contamination also helps us understand the benefit of highly abundant fecal indicators such as pmmov and crassphage sodium bromide was also released into each pond to a final concentration of 0 5 mg l

curves from both the pond and mesocosm study were fit to a first order decay model n t n 0 e k o b s t where k o b s d 1 can be calculated as the slope of the regression line ln n t n 0 versus time silverman et al 2013 for crassphage and pmmov a pseudo first order inactivation rate constant k u v m2 j 1 can be calculated the depth averaged uv fluence can be calculated by first calculating the average light irradiance at total depth z using the equation employed by silverman et al maraccini et al 2016 silverman et al 2013 i λ z i λ 0 1 10 α λ z 2 303 α λ z i λ 0 s λ where i λ 0 is the wavelength specific irradiance incident on the water surface w m2 α λ is the decadic absorbance of the water matrix z is the path length and s λ is the light screening factor due to the uv meter measurements being a cumulative value for the wavelength range from 280 to 400 nm the equation above was modified by summing s λ to the following i z i 0 280 400 s λ where i z is the average light irradiance at depth z the depth averaged uv fluence j m2 can then be calculated by the following f z i z t a pseudo first order inactivation rate constant k u v m2 j 1 can then be calculated as the slope of the line ln n t n 0 versus the depth averaged uv fluence all inactivation rate constants were calculated using graphpad prism 7 0d la jolla california usa fixing the y intercept to zero statistical correlation between pond and mesocosm pseudo first order inactivation rate constants were performed using two way anova followed by fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test statistical correlation between microbial inactivation rate constants in the mesocosm study was performed using multiple linear regression and two way anova followed by a fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test there were two mesocosms per treatment uncovered or covered each inactivation value from each treatment was used as a variable in the two way anova analysis and each inactivation curve from each treatment was used as replicates in the multiple linear regression to compare between treatments and among microbes k o b s values from the mesocosm experiment were used in the comparison between treatments due to the similar setups water depths and matrices systematic review we performed a short systematic review using search methods described in previously published meta analyses identifying a total of 64 unique inactivation rate constants across the seven different microbes tested in this study table s4 boehm et al 2018 2019 briefly web of science core collection and pubmed were searched in february 2019 the search items used were x and water or seawater or freshwater and persistence or decay or inactivation where x represents one of the seven indicators used in this study details of the review process are provided in the si results pond study pond persistence experiments were completed in two experimental closed system 925 m3 ponds from july 31st to august 28th 2018 system was assumed to be well mixed wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and added into each pond with wastewater at a 0 01 total concentration samples were collected approximately 0 3 m below the water surface daily at two separate locations in each pond at each sampling time point for water quality characterization and microbial quantification crassphage pmmov and hf183 bacr287 were measured in the ponds because of their high concentrations in wastewater the culturable microbes e coli coliphage and enterococci were tested and not detectable in the pond after 2 h adv and hpyv were not measured in the ponds since they would not be detectable in the ponds based on pond sewage dilution and calculated detection limit sample conductivity and turbidity averaged 0 32 ms cm and 0 08 ntu respectively mean water temperature in the ponds was 24 7 c the ph of initial samples before wastewater release was 8 6 no culturable indicators were detected in the initial pond samples before or following wastewater release in the initial wastewater samples crassphage pmmov and hf183 bacr287 had concentrations of 1 03 109 1 38 108 and 4 26 108 genome copies l respectively crassphage and pmmov were detectable for five and eight days respectively in both ponds fig 1 hf183 bacr287 was only detectable for the 2 h and one day time points so inactivation rate constants were not calculated molecular fecal indicator target concentrations following wastewater release were normalized to a conservative bromide tracer concentration by simply dividing by the concentration of bromide in each sample to account for dilution k o b s and k u v were then calculated based on these normalized values the mean k o b s values for pmmov and crassphage were 0 41 d 1

31st 2018 to august 28th 2018 four 300 l tanks were filled with 200 l of pond water and two of the four tanks were covered with shade cloth which blocks 96 7 of uva uvb due to the high reduction in incident light by the shade cloth the covered mesocosms were assumed to be in little to no sunlight throughout the experiment wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and added into each mesocosm at a 1 total concentration a single sample was collected daily from each tank for water quality characterization and microbial quantification water conductivity and

in table 3 fecal pollution indicator concentrations were corrected for dilution e g rain following initial release using the bromide tracer enterococci and somatic coliphage were detectable for 2 h first sampling time point and two days respectively in the uncovered mesocosms and both were detectable for five days in the covered mesocosms e coli was detectable for two days in the covered mesocosm and 2 h in the uncovered mesocosms inactivation rate constants for enterococci in the uncovered mesocosm and e coli in both the covered and uncovered mesocosms were not calculated as insufficient data was available in the quantifiable range enterococci and somatic coliphage had mean k o b s values of 1 20 d 1 and 0 62 d 1 respectively in the covered mesocosm while somatic

had mean k o b s values of 0 20 d 1 and 0 09 d 1 in the covered and uncovered mesocosms respectively pmmov also had a mean k u v value of 0 002 m2 j 1 in the uncovered mesocosm k u v values were only calculated for crassphage and pmmov because they are the only microbes quantifiable after one day in the pond experiments statistical correlation pond and uncovered mesocosm k u v values were compared using a two way anova followed by a fischer s lsd multiple comparisons test to evaluate potential differences due to experimental setup in the pond study pmmov k u v values were statistically smaller than pmmov uncovered mesocosm k u v values whereas crassphage k u v values were not statistically different from crassphage uncovered mesocosm k u v values p 0 1 for crassphage and p 0 04 for pmmov all fecal indicator duplicate k o b s values for the uncovered mesocosm study were compared using two way anova followed by fisher s lsd multiple comparisons test fig s3 all fecal pollution indicators were also compared using multiple linear regression s correlation coefficient to evaluate correlation fig s4 anova results comparing fecal indicator k o b s values are presented in fig s3 anova results showed that hpyv crassphage and somatic coliphage k o b s values were not significantly different in the uncovered mesocosms p 0 05 however all other comparisons between microbial k o b s values in the uncovered mesocosm had significant differences p 0 05 multiple linear regression results of the uncovered mesocosms showed hpyv crassphage and somatic coliphage were significantly correlated p 0 05 with each other and adv fig s4 multiple linear regression results also showed pmmov and hf183 to be significantly different from each other and the other viral indicators in the uncovered mesocosms fig s4 in the covered mesocosms anova did not identify significant differences between crassphage hpyv adv and somatic coliphage k o b s values and enterococci and hf183 bacr287 k o b s values pmmov was statistically different from adv crassphage hf183 bacr287 and enterococci but not statistically different from somatic coliphage and hpyv multiple linear regression results showed all viral fecal indicators had significant correlations p 0 05 with each other in the covered mesocosms except for comparison between crassphage and pmmov fig s4 hf183 was significantly p 0 05 correlated with enterococci in the covered mesocosms fig s4 discussion literature comparison of inactivation rate constants for fecal pollution indicators fecal pollution indicator inactivation rate constants in water are essential to inform risk interpretation associated with fecal pollution monitoring in surface water in this study we investigated the inactivation of seven fecal pollution indicators including the emerging viral indicators crassphage and pmmov in order to provide enhanced context for our study results we performed a short systematic review to identify literature value inactivation rate constants across the seven different microbes tested then compared them to the k o b s values determined in this study this systematic review will help us to understand research gaps and recognize best practices associated with performing inactivation experiments boehm et al 2019 we were able to briefly compare hf183 bacr287 and uncovered enterococci values with previous literature but we were unable to develop literature comparisons for e coli in either condition or enterococci in the uncovered mesocosms due to insufficient data to calculate inactivation rate constants in our study enterococci k o b s values for the covered condition in the current study were smaller than five out of the six inactivation rate constants from previous studies in the absence of sunlight fig 4 ranging from 0 130 to 2 4 d 1 ahmed et al 2014 anderson et al 2005 craig et al 2019 eichmiller et al 2014 jeanneau et al 2012 kirs et al 2016 hf183 bacr287 k o b s values in the uncovered mesocosm were smaller than all 16 literature value inactivation rate constants whereas in the covered mesocosm mean k o b s values were smaller than seven out of the nine literature value inactivation rate constants fig 4 ranging from 0 03 to 2 55 d 1 ahmed et al 2014 2019 bae and wuertz 2015 balleste et al 2018 2019 dick et al 2010 eichmiller et al 2014 gilpin et al 2013 green et al 2011 he et al 2016 jeanneau et al 2012 kirs et al 2016 liang et al 2012 walters and field 2009 two previous studies that reported inactivation rate constants for pmmov in the absence of sunlight were identified the current study pmmov k o b s values in the absence of sunlight was smaller than these two inactivation rate constants 0 05 d 1 and 0 053 d 1 hamza 2011 rachmadi et al 2016 literature values on crassphage inactivation in the absence of sunlight were also not available to develop literature comparisons with crassphage in the covered condition in the presence of sunlight however crassphage had mean k o b s values that were smaller than all three inactivation rate constants reported in previous studies ahmed et al 2019 balleste et al 2019 we were able to compare all other viral inactivation rate constants with previous studies done in both the absence and presence of sunlight somatic coliphage adv and hpyv had k o b s values that were slightly smaller not significant than the mean value from the literature review fig 4 ahmed et al 2014 2019 bae and wuertz 2015 balleste et al 2019 chendorain et al 1998 craig et al 2019 elmahdy et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2019 kirs et al 2016 prevost et al 2016 wu et al 2016 when we compared k u v values between pond and mesocosm study we determined pond crassphage k u v values were slightly smaller not statistically than uncovered mesocosm crassphage k u v values p 0 1 and that pmmov pond k u v values were significantly smaller than the mesocosm values the faster inactivation in the current pond study compared to the mesocosm study may be due to multiple factors that can appear with scaling up that can affect microbial inactivation such as microbiota sagarin et al 2016 while biological activity was not directly tested at the different scales scaling up may introduce changes in the microbial community diversity that may not have been present or possible at the lower scales this could also explain why decay in our study was faster than previously observed the model systems in our study were significantly larger and more exposed to the environmental factors than other model systems we used ponds with a volume of 925 000 l and mesocosms with a volume of 300 l whereas previous study approaches have used dialysis bags microcosms and smaller mesocosms 10 20l these results may demonstrate that it is important to not overextend inactivation rate constants from smaller scale studies to larger scale applications the larger inactivation rate constants in the presence of sunlight compared to the absence of sunlight shows that sunlight has an effect on indicator persistence previous studies however do not account for or measure uv fluence in their experiments hence this could also be a reason for the differences between this study and previous literature other physical characteristics such as ph temperature and salinity could play a role in the differences between this study and previous literature comparison however most studies did not report values for all physical characteristics hence we cannot determine the role these parameters play on the differential inactivation rate constants it is important for future studies to report all relevant conditions additional research is also needed to understand how these different physical factors affect the inactivation of fecal indicators under large scale conditions comparison between viral and bacterial persistence a significant motivation for developing a viral fecal pollution indicator is the inadequacy of bacterial fecal pollution indicators to represent viral fate in this study the bacterial fecal indicators enterococci e coli and hf183 bacr287 decayed faster in the uncovered mesocosms compared to viral indicators suggesting that bacterial fecal indicators were more susceptible to inactivation stressors than the viral fecal indicators prior studies have observed similar relationships between viral and bacterial fecal indicators attributed to a number of factors ahmed et al 2019 one factor is the smaller size of viruses that may adsorb to larger particles which can shield the virus from uv radiation rao et al 1984 viruses such as phages e g crassphage somatic coliphage can also be shielded from uv when present in a bacterial host or if host cell debris is adsorbed onto the virus inactivation of viral fecal indicators were also slower than the inactivation of bacterial fecal indicators in the covered mesocosm one previously suggested reason for this is that bacteria are more susceptible to predation than viruses due to the presence of eukaryotes such as protozoa and bacteriophages in surface waters chen and williams 2012 further research into the mechanisms of fecal indicator inactivation is still necessary to interpret the differences between viral and bacterial indicators in addition these results demonstrate the differential fate of bacterial and viral indicators and highlight the necessity of viral indicators to accurately demonstration viral fate in the environment extended persistence of pmmov inactivation of pmmov was significantly slower than all other microbial targets tested in this experiment the pmmov k o b s values between the covered and uncovered mesocosm were also not significantly different p value 0 7186 a potential contributing factor to the extended persistence of pmmov is its single stranded rna genome previous studies have shown dna is more photoreactive than rna hence making rna genomes more uv resistant kundu et al 2004 qiao and wigginton 2016 however a recent study by qiao et al suggested that ssrna viruses such as norovirus have equal resistance to uv degradation as dsdna viruses such as adv hpyv somatic coliphage and crassphage qiao et al 2018 additional research is needed to parse out the differences between these two different types of viruses in more realistic conditions the extended persistence of pmmov could also be due to its long rod shaped protein capsid approximate length of 312 nm which could influence inactivation hamza 2011 kitajima et al 2018 these results demonstrate that the extended persistence of pmmov should be considered during viral indicator evaluation and when including viral indicators into quantitative microbial risk assessment we used a ratio approach to examine the differential persistence of crassphage and pmmov fig 5 the predicted crassphage pmmov ratio varied over orders of magnitude within a week of sewage release highlighting the significantly differential persistence of crassphage and pmmov in aged sewage this analysis also highlights the limitations associated with using only one fecal indicator to assess risk these results also highlight the value of using multiple fecal indicators to assess microbial water quality in a toolbox approach to account for differential fate and inactivation study limitations the primary limitation of the current study is the consideration of a single set of water quality parameters and weather conditions as differing water quality and weather conditions would provide a more complete picture of fecal indicator persistence in addition both crassphage and pmmov have only been applied as molecular indicators to date future research should evaluate how these molecular identifications correlate with viable human pathogens another limitation of the current study is that the majority of the targets used are molecular targets hence there is uncertainty around whether organisms are viable future research should investigate ways to assess viability of molecular targets through the development of culturable assays or the use of propidium monoazide another limitation of our study is the inability to demonstrate mechanisms driving the significant differences between the pond and mesocosm study additional research is needed to reveal how scaling up experiments affects decay the calculations used in this study assumed ponds and mesocosms to be well mixed but this was not directly assessed the final limitation of our study is that visible light was not measured throughout the experiment visible light has been shown to contribute to the inactivation of microorganisms though the reaction with colored dissolved organic matter traving et al 2017 further research should investigate the effects of visible light on these viral fecal indicators and compare them to human pathogens conclusion bacterial indicators hf183 bacr287 e coli and enterococci inactivated more rapidly than viral indicators crassphage hpyv adv somatic coliphage and pmmov demonstrating the importance of including viral indicators in the microbial water quality toolkit pmmov an ssrna virus has extended persistence compared to other viral indicators in water this suggests that the extended persistence should be taken into account during risk and exposure modeling all targets except pmmov decayed faster in the presence of sunlight than in the absence of sunlight emphasizing sunlight as a primary driver of fecal indicator persistence in surface waters ultimately the relative inactivation observed between fib and the promising viral indicators used in this study will help develop each fecal pollution indicator for use in microbial water quality assessment improving risk of infection analysis for fecal contaminated waters declaration of competing
