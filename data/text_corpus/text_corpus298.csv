1490,sorption of pharmaceuticals which can occur in soils may differ when present in a soil solution as a single compound or in a solution with other pharmaceuticals therefore the sorption isotherms described by the freundlich equations were evaluated for 6 compounds which were applied in solutions of a single pharmaceutical two pharmaceuticals or all pharmaceuticals to seven soils study mainly focused on a behavior of fexofenadine and irbesartan that occurred in soils in 3 forms cationic zwitter ionic or neutral anionic sorption of both compounds slightly increased in some soils when applied together largely increased when applied with carbamazepine neutral and extremely increased when applied in solutions with citalopram strongly sorbed cation which could be explained by a cooperative multilayer sorption on soil constituents on the other hand sorption of both compounds moderately decreased when applied with clindamycin cation and neutral or sulfamethoxazole neutral or anion the magnitude of an increase or decrease in the freundlich sorption coefficient kf for a particular compound depended on soil conditions a form of compound s molecule and its interaction with molecules of other compounds despite sorption being influenced by other compound s in solution the kf coefficients evaluated for a particular compound under the different conditions were mostly correlated with the same soil properties kf car with an organic carbon content kf cit and kf cli with a base cation saturation kf sul with hydrolytic acidity and kf fex and kf irb with sorption complex saturation keywords soil types pharmaceuticals sorption single solute bi solute penta solute solution cooperative multilayer sorption 1 introduction the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has become one of the new environmental threats there are several sources of these compounds and various pathways by which they may pollute the environment due to incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants e g fedorova et al 2014 golovko et al 2014 loos et al 2013 these compounds can contaminate surface water e g cunha et al 2017 de jongh et al 2012 fram and belitz 2011 kruc et al 2019 radovic et al 2015 from which these contaminants can consequently migrate into groundwater through river banks e g de jongh et al 2012 kruc et al 2019 radovic et al 2015 the most frequent pathways of human pharmaceuticals directly contaminating soil and groundwaters is via leakage of wastewaters from sewage systems and from using treated wastewater and sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants for irrigation and soil amendment respectively e g al farsi et al 2017 ivanová et al 2018 kodešová et al 2019b mathews and reinhold 2013 verlicchi and zambello 2015 veterinary pharmaceuticals can enter the water environment directly from animal urine or after application of farm waste to soils e g charuaud et al 2019 pharmaceuticals in soils can be consequently taken up by plants e g goldstein et al 2014 hurtado et al 2016 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a 2019b malchi et al 2014 montemurro et al 2017 mordechay et al 2018 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2013 the mobility of these contaminants in soil and groundwater and their availability for plants is largely controlled by their sorption onto soils and sediments e g brunetti et al 2019 the sorption of a particular compound onto a tested material is governed by the physical chemical properties of the sorbate and sorbent and their solution properties schaffer and licha 2015 pharmaceuticals occur in the environment in different forms i e neutral cationic anionic or zwitter ionic the form of the compound s molecule is determined by its pka value and the ph value of the solution the sorption mechanisms hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions depend on the form of the compound s molecule pharmaceuticals occur in the environment in solutions with other organic and inorganic substances the sorption of pharmaceuticals onto solids can be either negatively or positively influenced due to their competition for the same sorption sites or synergy respectively knowledge of actual sorption behaviors of compounds in their mixtures is crucial for many environmental applications as risk assessments related to their migration in the vadose zone pollution of drinking water resources crop and consequently food contamination etc nevertheless in many of these studies sorption behavior is frequently estimated using models developed for neutral organic compounds as pesticides that insufficiently describe reality carter et al 2020 li et al 2020 in addition modified sorption in multiple solute solutions which can either increase or decrease mobility and availability is usually neglected studies focused on the simultaneous sorption of two or more pharmaceuticals in soils are rare and provide relatively insufficient and inconsistent information about the behavior of different molecules in these materials for instance a noncompetitive sorption between the two anionic statin drugs atorvastatin and simvastatin acid onto silty sand soil peat river sediment and biosolids was reported by ottmar et al 2010 a mixture of anionic molecules of sulfonamides sulfadimethoxine and sulfaguanidine also had a negligible effect on their behavior in tested soils in a study by maszkowska et al 2013 the apparent competition between diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen anionic molecules in two and three solute systems sorption in two biochars was documented by jung et al 2015 on the other hand zhang et al 2017 observed slight synergic effect of simultaneous applications of ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac anionic molecules on their sorption affinity in a loam texture soil oh et al 2016 found that salicylic acid enhanced the sorption of sulfamethoxazole to sediments competition between bisphenol a and carbamazepine unionized molecules and no competition between phenanthrene on carbamazepine sorption onto single walled carbon nanotubes was observed by lerman et al 2013 the strong competition between the sorption of three fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin ofloxacin and norfloxacin i e zwitter ionic compounds in a silty clay loam was reported by conkle et al 2010 the competitive sorption was also observed between ciprofloxacin cationic zwitter ionic anionic and sulfadiazine cationic neutral anionic onto two clays montmorillonite and kaolinite by septian et al 2019 competitive behavior was also found for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline zwitter ionic anionic in montmorillonite by wu et al 2019 martínez costa et al 2018 reported competitive sorption of sulfamethoxazole anionic and trimethoprim cationic and neutral on a hybrid clay nanosorbent competitive sorption onto biochars was documented for ketoprofen and triclosan neutral and anionic by wu et al 2017 our two previous studies kočárek et al 2016 fér et al 2018 carried out for 4 pharmaceuticals and soil samples taken from different horizons of 3 soil types showed that sorption of positively charged atenolol did not differ when applied separately or in solution with other 3 compounds the sorption of trimethoprim cation and neutral sulfamethoxazole anion decreased and increased respectively the sorption of carbamazepine was lower in 4 compound solutions kočárek et al 2016 but was higher in 3 compound without trimethoprim solutions fér et al 2018 it is apparent that molecules of pharmaceuticals which occur in the environment in different forms may differently influence each other in their sorption onto various materials while for instance an influence of cations inorganic or organic on sorption of organic cations or anions in soils which can be competitive or cooperative respectively or a mutual effect of two or more organic compounds in similar forms on their sorption behavior which can be competitive was to some degree revealed a behavior of compounds that depending on soil conditions may occur in 3 different forms in multiple solute systems has not been fully discovered in addition influences of various organic molecules on sorption of organic molecules in zwitter ionic forms in soils has not been wholly revealed studies by conkle et al 2010 septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 mostly proved competitive behavior of tested compounds under limited soil or clay conditions our previous study for fexofenadine fex and irbesartan irb which may occur in the environment in 3 forms cation zwitter ion or neutral and anion showed that their sorption in soils was negatively influenced by the base cation saturation and positively to the hydrolytic acidity klement et al 2018 similarly sorption of sulfamethoxazole neutral and anion was negatively related to the base cation saturation and positively to the hydrolytic acidity kodešová et al 2015 and its sorption increased in some soils when simultaneously sorbed with positively charged compounds fér et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 therefore in this new study it has been hypothesized that sorption of fex and irb can be also positively affected by cationic molecules it has been also hypothesized that sorption of these two compounds can decrease due to their competition with each other and due to competition with molecules in similar forms to prove these hypotheses the following four pharmaceuticals were in addition selected citalopram cit cation clindamycin cli cation and neutral carbamazepine car neutral and sulfamethoxazole sul neutral anion the aim was to reveal the overall behavior of these two pharmaceuticals in very different soils how these two compounds influence each other in their sorption affinities to reveal how other pharmaceuticals of another forms i e neutral anionic and cationic can affect the sorption of these compounds and how these compounds influence sorption of other compounds the main goal was to describe general trends in the behavior of these types of molecules with respect to the characteristic groups of soils which could be then employed to solve scientific and practical tasks in the subsurface water hydrology and related fields for this purpose a new procedure to compare general trends in sorption isotherms was proposed which could be used for a further estimation of changes in sorption behaviors due to a presence of other compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals six pharmaceuticals table 1 were selected based on their common occurrence in the environment 1 and their different forms in the soil environment 2 1 all 6 pharmaceuticals frequently occur in wastewater fedorova et al 2014 golovko et al 2014 in the czech republic and in other european countries loos et al 2013 these compounds are also found in sewage sludge ivanová et al 2018 kodešová et al 2019b some of these compounds can contaminate ground water loos et al 2010 cunha et al 2017 or can be taken up by plants kodešová et al 2019a 2019b 2 selected pharmaceuticals due to their different forms figs 1 and s1 should differently affect each other in their sorption affinities to soils mass fractions fig 1 of different species of each compound in each tested soil described below were calculated using eqs s1 s5 and soil phcacl2 table 2 assuming that ph of a soil solution suspension was governed by soil ph klement et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 the actual mass fractions could slightly differ from these values klement et al 2018 and kočárek et al 2016 have not observed any trends with increasing concentrations of the same compounds in suspensions however ph of suspensions for each soil slightly varied and variation was in the range of measurement uncertainty that is usual for the soil environment further uncertainty stems from the fact that the mass fractions were calculated from the calculated pka values and not from the measured ones the sorption of car cli and sul applied individually into 13 soils has been previously evaluated by kodešová et al 2015 and the sorption of cit fex and irb applied individually into 7 soils of the 13 soils was assessed by klement et al 2018 all pharmaceuticals used in the sorption experiments were purchased from tci japan and were of 97 car and 98 cit cli fex irb sul analytical grade purity isotope labeled analogues of the native compounds were purchased from toronto research chemicals canada 2 2 soils and soil properties the same soils as were used by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 were also employed in this study it has been documented that these soils cover wide range of soils that occur in the central europe have considerably different properties and are suitable to study behavior of selected pharmaceuticals under variable conditions i e sorption mechanisms and relationships between soil properties and compounds sorption affinities the new samples were taken from the surface horizons 0 25 cm of different

scs the percentage of bcs in cec the correlation coefficients describing the relationships among the soil properties are shown in the supplementary material table s1 2 3 sorption experiment the standard batch equilibrium method oecd 2000 was used to evaluate the sorption isotherms the procedure was the same as in the studies by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 ten grams of the dry soil sample was placed directly into a plastic centrifuge tube next the soil sample was mixed with 20 cm3 of a solution of a single pharmaceutical two pharmaceuticals or all pharmaceuticals except cit in 5 different concentrations 0 5 1 2 5 or 10 μg cm 3 in 0 01 m cacl2 it should be noted that applied concentrations were higher than environmentally relevant concentrations e g one to three order of magnitude higher than in sewage sludge kodešová et al 2019a 2019b and treated wastewater respectively golovko et al 2014 however the concentrations are the same as in our previous studies klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 and the range of selected values is similar to the concentration ranges usually applied in similar studies e g doretto et al 2014 chefetz et al 2008 vithanage et al 2014 in addition because the main aim was to study competitive or synergic behaviors of tested compounds it was expected that these different behaviors will be more pronounced in solutions of higher concentrations since the main aim was to determine how molecules of fex and irb which could occur in 3 different forms depending on the soil ph cope with other molecules all bi solute combinations were suggested only for those two compounds in addition the sul cli combination was also examined cit was excluded from the solution of all compounds due to its very high sorption in soils klement et al 2018 and because it was likely to have a very strong impact on the sorption of other compounds because the solubility of 3 pharmaceuticals cit fex and irb is low each compound or their mixture was first dissolved in 25 cm3 of ethanol klement et al 2018 then added into 975 cm3 of 0 01 m cacl2 solution and sonicated for 5 min i e 0 44 mm c2h5oh solution each soil solution suspension was prepared in duplicate the tubes were shaken for 24 h at 20 c using an analog reciprocating shaker gfl 3006 gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh this time of exposure was suggested to be sufficient to achieve sorption equilibrium of all tested compounds in our two previous studies klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 following suspension processing was also for tested compounds proposed by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm and filtered through a regenerated cellulose syringe filter 0 45 μm no noticeable impact of sample filtration through syringe filters on the recovery of studied compounds was proven by lindberg et al 2014 the actual initial concentrations cini a μg cm 3 and final equilibrium concentrations ceq μg cm 3 were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and either an isotope dilution or an internal standard is method according to our previous work fér et al 2018 klement et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 kodešová et al 2015 briefly approximately 1 cm3 of filtrate was transferred to the autosampler vial and the is was added the samples were analyzed by direct injection into an lc ms ms system where a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq ultra thermo scientific usa was coupled with a dionex ultimate 3000sd pump and an autosampler thermo scientific usa matrix effects were corrected using matrix matching standard the lc method was adopted from our earlier published analytical paper grabic et al 2012 using a hypersilgold phenyl analytical column thermo scientific usa to shorten analysis time the concentration of pharmaceuticals which were sorbed onto soil particles s μg g 1 where calculated as follows 1 s 2 c ini a c eq data points of the sorption isotherms given by the final pharmaceutical concentration c ceq and s were fitted using the freundlich equation 2 s k f c 1 n where kf cm3 n μg1 1 n g 1 and n are empirical coefficients these unknown empirical coefficients were computed using the linear transformation of eq 2 and laboratory data jorgensen and bendorichio 2001 together with the least squares method next to be able to assess influences of soil properties on compounds sorption affinities which were described by kf values that were n dependent and to evaluate differences between sorption affinities of compounds applied separately and simultaneously the same procedure as proposed and applied by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 was used the average navg coefficient was calculated for each pharmaceutical using n values from all scenarios then the freundlich equation in which n was fixed at the navg value was again used to fit the experimental data points linearly related c1 n avg and s values and to obtain the kf values using the least squares method these values were then used for the following statistical analyses in addition differences between the kf values affected by simultaneous sorption of two or five compounds and the unaffected kf values δkf were calculated to illustrate either antagonistic or synergic effects on their sorption intensities these differences were also expressed in percentages of the unaffected kf values it should be stated that alternatively the distribution coefficients kd for a particular equilibrium concentration ceq could be calculated and assessed similarly however in this case the kd values would be different for different equilibrium concentrations in addition the kf and navg values describe general trends of sorption isotherms and despite suppressing information about curvature of sorption isotherm for each soil give better information about compound sorption behavior than single kd values nevertheless to elucidate differences in kd coefficients for one soil hch and pharmaceutical fex s values were calculated for selected ceq values 0 01 0 1 1 10 μg cm 3 using eq 2 and the initially optimized coefficients kf and n and values obtained for the navg value the kd values were calculated as a ratio between s and c kd for c 1 equals to corresponding kf the δkd values were computed as differences between the kd values affected by simultaneous sorption of two or five compounds and the unaffected kd values 2 4 statistical analyses correlations between the freundlich sorption coefficients kf for navg value and each of the measured physical and chemical soil properties were assessed using the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the statistical significance of the estimated correlations was evaluated using the p value the multiple range tests were used to compare the kf values of a particular compound resulting from different scenarios the principal component analyses were used to categorize soils according to the kf values for a single compound and the trends in the δkf values i e in changes of sorption affinities by other compounds all statistical analyses were performed using stagraphics centurion xv version 15 2 06 3 results and discussion in soils 3 1 sorption of neutral molecules of carbamazepine car was in the neutral form in all cases fig 1 thus the sorption of car was mainly driven by hydrophobic partitioning and partly also due to hydrogen bonding schaffer and licha 2015 as expected kodešová et al 2015 the highest sorption of car tables 3 and s2 and fig s2a b was observed in schs the highest cox and decreased with decreasing cox statistically significant relationships between the kf and cox values were found for all scenarios tables 4 and s8 the statistically significant relationships between the kf and other soil properties cec bcs and ρs are given by their correlations with cox table s1 the simultaneously sorbed compounds had no or very small mostly negative influences on car sorption figs 2 s2a b and s8 the increase or decrease in the freundlich sorption coefficient kf δ kf in fig 2 was mostly lower than 20 varied between 11 7 and 13 2 fig s8 except the kf decrease in ae from 32 6 to 39 3 fig s8 which can be explained by the lowest sorption efficiency of this soil table 3 due to the low organic carbon content table 2 these findings are consistent with the results obtained for the topsoils of gp hl and hca by kočárek et al 2016 the multiple range tests fig s9 did not shown any significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 2 sorption of cationic and neutral molecules of citalopram and clindamycin cit was present in all solutions in cation form fig 1 therefore the sorption of cit tables 3 and s3 and fig s3a b was mainly governed by cation exchange schaffer and licha 2015 and the kf value correlated with bcs tables 4 and s9 these findings are in agreement with the results of klement et al 2018 the kf value was also positively correlated with all ph values and salinity in water which can be associated with their correlations with bcs however the higher concentrations of substances in soil solutions could also cause an increased activity of sorbate e g kutzner et al 2016 2018 the cit sorption in all soils and kf values were positively influenced by irb and by fex in schs hch and gp figs 2 s3a b and s8 fig 2 shows the largest differences in the kf values for schs hch and gp however the kf increases for cit irb in these soils expressed in percentages fig s8 were similar to those for other soils because cit sorption in schs hch and gp was considerably higher compared to that in other soils table 3 the kf increase was in all cases larger than 20 δkf varied between 24 5 and 89 5 fig s8 in the case of cit fex increases or decreases in kf were mostly lower than 20 except in gp and dca fig s8 the positive influence of irb when it was partly in anion form i e in schs hch and gp fig 1 on cit sorption fig 2 can be explained by their synergic behavior considerably lower increases in the kf values for these soils were observed for fex which can be explained by a very low fraction of its anionic form in these soils 2 4 2 1 and 1 3 fig 1 nevertheless in both cases cit likely reduced repulsion between the soil surface and irb fex and increased their sorption at the surface of the soil constituents via hydrophobic partitioning hydrogen bonding surface complexation etc which is discussed below and formed additional negatively charged sorption sites for cationic molecules of cit conversely the interactions between the cit molecules sorbed at the soil surface with the irb and fex molecules could form additional sites for sorption due to hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic interactions as surface complexation ligand exchange etc the multilayer cooperative sorption of a single cit or cit with the other compound i e ability of cit to form multiple layers on the soil constituents was indicated by the n values tables 3 and s3 which were considerably lower than 1 in all cases similar interactions can be responsible for an overall increase 20 in the kf values for cit irb for other soils the multiple range tests fig s9 did not shown significant differences in the kf values resulting from the different scenarios cli occurred in solution in two forms cation and neutral fig 1 therefore the sorption of cli tables 3 and s4 and fig s4a b was mostly driven by cation exchange and hydrophobic partitioning schaffer and licha 2015 however statistically significant relationships between the kf and bcs values were found tables 4 and s10 for all scenarios e g kodešová et al 2015 likely due to the same reasons as discussed above for cit the kf values were also positively correlated with all ph values and salinity in water the cli sorption affinity figs 2 s4a b and s8 was in all cases negatively influenced by other compounds this result indicates that these compounds competed for the same sorption sites despite that results of correlation analyses suggested that cation exchange played a major role in cli sorption onto soil constituents decrease in kf values that was mostly lower than 20 fig s8 could be due to competitive sorption via hydrophobic partitioning and hydrogen bonding e g larger decrease in kf for cli irb in hl hca and dca in which irb was mostly in neutral form or larger decrease in kf for cli sul in hl hca dca and ae in which sul was also partly in neutral form interestingly the influences of the mixtures of the other 4 compounds fex irb sul and car did not differ from the influence of a single irb fex or sul behavior of cli was considerably different despite its mostly positive charge than behavior of cit likely because cli was not able to form multiple layers on soil constituents as cit n 0 98 for cli the multiple range tests fig s9 did not show significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 3 sorption of neutral and anionic molecules of sulfamethoxazole sul occurred mostly in anionic form and partly in a neutral form fig 1 thus the sorption of sul onto soil surfaces tables 3 and s5 and fig s5a b should be governed by hydrophobic partitioning surface complexation and cation bridging schaffer and licha 2015 as found by kodešová et al 2015 the kf values in all cases were positively correlated with the ha values tables 4 and s11 sul sorption was positively affected by cationic cli figs 2 s5a b and s8 it should be noticed that in studies by kočárek et al 2016 and fér et al 2018 the positively charged compound atenolol had a greater impact on sul sorption in hch and gp in comparison to a negligible impact in hca difference between our greater influence in hca dca and ae compared to that in other soils fig 2 and previous findings can be explained by the fact that cli was in hch gp and schs partly in neutral form contrary to the mostly cation form in hca dca and ae fig 1 and therefore could not efficiently diminish the repulsion between the soils and the sul molecules the δkf increase or decrease was mostly lower than 20 the δkf decrease of 31 6 hch can be attributed to a very low sorption of sul in this soil and to a greater influence of possible experimental errors on the evaluated kf and δkf values sul sorption was negatively impacted by fex similarly as fex sorption was negatively influenced by sul however δkf for sul fex varied between 15 8 and 49 0 fig s8 which shows a larger decrease in kf for sul than that for fex this indicates that sorption of fex compound of a larger affinity to soils than sul was less influenced by competition with sul than sorption of sul affected by fex finally sorption of sul was mostly negatively influenced by irb δkf varied between 5 4 and 40 0 the δkf values mostly followed a similar trend as the δkf values for sul fex which suggests similar behavior of these compounds in soil solutes suspensions the negligible influence mostly 10 of a mixture of other 4 compounds on sul sorption was found the larger decrease in kf values fig s8 for sul mix in schs and gp and sul fex and sul irb can be again attributed to a very low sorption of sul in these soils and to a greater influence of possible experimental errors on the evaluated kf and δkf values the multiple range tests fig s9 did not show significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 4 sorption of cationic neutral or zwitter ionic and anionic molecules of fexofenadine and irbesartan fex was mostly in zwitter ionic form partly in cationic and anionic forms for low and high ph respectively fig 1 thus the sorption of fex onto the soil surface tables 3 and s6 and fig s6a b could be controlled by various mechanisms and obstructed by repulsion from the soil surface due to its negative charge schaffer and licha 2015 klement et al 2018 found that the kf values for fex correlated with ha and thus they suggested the negative charge of this molecule likely plays a more important role the reason could be the position and character of the different charges while the pka1 acid is related to a carboxylic acid the pka2 base is related to a tertiary nitrogen located in the central part of the molecule close to two hydroxyl groups table 1 which could hinder the coulombic attraction to the sorbent surface carrasquillo et al 2008 in the present study statistically significant correlations between the kf and ha values were found only for fex affected by irb and car tables 4 and s12 however the statistical analyses in almost all the cases showed negative relationships between the kf and scs values which indicated the negative influence of the percentage of the negatively charged sites related to bcs at the surface of the soil constituents the kf values were also negatively correlated with all ph values that were positively correlated with scs however these negative correlations may also be associated with a dissociation of fex molecules under various ph conditions i e a higher sorption of zwitter ions than sorption of anions the fex sorption was negatively influenced by cli and sul figs 2 s6a b and s8 however the kf decrease was mostly lower than 20 δkf varied between 5 5 and 16 2 for cli and between 0 18 and 15 8 for sul fig s8 these findings support previous suggestion about their competition for the same sorption sites discussed for cli and sul on the other hand the fex sorption affinity to soils dramatically increased when applied with cit as discussed above these findings indicate ability of cit to cooperatively form multiple layers on the soil constituents contrary to the competitive character of simultaneous sorption of cli and fex the δkf increase varied between 155 and 229 fig s8 the largest δkf increases fig s8 were observed in schs hch and gp in which fex was partly in anionic form fig 1 as discussed for sul by kočárek et al 2016 the bonding of cit onto negative charges of soil could reduce the repulsion between fex molecules in anionic as well as in zwitter ionic form and soil constituents fex could also be sorbed due to cation bridging a higher sorption of fex was also observed when it was applied with car δkf between 50 7 and 78 2 irb δkf between 4 7 and 63 2 and in a mixture with the other 4 compounds δkf between 48 2 and 81 4 the δkf values for fex mix mostly followed values for fex car no trends were observed for different soils it can be hypothesized that a layer of these mostly neutral compounds served as protection against repulsion however the kf values in all of these cases were still negatively correlated with the scs values the evaluated relationships do not help to explain these compound sorption mechanisms the multiple range tests fig s9 grouped the kf values into 3 groups however only the kf values resulting from the fex cit scenario significantly differed from the single fex scenario irb was mostly in a neutral form partly in cationic and anionic form for low and high ph respectively fig 1 thus the sorption of irb onto the soil surface tables 3 and s7 and fig s7a b should be mainly driven by hydrophobic partitioning hydrogen bonding neutral molecules and other electrostatic interactions anions schaffer and licha 2015 however as found by klement et al 2018 the irb sorption behavior was more similar to fex and the kf values were mostly negatively correlated with the scs values tables 4 and s13 the kf values were also negatively correlated with all ph values i e there was a positive correlation between the ph and scs values and or a higher sorption of neutral molecules than sorption of anions as discussed for fex irb sorption figs 2 s7a b and s8 was positively influenced by cit δkf between 3 6 and 1037 and car δkf between 35 2 and 118 and was negatively influenced by cli δkf between 7 1 and 37 5 due to the same reasons for instance the largest increase in δkf for irb cit was observed in schs hch gp and hl in which irb was partly in anionic form 33 30 21 and 3 6 respectively fig 1 and therefore cit likely reduced repulsion of irb molecules from soil constituents sorption could be enhanced by cation bridging in these soils neutral molecules of irb competed with the neutral molecules of cli for the same sorption sites the δkf values for irb mix between 9 1 and 108 again mostly followed the δkf values for irb car thus results of this study again proved a very similar behavior of fex and irb klement et al 2018 despite that these two compounds differ in forms of their molecules i e zwitter ionic and neutral respectively the multiple range tests fig s9 again showed that only the kf values resulting from the irb cit scenario significantly differed from the single fex scenario our findings are in contrast to results published by conkle et al 2010 septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 which documented mostly the negative influences of competitions of compounds which depending on ph occurred in 3 different forms cationic zwitter ionic or neutral anionic on their sorption in soils and clays the simultaneous application of both compounds fex and irb had either negligible or slightly positive influences on their sorption in tested soils differences in behaviors of compounds tested in our and previous studies can be explained by differences in structures of molecules another reason could be that studies by septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 were performed with clays and sorption of tested compounds was not influenced by the organic matter content and other components of soils sorption of both compounds fex and irb was positively affected by car neutral which is in agreement with the increased sorption of fex and irb when it was mostly in a neural form in hl hca dca sorption of both compounds was also positively affected by cit strongly sorbed positively charged compound which agrees with our presumptions on the other hand simultaneous sorption of cli mostly positively charged compound negatively influenced sorption of fex and irb thus our hypothesis that positively charged molecules should positively affect fex and irb sorption in soils has not been confirmed 3 5 categorization of soils according to the kf values and trends in changes of sorption affinities by other compounds the principal component analysis carried out for the freundlich sorption coefficients resulted from the single compound application fig 3 showed very similar sorption behavior of all compounds in soils developed on loess hch gp hl and marlite schs substrates and diverse behavior in the other three soils the principal component analyses carried out for the δkf values for a particular compound indicated different soil categories for each compound not shown the analyses carried out for the δkf values for all compounds grouped the soils as follows schs hch and gp hl ae and hca and dca fig 3 this division corresponds to specific ranges of potential soil reactions phkcl and phcacl2 in table 2 affecting the forms of the compounds and driving sorption mechanisms and partly also the sorption affinities soil categorization clearly follows different soil substrates and overall soil chemical and physical qualities similar grouping of the same soils was observed when assessing dissipations of 5 pharmaceuticals trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole clindamycin atenolol and metoprolol kodešová et al 2016 and degradations of 3 pharmaceuticals trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin and formations of their transformation products koba et al 2017 however kodešová et al 2016 did not observe a similar behavior when evaluating kf coefficients for these 5 compounds it was concluded that while pharmaceutical dissipation half lives were controlled by overall soil quality their sorption affinities were mainly controlled by particular soil chemical properties our new results can indicate that sorption behavior of tested compounds in multicomponent systems is more complex and a definition of a soil type and substrate plays a greater role 3 6 implication for assessment of compounds mobility in vadose zone and their availability for plants the lowest sorption in soils i e the highest mobility in soils for a single compound table 3 was observed for sul kf 1 5 1 6 cm3 n μg1 1 n g 1 followed by car 2 8 1 1 irb 3 1 2 9 cli 9 2 5 1 fex 30 14 and cit 161 893 177 359 the impact of simultaneous sorption of other compounds on sul sorption figs 2 and s8 was in some soils large but the overall influence in the mixture without cit was relatively low average δkf of 7 similarly the influence on sorption of car in the mixture was relatively low average δkf of 11 the negative influence on sorption was observed also for cli average δkf of 16 on the other hand the increase in sorption affinity of compounds in mixture was observed for fex and irb average δkf of 63 and 67 respectively thus while sul car and cli in multiple compound solutions can be more mobile in the vadose zone than for single compound solutions fex and irb can be less mobile as mentioned above section 2 3 the concentrations used in this study were one to three order of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations behaviors of compounds that occur in the vadose zone in lower concentrations can differ as also noted above alternatively competitive or cooperative behaviors of compounds can be assessed using the kd coefficients calculated for the selected concentrations ceq fig s10 the kd values evaluated for fex in hch increased with the decreasing ceq values for n 1 and decreased for n 1 all kd values for each combination of compounds showed either increase or decrease the absolute values of δkd computed for constant n 1 15 increased with the decreasing ceq values the δkd values resulted for the variable n values were more variable the increasing and decreasing trend with the decreasing ceq values for n 1 and n 1 respectively assuming an uncertainty in optimized kf and n values the resulting kd and δkd values cannot be used for assessing behavior of compounds in multiple compound solutions it should be also mentioned that another important factor influencing sorption and mobility of pharmaceuticals in soils is organic matter dissolved in soil water solution dom which can affect behavior of compounds in soils in two ways first compound can be attached to dom and next transported with dom migrated through the vadose zone second dissolved organic matter can compete with an organic compound for the soil sorption sites and thus reduces sorption of the tested compound or on the other hand can increase its sorption due to the formation of complexes between compounds and dom these affects can be more pronounced in the case of dom dissolved from various soil amendments or sorbent itself rich in organic matter as biochar farm biosolids and sewage sludge or present in irrigation water e g chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 jia et al 2018 maoz and chefetz 2010 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 this factor was neglected in this study due to two reasons the soil organic matter content was mostly low and thus fraction of dom was likely also low concentrations of compounds were large the dom influence can be likely more significant when the substances are applied to soils from their standard sources e g treated wastewater sewage sludge farm biosolids i e in mixture with other compounds including dom and in the environmental relevant concentrations furthermore compound s behavior can be also positively or negatively influenced be presence of dissolved inorganic cations e g hu et al 2019 therefore additional studies are needed to discover behaviors of compounds applied into soil in the environmental relevant concentrations of all soil solution constituents however the proposed methodology allowing assessment of trends in decreases or increases in the kf sorption coefficients for the average n value can be used to estimate behaviors of compounds in these systems the spread of tested contaminants in the environment mostly corresponds to their sorption affinity to soils and sediments sul due to its low sorption in soils table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 can quickly migrate in soils and sediments sul can rapidly dissipate in topsoils e g dissipation half lives dt50 of 8 0 3 3 days kodešová et al 2016 but its dissipation half lives in subsoils can be high e g 66 and 152 days in loess and sand respectively kodešová et al 2016 therefore once sul occurs in subsurface layers can easily migrate in the subsurface water environment which has been confirmed by its frequent occurrence in groundwaters e g fram and belitz 2011 godfrey et al 2007 li 2014 and loos et al 2010 it has been also documented that sul and its metabolites can be also taken up by plants however they uptake and translocation in plant bodies is due to its mostly negatively charged molecules limited e g ahmed et al 2015 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a malchi et al 2014 and wu et al 2013 car due to its low sorption affinity in soils table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 and also great persistency in soils and sediments e g dt50 mostly greater than 1000 days kodešová et al 2016 is a highly mobile compound in the subsurface water environment therefore this compound frequently occurs in groundwaters e g fram and belitz 2011 fisher et al 2016 godfrey et al 2007 kruc et al 2019 li 2014 huntscha et al 2012 loos et al 2010 radovic et al 2015 it has been also documented that car is freely take up by plants translocated accumulated but also transformed in plant bodies e g goldstein et al 2014 hurtado et al 2016 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a 2019b malchi et al 2014 montemurro et al 2017 mordechay et al 2018 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2013 sorption of irb in soils table 2 or klement et al 2018 strongly depends on soils conditions it can be either very low soils developed on loess or high dca ae the dissipation half lives of irb 9 27 7 days reported by iranzo et al 2018 in the composted sludge from the waste water treatment plant showed low or moderated stability their values were similar or slightly lower than values measured for our soils 24 4 3 5 days not published data a potential of irb to migrate in the subsurface water environment is moderate or low respectively to our knowledge there is no study documenting an occurrence of irb in groundwaters no uptake of irb from the sewage sludge applied into 7 soils as a soil amendment was found by kodešová et al 2019b assuming the sorption coefficients table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 and the dt50 values of 23 23 days kodešová et al 2016 for cli cli should not extensively migrate in the vadose zone a competition with other compounds for the same sorption sites can reduce its sorption but its sorption is due to mostly positively charged molecules still relatively high therefore this compound has not been probably detected in groundwaters e g de jongh et al 2012 kruc et al 2019 a potential uptake of cli by plants is likely very limited for instance kodešová et al 2019b reported no uptake of cli and very low uptakes of its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide from the sewage sludge in 7 soils sorption of fex in soils table 2 or klement et al 2018 is relatively high and its stability in soils is moderate dt50 of 24 21 days not published data thus its mobility in the vadose zone seems to be very low for instance kruc et al 2019 found fex in river water but not in riverbank filtrations on the other hand fischer et al 2016 found fex in shallow ground water due to the wastewater disposal negligible uptakes of fex from the sewage sludge were reported by kodešová et al 2019b cit should be due to its very large sorption practically immobile in the subsurface water environment however fick et al 2009 found low concentrations of cit in 3 of 6 monitoring wells likely due to a very high concentrations of cit in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant and in river water gottschall et al 2012 found low concentrations of cit in groundwater after the application of dewatered municipal biosolids to a field it has been also shown that cit can be taken up by plants e g kodešová et al 2019b one of the reasons could be a very high stability in the soil environment dt50 values of 152 54 days not published data another reason can be the concave shape of the sorption isotherms i e n 1 which indicates lower sorption affinity of cit for its low concentration in solution 4 conclusions in this study the procedure to compare general trends in sorption isotherms evaluated for a single compound in soils and affected by presence by other compounds was proposed and tested for 6 pharmaceuticals and 7 soils the results for the bi solute systems showed that sorption of both compounds can increase i e a synergic effect for both compounds sorption of the first and second can increase and decrease respectively i e a synergic effect for one and antagonistic for the other and sorption of both can decrease i e an antagonistic effect for both compounds the results also showed that the sorption of compounds in specific bi solute systems can be synergic in certain soils and can be antagonistic in other soils which depended on the form of their molecules this is likely the reason why summary of previous findings provided inconsistent information about expected behavior of compounds in their mixtures the tested soils were according to the changes in compound s sorption affinities clustered in to 3 groups which mainly corresponded to specific ranges of potential soil reactions affecting the form of the molecules and driving sorption mechanisms and partly also with the substrate and sorption affinities these findings showed that the sorption behavior of such organic compounds studied in a single soil cannot be extrapolated to other soil conditions and must always be examined in several soil samples representing particular groups of soils specifically affecting the sorption of these organic compounds the correlation analyses showed that despite sorption being either positively or negatively influenced by other compound s in solution the freundlich sorption coefficients kf evaluated for a particular compound were always correlated with the same soil properties these findings indicated that the general trends in the kf coefficients evaluated for various combinations of compounds in different soils remain unchanged thus these soil properties can be used to assess soils according to the potential mobility of a specific compound in these soils e g klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 the evaluated percentages characterizing the impact of the multiple solute systems on sorption of compounds provided information about trends in different soil groups these values can be used to estimate potential increase or decrease in sorption affinities of tested compounds evaluated for a single compound and certain soil material related to a particular soil group such approach can be applied for estimated e g klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 as well as measured adsorption isotherms and can be adopted in various environmental studies evaluating migration of these compounds in the water environment adjusted estimates of compound s sorption coefficients for multiple solute systems can for instance improve the predictive ability of mathematical models simulating transport of contaminants in the vadose zone and subsequent groundwater contamination however new studies are needed to assess compounds behaviors and to test this procedure under the environmentally relevant concentrations impact of other compounds in soil solution e g

1490,sorption of pharmaceuticals which can occur in soils may differ when present in a soil solution as a single compound or in a solution with other pharmaceuticals therefore the sorption isotherms described by the freundlich equations were evaluated for 6 compounds which were applied in solutions of a single pharmaceutical two pharmaceuticals or all pharmaceuticals to seven soils study mainly focused on a behavior of fexofenadine and irbesartan that occurred in soils in 3 forms cationic zwitter ionic or neutral anionic sorption of both compounds slightly increased in some soils when applied together largely increased when applied with carbamazepine neutral and extremely increased when applied in solutions with citalopram strongly sorbed cation which could be explained by a cooperative multilayer sorption on soil constituents on the other hand sorption of both compounds moderately decreased when applied with clindamycin cation and neutral or sulfamethoxazole neutral or anion the magnitude of an increase or decrease in the freundlich sorption coefficient kf for a particular compound depended on soil conditions a form of compound s molecule and its interaction with molecules of other compounds despite sorption being influenced by other compound s in solution the kf coefficients evaluated for a particular compound under the different conditions were mostly correlated with the same soil properties kf car with an organic carbon content kf cit and kf cli with a base cation saturation kf sul with hydrolytic acidity and kf fex and kf irb with sorption complex saturation keywords soil types pharmaceuticals sorption single solute bi solute penta solute solution cooperative multilayer sorption 1 introduction the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment has become one of the new environmental threats there are several sources of these compounds and various pathways by which they may pollute the environment due to incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment plants e g fedorova et al 2014 golovko et al 2014 loos et al 2013 these compounds can contaminate surface water e g cunha et al 2017 de jongh et al 2012 fram and belitz 2011 kruc et al 2019 radovic et al 2015 from which these contaminants can consequently migrate into groundwater through river banks e g de jongh et al 2012 kruc et al 2019 radovic et al 2015 the most frequent pathways of human pharmaceuticals directly contaminating soil and groundwaters is via leakage of wastewaters from sewage systems and from using treated wastewater and sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants for irrigation and soil amendment respectively e g al farsi et al 2017 ivanová et al 2018 kodešová et al 2019b mathews and reinhold 2013 verlicchi and zambello 2015 veterinary pharmaceuticals can enter the water environment directly from animal urine or after application of farm waste to soils e g charuaud et al 2019 pharmaceuticals in soils can be consequently taken up by plants e g goldstein et al 2014 hurtado et al 2016 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a 2019b malchi et al 2014 montemurro et al 2017 mordechay et al 2018 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2013 the mobility of these contaminants in soil and groundwater and their availability for plants is largely controlled by their sorption onto soils and sediments e g brunetti et al 2019 the sorption of a particular compound onto a tested material is governed by the physical chemical properties of the sorbate and sorbent and their solution properties schaffer and licha 2015 pharmaceuticals occur in the environment in different forms i e neutral cationic anionic or zwitter ionic the form of the compound s molecule is determined by its pka value and the ph value of the solution the sorption mechanisms hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions depend on the form of the compound s molecule pharmaceuticals occur in the environment in solutions with other organic and inorganic substances the sorption of pharmaceuticals onto solids can be either negatively or positively influenced due to their competition for the same sorption sites or synergy respectively knowledge of actual sorption behaviors of compounds in their mixtures is crucial for many environmental applications as risk assessments related to their migration in the vadose zone pollution of drinking water resources crop and consequently food contamination etc nevertheless in many of these studies sorption behavior is frequently estimated using models developed for neutral organic compounds as pesticides that insufficiently describe reality carter et al 2020 li et al 2020 in addition modified sorption in multiple solute solutions which can either increase or decrease mobility and availability is usually neglected studies focused on the simultaneous sorption of two or more pharmaceuticals in soils are rare and provide relatively insufficient and inconsistent information about the behavior of different molecules in these materials for instance a noncompetitive sorption between the two anionic statin drugs atorvastatin and simvastatin acid onto silty sand soil peat river sediment and biosolids was reported by ottmar et al 2010 a mixture of anionic molecules of sulfonamides sulfadimethoxine and sulfaguanidine also had a negligible effect on their behavior in tested soils in a study by maszkowska et al 2013 the apparent competition between diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen anionic molecules in two and three solute systems sorption in two biochars was documented by jung et al 2015 on the other hand zhang et al 2017 observed slight synergic effect of simultaneous applications of ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac anionic molecules on their sorption affinity in a loam texture soil oh et al 2016 found that salicylic acid enhanced the sorption of sulfamethoxazole to sediments competition between bisphenol a and carbamazepine unionized molecules and no competition between phenanthrene on carbamazepine sorption onto single walled carbon nanotubes was observed by lerman et al 2013 the strong competition between the sorption of three fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin ofloxacin and norfloxacin i e zwitter ionic compounds in a silty clay loam was reported by conkle et al 2010 the competitive sorption was also observed between ciprofloxacin cationic zwitter ionic anionic and sulfadiazine cationic neutral anionic onto two clays montmorillonite and kaolinite by septian et al 2019 competitive behavior was also found for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline zwitter ionic anionic in montmorillonite by wu et al 2019 martínez costa et al 2018 reported competitive sorption of sulfamethoxazole anionic and trimethoprim cationic and neutral on a hybrid clay nanosorbent competitive sorption onto biochars was documented for ketoprofen and triclosan neutral and anionic by wu et al 2017 our two previous studies kočárek et al 2016 fér et al 2018 carried out for 4 pharmaceuticals and soil samples taken from different horizons of 3 soil types showed that sorption of positively charged atenolol did not differ when applied separately or in solution with other 3 compounds the sorption of trimethoprim cation and neutral sulfamethoxazole anion decreased and increased respectively the sorption of carbamazepine was lower in 4 compound solutions kočárek et al 2016 but was higher in 3 compound without trimethoprim solutions fér et al 2018 it is apparent that molecules of pharmaceuticals which occur in the environment in different forms may differently influence each other in their sorption onto various materials while for instance an influence of cations inorganic or organic on sorption of organic cations or anions in soils which can be competitive or cooperative respectively or a mutual effect of two or more organic compounds in similar forms on their sorption behavior which can be competitive was to some degree revealed a behavior of compounds that depending on soil conditions may occur in 3 different forms in multiple solute systems has not been fully discovered in addition influences of various organic molecules on sorption of organic molecules in zwitter ionic forms in soils has not been wholly revealed studies by conkle et al 2010 septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 mostly proved competitive behavior of tested compounds under limited soil or clay conditions our previous study for fexofenadine fex and irbesartan irb which may occur in the environment in 3 forms cation zwitter ion or neutral and anion showed that their sorption in soils was negatively influenced by the base cation saturation and positively to the hydrolytic acidity klement et al 2018 similarly sorption of sulfamethoxazole neutral and anion was negatively related to the base cation saturation and positively to the hydrolytic acidity kodešová et al 2015 and its sorption increased in some soils when simultaneously sorbed with positively charged compounds fér et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 therefore in this new study it has been hypothesized that sorption of fex and irb can be also positively affected by cationic molecules it has been also hypothesized that sorption of these two compounds can decrease due to their competition with each other and due to competition with molecules in similar forms to prove these hypotheses the following four pharmaceuticals were in addition selected citalopram cit cation clindamycin cli cation and neutral carbamazepine car neutral and sulfamethoxazole sul neutral anion the aim was to reveal the overall behavior of these two pharmaceuticals in very different soils how these two compounds influence each other in their sorption affinities to reveal how other pharmaceuticals of another forms i e neutral anionic and cationic can affect the sorption of these compounds and how these compounds influence sorption of other compounds the main goal was to describe general trends in the behavior of these types of molecules with respect to the characteristic groups of soils which could be then employed to solve scientific and practical tasks in the subsurface water hydrology and related fields for this purpose a new procedure to compare general trends in sorption isotherms was proposed which could be used for a further estimation of changes in sorption behaviors due to a presence of other compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals six pharmaceuticals table 1 were selected based on their common occurrence in the environment 1 and their different forms in the soil environment 2 1 all 6 pharmaceuticals frequently occur in wastewater fedorova et al 2014 golovko et al 2014 in the czech republic and in other european countries loos et al 2013 these compounds are also found in sewage sludge ivanová et al 2018 kodešová et al 2019b some of these compounds can contaminate ground water loos et al 2010 cunha et al 2017 or can be taken up by plants kodešová et al 2019a 2019b 2 selected pharmaceuticals due to their different forms figs 1 and s1 should differently affect each other in their sorption affinities to soils mass fractions fig 1 of different species of each compound in each tested soil described below were calculated using eqs s1 s5 and soil phcacl2 table 2 assuming that ph of a soil solution suspension was governed by soil ph klement et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 the actual mass fractions could slightly differ from these values klement et al 2018 and kočárek et al 2016 have not observed any trends with increasing concentrations of the same compounds in suspensions however ph of suspensions for each soil slightly varied and variation was in the range of measurement uncertainty that is usual for the soil environment further uncertainty stems from the fact that the mass fractions were calculated from the calculated pka values and not from the measured ones the sorption of car cli and sul applied individually into 13 soils has been previously evaluated by kodešová et al 2015 and the sorption of cit fex and irb applied individually into 7 soils of the 13 soils was assessed by klement et al 2018 all pharmaceuticals used in the sorption experiments were purchased from tci japan and were of 97 car and 98 cit cli fex irb sul analytical grade purity isotope labeled analogues of the native compounds were purchased from toronto research chemicals canada 2 2 soils and soil properties the same soils as were used by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 were also employed in this study it has been documented that these soils cover wide range of soils that occur in the central europe have considerably different properties and are suitable to study behavior of selected pharmaceuticals under variable conditions i e sorption mechanisms and relationships between soil properties and compounds sorption affinities the new samples were taken from the surface horizons 0 25 cm of different

scs the percentage of bcs in cec the correlation coefficients describing the relationships among the soil properties are shown in the supplementary material table s1 2 3 sorption experiment the standard batch equilibrium method oecd 2000 was used to evaluate the sorption isotherms the procedure was the same as in the studies by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 ten grams of the dry soil sample was placed directly into a plastic centrifuge tube next the soil sample was mixed with 20 cm3 of a solution of a single pharmaceutical two pharmaceuticals or all pharmaceuticals except cit in 5 different concentrations 0 5 1 2 5 or 10 μg cm 3 in 0 01 m cacl2 it should be noted that applied concentrations were higher than environmentally relevant concentrations e g one to three order of magnitude higher than in sewage sludge kodešová et al 2019a 2019b and treated wastewater respectively golovko et al 2014 however the concentrations are the same as in our previous studies klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 and the range of selected values is similar to the concentration ranges usually applied in similar studies e g doretto et al 2014 chefetz et al 2008 vithanage et al 2014 in addition because the main aim was to study competitive or synergic behaviors of tested compounds it was expected that these different behaviors will be more pronounced in solutions of higher concentrations since the main aim was to determine how molecules of fex and irb which could occur in 3 different forms depending on the soil ph cope with other molecules all bi solute combinations were suggested only for those two compounds in addition the sul cli combination was also examined cit was excluded from the solution of all compounds due to its very high sorption in soils klement et al 2018 and because it was likely to have a very strong impact on the sorption of other compounds because the solubility of 3 pharmaceuticals cit fex and irb is low each compound or their mixture was first dissolved in 25 cm3 of ethanol klement et al 2018 then added into 975 cm3 of 0 01 m cacl2 solution and sonicated for 5 min i e 0 44 mm c2h5oh solution each soil solution suspension was prepared in duplicate the tubes were shaken for 24 h at 20 c using an analog reciprocating shaker gfl 3006 gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh this time of exposure was suggested to be sufficient to achieve sorption equilibrium of all tested compounds in our two previous studies klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 following suspension processing was also for tested compounds proposed by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm and filtered through a regenerated cellulose syringe filter 0 45 μm no noticeable impact of sample filtration through syringe filters on the recovery of studied compounds was proven by lindberg et al 2014 the actual initial concentrations cini a μg cm 3 and final equilibrium concentrations ceq μg cm 3 were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and either an isotope dilution or an internal standard is method according to our previous work fér et al 2018 klement et al 2018 kočárek et al 2016 kodešová et al 2015 briefly approximately 1 cm3 of filtrate was transferred to the autosampler vial and the is was added the samples were analyzed by direct injection into an lc ms ms system where a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq ultra thermo scientific usa was coupled with a dionex ultimate 3000sd pump and an autosampler thermo scientific usa matrix effects were corrected using matrix matching standard the lc method was adopted from our earlier published analytical paper grabic et al 2012 using a hypersilgold phenyl analytical column thermo scientific usa to shorten analysis time the concentration of pharmaceuticals which were sorbed onto soil particles s μg g 1 where calculated as follows 1 s 2 c ini a c eq data points of the sorption isotherms given by the final pharmaceutical concentration c ceq and s were fitted using the freundlich equation 2 s k f c 1 n where kf cm3 n μg1 1 n g 1 and n are empirical coefficients these unknown empirical coefficients were computed using the linear transformation of eq 2 and laboratory data jorgensen and bendorichio 2001 together with the least squares method next to be able to assess influences of soil properties on compounds sorption affinities which were described by kf values that were n dependent and to evaluate differences between sorption affinities of compounds applied separately and simultaneously the same procedure as proposed and applied by kodešová et al 2015 and klement et al 2018 was used the average navg coefficient was calculated for each pharmaceutical using n values from all scenarios then the freundlich equation in which n was fixed at the navg value was again used to fit the experimental data points linearly related c1 n avg and s values and to obtain the kf values using the least squares method these values were then used for the following statistical analyses in addition differences between the kf values affected by simultaneous sorption of two or five compounds and the unaffected kf values δkf were calculated to illustrate either antagonistic or synergic effects on their sorption intensities these differences were also expressed in percentages of the unaffected kf values it should be stated that alternatively the distribution coefficients kd for a particular equilibrium concentration ceq could be calculated and assessed similarly however in this case the kd values would be different for different equilibrium concentrations in addition the kf and navg values describe general trends of sorption isotherms and despite suppressing information about curvature of sorption isotherm for each soil give better information about compound sorption behavior than single kd values nevertheless to elucidate differences in kd coefficients for one soil hch and pharmaceutical fex s values were calculated for selected ceq values 0 01 0 1 1 10 μg cm 3 using eq 2 and the initially optimized coefficients kf and n and values obtained for the navg value the kd values were calculated as a ratio between s and c kd for c 1 equals to corresponding kf the δkd values were computed as differences between the kd values affected by simultaneous sorption of two or five compounds and the unaffected kd values 2 4 statistical analyses correlations between the freundlich sorption coefficients kf for navg value and each of the measured physical and chemical soil properties were assessed using the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the statistical significance of the estimated correlations was evaluated using the p value the multiple range tests were used to compare the kf values of a particular compound resulting from different scenarios the principal component analyses were used to categorize soils according to the kf values for a single compound and the trends in the δkf values i e in changes of sorption affinities by other compounds all statistical analyses were performed using stagraphics centurion xv version 15 2 06 3 results and discussion in soils 3 1 sorption of neutral molecules of carbamazepine car was in the neutral form in all cases fig 1 thus the sorption of car was mainly driven by hydrophobic partitioning and partly also due to hydrogen bonding schaffer and licha 2015 as expected kodešová et al 2015 the highest sorption of car tables 3 and s2 and fig s2a b was observed in schs the highest cox and decreased with decreasing cox statistically significant relationships between the kf and cox values were found for all scenarios tables 4 and s8 the statistically significant relationships between the kf and other soil properties cec bcs and ρs are given by their correlations with cox table s1 the simultaneously sorbed compounds had no or very small mostly negative influences on car sorption figs 2 s2a b and s8 the increase or decrease in the freundlich sorption coefficient kf δ kf in fig 2 was mostly lower than 20 varied between 11 7 and 13 2 fig s8 except the kf decrease in ae from 32 6 to 39 3 fig s8 which can be explained by the lowest sorption efficiency of this soil table 3 due to the low organic carbon content table 2 these findings are consistent with the results obtained for the topsoils of gp hl and hca by kočárek et al 2016 the multiple range tests fig s9 did not shown any significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 2 sorption of cationic and neutral molecules of citalopram and clindamycin cit was present in all solutions in cation form fig 1 therefore the sorption of cit tables 3 and s3 and fig s3a b was mainly governed by cation exchange schaffer and licha 2015 and the kf value correlated with bcs tables 4 and s9 these findings are in agreement with the results of klement et al 2018 the kf value was also positively correlated with all ph values and salinity in water which can be associated with their correlations with bcs however the higher concentrations of substances in soil solutions could also cause an increased activity of sorbate e g kutzner et al 2016 2018 the cit sorption in all soils and kf values were positively influenced by irb and by fex in schs hch and gp figs 2 s3a b and s8 fig 2 shows the largest differences in the kf values for schs hch and gp however the kf increases for cit irb in these soils expressed in percentages fig s8 were similar to those for other soils because cit sorption in schs hch and gp was considerably higher compared to that in other soils table 3 the kf increase was in all cases larger than 20 δkf varied between 24 5 and 89 5 fig s8 in the case of cit fex increases or decreases in kf were mostly lower than 20 except in gp and dca fig s8 the positive influence of irb when it was partly in anion form i e in schs hch and gp fig 1 on cit sorption fig 2 can be explained by their synergic behavior considerably lower increases in the kf values for these soils were observed for fex which can be explained by a very low fraction of its anionic form in these soils 2 4 2 1 and 1 3 fig 1 nevertheless in both cases cit likely reduced repulsion between the soil surface and irb fex and increased their sorption at the surface of the soil constituents via hydrophobic partitioning hydrogen bonding surface complexation etc which is discussed below and formed additional negatively charged sorption sites for cationic molecules of cit conversely the interactions between the cit molecules sorbed at the soil surface with the irb and fex molecules could form additional sites for sorption due to hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic interactions as surface complexation ligand exchange etc the multilayer cooperative sorption of a single cit or cit with the other compound i e ability of cit to form multiple layers on the soil constituents was indicated by the n values tables 3 and s3 which were considerably lower than 1 in all cases similar interactions can be responsible for an overall increase 20 in the kf values for cit irb for other soils the multiple range tests fig s9 did not shown significant differences in the kf values resulting from the different scenarios cli occurred in solution in two forms cation and neutral fig 1 therefore the sorption of cli tables 3 and s4 and fig s4a b was mostly driven by cation exchange and hydrophobic partitioning schaffer and licha 2015 however statistically significant relationships between the kf and bcs values were found tables 4 and s10 for all scenarios e g kodešová et al 2015 likely due to the same reasons as discussed above for cit the kf values were also positively correlated with all ph values and salinity in water the cli sorption affinity figs 2 s4a b and s8 was in all cases negatively influenced by other compounds this result indicates that these compounds competed for the same sorption sites despite that results of correlation analyses suggested that cation exchange played a major role in cli sorption onto soil constituents decrease in kf values that was mostly lower than 20 fig s8 could be due to competitive sorption via hydrophobic partitioning and hydrogen bonding e g larger decrease in kf for cli irb in hl hca and dca in which irb was mostly in neutral form or larger decrease in kf for cli sul in hl hca dca and ae in which sul was also partly in neutral form interestingly the influences of the mixtures of the other 4 compounds fex irb sul and car did not differ from the influence of a single irb fex or sul behavior of cli was considerably different despite its mostly positive charge than behavior of cit likely because cli was not able to form multiple layers on soil constituents as cit n 0 98 for cli the multiple range tests fig s9 did not show significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 3 sorption of neutral and anionic molecules of sulfamethoxazole sul occurred mostly in anionic form and partly in a neutral form fig 1 thus the sorption of sul onto soil surfaces tables 3 and s5 and fig s5a b should be governed by hydrophobic partitioning surface complexation and cation bridging schaffer and licha 2015 as found by kodešová et al 2015 the kf values in all cases were positively correlated with the ha values tables 4 and s11 sul sorption was positively affected by cationic cli figs 2 s5a b and s8 it should be noticed that in studies by kočárek et al 2016 and fér et al 2018 the positively charged compound atenolol had a greater impact on sul sorption in hch and gp in comparison to a negligible impact in hca difference between our greater influence in hca dca and ae compared to that in other soils fig 2 and previous findings can be explained by the fact that cli was in hch gp and schs partly in neutral form contrary to the mostly cation form in hca dca and ae fig 1 and therefore could not efficiently diminish the repulsion between the soils and the sul molecules the δkf increase or decrease was mostly lower than 20 the δkf decrease of 31 6 hch can be attributed to a very low sorption of sul in this soil and to a greater influence of possible experimental errors on the evaluated kf and δkf values sul sorption was negatively impacted by fex similarly as fex sorption was negatively influenced by sul however δkf for sul fex varied between 15 8 and 49 0 fig s8 which shows a larger decrease in kf for sul than that for fex this indicates that sorption of fex compound of a larger affinity to soils than sul was less influenced by competition with sul than sorption of sul affected by fex finally sorption of sul was mostly negatively influenced by irb δkf varied between 5 4 and 40 0 the δkf values mostly followed a similar trend as the δkf values for sul fex which suggests similar behavior of these compounds in soil solutes suspensions the negligible influence mostly 10 of a mixture of other 4 compounds on sul sorption was found the larger decrease in kf values fig s8 for sul mix in schs and gp and sul fex and sul irb can be again attributed to a very low sorption of sul in these soils and to a greater influence of possible experimental errors on the evaluated kf and δkf values the multiple range tests fig s9 did not show significant differences in the kf values resulting from different scenarios 3 4 sorption of cationic neutral or zwitter ionic and anionic molecules of fexofenadine and irbesartan fex was mostly in zwitter ionic form partly in cationic and anionic forms for low and high ph respectively fig 1 thus the sorption of fex onto the soil surface tables 3 and s6 and fig s6a b could be controlled by various mechanisms and obstructed by repulsion from the soil surface due to its negative charge schaffer and licha 2015 klement et al 2018 found that the kf values for fex correlated with ha and thus they suggested the negative charge of this molecule likely plays a more important role the reason could be the position and character of the different charges while the pka1 acid is related to a carboxylic acid the pka2 base is related to a tertiary nitrogen located in the central part of the molecule close to two hydroxyl groups table 1 which could hinder the coulombic attraction to the sorbent surface carrasquillo et al 2008 in the present study statistically significant correlations between the kf and ha values were found only for fex affected by irb and car tables 4 and s12 however the statistical analyses in almost all the cases showed negative relationships between the kf and scs values which indicated the negative influence of the percentage of the negatively charged sites related to bcs at the surface of the soil constituents the kf values were also negatively correlated with all ph values that were positively correlated with scs however these negative correlations may also be associated with a dissociation of fex molecules under various ph conditions i e a higher sorption of zwitter ions than sorption of anions the fex sorption was negatively influenced by cli and sul figs 2 s6a b and s8 however the kf decrease was mostly lower than 20 δkf varied between 5 5 and 16 2 for cli and between 0 18 and 15 8 for sul fig s8 these findings support previous suggestion about their competition for the same sorption sites discussed for cli and sul on the other hand the fex sorption affinity to soils dramatically increased when applied with cit as discussed above these findings indicate ability of cit to cooperatively form multiple layers on the soil constituents contrary to the competitive character of simultaneous sorption of cli and fex the δkf increase varied between 155 and 229 fig s8 the largest δkf increases fig s8 were observed in schs hch and gp in which fex was partly in anionic form fig 1 as discussed for sul by kočárek et al 2016 the bonding of cit onto negative charges of soil could reduce the repulsion between fex molecules in anionic as well as in zwitter ionic form and soil constituents fex could also be sorbed due to cation bridging a higher sorption of fex was also observed when it was applied with car δkf between 50 7 and 78 2 irb δkf between 4 7 and 63 2 and in a mixture with the other 4 compounds δkf between 48 2 and 81 4 the δkf values for fex mix mostly followed values for fex car no trends were observed for different soils it can be hypothesized that a layer of these mostly neutral compounds served as protection against repulsion however the kf values in all of these cases were still negatively correlated with the scs values the evaluated relationships do not help to explain these compound sorption mechanisms the multiple range tests fig s9 grouped the kf values into 3 groups however only the kf values resulting from the fex cit scenario significantly differed from the single fex scenario irb was mostly in a neutral form partly in cationic and anionic form for low and high ph respectively fig 1 thus the sorption of irb onto the soil surface tables 3 and s7 and fig s7a b should be mainly driven by hydrophobic partitioning hydrogen bonding neutral molecules and other electrostatic interactions anions schaffer and licha 2015 however as found by klement et al 2018 the irb sorption behavior was more similar to fex and the kf values were mostly negatively correlated with the scs values tables 4 and s13 the kf values were also negatively correlated with all ph values i e there was a positive correlation between the ph and scs values and or a higher sorption of neutral molecules than sorption of anions as discussed for fex irb sorption figs 2 s7a b and s8 was positively influenced by cit δkf between 3 6 and 1037 and car δkf between 35 2 and 118 and was negatively influenced by cli δkf between 7 1 and 37 5 due to the same reasons for instance the largest increase in δkf for irb cit was observed in schs hch gp and hl in which irb was partly in anionic form 33 30 21 and 3 6 respectively fig 1 and therefore cit likely reduced repulsion of irb molecules from soil constituents sorption could be enhanced by cation bridging in these soils neutral molecules of irb competed with the neutral molecules of cli for the same sorption sites the δkf values for irb mix between 9 1 and 108 again mostly followed the δkf values for irb car thus results of this study again proved a very similar behavior of fex and irb klement et al 2018 despite that these two compounds differ in forms of their molecules i e zwitter ionic and neutral respectively the multiple range tests fig s9 again showed that only the kf values resulting from the irb cit scenario significantly differed from the single fex scenario our findings are in contrast to results published by conkle et al 2010 septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 which documented mostly the negative influences of competitions of compounds which depending on ph occurred in 3 different forms cationic zwitter ionic or neutral anionic on their sorption in soils and clays the simultaneous application of both compounds fex and irb had either negligible or slightly positive influences on their sorption in tested soils differences in behaviors of compounds tested in our and previous studies can be explained by differences in structures of molecules another reason could be that studies by septian et al 2019 and wu et al 2019 were performed with clays and sorption of tested compounds was not influenced by the organic matter content and other components of soils sorption of both compounds fex and irb was positively affected by car neutral which is in agreement with the increased sorption of fex and irb when it was mostly in a neural form in hl hca dca sorption of both compounds was also positively affected by cit strongly sorbed positively charged compound which agrees with our presumptions on the other hand simultaneous sorption of cli mostly positively charged compound negatively influenced sorption of fex and irb thus our hypothesis that positively charged molecules should positively affect fex and irb sorption in soils has not been confirmed 3 5 categorization of soils according to the kf values and trends in changes of sorption affinities by other compounds the principal component analysis carried out for the freundlich sorption coefficients resulted from the single compound application fig 3 showed very similar sorption behavior of all compounds in soils developed on loess hch gp hl and marlite schs substrates and diverse behavior in the other three soils the principal component analyses carried out for the δkf values for a particular compound indicated different soil categories for each compound not shown the analyses carried out for the δkf values for all compounds grouped the soils as follows schs hch and gp hl ae and hca and dca fig 3 this division corresponds to specific ranges of potential soil reactions phkcl and phcacl2 in table 2 affecting the forms of the compounds and driving sorption mechanisms and partly also the sorption affinities soil categorization clearly follows different soil substrates and overall soil chemical and physical qualities similar grouping of the same soils was observed when assessing dissipations of 5 pharmaceuticals trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole clindamycin atenolol and metoprolol kodešová et al 2016 and degradations of 3 pharmaceuticals trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin and formations of their transformation products koba et al 2017 however kodešová et al 2016 did not observe a similar behavior when evaluating kf coefficients for these 5 compounds it was concluded that while pharmaceutical dissipation half lives were controlled by overall soil quality their sorption affinities were mainly controlled by particular soil chemical properties our new results can indicate that sorption behavior of tested compounds in multicomponent systems is more complex and a definition of a soil type and substrate plays a greater role 3 6 implication for assessment of compounds mobility in vadose zone and their availability for plants the lowest sorption in soils i e the highest mobility in soils for a single compound table 3 was observed for sul kf 1 5 1 6 cm3 n μg1 1 n g 1 followed by car 2 8 1 1 irb 3 1 2 9 cli 9 2 5 1 fex 30 14 and cit 161 893 177 359 the impact of simultaneous sorption of other compounds on sul sorption figs 2 and s8 was in some soils large but the overall influence in the mixture without cit was relatively low average δkf of 7 similarly the influence on sorption of car in the mixture was relatively low average δkf of 11 the negative influence on sorption was observed also for cli average δkf of 16 on the other hand the increase in sorption affinity of compounds in mixture was observed for fex and irb average δkf of 63 and 67 respectively thus while sul car and cli in multiple compound solutions can be more mobile in the vadose zone than for single compound solutions fex and irb can be less mobile as mentioned above section 2 3 the concentrations used in this study were one to three order of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations behaviors of compounds that occur in the vadose zone in lower concentrations can differ as also noted above alternatively competitive or cooperative behaviors of compounds can be assessed using the kd coefficients calculated for the selected concentrations ceq fig s10 the kd values evaluated for fex in hch increased with the decreasing ceq values for n 1 and decreased for n 1 all kd values for each combination of compounds showed either increase or decrease the absolute values of δkd computed for constant n 1 15 increased with the decreasing ceq values the δkd values resulted for the variable n values were more variable the increasing and decreasing trend with the decreasing ceq values for n 1 and n 1 respectively assuming an uncertainty in optimized kf and n values the resulting kd and δkd values cannot be used for assessing behavior of compounds in multiple compound solutions it should be also mentioned that another important factor influencing sorption and mobility of pharmaceuticals in soils is organic matter dissolved in soil water solution dom which can affect behavior of compounds in soils in two ways first compound can be attached to dom and next transported with dom migrated through the vadose zone second dissolved organic matter can compete with an organic compound for the soil sorption sites and thus reduces sorption of the tested compound or on the other hand can increase its sorption due to the formation of complexes between compounds and dom these affects can be more pronounced in the case of dom dissolved from various soil amendments or sorbent itself rich in organic matter as biochar farm biosolids and sewage sludge or present in irrigation water e g chen et al 2017 he et al 2019 jia et al 2018 maoz and chefetz 2010 wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 this factor was neglected in this study due to two reasons the soil organic matter content was mostly low and thus fraction of dom was likely also low concentrations of compounds were large the dom influence can be likely more significant when the substances are applied to soils from their standard sources e g treated wastewater sewage sludge farm biosolids i e in mixture with other compounds including dom and in the environmental relevant concentrations furthermore compound s behavior can be also positively or negatively influenced be presence of dissolved inorganic cations e g hu et al 2019 therefore additional studies are needed to discover behaviors of compounds applied into soil in the environmental relevant concentrations of all soil solution constituents however the proposed methodology allowing assessment of trends in decreases or increases in the kf sorption coefficients for the average n value can be used to estimate behaviors of compounds in these systems the spread of tested contaminants in the environment mostly corresponds to their sorption affinity to soils and sediments sul due to its low sorption in soils table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 can quickly migrate in soils and sediments sul can rapidly dissipate in topsoils e g dissipation half lives dt50 of 8 0 3 3 days kodešová et al 2016 but its dissipation half lives in subsoils can be high e g 66 and 152 days in loess and sand respectively kodešová et al 2016 therefore once sul occurs in subsurface layers can easily migrate in the subsurface water environment which has been confirmed by its frequent occurrence in groundwaters e g fram and belitz 2011 godfrey et al 2007 li 2014 and loos et al 2010 it has been also documented that sul and its metabolites can be also taken up by plants however they uptake and translocation in plant bodies is due to its mostly negatively charged molecules limited e g ahmed et al 2015 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a malchi et al 2014 and wu et al 2013 car due to its low sorption affinity in soils table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 and also great persistency in soils and sediments e g dt50 mostly greater than 1000 days kodešová et al 2016 is a highly mobile compound in the subsurface water environment therefore this compound frequently occurs in groundwaters e g fram and belitz 2011 fisher et al 2016 godfrey et al 2007 kruc et al 2019 li 2014 huntscha et al 2012 loos et al 2010 radovic et al 2015 it has been also documented that car is freely take up by plants translocated accumulated but also transformed in plant bodies e g goldstein et al 2014 hurtado et al 2016 klement et al 2020 kodešová et al 2019a 2019b malchi et al 2014 montemurro et al 2017 mordechay et al 2018 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2013 sorption of irb in soils table 2 or klement et al 2018 strongly depends on soils conditions it can be either very low soils developed on loess or high dca ae the dissipation half lives of irb 9 27 7 days reported by iranzo et al 2018 in the composted sludge from the waste water treatment plant showed low or moderated stability their values were similar or slightly lower than values measured for our soils 24 4 3 5 days not published data a potential of irb to migrate in the subsurface water environment is moderate or low respectively to our knowledge there is no study documenting an occurrence of irb in groundwaters no uptake of irb from the sewage sludge applied into 7 soils as a soil amendment was found by kodešová et al 2019b assuming the sorption coefficients table 2 or kodešová et al 2015 and the dt50 values of 23 23 days kodešová et al 2016 for cli cli should not extensively migrate in the vadose zone a competition with other compounds for the same sorption sites can reduce its sorption but its sorption is due to mostly positively charged molecules still relatively high therefore this compound has not been probably detected in groundwaters e g de jongh et al 2012 kruc et al 2019 a potential uptake of cli by plants is likely very limited for instance kodešová et al 2019b reported no uptake of cli and very low uptakes of its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide from the sewage sludge in 7 soils sorption of fex in soils table 2 or klement et al 2018 is relatively high and its stability in soils is moderate dt50 of 24 21 days not published data thus its mobility in the vadose zone seems to be very low for instance kruc et al 2019 found fex in river water but not in riverbank filtrations on the other hand fischer et al 2016 found fex in shallow ground water due to the wastewater disposal negligible uptakes of fex from the sewage sludge were reported by kodešová et al 2019b cit should be due to its very large sorption practically immobile in the subsurface water environment however fick et al 2009 found low concentrations of cit in 3 of 6 monitoring wells likely due to a very high concentrations of cit in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant and in river water gottschall et al 2012 found low concentrations of cit in groundwater after the application of dewatered municipal biosolids to a field it has been also shown that cit can be taken up by plants e g kodešová et al 2019b one of the reasons could be a very high stability in the soil environment dt50 values of 152 54 days not published data another reason can be the concave shape of the sorption isotherms i e n 1 which indicates lower sorption affinity of cit for its low concentration in solution 4 conclusions in this study the procedure to compare general trends in sorption isotherms evaluated for a single compound in soils and affected by presence by other compounds was proposed and tested for 6 pharmaceuticals and 7 soils the results for the bi solute systems showed that sorption of both compounds can increase i e a synergic effect for both compounds sorption of the first and second can increase and decrease respectively i e a synergic effect for one and antagonistic for the other and sorption of both can decrease i e an antagonistic effect for both compounds the results also showed that the sorption of compounds in specific bi solute systems can be synergic in certain soils and can be antagonistic in other soils which depended on the form of their molecules this is likely the reason why summary of previous findings provided inconsistent information about expected behavior of compounds in their mixtures the tested soils were according to the changes in compound s sorption affinities clustered in to 3 groups which mainly corresponded to specific ranges of potential soil reactions affecting the form of the molecules and driving sorption mechanisms and partly also with the substrate and sorption affinities these findings showed that the sorption behavior of such organic compounds studied in a single soil cannot be extrapolated to other soil conditions and must always be examined in several soil samples representing particular groups of soils specifically affecting the sorption of these organic compounds the correlation analyses showed that despite sorption being either positively or negatively influenced by other compound s in solution the freundlich sorption coefficients kf evaluated for a particular compound were always correlated with the same soil properties these findings indicated that the general trends in the kf coefficients evaluated for various combinations of compounds in different soils remain unchanged thus these soil properties can be used to assess soils according to the potential mobility of a specific compound in these soils e g klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 the evaluated percentages characterizing the impact of the multiple solute systems on sorption of compounds provided information about trends in different soil groups these values can be used to estimate potential increase or decrease in sorption affinities of tested compounds evaluated for a single compound and certain soil material related to a particular soil group such approach can be applied for estimated e g klement et al 2018 kodešová et al 2015 as well as measured adsorption isotherms and can be adopted in various environmental studies evaluating migration of these compounds in the water environment adjusted estimates of compound s sorption coefficients for multiple solute systems can for instance improve the predictive ability of mathematical models simulating transport of contaminants in the vadose zone and subsequent groundwater contamination however new studies are needed to assess compounds behaviors and to test this procedure under the environmentally relevant concentrations impact of other compounds in soil solution e g

1491,the transport of pollutants inside the groundwater system is profoundly affected by absorption and transmission via colloid or soil particles therefore it is essential to investigate the significant pollutants such as hexavalent chromium cr vi transfer in the presence of colloid particles that can facilitate or retain this transfer for this purpose an experiment is carried out in a saturated porous media column to study the bentonite concentration flow velocity and sand grain size effects on co transport of cr vi with bentonite the results of this study demonstrated that the colloid particles facilitate the transfer of cr vi by 30 in 200 mg l bentonite colloids concentration the amount of transmitted cr vi is decreased by increasing the bentonite colloids concentration from 200 mg l to 300 mg l as the flow velocity increased from 2 cm min to 3 3 cm min the amount of transferred cr vi increased by 7 the results show that with reducing the sand grain size the amount of transmitted bentonite and cr vi is reduced that this effect is more sensible in bentonite transport as a result it can be noted that the bentonite colloidal particles according to its concentration and experimental conditions may facilitate or retain the cr vi transport and sand gradation has a significant impact on colloid and pollutant transmission keywords hexavalent chromium bentonite sand gradation colloid concentration column experiment 1 introduction groundwater pollution is often the result of human activities any activity that leads to the diffusion of chemicals or wastes into the environment has the potential to contaminate the groundwater when groundwater is polluted its cleaning will be difficult and expensive burri et al 2019 many processes can affect the fate and transport of pollution in the groundwater some of these essential processes are transport absorption and biological decomposition transport occurs when pollutants travel with groundwater absorption occurs when pollutants link themselves to soil or colloid particles absorption can slow down or sometimes facilitate the movement of pollution in groundwater biological degradation occurs when microorganisms use hazardous substances as an energy source speight 2019 migration and transport of colloid particles are present in natural porous media as an engineering concern in groundwater pollution ghiasi et al 2020 these colloid particles are often derived from clay minerals iron oxides and aluminum silicate and natural organic substances sen and khilar 2006 many researchers have worked on the transport of pollutants colloid particles and also their interactions most studies have concluded that the colloidal particles facilitate the pollutants transport in groundwater magee et al 1991 roy and dzombak 1996 puls and powell 1992 saiers and hornberger 1996 kersting et al 1999 kretzschmar et al 1999 sen et al 2002a 2002b zhuang et al 2003 de jonge et al 2004 šimůnek et al 2006 cheng et al 2016 emerson et al 2016 benhabib et al 2017 ma et al 2017 snousy et al 2018 however some have stated that in certain conditions the colloidal particles have a negative impact on the pollutants transport and causing adsorbed pollutant to the particles trap between the grains bekhit et al 2006 bekhit et al 2009 sen and khilar 2006 kheirabadi et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2020 peng et al 2017 in the previous studies with column experiment the effect of different parameters and conditions were investigated such as ph ion strength flow velocity particle size and colloid concentration ryan and elimelech 1996 roy and dzombak 1997 um and papelis 2002 torkzaban et al 2015 roy and dzombak 1996 empirically found that the reduction of ion resistance could be the cause of colloid mobility saiers and hornberger 1999 experimentally reported that colloid mobility increases with increasing ph and flow velocity bradford et al 2002 investigated the physical factors influencing the transport of colloid in the wet condition their results showed that the amount of trapped colloid and colloid output concentration are highly dependent on the soil grain size and colloid size bennacer et al 2017 investigated the coupled effects of ionic strength particle size and flow velocity on transport and deposition of suspended particles in saturated porous media ge et al 2018 studied the role of u vi concentration ph and ionic strength on co transport of u vi and colloids and showed won et al 2019 illustrated that large colloidal particles lead to clogging and reduce pollutant transport he et al 2019 demonstrated the increasing silver nanoparticles transmission occurred in lower particles diameter sizes li et al 2019 perused the fe colloid co transport under hydrochemical and hydrodynamic condition they showed that increasing the silicon concentration and humic acid colloids promote and inhibit fe transport respectively they used three porous media with the same average diameter and different specific area and concluded that the porous media with the highest specific area has the lowest fe transport despite numerous experiments in this area the effects of different conditions and parameters on pollutant transport in the presence of colloid particles have been limited only to investigating the effects of ionic strength and ph and there are little studies perused other parameters effect therefore it is essential to investigate the effects of other important parameters such as flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on pollutant and colloids co transport which a few articles studied some of these parameters effect in recent years yang et al 2019a b heavy metals have high absorbance properties morsali et al 2019 and could be transported to groundwater by soil or colloid particles anthropogenic activities such as electroplating leather tanning wood preservation can release large amounts of cr vi in liquid and solid waste forms patterson 1985 the cr vi is a significant pollutant in groundwater because of its highly toxic and highly soluble in water and availability of transport to long distances in the groundwater somasundaram et al 2011 so the presence of colloid particles could have a remarkable role in cr vi transmission in groundwater thus the main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of colloid particles presence on the transport of cr vi and the effect of flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on cr vi and colloids co transport 2 materials and methods the chromium cr vi transfer in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles experiment is done in a laboratory column the schematic experiment setup has been demonstrated in fig 1 preparing the experimental setup materials used and how the experiment was conducted were all based on the standards mentioned in the guidelining protocol for soil column experiments assessing fate and transport of trace organics gibert et al 2014 and procedure of bradford et al 2002 experiment in the following sections the experimental procedures were explained 2 1 column experiment a plexiglass column with a length of 50 cm an inner diameter of 4 8 cm and the outer diameter of 5 cm were used in the experiments the beginning of the column is closed and the end of it is open the water flow was upward and the water injection point has 1 cm distance from the bottom for uniform distribution of solute in column cross section the first 5 cm was filled with coarse sand particles the water velocity inside the column was regulated by the peristaltic pump the cr vi and bentonite are combined in a tank this mixture was injected at a distance of 5 cm from the beginning of the column the first sampling point is 5 cm above the injection point i e 10 cm distance from the beginning of the column 2 2 colloid particles bentonite was used as the colloid particles bentonite properties have been shown in table 1 in order to prepare the bentonite mixture a certain amount of bentonite was added to water and then the solution was obtained using the ultrasonic bath parsonic 11 s machine in order to measure the bentonite concentration the turbidity of the samples was measured li et al 2016 different concentrations of bentonite were prepared and the turbidity of samples was measured using hach dr 2000 device the relationship between the concentration of bentonite and turbidity value was then obtained this calibration curve was used to estimate the bentonite particles concentration in the study the main concentration of the colloid particles was 200 mg l and selected based on literature metreveli and frimmel 2007 2 3 pollutant cr vi was selected as a pollutant in this study because of its importance in the groundwater cr vi properties have been shown in table 1 the concentration of cr vi is measured using hach dr 5000 device the range of measurable concentration by this device is 0 01 to 0 7 mg l 2 4 porous media natural sand was used as a porous media in this study three different uniform soil particles were used the average diameter of aggregates size was between 4 75 mm and 2 36 mm agr 1 between 2 36 mm and 1 18 mm agr 2 and between 1 18 and 0 60 mm agr 3 which were obtained from astm standard sieve numbers 4 8 16 and 30 respectively the three aggregates were first washed properly and were placed in the oven for 24 h to dry properties of three aggregates have been demonstrated in table 2 2 5 running the test water flows from bottom to top and at the specified velocity in order to estimate the time of the entire experiment a color solution methyl orange was first injected into the column and the breakthrough curve was analyzed the experiment and sampling time was determined based on the duration time from the arrival of the first colored particles to the column outlet until the full distribution after each color test the water was passed faster through the column to remove the effect of colored material the experiment was done in two steps including transport of cr vi with bentonite and investigating the effect of three parameters the prepared mixture bentonite cr vi or their combination with uniform velocity was injected into the column and the samples were taken as 10 ml volume the cells volume of dr 2000 and dr 5000 devices was 25 ml and 10 ml for dr 2000 device samples volume bring up to 25 ml the samples bentonite and cr vi concentration were measured in less than one hour after the experiment ended finally the effect of three parameters including flow velocity size of aggregates and colloidal concentration were investigated on the transport of cr vi with bentonite test 2 6 bentonite concentration calibration as mentioned the turbidity of the samples was used to measure the bentonite concentration in order to obtain the relationship between the turbidity and the bentonite concentration in samples specific colloidal mixture were produced in 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l concentrations and then their turbidity was measured by using the dr 2000 spectrophotometer the calibration curve of the bentonite concentration is demonstrated in fig 2 as a result the obtained relationship for the estimation of the bentonite concentration with high accuracy is as follow 1 bentonite concentration mg l turbidity 1 1265 0 6918 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr vi transport cr vi transfer experiment was carried out in the saturated porous media without bentonite colloidal particles as a first test a sampling of this experiment was in 330 390 480 600 780 and 1020 s after running the test begins the 330 s and 1020s sampling times are times of colored material first particles arrival to the end of the column and colored material thoroughly mixed at the end of the column respectively the other sampling times and increasing time intervals have been selected due to decreasing distributing velocity over time this test repeated for three times to check the experiment and personal errors the cr vi transfer breakthrough curve btc and error bars are shown in fig 3 the horizontal axial variable is time with a unit of seconds and the vertical axial variable is the ratio of output cr vi concentration c to cr vi initial concentration c0 the fig 3 shows that the transport cr vi at the outlet is increased rapidly in the first 600 s and reaches a constant value after completing advection and diffusion processes in the column finally the constant concentration is almost 0 6 times of input concentration and the remaining pollutants particles are adhered to the sand particles and trapped in the pores the small range of error bars illustrating the low impact of experiment errors on test results 3 2 cr vi with bentonite transport the transport of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles was carried out in order to investigate the effect of these particles on the transfer of cr vi in porous media this test repeated three times also the co transport of cr vi and bentonite colloidal particles btc has been shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that with the presence of bentonite colloid particles the amount of cr vi transferred value has increased 1 6 times in the saturated porous media this value is reduced to 1 2 times at the end of the experiment because the colloid particles filled the pores between the sand particles therefore the presence of bentonite colloid particles tends to facilitate the transport of cr vi to approximately 1 3 times also the colloid particles transmission for a long time in the saturated porous media results in the lower pore volume between the sand particles and then reduction of particle transfer such as the pollutants sticking to the colloid particles the colloidal particles presence effect on pollution transport has been provided in recent studies the 200 mg l concentration of kaolinite increases cesium transport by 12 saiers and hornberger 1996 in order to investigate the individual transmitting of cr vi in presence of bentonite colloidal particles an additional test have been done in one sample of the test results after reading the cr vi concentration the bentonite colloidal particles were completely removed using a filter paper and the cr vi concentration has been reread the results of this test showed that the cr vi concentration in the filtered sample decreased by almost 35 from the primary sample so approximately 35 of cr vi particles were attached to colloidal particles and 65 have been transmitted individually in the next sections the effect of different bentonite concentration grain size distribution and pore velocity is discussed 3 3 effects of experimental conditions and parameters 3 3 1 velocity the effect of velocity on colloid particles transport has been studied in past researches in this study the effect of velocity on the transfer of cr vi in the presence of bentonite was investigated the experiment was carried out with three velocities of 2 2 7 and 3 3 cm min the results are shown in fig 5 in order to better compare the three curves the pore volume parameter is used in the horizontal axis since the three curves are different in velocity and time of the experiments this parameter makes it possible to compare three curves in one scale fig 5 shows that with the increase in the velocity the higher amount of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloid particles is transmitted and the ratio of cr vi concentration to the input concentration reaches the final value faster by increasing the velocity from 2 cm min to 3 3 cm min the amount of transferred cr vi increased by 7 this value at the beginning of the test is higher than the end of the test the increase in the flow rate causes fewer cr vi and bentonite particles to get stuck in holes between the sand particles and the more massive amount of particles can be transferred this phenomenon can be observed in the increase of c c0 in fig 5 by increasing the flow rate extra hydrodynamic shear stress will be occurred on sand surfaces and increase mobile particles both colloid and pollutant particles by desorption of adsorbed colloids yin et al 2010 as a result by increasing the flow velocity the rate of cr vi and bentonite particles adhering to sand grains is reduced and more of them transferred the velocity effect has been demonstrated by some studies chen et al 2018a 2018b bennacer et al 2017 saiers and hornberger 1996 bennacer et al 2017 have shown by increasing flow velocity for two times transport of suspended particles increases by 4 3 3 2 bentonite concentration the effect of bentonite concentrations investigated by testing three bentonite concentrations of 100 200 and 300 mg l fig 6 shows the cr vi breakthrough curves of these three bentonite concentrations this graph shows that by increasing the concentration from 100 to 200 mg l a more massive amount of cr vi has been transmitted 20 more transmission and the colloid particles facilitate the cr vi transport however by increasing the bentonite concentration from 200 to 300 mg l cr vi transport is reduced by 10 the colloid particles will facilitate the pollutants transport until a specific colloid concentration and beyond this concentration the amount of transferred cr vi is reduced because the colloid particles and their adsorbed cr vi are more likely to get caught between the sand particles in high concentrations this issue has been discussed in recent studies sen et al 2002a 2002b sen and khilar 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2015 surface filtration inner blocking and attachment occur for colloidal particles clogging in porous media inner blocking is the result of colloidal particles high concentration ye et al 2019 fig 7 is the conceptual schematic of colloid concentration effect according to fig 7 the more presence of colloidal particles causes more pollutant adsorption and transmission by colloids but the excess amount of colloidal particles leads to inner blocking and colloidal particles clogging and then reducing in adsorbed pollutant particles therefore there is an optimum concentration of colloid particles in which the pollutant transport would be maximum due to recent studies ionic strength ph porous media particles diameter flow velocity and colloid particles diameter can affect colloid transport and retention sen and khilar 2006 so the optimum concentration of colloid particles is a function of these parameters for the current study this optimum bentonite concentration is between 200 and 300 mg l 3 3 3 sand grain size effect the effect of the three different sand grain size agr 1 agr 2 and agr 3 was tested on both bentonite colloids and cr vi transport the effect of three different grain sizes on the transfer of bentonite is shown in fig 8 the horizontal axial variable is pore volume and the vertical axial variable is the ratio of bentonite concentration changes cc on bentonite input concentration cc0 fig 8 demonstrated that by reducing the sand grain size a lower amount of bentonite had been transmitted by increasing the size of the particles from agr 2 to agr 1 the amount of transferred bentonite colloid particles was almost quadrupled at the beginning of the test and 1 3 times at the end of the experiment by increasing the particle diameter from agr 3 to agr 1 the bentonite transmission is almost 3 5 times increased the smaller particles diameter have lower pore volume and therefore pore volumes filled more quickly so with the reduction of particle diameter the colloid particles are less transferred because by reducing the size of sand grains the size of pore volumes reduced and the inner blocking phenomenon occurred in low colloid concentration so colloid particles are trapped more between the sand particles fig 9 indicates the reduction of cr vi transfer in return for reducing the sand grain size particles due to the reduction in the pore volume between the sand particles by reducing the diameter of the particles from agr 1 to agr 2 the amount of transferred cr vi decrease by 15 and by reducing the diameter from agr 1 to agr 3 it decreases by 30 however in this case because the cr vi particles are also transferred directly apart from adhering to the bentonite colloid particles the sand particles diameter has less effect than the colloid particles therefore the sand grain size has more effect on the transport of bentonite colloid particles and because some cr vi particles are transmitted by sticking to the bentonite colloid particles it has less effect on the transport of cr vi the porous media particles size effect has been reported by grolimund et al 1998 ngueleu et al 2013 gavrilescu 2014 molnar et al 2015 fujita and kobayashi 2016 chen et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2019 and li et al 2019 4 conclusion colloidal particles can facilitate or retain pollutant transmission in groundwater and its presence and concentration variation could have a remarkable effect on significant groundwater pollution transmission such as cr vi also the physical properties groundwater environment and groundwater velocity are effective in transmitting pollution to groundwater therefore the transport of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles was studied in an experimental column filled with sand furthermore the effect of colloidal particles presence on the transport of pollutant effects of flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on cr vi transport is investigated the results of the study can be expressed in forwarding items the turbidity of the samples and their bentonite colloidal particles concentration have a direct relationship with each other so bentonite concentration can be estimated by samples turbidity with low error presence of bentonite colloidal particles will facilitate the cr vi transmission in porous media by 30 increasing the bentonite concentration leads to inner blocking and reduce the possibility of cr vi particles transferring increasing the flow velocity increases the cr vi transport in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles smaller sand grain particles diameter leads to occurring inner blocking in low colloid concentration reduction the pore volume between sand particles and decreased the bentonite colloidal particles transmission as the amount of cr vi transport is carried out by adhering to bentonite colloidal particles cr vi transport is also reduced therefore it can be concluded that if the pore volume decreases with sand grain size reduction the lower amount of bentonite is transferred and it decreases the amount of transmitted cr vi because some cr vi particles adhered to bentonite colloid particles also by increasing the concentration of bentonite according to inner blocking more of these particles are attached to the sand particles and leads to pore volume clogging and reducing the transport of cr vi as a result it can be noted that the colloid particles facilitate the pollutant transport but in certain conditions this facilitating convert to retaining author statement b g completed this study as part of his phd thesis under the supervision of m h n and advisery of a m m the paper was written by b g while technical

1491,the transport of pollutants inside the groundwater system is profoundly affected by absorption and transmission via colloid or soil particles therefore it is essential to investigate the significant pollutants such as hexavalent chromium cr vi transfer in the presence of colloid particles that can facilitate or retain this transfer for this purpose an experiment is carried out in a saturated porous media column to study the bentonite concentration flow velocity and sand grain size effects on co transport of cr vi with bentonite the results of this study demonstrated that the colloid particles facilitate the transfer of cr vi by 30 in 200 mg l bentonite colloids concentration the amount of transmitted cr vi is decreased by increasing the bentonite colloids concentration from 200 mg l to 300 mg l as the flow velocity increased from 2 cm min to 3 3 cm min the amount of transferred cr vi increased by 7 the results show that with reducing the sand grain size the amount of transmitted bentonite and cr vi is reduced that this effect is more sensible in bentonite transport as a result it can be noted that the bentonite colloidal particles according to its concentration and experimental conditions may facilitate or retain the cr vi transport and sand gradation has a significant impact on colloid and pollutant transmission keywords hexavalent chromium bentonite sand gradation colloid concentration column experiment 1 introduction groundwater pollution is often the result of human activities any activity that leads to the diffusion of chemicals or wastes into the environment has the potential to contaminate the groundwater when groundwater is polluted its cleaning will be difficult and expensive burri et al 2019 many processes can affect the fate and transport of pollution in the groundwater some of these essential processes are transport absorption and biological decomposition transport occurs when pollutants travel with groundwater absorption occurs when pollutants link themselves to soil or colloid particles absorption can slow down or sometimes facilitate the movement of pollution in groundwater biological degradation occurs when microorganisms use hazardous substances as an energy source speight 2019 migration and transport of colloid particles are present in natural porous media as an engineering concern in groundwater pollution ghiasi et al 2020 these colloid particles are often derived from clay minerals iron oxides and aluminum silicate and natural organic substances sen and khilar 2006 many researchers have worked on the transport of pollutants colloid particles and also their interactions most studies have concluded that the colloidal particles facilitate the pollutants transport in groundwater magee et al 1991 roy and dzombak 1996 puls and powell 1992 saiers and hornberger 1996 kersting et al 1999 kretzschmar et al 1999 sen et al 2002a 2002b zhuang et al 2003 de jonge et al 2004 šimůnek et al 2006 cheng et al 2016 emerson et al 2016 benhabib et al 2017 ma et al 2017 snousy et al 2018 however some have stated that in certain conditions the colloidal particles have a negative impact on the pollutants transport and causing adsorbed pollutant to the particles trap between the grains bekhit et al 2006 bekhit et al 2009 sen and khilar 2006 kheirabadi et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2020 peng et al 2017 in the previous studies with column experiment the effect of different parameters and conditions were investigated such as ph ion strength flow velocity particle size and colloid concentration ryan and elimelech 1996 roy and dzombak 1997 um and papelis 2002 torkzaban et al 2015 roy and dzombak 1996 empirically found that the reduction of ion resistance could be the cause of colloid mobility saiers and hornberger 1999 experimentally reported that colloid mobility increases with increasing ph and flow velocity bradford et al 2002 investigated the physical factors influencing the transport of colloid in the wet condition their results showed that the amount of trapped colloid and colloid output concentration are highly dependent on the soil grain size and colloid size bennacer et al 2017 investigated the coupled effects of ionic strength particle size and flow velocity on transport and deposition of suspended particles in saturated porous media ge et al 2018 studied the role of u vi concentration ph and ionic strength on co transport of u vi and colloids and showed won et al 2019 illustrated that large colloidal particles lead to clogging and reduce pollutant transport he et al 2019 demonstrated the increasing silver nanoparticles transmission occurred in lower particles diameter sizes li et al 2019 perused the fe colloid co transport under hydrochemical and hydrodynamic condition they showed that increasing the silicon concentration and humic acid colloids promote and inhibit fe transport respectively they used three porous media with the same average diameter and different specific area and concluded that the porous media with the highest specific area has the lowest fe transport despite numerous experiments in this area the effects of different conditions and parameters on pollutant transport in the presence of colloid particles have been limited only to investigating the effects of ionic strength and ph and there are little studies perused other parameters effect therefore it is essential to investigate the effects of other important parameters such as flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on pollutant and colloids co transport which a few articles studied some of these parameters effect in recent years yang et al 2019a b heavy metals have high absorbance properties morsali et al 2019 and could be transported to groundwater by soil or colloid particles anthropogenic activities such as electroplating leather tanning wood preservation can release large amounts of cr vi in liquid and solid waste forms patterson 1985 the cr vi is a significant pollutant in groundwater because of its highly toxic and highly soluble in water and availability of transport to long distances in the groundwater somasundaram et al 2011 so the presence of colloid particles could have a remarkable role in cr vi transmission in groundwater thus the main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of colloid particles presence on the transport of cr vi and the effect of flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on cr vi and colloids co transport 2 materials and methods the chromium cr vi transfer in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles experiment is done in a laboratory column the schematic experiment setup has been demonstrated in fig 1 preparing the experimental setup materials used and how the experiment was conducted were all based on the standards mentioned in the guidelining protocol for soil column experiments assessing fate and transport of trace organics gibert et al 2014 and procedure of bradford et al 2002 experiment in the following sections the experimental procedures were explained 2 1 column experiment a plexiglass column with a length of 50 cm an inner diameter of 4 8 cm and the outer diameter of 5 cm were used in the experiments the beginning of the column is closed and the end of it is open the water flow was upward and the water injection point has 1 cm distance from the bottom for uniform distribution of solute in column cross section the first 5 cm was filled with coarse sand particles the water velocity inside the column was regulated by the peristaltic pump the cr vi and bentonite are combined in a tank this mixture was injected at a distance of 5 cm from the beginning of the column the first sampling point is 5 cm above the injection point i e 10 cm distance from the beginning of the column 2 2 colloid particles bentonite was used as the colloid particles bentonite properties have been shown in table 1 in order to prepare the bentonite mixture a certain amount of bentonite was added to water and then the solution was obtained using the ultrasonic bath parsonic 11 s machine in order to measure the bentonite concentration the turbidity of the samples was measured li et al 2016 different concentrations of bentonite were prepared and the turbidity of samples was measured using hach dr 2000 device the relationship between the concentration of bentonite and turbidity value was then obtained this calibration curve was used to estimate the bentonite particles concentration in the study the main concentration of the colloid particles was 200 mg l and selected based on literature metreveli and frimmel 2007 2 3 pollutant cr vi was selected as a pollutant in this study because of its importance in the groundwater cr vi properties have been shown in table 1 the concentration of cr vi is measured using hach dr 5000 device the range of measurable concentration by this device is 0 01 to 0 7 mg l 2 4 porous media natural sand was used as a porous media in this study three different uniform soil particles were used the average diameter of aggregates size was between 4 75 mm and 2 36 mm agr 1 between 2 36 mm and 1 18 mm agr 2 and between 1 18 and 0 60 mm agr 3 which were obtained from astm standard sieve numbers 4 8 16 and 30 respectively the three aggregates were first washed properly and were placed in the oven for 24 h to dry properties of three aggregates have been demonstrated in table 2 2 5 running the test water flows from bottom to top and at the specified velocity in order to estimate the time of the entire experiment a color solution methyl orange was first injected into the column and the breakthrough curve was analyzed the experiment and sampling time was determined based on the duration time from the arrival of the first colored particles to the column outlet until the full distribution after each color test the water was passed faster through the column to remove the effect of colored material the experiment was done in two steps including transport of cr vi with bentonite and investigating the effect of three parameters the prepared mixture bentonite cr vi or their combination with uniform velocity was injected into the column and the samples were taken as 10 ml volume the cells volume of dr 2000 and dr 5000 devices was 25 ml and 10 ml for dr 2000 device samples volume bring up to 25 ml the samples bentonite and cr vi concentration were measured in less than one hour after the experiment ended finally the effect of three parameters including flow velocity size of aggregates and colloidal concentration were investigated on the transport of cr vi with bentonite test 2 6 bentonite concentration calibration as mentioned the turbidity of the samples was used to measure the bentonite concentration in order to obtain the relationship between the turbidity and the bentonite concentration in samples specific colloidal mixture were produced in 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l concentrations and then their turbidity was measured by using the dr 2000 spectrophotometer the calibration curve of the bentonite concentration is demonstrated in fig 2 as a result the obtained relationship for the estimation of the bentonite concentration with high accuracy is as follow 1 bentonite concentration mg l turbidity 1 1265 0 6918 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr vi transport cr vi transfer experiment was carried out in the saturated porous media without bentonite colloidal particles as a first test a sampling of this experiment was in 330 390 480 600 780 and 1020 s after running the test begins the 330 s and 1020s sampling times are times of colored material first particles arrival to the end of the column and colored material thoroughly mixed at the end of the column respectively the other sampling times and increasing time intervals have been selected due to decreasing distributing velocity over time this test repeated for three times to check the experiment and personal errors the cr vi transfer breakthrough curve btc and error bars are shown in fig 3 the horizontal axial variable is time with a unit of seconds and the vertical axial variable is the ratio of output cr vi concentration c to cr vi initial concentration c0 the fig 3 shows that the transport cr vi at the outlet is increased rapidly in the first 600 s and reaches a constant value after completing advection and diffusion processes in the column finally the constant concentration is almost 0 6 times of input concentration and the remaining pollutants particles are adhered to the sand particles and trapped in the pores the small range of error bars illustrating the low impact of experiment errors on test results 3 2 cr vi with bentonite transport the transport of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles was carried out in order to investigate the effect of these particles on the transfer of cr vi in porous media this test repeated three times also the co transport of cr vi and bentonite colloidal particles btc has been shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that with the presence of bentonite colloid particles the amount of cr vi transferred value has increased 1 6 times in the saturated porous media this value is reduced to 1 2 times at the end of the experiment because the colloid particles filled the pores between the sand particles therefore the presence of bentonite colloid particles tends to facilitate the transport of cr vi to approximately 1 3 times also the colloid particles transmission for a long time in the saturated porous media results in the lower pore volume between the sand particles and then reduction of particle transfer such as the pollutants sticking to the colloid particles the colloidal particles presence effect on pollution transport has been provided in recent studies the 200 mg l concentration of kaolinite increases cesium transport by 12 saiers and hornberger 1996 in order to investigate the individual transmitting of cr vi in presence of bentonite colloidal particles an additional test have been done in one sample of the test results after reading the cr vi concentration the bentonite colloidal particles were completely removed using a filter paper and the cr vi concentration has been reread the results of this test showed that the cr vi concentration in the filtered sample decreased by almost 35 from the primary sample so approximately 35 of cr vi particles were attached to colloidal particles and 65 have been transmitted individually in the next sections the effect of different bentonite concentration grain size distribution and pore velocity is discussed 3 3 effects of experimental conditions and parameters 3 3 1 velocity the effect of velocity on colloid particles transport has been studied in past researches in this study the effect of velocity on the transfer of cr vi in the presence of bentonite was investigated the experiment was carried out with three velocities of 2 2 7 and 3 3 cm min the results are shown in fig 5 in order to better compare the three curves the pore volume parameter is used in the horizontal axis since the three curves are different in velocity and time of the experiments this parameter makes it possible to compare three curves in one scale fig 5 shows that with the increase in the velocity the higher amount of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloid particles is transmitted and the ratio of cr vi concentration to the input concentration reaches the final value faster by increasing the velocity from 2 cm min to 3 3 cm min the amount of transferred cr vi increased by 7 this value at the beginning of the test is higher than the end of the test the increase in the flow rate causes fewer cr vi and bentonite particles to get stuck in holes between the sand particles and the more massive amount of particles can be transferred this phenomenon can be observed in the increase of c c0 in fig 5 by increasing the flow rate extra hydrodynamic shear stress will be occurred on sand surfaces and increase mobile particles both colloid and pollutant particles by desorption of adsorbed colloids yin et al 2010 as a result by increasing the flow velocity the rate of cr vi and bentonite particles adhering to sand grains is reduced and more of them transferred the velocity effect has been demonstrated by some studies chen et al 2018a 2018b bennacer et al 2017 saiers and hornberger 1996 bennacer et al 2017 have shown by increasing flow velocity for two times transport of suspended particles increases by 4 3 3 2 bentonite concentration the effect of bentonite concentrations investigated by testing three bentonite concentrations of 100 200 and 300 mg l fig 6 shows the cr vi breakthrough curves of these three bentonite concentrations this graph shows that by increasing the concentration from 100 to 200 mg l a more massive amount of cr vi has been transmitted 20 more transmission and the colloid particles facilitate the cr vi transport however by increasing the bentonite concentration from 200 to 300 mg l cr vi transport is reduced by 10 the colloid particles will facilitate the pollutants transport until a specific colloid concentration and beyond this concentration the amount of transferred cr vi is reduced because the colloid particles and their adsorbed cr vi are more likely to get caught between the sand particles in high concentrations this issue has been discussed in recent studies sen et al 2002a 2002b sen and khilar 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2015 surface filtration inner blocking and attachment occur for colloidal particles clogging in porous media inner blocking is the result of colloidal particles high concentration ye et al 2019 fig 7 is the conceptual schematic of colloid concentration effect according to fig 7 the more presence of colloidal particles causes more pollutant adsorption and transmission by colloids but the excess amount of colloidal particles leads to inner blocking and colloidal particles clogging and then reducing in adsorbed pollutant particles therefore there is an optimum concentration of colloid particles in which the pollutant transport would be maximum due to recent studies ionic strength ph porous media particles diameter flow velocity and colloid particles diameter can affect colloid transport and retention sen and khilar 2006 so the optimum concentration of colloid particles is a function of these parameters for the current study this optimum bentonite concentration is between 200 and 300 mg l 3 3 3 sand grain size effect the effect of the three different sand grain size agr 1 agr 2 and agr 3 was tested on both bentonite colloids and cr vi transport the effect of three different grain sizes on the transfer of bentonite is shown in fig 8 the horizontal axial variable is pore volume and the vertical axial variable is the ratio of bentonite concentration changes cc on bentonite input concentration cc0 fig 8 demonstrated that by reducing the sand grain size a lower amount of bentonite had been transmitted by increasing the size of the particles from agr 2 to agr 1 the amount of transferred bentonite colloid particles was almost quadrupled at the beginning of the test and 1 3 times at the end of the experiment by increasing the particle diameter from agr 3 to agr 1 the bentonite transmission is almost 3 5 times increased the smaller particles diameter have lower pore volume and therefore pore volumes filled more quickly so with the reduction of particle diameter the colloid particles are less transferred because by reducing the size of sand grains the size of pore volumes reduced and the inner blocking phenomenon occurred in low colloid concentration so colloid particles are trapped more between the sand particles fig 9 indicates the reduction of cr vi transfer in return for reducing the sand grain size particles due to the reduction in the pore volume between the sand particles by reducing the diameter of the particles from agr 1 to agr 2 the amount of transferred cr vi decrease by 15 and by reducing the diameter from agr 1 to agr 3 it decreases by 30 however in this case because the cr vi particles are also transferred directly apart from adhering to the bentonite colloid particles the sand particles diameter has less effect than the colloid particles therefore the sand grain size has more effect on the transport of bentonite colloid particles and because some cr vi particles are transmitted by sticking to the bentonite colloid particles it has less effect on the transport of cr vi the porous media particles size effect has been reported by grolimund et al 1998 ngueleu et al 2013 gavrilescu 2014 molnar et al 2015 fujita and kobayashi 2016 chen et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2019 and li et al 2019 4 conclusion colloidal particles can facilitate or retain pollutant transmission in groundwater and its presence and concentration variation could have a remarkable effect on significant groundwater pollution transmission such as cr vi also the physical properties groundwater environment and groundwater velocity are effective in transmitting pollution to groundwater therefore the transport of cr vi in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles was studied in an experimental column filled with sand furthermore the effect of colloidal particles presence on the transport of pollutant effects of flow velocity aggregates size and colloid concentration on cr vi transport is investigated the results of the study can be expressed in forwarding items the turbidity of the samples and their bentonite colloidal particles concentration have a direct relationship with each other so bentonite concentration can be estimated by samples turbidity with low error presence of bentonite colloidal particles will facilitate the cr vi transmission in porous media by 30 increasing the bentonite concentration leads to inner blocking and reduce the possibility of cr vi particles transferring increasing the flow velocity increases the cr vi transport in the presence of bentonite colloidal particles smaller sand grain particles diameter leads to occurring inner blocking in low colloid concentration reduction the pore volume between sand particles and decreased the bentonite colloidal particles transmission as the amount of cr vi transport is carried out by adhering to bentonite colloidal particles cr vi transport is also reduced therefore it can be concluded that if the pore volume decreases with sand grain size reduction the lower amount of bentonite is transferred and it decreases the amount of transmitted cr vi because some cr vi particles adhered to bentonite colloid particles also by increasing the concentration of bentonite according to inner blocking more of these particles are attached to the sand particles and leads to pore volume clogging and reducing the transport of cr vi as a result it can be noted that the colloid particles facilitate the pollutant transport but in certain conditions this facilitating convert to retaining author statement b g completed this study as part of his phd thesis under the supervision of m h n and advisery of a m m the paper was written by b g while technical

biodegradation of btex in the lnapl source zone the enrichment of 13c in aromatic compounds dissolved in groundwater compared to the corresponding compounds in lnapl indicate that csia can provide valuable information regarding biodegradation the isotopic analysis of methane provides direct indication of oxidation mediated by aquifer oxygenation the 13c co2 values indicate methanogenesis prevailing at the border and aerobic biodegradation in the center of the lnapl source zone importantly the isotopic results allowed major improvements in the previously developed conceptual model supporting the existence of oxic and anoxic environments within the lnapl source zone keywords btex mineralization methanogenesis isotopic analysis csia interphase mass transfer 1 introduction hydrocarbon derived fuels represent an import source of energy worldwide the accidental release of hydrocarbons because of leakage of storage tanks or pipeline rupture represents a typical situation for groundwater contamination whenever that a large volume of petroleum fuel is spilled it can migrate down the unsaturated zone and reach and saturate zone forming often a light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls in the vadose zone petroleum is distributed as a non aqueous phase in the pores of the soil on the top of the saturated zone lnapl may fill pores and forming a multiphasic context with oil gas and water when the water table is fluctuating and may releases soluble compounds mainly benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes or btex to the water by interphase mass transfer because btex compounds released to groundwater are relatively water soluble and mobile predicting their fate in the saturated zone is crucial for establishing remediation goals and actions in petroleum contaminated site management under favorable conditions the degradation of hydrocarbons driven by microbial activity may efficiently limit the spread of btex plumes the isotopic enrichment of aromatic hydrocarbons related to microbial mediated breakdown is supported by many field and laboratory studies blum et al 2009 dorer et al 2016 feisthauer et al 2012 mancini et al 2003 morasch et al 2002 schmidt et al 2004 vogt et al 2008 in the last two decades the technique of compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has become a well established method to quantitatively assess the biodegradation of contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater vogt et al 2016 this methodology is based on the finding that bacteria mediated degradation consumes preferentially the molecules with the lighter isotope species e g 12c and 1h because the activation energy to break covalent bond containing light isotopes is lower compared to that of heavier substituents leading to stable isotope fractionation of the target molecules consequently csia represents a valuable tool to identify and measure the extent of naturally induced contaminant reduction in groundwater elsner et al 2005 additionally isotope fractionation may also be induced by some physical process such as diffusion to vapor phase bouchard et al 2008 transverse dispersion rolle et al 2010 and sorption schüth et al 2003 however the isotope fractionation due to phase partitioning is small kopinke et al 2017 and therefore unlikely to have large effects in the field kopinke et al 2005 in the lnapl source zone entrapped hydrocarbons in the pore system can release soluble compounds over a timescale of decades by interphase mass transfer processes eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b thornton et al 2013 the mass transfer of btex from napl to groundwater by diffusion does not generate detectable isotopic fractionation aeppli et al 2009 heße et al 2014 under these conditions csia may not offer conclusive evidence of hydrocarbon mineralization and only a few studies have focused on isotopic characterization dominated by mass transfer phenomena aeppli et al 2009 heße et al 2014 large proportion of btex released by mass transfer is biodegraded within the lnapl source zone by distinct metabolic pathways among them methanogenesis is known to require more energy than pathways with other electron acceptors from a thermodynamic point of view however several reports have demonstrated that hydrocarbons can be mineralized by methanogenesis owing to syntrophic relationships of microbial consortia composed of fermenters and methanogens gieg et al 2014 lueders 2017 morris et al 2013 this process can become dominant if other energetically more favorable electron acceptors are no longer available methanogenesis has been identified as an important or even dominant process related to hydrocarbon degradation in subsurface environments garg et al 2017 jiménez et al 2016 ramos et al 2014 reinhard et al 2005 teramoto and chang 2019 methanogenic degradation of hydrocarbons by a consortium of bacteria and archaea initiates with fermentation reaction causing the hydrocarbons to degrade into acetate and hydrogen in the initial step zengler methanogens form methane via pathways that are commonly classified based on the type of carbon precursor utilized by them the primary methanogenic pathways are referred to as hydrogenotrophic carbonate reduction acetotrophic fermentation and methylotrophic which is be characterized by the isotope composition of methane whiticar 1999 the investigation on isotopic ch4 in hydrocarbon contaminated sites has been conducted by several researchers balabane et al 1987 games et al 1978 revesz et al 1995 whiticar and faber 1986 the methanogenesis pathway promotes the enrichment of remaining hydrocarbon simultaneously producing ch4 highly depleted in 13c isotopically light methane and co2 highly enriched in 13c isotopically heavy carbon dioxide amos et al 2011 conrad et al 1997 feisthauer et al 2011 however if methane is oxidized by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria the reaction promotes isotopic enrichment of methane and isotopic depletion of co2 along the methane gradient because of the strong stable carbon and hydrogen isotope effect on bacterial methane oxidation amos et al 2011 feisthauer et al 2011 revesz et al 1995 whiticar and faber 1986 in addition the mineralization of hydrocarbons which are usually depleted in 13c owing to their principally biological origin generates isotopically light co2 conrad et al 1997 revesz et al 1995 whiticar 1999 hence at sites contaminated by hydrocarbons the carbon isotope signature of co2 can be affected by several different processes the oxidation of hydrocarbons and methane produces light co2 whereas methanogenesis produces heavy co2 background co2 can stem from sediment carbonates soil respiration or the atmosphere adding variable 13c signatures into the pool conrad et al 1997 the seasonal precipitation pattern at our site lead to large fluctuation of the water table and vertical smearing of the lnapls in the sediment column e g durnford et al 1991 steffy et al 1998 the upward movement of a water table driven by groundwater recharge causes the entrapment of air in the pores in the uppermost portion of the saturated zone faybishenko 1995 fry et al 1997 williams and oostrom 2000 marinas et al 2013 mcleod et al 2015 the entrapped air releases oxygen into the groundwater mcleod et al 2015 williams and oostrom 2000 which may support oxidation processes the zone containing the pores that are partially filled by entrapped air is known as the quasi saturated zone faybishenko 1995 the air entrapment is associated with the presence of excess air that is the gases including oxygen are present at concentrations higher than those required for equilibrium with atmosphere holocher et al 2002 despite the potential impacts on the biogeochemistry of hydrocarbon biodegradation thus far the effects of aquifer oxygenation have not been investigated in detail the ability of the csia technique to assess the subsurface hydrocarbon biodegradation was demonstrated at numerous sites in temperate climates located in the northern hemisphere in subtropical and tropical climates distinct geochemical and hydrological features for example elevated groundwater temperature wide range fluctuating water table and abundance of iron in the aquifer sediment prevail and studies demonstrating the suitability of the csia technique under these conditions are limited the most prominent characteristic observed in the subtropical and tropical climates is non aqueous phase entrapment controlled by wide range water table fluctuation and elevated groundwater temperature which may cause increased biodegradation kinetics because of the lack of studies the applicability of the isotopic techniques in hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers in subtropical and tropical environments remain unclear to address this gap we aimed to evaluate for the first time the suitability of the csia technique in a jet fuel contaminated site situated in a subtropical climate by investigating the isotopic composition of btex in the aqueous and oil phases in addition we performed isotopic analyses of ch4 and co2 in the aqueous phase to trace the fate of ch4 produced by btex biodegradation under methanogenic conditions in the iron depleted zones 2 methods 2 1 site background 2 1 1 hydrogeology the study area is located in the municipality of paulínia são paulo brazil the cenozoic shallow aquifer is composed of clayey sands coarse sand lenses sandy clays and clayey silts bordignon et al 2016 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the geometry of the channelized sandy bodies and the widespread floodplain facies indicate a typical meandering river depositional environment dominated by flood plains teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b because hydraulic conductivity is intrinsically related to aquifer lithology a high variability in hydraulic conductivity is observed the values of hydraulic conductivities determined by slug tests performed on 64 monitoring wells range between 1 2 10 7 and 2 4 10 4 m s with a geometric mean of 2 8 10 5 m s teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the average hydraulic gradient is 0 0036 in the northeast region and increases to the southwest toward the discharge zone reaching a value of 0 0176 fig 1 shows the potentiometric map the inferred limit of the source zone and the locations of the monitoring and pumping wells in the study area a large quantity of jet fuel is present in the subsurface with an estimated volume of 520 m3 pede 2009 the long term monitoring of water table depth indicates that the water table fluctuates within a range of 3 5 m the maximum groundwater level is typically reached in may and falls steadily until december teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b due to the large annual fluctuation of the water table most of the monitoring wells were installed within 2 m of water column and 2 to 3 m of unsaturated zone resulting in filter length of 4 to 5 m in order to obtain more specific information from deeper intervals 2 or 3 m below the water table multi level wells with separated 1 m filter section were installed 2 1 2 groundwater remediation since 2005 a pump and treat remediation was operated in different modes initially it was operated through four pumping wells from 2008 to 2009 five additional wells were incorporated into the system from 2010 to 2011 the remediation was paused and from 2011 to the present operation resumed with 20 active pumping wells fig 1 to determine the limit of lnapl spread the plumes of the dissolved btex compounds were monitored a total of 104 monitoring wells were installed in an area of 264 600 m2 the lnapl recovery was possible only during the four dry years when the water table was sufficiently low pede 2009 the volume of water extracted varied between 1 8 and 27 m3 day the capture zone during the dry seasons is presented via potentiometric maps teramoto and chang 2018 2 1 3 distribution and solubilization of lnapl because of the large fluctuations of water table 4 m along 15 years the lnapl forms an entrapped phase below the water table as demonstrated in a recent investigation using laser induced fluorescence isler et al 2018 fig 2 presents the transect sw ne with 5 laser induced fluorescence lif tests 2 of them previously presented by isler et al 2018 lif 02 and lif 05 the lif tests show the upper and lower delimitation of the lnapl in pore system fig 2 importantly lif 01 does not show significant fluorescence until 14 8 m depth but the sediment samples collected in this point presented oil phase in samples collected during the drilling of monitoring wells the btex concentration in the aqueous phase reflects the concentration of these compounds in the entrapped lnapl teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b because the pores with high non aqueous saturation deplete slowly the concentration in regions with high saturation typically exhibits still high concentration in aqueous phase teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b 2 1 4 dissolved btex plume the high flow velocity should sustain the development of large dissolved plumes in response to the rapid advective movement of the water soluble compounds in the source zone however a noticeable feature of this site is that the narrow plumes of btex are developed by advective movement of solubilized btex and each liter of the plume is characterized by the presence of few micrograms teramoto and chang 2019 have suggested that the plume is rather short and relatively stable over time further high degradation kinetics contribute to stabilization of the plume despite its high flow velocity several studies have revealed that the rate of biodegradation of dissolved hydrocarbon increases with an increase in temperature with upper threshold reaching at approximately 35 c e g deeb and alvarez cohen 1999 alagappan and cowan 2004 yadav et al 2012 zeman et al 2014 likely the solubilization of btex plumes is constrained by elevated rates of biodegradation favored by high groundwater temperature which is approximately 26 c at this site teramoto and chang 2019 2 1 5 geochemistry and microbiology of lnapl source zone shallow groundwater is an open system buffered by the carbonate system particularly by high pco2 found in the unsaturated zone typical values of pco2 found in tropical regions range between 10 1 8 to 10 1 4 atm brook et al 1983 bordignon et al 2016 have shown that the co2 concentration in vadose and unsaturated zone is high reaching over 50 000 ppmv jet fuel is the main electron donor at this filed site and btex compounds are leaching from the lnapls and transported by ground water flow because of their higher solubility s than aliphatic hydrocarbons the seasonal dynamics of this system are a constraint for interpretation of geochemical and isotopic parameters for determination of natural attenuation processes as degradation and dissolution of contaminants are linked to changing conditions long term geochemical monitoring indicates high concentration of both fe2 and ch4 fig 3 supporting the iron reduction and methanogenesis as main mechanisms driving hydrocarbon mineralization teramoto and chang 2019 2 2 isotopic analysis to evaluate the isotopic compositions of aromatic compounds of lnapl eight floating oil samples were collected at monitoring wells in december 2014 using disposable bailer additionally one sample of fresh jet fuel was also analyzed to characterize the isotopic composition of btex and methane for both aqueous and oil phases we conducted three campaigns march 2015 april 2016 and december 2017 of groundwater sampling fig 4 the water samples were analyzed for btex compounds only in the first two sampling campaigns march 2015 and april 2016 and for methane in all three 2 2 1 determination of isotopic signature of btex compounds to address the isotopic characterization of btex compounds in the lnapl source zone samples of lnapl and groundwater were collected the lnapl samples were collected in the monitoring well during the second quarter of 2014 within the dry season using a disposable bailer the groundwater samples were collected in two sampling campaigns using low flow methodology epa 1996 in march 2015 and april 2016 during the wet season in these periods the water table is at its maximum level recorded in these years for isotope analysis of btex in the aqueous phase 1 l schott bottles were filled with groundwater and naoh pellets were added enough to maintain ph 12 to preserve the samples next in the lab the samples were subjected to extraction with 5 ml of n pentane for 7 h on a shaker table in a room maintained at 9 c and were kept to a ph between 10 and 12 following procedures described in the literature feisthauer et al 2012 the n pentane extracts were analyzed in a gas chromatograph gc model 7890a agilent technology that was coupled to a mass spectrometry system irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific germany and automatic sampler combi pal model ctc analytics the methods for stable isotope analysis was described by feisthauer et al 2012 the gc was equipped with a zb 1 column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 μm zebron for separation of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene isomers the initial temperature was set at 40 c held constant for 5 min then increased at 3 c min to 90 c and finally increased at 20 c min to 250 c where it was held for 3 min the helium flow was held constant at 2 ml min and 1 6 ml min for carbon and hydrogen measurements respectively for carbon stable isotope analysis the btex compounds were converted at 980 c on a cuo ni pt catalyst to water and carbon dioxide which was subsequently measured by irms for hydrogen isotope analysis the separated btex compounds were transformed at 1440 c in a ceramic tube gc pyrolysis thermo fisher scientific into graphite and molecular hydrogen gas which was subsequently analyzed by irms the most common expression for stable isotope ratios of a given compound is the deviation d x from an international standard the isotope values are reported as delta notation δ 13c in units per mil 1 δ 13 r sample r standard r standard x 1000 where r sample is the isotope ratio 13c 12c of the sample and r standard is the carbon stable isotope ratio of the standard as isotope shifts are usually in the per mil range they are by definition multiplied by a factor of 1000 the carbon and hydrogen isotopic signatures are reported as δ values in parts per thousand relative to international reference materials which are vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for carbon and standard mean ocean water smow for hydrogen coplen et al 2006 coplen 2011 schimmelmann et al 2016 for both carbon and hydrogen isotope measurements each sample was analyzed at least three times the results are reported as the mean in delta notation according to eq 1 together with the standard deviation 2 3 quantitative analysis of btex btex concentrations were determined in samples extracted with n pentane for isotope analysis see 2 2 the n pentane extracts were analyzed in a gas chromatograph gc model 7890a agilent technology equipped with an autosampler combi pal model ctc analytics and coupled to a mass spectrometer ms model 5975c agilent chromatographic conditions for gc ms concentration analysis were the same as described for isotopic analysis of btex compounds see 2 2 2 3 1 determination of isotopic signature of methane to determine the δ 13c of dissolved ch4 and co2 approximately 170 ml of groundwater were transferred into 200 ml serum bottles previously amended with approximately 20 g of nacl to reduce microbial metabolism and gas solubility favoring its partitioning to the headspace and the bottles were immediately closed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals samples were stored upside down at 4 c until the analysis directly before isotopic measurement the samples were acidified with hcl to reach ph 2 as described in the literature fischer et al 2004 subsequently headspace samples of 50 to 100 μl were injected into the gc equipped with a cp porabond q column 50 m 0 32 mm 0 5 μm varian and separated at a constant temperature of 40 c and a constant helium flow of 2 ml min as described in a recent study teramoto and chang 2019 each sample was analyzed at least three times to obtain the mean the standard deviation of the isotope value was typically better than 0 5 3 results 3 1 aqueous concentration of ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene during the sample collection for isotopic characterization the btex concentrations were measured in three sampling campaigns table 1 of the supplementary material and showed high variability the btex concentrations were measured in march 2015 and april 2016 fig 5 benzene and toluene were found in much lower concentration than ethylbenzene and xylenes btex concentrations are high in the center of the lnapl source zone and decrease with the groundwater flow toward the edges moreover btex concentrations are higher in wet season fig 5a e 5b than in dry season fig 5c in response to cyclic annual water table fluctuations teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b 3 2 isotopic analysis of btex within the source zone to evaluate the initial signature of btex compounds released into the aqueous phase we determined the isotopic signature of btex extracted from the oil phase under the assumption that the isotope signature of the residual fraction had not been altered by dissolution during the diffusion from lnapl to groundwater thullner et al 2013 table 1 presents the 13c for ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene in sampled lnapl showing an overall low variability in carbon isotope composition of less than one benzene and toluene concentrations were below the detection limit for isotope analysis and thus could not be used to evaluate the alteration of lnapl the variability of the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and xylenes in the lnapl was low and almost within the uncertainty of the analysis demonstrating that the isotope signatures of ethylbenzene and xylenes in the source were similar to those determined in the jet fuel fresh kerosene from the refinery site thus as expected the lnapl has conserved the isotope signature of the original jet fuel and the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and xylenes within the phase have not been altered by chemical or biological processes overtime to improve our understanding of the dynamics of mass transfer in the source zone we collected groundwater samples within the source zone during two sampling campaigns in march 2015 and april 2016 as presented in table 1 of the supplementary material the obtained results of δ 13c of ethylbenzene in aqueous phase indicate that two of six samples in the first sampling campaign and eight of eleven samples in the second sampling campaign deviate noticeably with respect to the carbon isotopic signature of this compound in lnapl 2 demonstrating an enrichment of the compound by biodegradation in the case of m p xylenes one sample was significantly enriched in only the first sampling campaign whereas the o xylene showed significant deviation in one sample in the second sampling campaign fig 3 in the case of the first campaign two of eight samples deviated more than 2 for ethylbenzene three samples for m p xylenes and none for o xylenes in the second campaign seven of eleven samples deviated more than 2 for ethylbenzene a lower enrichment of the isotope composition was observed for m p xylenes and o xylenes these results indicate specific trends of isotopic enrichment for the various compounds in general the results suggest that ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene show higher isotopic enrichment compared to these compounds in the lnapl phase table 1 which clearly indicate degradation at high and low water table three samples re pm 115b re pm 101b and re pm 81b collected in the first and second sampling campaigns show a positive shift beyond 2 for m p xylenes downgradient of the lnapl source zone the plume of the dissolved phase is small to negligible because the high temperature provides conditions for fast mineralization of btex teramoto and chang 2019 the 13c of the isotopic signatures determined in lnapl and groundwater samples collected in march 2015 and april 2016 were compared to quantify isotope enrichment fig 6 the medians of 13c btex in the aqueous phase are shifted to higher values demonstrating the isotopic enrichment mediated by bacterial degradation likewise the variances of measured 13c btex in the aqueous phase are higher than those measured in lnapl the increase of standard deviation of 13c btex in the aqueous phase may be associated with isotopic enrichment reflecting the extent of biodegradation this parameter can be used as a criterion to diagnose the biodegradation within the lnapl source zone 3 3 isotopes of ch4 and co2 the evaluation of methane isotopic signature changes provides a complementary view of btex mineralization the isotopic characterization of methane conducted in april 2015 march 2016 and december 2017 are presented in table 3 of the supplementary material the determination of δ 2h ch4 was possible in only 40 of the 89 collected samples in the three sampling campaigns because of low methane concentration in these groundwater samples particularly downgradient of the source zone the range of 13c methane fig 6 varies in the three sampling campaigns while the median possesses very low variation the values of measured δ 2h and 13c projected in diagram of whiticar 1999 indicate that all samples fall within the field of bacterial production and most of them within the fermentation field indicating that methanogenesis in the studied site is mainly acetoclastic fig 7 the δ 2h ch4 is related to δ 2h h2o according empirical relationship described in eq 2 whiticar 1999 2 δ 2 h ch 4 m δ 2 h h 2 o β where m is equal to 1 in the case of carbonate reduction and 0 25 in the case of fermentation the m parameter varies between 300 and 377 whiticar 1999 the groundwater in the studied region have respectively δ 2h and δ 18o nearly 42 and 7 chang et al 2020 thus the expected range of δ 2h ch4 varies between 310 5 and 387 5 typical of fermentative methanogenesis most of samples fall within the isotope field of the fermentation acetoclastic when the values of 13c co2 and 13c ch4 are projected in diagram presented by milkov and etiope 2018 fig 8 indicating that this mechanism represents the prevailing process associated with methane production because of the reduced concentration it was not possible to determine the δ 2h of methane in groundwater collected downgradient of lnapl source zone which hampered our interpretation the 13c ch4 values are in general more positive downgradient of the lnapl source zone than inside it suggesting an isotopic enrichment derived from methane oxidation along the flowlines notably the map of 13c co2 displays a clear zoning with the enriched δ 13c co2 values occupying the borders south and north of the lnapl source zone and the more depleted values in the center fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 isotope fractionation pattern of ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylenes the mass transfer of lnapls to the aqueous phase is a complex phenomenon that is controlled by flow velocity porosity height of smear zone and geometry of the bubble and ganglia of the entrapped lnapl mobile et al 2016 saba and illangasekare 2000 saenton and illangasekare 2007 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the variation in biodegradation indicated by the 13c pattern of contaminants in the two sampling campaigns conducted in may 2015 and april 2016 fig 4 may therefore be attributed to the variation of flow rate and biodegradation kinetics hence despite the continuous input of contaminants with the isotope composition of the source material during the interphase mass transfer from the lnaps our results showed a noticeable isotope enrichment of the compounds in aqueous phase compared to lnapl this suggests that the csia is able to validate the biodegradation within the water saturated zone close to the lnapl source zone the isotopic composition of btex in the aqueous phase varies with time and reflects the extent of biodegradation the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and m p xylene show a more prominent isotopic shift in may 2015 and a less extensive shift in april 2016 whereas o xylene shows stronger enrichment in april 2016 these results indicate that the different compounds follow distinct temporal trends reflecting differences in the mineralization or dissolution kinetics the low enrichment in some samples may also be related to aerobic biodegradation these mechanisms were shown to be associated with rather small carbon isotope effects ɛc 0 6 while the anaerobic hydroxylation of the side chain of ethylbenzene by the enzyme ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is characterized by noticeable carbon and hydrogen isotope effects εc 3 7 monooxygenases acting on aromatics have been divided into four different types ullrich and hofrichter 2007 carbon isotope fractionation effects associated with monooxygenation of the aromatic ring were shown to range from low to considerable probably due to the different reaction mechanisms of the different types of monooxygenases vogt et al 2018 4 2 isotope pattern of of dic and ch4 in aqueous phase the occurrence of anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons driven mainly by iron reduction and methanogenesis was previously demonstrated by detection of a large plume of fe ii and methane teramoto and chang 2019 the isotopically heavy dic in the border of lnapl source zone fig 8 indicates the occurrence of anaerobic biodegradation mainly due to methanogenesis in contrast the similarity of 13c dic to the average 13c btex value 25 5 for the lnapl in the center of the source zone fig 6 strongly indicates aerobic biodegradation in this area dic progressively gets depleted in δ 13c downgradient of the southern edge of the source zone most likely reflecting methane oxidation fig 8 this assumption challenged the intuitive conceptual model of methanogenic biodegradation prevalence in the center of the source zone and that of aerobic biodegradation at the edge these results strongly suggest the dominance of the methanogenesis reaction along the north and south edges of the lnapl source zone 4 3 development of a conceptual model the seasonal fluctuating water table and air entrapment results in changing redox conditions in the smear zone teramoto and chang 2019 on this site air entrapment is a seasonal and additional time varying driving force for biodegradation the seasonal pattern is typically found in tropical areas with large seasonal precipitation patterns governing fluctuations of the water table the isotopic data presented in this work in combination with microbiological data presented by hidalgo et al 2019 reinforces the importance of air entrapment and supports the reexamination of the conceptual model previously presented by teramoto and chang 2019 the main improvement over the previous geochemical conceptual model was the identification of an oxygenated region within the lnapl source zone created by air entrapment during water table rise the new conceptual model is schematically illustrated in fig 10 4 3 1 typical mineral phases and geochemistry of a pristine aquifer the pristine groundwater displays low mineralization electrical conductibility lower than 20 μs cm due to the reduced residence time and simplicity of aquifer mineralogy teramoto and chang 2019 the mineral phases that were identified in the studied aquifer were quartz sio2 kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 and goethite feo oh these are compatible with the lateritic nature of the studied aquifer because of the simplistic mineralogy and direct input of groundwater recharge the electrical conductivity is usually greater than 20 μs cm the speciation calculation of the pristine groundwater buffered by a pco2 level of 10 1 5 atm indicating a ph value of approximately 4 7 and an alkalinity value of less than 1 mg l which are similar to the field measurements 4 3 2 lnapl source zone the analyses of 16s rna metagenomic and isotopic analysis indicate the stratification of the redox zone as well as the coexistence both aerobic and anaerobic zones within the lnapl source zone fig 9 this finding is different from that in many field sites in temperate climates e g sutton et al 2013 fahrenfeld et al 2014 irianni renno et al 2016 where microbes and functional genes strictly related to anaerobic biodegradation within the saturated zone containing lnapl were most abundant the existence of an aerobic environment in the studied site is induced by fluctuation of the water table during groundwater recharge water invades the pores both air and lnapl are entrapped by capillary forces bellow the water table creating a temporal zone with aerobic niches in the water saturated zone unless the oxygen from air entrapment is consumed this oxygen is released in the water saturated zone by solubilization of entrapped air bubbles which will form aerobic niches in an otherwise anoxic environment this is explained by the abundance of aerobic and anaerobic microbes in the same zone stretching along the fluctuation of the water table the evaluation of the lif transect fig 2 crossing the lnapl source zone reveals that lnapl in the center of the source zone is distributed in the uppermost region of the saturated zone determined by water table fluctuation on the other hand in the areas of middle to southern edges of the source zone lnapl is strongly entrapped and smeared along the depth interval of water fluctuations and a major portion of lnapl is located at the top of the water table thus within the lnapl source zone there is a stratified environment in which oxic and anoxic zones coexist the direct evidence of oxygenation stratification was obtained by metagenomic and 16s rrna investigations presented by hidalgo et al 2019 as demonstrated in this work aerobic degraders of aliphatic and aromatic compounds member of the moraxellaceae family revealed by metagenomic analysis are found at the top of the saturated zone the metagenomic analysis identified genes for benzoate degradation via catechol benabcd and encoded for catechol 1 2 dioxygenase cata both associated with the moraxellaceae family were identified thus the aerobic biodegradation in the center of the source zone indicated by the measured 13c dic is related to the distribution of lnapl within the aerobic zone fig 10 on the other hand in the southern region of the source zone lnapl is mainly distributed below the oxygenated zone fig 10 and anaerobic biodegradation prevails the values of 13c dic in the southern source zone indicate anaerobic biodegradation and correspond with the high concentrations of ch4 and fe2 observed in this region fig 3 an anoxic environment prevails below the zone of bubble entrapment with average ph and alkalinity of nearly 5 62 and 44 05 mg l respectively teramoto and chang 2019 the co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways indicate the existence of both hydrocarbon pathways which lead to high concentration of fe2 and ch4 within the lnapl source zone fig 3 several studies e g chapelle and lovley 1992 cozzarelli et al 2001 schreiber et al 2004 miles et al 2008 have demonstrated that biodegradation under fe iii reduction and methanogenesis can occur in biogeochemical niches of the same zone showing compartmentation of the soil column according to previous works e g siegert et al 2011 kato et al 2012 zhuang et al 2015 the syntrophic metabolism related to methanogenesis is favored in presence of iron oxides under this condition the abundance of iron oxide observed at the edge of lnapl source zone favors the co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways in some places where the iron was depleted by reductive reactions related to hydrocarbon biodegradation methanogenesis dominates and the concentration of ch4 is higher while the concentration of fe2 is modest as observed in fig 3 in the center of lnapl source zone the concentration of both ch4 and fe2 are lower suggesting the prevalence of aerobic biodegradation the presence of oxygen at the aerobic zone inhibits the methanogenesis and the transition of aerobic to methanogenic zones is likely abrupt although genes related to methanogenic have not been found via metagenomic analysis hidalgo et al 2019 found genes related to the initial steps of methanogenesis as well as those involved in other general cell cycle reactions such as hdrb2 and hdrc2 encoding for heterodisulfide reductase enzyme complex hidalgo et al 2019 also found propionibacteriaceae and enterobacteriaceae families at a depth of 1 2 m below the water table and geobacteriaceae and peptococcaceae familie colonizing in situ microcosm installed 1 2 to 3 2 m bellow the water table this finding supports the existence of anoxic environment bellow the oxygenated zone 4 3 3 fe2 and ch4 plume a plume of fe2 and ch4 stretches downgradient from the lnapl source zone this zone is generated by advective migration of fe2 and ch4 produced by hydrocarbon biodegradation under iron and methanogenesis respectively these are transported with the water flow downgradient from the lnapl source zone the values of average ph alkalinity and electrical conductivity are significantly lower than those values observed in the lnapl source zone the fe2 and ch4 concentrations with alternating cycles of varying concentrations display an inverse trend with respect to fluctuation of the water table teramoto and chang 2019 interpreted this variation as changes in redox state of the aquifer due to the influx of oxygen during water table rise and consequent air entrapment in the uppermost portion of the saturated zone however this behavior may reflect a simple dilution during groundwater recharge when there is an input of clean water at the top of the saturated zone the 13c ch4 and 13c dic in the metabolic plume are similar to that in the southern region of the lnapl source zone fig 8 suggesting that the methane oxidation contribution of light co2 is not very pronounced on the contrary enrichment of 13c ch4 and fractionation of 13c dic is only visible at the edge of the ch4 plume because the lnapl middle to southern edge of the source zone is distributed below the oxygenated zone the produced ch4 and fe2 plumes are also distributed below this zone fig 9 the low oxygenation content prevents the fe2 oxidation and maintains the 13c ch4 and 13c dic values as relatively stable over long distances from source zone 5 conclusions the new insights provided by csia in the present study significantly enhance the previous findings at the study site with respect to the mechanism involved in the release and mineralization of hydrocarbons our results demonstrate that isotopic analysis of groundwater collected within the source zone can be applied to understand the overlap of mass transfer and biodegradation within the source zone the isotope and geochemical parameters were used to characterize natural attenuation process of lnapls with an aquifer in tropical areas lateritic soil columns and with typical large fluctuation of the water columns the water table fluctuation formation of a smear zone and entrapment of air lead to a compartmentation of the aquifer into temporal geochemical niches disturbing a clear geochemical zonation according to the availability of electron acceptors and donators the zones of aerobic iron reducing and methanogenic biodegradation were overlapping and indicating a strong spatial and temporal fluctuation correlated the precipitation pattern and rise and fall of the water table the results

1492,release of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex as components of the light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl contaminates soil and groundwater assessing the mechanisms of degradation and mineralization of btex in groundwater helps understand the migration of the dissolved plume enabling the reduction of risks to humans here we studied the fate of ethylbezene m p xylenes and o xylenes and the accompanying formation of methane in a cenozoic lateritic aquifer in brazil by compound specific carbon stable isotope analysis csia to gain insights into the complex dynamics of release and biodegradation of btex in the lnapl source zone the enrichment of 13c in aromatic compounds dissolved in groundwater compared to the corresponding compounds in lnapl indicate that csia can provide valuable information regarding biodegradation the isotopic analysis of methane provides direct indication of oxidation mediated by aquifer oxygenation the 13c co2 values indicate methanogenesis prevailing at the border and aerobic biodegradation in the center of the lnapl source zone importantly the isotopic results allowed major improvements in the previously developed conceptual model supporting the existence of oxic and anoxic environments within the lnapl source zone keywords btex mineralization methanogenesis isotopic analysis csia interphase mass transfer 1 introduction hydrocarbon derived fuels represent an import source of energy worldwide the accidental release of hydrocarbons because of leakage of storage tanks or pipeline rupture represents a typical situation for groundwater contamination whenever that a large volume of petroleum fuel is spilled it can migrate down the unsaturated zone and reach and saturate zone forming often a light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls in the vadose zone petroleum is distributed as a non aqueous phase in the pores of the soil on the top of the saturated zone lnapl may fill pores and forming a multiphasic context with oil gas and water when the water table is fluctuating and may releases soluble compounds mainly benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes or btex to the water by interphase mass transfer because btex compounds released to groundwater are relatively water soluble and mobile predicting their fate in the saturated zone is crucial for establishing remediation goals and actions in petroleum contaminated site management under favorable conditions the degradation of hydrocarbons driven by microbial activity may efficiently limit the spread of btex plumes the isotopic enrichment of aromatic hydrocarbons related to microbial mediated breakdown is supported by many field and laboratory studies blum et al 2009 dorer et al 2016 feisthauer et al 2012 mancini et al 2003 morasch et al 2002 schmidt et al 2004 vogt et al 2008 in the last two decades the technique of compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has become a well established method to quantitatively assess the biodegradation of contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater vogt et al 2016 this methodology is based on the finding that bacteria mediated degradation consumes preferentially the molecules with the lighter isotope species e g 12c and 1h because the activation energy to break covalent bond containing light isotopes is lower compared to that of heavier substituents leading to stable isotope fractionation of the target molecules consequently csia represents a valuable tool to identify and measure the extent of naturally induced contaminant reduction in groundwater elsner et al 2005 additionally isotope fractionation may also be induced by some physical process such as diffusion to vapor phase bouchard et al 2008 transverse dispersion rolle et al 2010 and sorption schüth et al 2003 however the isotope fractionation due to phase partitioning is small kopinke et al 2017 and therefore unlikely to have large effects in the field kopinke et al 2005 in the lnapl source zone entrapped hydrocarbons in the pore system can release soluble compounds over a timescale of decades by interphase mass transfer processes eberhardt and grathwohl 2002 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b thornton et al 2013 the mass transfer of btex from napl to groundwater by diffusion does not generate detectable isotopic fractionation aeppli et al 2009 heße et al 2014 under these conditions csia may not offer conclusive evidence of hydrocarbon mineralization and only a few studies have focused on isotopic characterization dominated by mass transfer phenomena aeppli et al 2009 heße et al 2014 large proportion of btex released by mass transfer is biodegraded within the lnapl source zone by distinct metabolic pathways among them methanogenesis is known to require more energy than pathways with other electron acceptors from a thermodynamic point of view however several reports have demonstrated that hydrocarbons can be mineralized by methanogenesis owing to syntrophic relationships of microbial consortia composed of fermenters and methanogens gieg et al 2014 lueders 2017 morris et al 2013 this process can become dominant if other energetically more favorable electron acceptors are no longer available methanogenesis has been identified as an important or even dominant process related to hydrocarbon degradation in subsurface environments garg et al 2017 jiménez et al 2016 ramos et al 2014 reinhard et al 2005 teramoto and chang 2019 methanogenic degradation of hydrocarbons by a consortium of bacteria and archaea initiates with fermentation reaction causing the hydrocarbons to degrade into acetate and hydrogen in the initial step zengler methanogens form methane via pathways that are commonly classified based on the type of carbon precursor utilized by them the primary methanogenic pathways are referred to as hydrogenotrophic carbonate reduction acetotrophic fermentation and methylotrophic which is be characterized by the isotope composition of methane whiticar 1999 the investigation on isotopic ch4 in hydrocarbon contaminated sites has been conducted by several researchers balabane et al 1987 games et al 1978 revesz et al 1995 whiticar and faber 1986 the methanogenesis pathway promotes the enrichment of remaining hydrocarbon simultaneously producing ch4 highly depleted in 13c isotopically light methane and co2 highly enriched in 13c isotopically heavy carbon dioxide amos et al 2011 conrad et al 1997 feisthauer et al 2011 however if methane is oxidized by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria the reaction promotes isotopic enrichment of methane and isotopic depletion of co2 along the methane gradient because of the strong stable carbon and hydrogen isotope effect on bacterial methane oxidation amos et al 2011 feisthauer et al 2011 revesz et al 1995 whiticar and faber 1986 in addition the mineralization of hydrocarbons which are usually depleted in 13c owing to their principally biological origin generates isotopically light co2 conrad et al 1997 revesz et al 1995 whiticar 1999 hence at sites contaminated by hydrocarbons the carbon isotope signature of co2 can be affected by several different processes the oxidation of hydrocarbons and methane produces light co2 whereas methanogenesis produces heavy co2 background co2 can stem from sediment carbonates soil respiration or the atmosphere adding variable 13c signatures into the pool conrad et al 1997 the seasonal precipitation pattern at our site lead to large fluctuation of the water table and vertical smearing of the lnapls in the sediment column e g durnford et al 1991 steffy et al 1998 the upward movement of a water table driven by groundwater recharge causes the entrapment of air in the pores in the uppermost portion of the saturated zone faybishenko 1995 fry et al 1997 williams and oostrom 2000 marinas et al 2013 mcleod et al 2015 the entrapped air releases oxygen into the groundwater mcleod et al 2015 williams and oostrom 2000 which may support oxidation processes the zone containing the pores that are partially filled by entrapped air is known as the quasi saturated zone faybishenko 1995 the air entrapment is associated with the presence of excess air that is the gases including oxygen are present at concentrations higher than those required for equilibrium with atmosphere holocher et al 2002 despite the potential impacts on the biogeochemistry of hydrocarbon biodegradation thus far the effects of aquifer oxygenation have not been investigated in detail the ability of the csia technique to assess the subsurface hydrocarbon biodegradation was demonstrated at numerous sites in temperate climates located in the northern hemisphere in subtropical and tropical climates distinct geochemical and hydrological features for example elevated groundwater temperature wide range fluctuating water table and abundance of iron in the aquifer sediment prevail and studies demonstrating the suitability of the csia technique under these conditions are limited the most prominent characteristic observed in the subtropical and tropical climates is non aqueous phase entrapment controlled by wide range water table fluctuation and elevated groundwater temperature which may cause increased biodegradation kinetics because of the lack of studies the applicability of the isotopic techniques in hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers in subtropical and tropical environments remain unclear to address this gap we aimed to evaluate for the first time the suitability of the csia technique in a jet fuel contaminated site situated in a subtropical climate by investigating the isotopic composition of btex in the aqueous and oil phases in addition we performed isotopic analyses of ch4 and co2 in the aqueous phase to trace the fate of ch4 produced by btex biodegradation under methanogenic conditions in the iron depleted zones 2 methods 2 1 site background 2 1 1 hydrogeology the study area is located in the municipality of paulínia são paulo brazil the cenozoic shallow aquifer is composed of clayey sands coarse sand lenses sandy clays and clayey silts bordignon et al 2016 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the geometry of the channelized sandy bodies and the widespread floodplain facies indicate a typical meandering river depositional environment dominated by flood plains teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b because hydraulic conductivity is intrinsically related to aquifer lithology a high variability in hydraulic conductivity is observed the values of hydraulic conductivities determined by slug tests performed on 64 monitoring wells range between 1 2 10 7 and 2 4 10 4 m s with a geometric mean of 2 8 10 5 m s teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the average hydraulic gradient is 0 0036 in the northeast region and increases to the southwest toward the discharge zone reaching a value of 0 0176 fig 1 shows the potentiometric map the inferred limit of the source zone and the locations of the monitoring and pumping wells in the study area a large quantity of jet fuel is present in the subsurface with an estimated volume of 520 m3 pede 2009 the long term monitoring of water table depth indicates that the water table fluctuates within a range of 3 5 m the maximum groundwater level is typically reached in may and falls steadily until december teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b due to the large annual fluctuation of the water table most of the monitoring wells were installed within 2 m of water column and 2 to 3 m of unsaturated zone resulting in filter length of 4 to 5 m in order to obtain more specific information from deeper intervals 2 or 3 m below the water table multi level wells with separated 1 m filter section were installed 2 1 2 groundwater remediation since 2005 a pump and treat remediation was operated in different modes initially it was operated through four pumping wells from 2008 to 2009 five additional wells were incorporated into the system from 2010 to 2011 the remediation was paused and from 2011 to the present operation resumed with 20 active pumping wells fig 1 to determine the limit of lnapl spread the plumes of the dissolved btex compounds were monitored a total of 104 monitoring wells were installed in an area of 264 600 m2 the lnapl recovery was possible only during the four dry years when the water table was sufficiently low pede 2009 the volume of water extracted varied between 1 8 and 27 m3 day the capture zone during the dry seasons is presented via potentiometric maps teramoto and chang 2018 2 1 3 distribution and solubilization of lnapl because of the large fluctuations of water table 4 m along 15 years the lnapl forms an entrapped phase below the water table as demonstrated in a recent investigation using laser induced fluorescence isler et al 2018 fig 2 presents the transect sw ne with 5 laser induced fluorescence lif tests 2 of them previously presented by isler et al 2018 lif 02 and lif 05 the lif tests show the upper and lower delimitation of the lnapl in pore system fig 2 importantly lif 01 does not show significant fluorescence until 14 8 m depth but the sediment samples collected in this point presented oil phase in samples collected during the drilling of monitoring wells the btex concentration in the aqueous phase reflects the concentration of these compounds in the entrapped lnapl teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b because the pores with high non aqueous saturation deplete slowly the concentration in regions with high saturation typically exhibits still high concentration in aqueous phase teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b 2 1 4 dissolved btex plume the high flow velocity should sustain the development of large dissolved plumes in response to the rapid advective movement of the water soluble compounds in the source zone however a noticeable feature of this site is that the narrow plumes of btex are developed by advective movement of solubilized btex and each liter of the plume is characterized by the presence of few micrograms teramoto and chang 2019 have suggested that the plume is rather short and relatively stable over time further high degradation kinetics contribute to stabilization of the plume despite its high flow velocity several studies have revealed that the rate of biodegradation of dissolved hydrocarbon increases with an increase in temperature with upper threshold reaching at approximately 35 c e g deeb and alvarez cohen 1999 alagappan and cowan 2004 yadav et al 2012 zeman et al 2014 likely the solubilization of btex plumes is constrained by elevated rates of biodegradation favored by high groundwater temperature which is approximately 26 c at this site teramoto and chang 2019 2 1 5 geochemistry and microbiology of lnapl source zone shallow groundwater is an open system buffered by the carbonate system particularly by high pco2 found in the unsaturated zone typical values of pco2 found in tropical regions range between 10 1 8 to 10 1 4 atm brook et al 1983 bordignon et al 2016 have shown that the co2 concentration in vadose and unsaturated zone is high reaching over 50 000 ppmv jet fuel is the main electron donor at this filed site and btex compounds are leaching from the lnapls and transported by ground water flow because of their higher solubility s than aliphatic hydrocarbons the seasonal dynamics of this system are a constraint for interpretation of geochemical and isotopic parameters for determination of natural attenuation processes as degradation and dissolution of contaminants are linked to changing conditions long term geochemical monitoring indicates high concentration of both fe2 and ch4 fig 3 supporting the iron reduction and methanogenesis as main mechanisms driving hydrocarbon mineralization teramoto and chang 2019 2 2 isotopic analysis to evaluate the isotopic compositions of aromatic compounds of lnapl eight floating oil samples were collected at monitoring wells in december 2014 using disposable bailer additionally one sample of fresh jet fuel was also analyzed to characterize the isotopic composition of btex and methane for both aqueous and oil phases we conducted three campaigns march 2015 april 2016 and december 2017 of groundwater sampling fig 4 the water samples were analyzed for btex compounds only in the first two sampling campaigns march 2015 and april 2016 and for methane in all three 2 2 1 determination of isotopic signature of btex compounds to address the isotopic characterization of btex compounds in the lnapl source zone samples of lnapl and groundwater were collected the lnapl samples were collected in the monitoring well during the second quarter of 2014 within the dry season using a disposable bailer the groundwater samples were collected in two sampling campaigns using low flow methodology epa 1996 in march 2015 and april 2016 during the wet season in these periods the water table is at its maximum level recorded in these years for isotope analysis of btex in the aqueous phase 1 l schott bottles were filled with groundwater and naoh pellets were added enough to maintain ph 12 to preserve the samples next in the lab the samples were subjected to extraction with 5 ml of n pentane for 7 h on a shaker table in a room maintained at 9 c and were kept to a ph between 10 and 12 following procedures described in the literature feisthauer et al 2012 the n pentane extracts were analyzed in a gas chromatograph gc model 7890a agilent technology that was coupled to a mass spectrometry system irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific germany and automatic sampler combi pal model ctc analytics the methods for stable isotope analysis was described by feisthauer et al 2012 the gc was equipped with a zb 1 column 60 m 0 32 mm 1 μm zebron for separation of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene isomers the initial temperature was set at 40 c held constant for 5 min then increased at 3 c min to 90 c and finally increased at 20 c min to 250 c where it was held for 3 min the helium flow was held constant at 2 ml min and 1 6 ml min for carbon and hydrogen measurements respectively for carbon stable isotope analysis the btex compounds were converted at 980 c on a cuo ni pt catalyst to water and carbon dioxide which was subsequently measured by irms for hydrogen isotope analysis the separated btex compounds were transformed at 1440 c in a ceramic tube gc pyrolysis thermo fisher scientific into graphite and molecular hydrogen gas which was subsequently analyzed by irms the most common expression for stable isotope ratios of a given compound is the deviation d x from an international standard the isotope values are reported as delta notation δ 13c in units per mil 1 δ 13 r sample r standard r standard x 1000 where r sample is the isotope ratio 13c 12c of the sample and r standard is the carbon stable isotope ratio of the standard as isotope shifts are usually in the per mil range they are by definition multiplied by a factor of 1000 the carbon and hydrogen isotopic signatures are reported as δ values in parts per thousand relative to international reference materials which are vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for carbon and standard mean ocean water smow for hydrogen coplen et al 2006 coplen 2011 schimmelmann et al 2016 for both carbon and hydrogen isotope measurements each sample was analyzed at least three times the results are reported as the mean in delta notation according to eq 1 together with the standard deviation 2 3 quantitative analysis of btex btex concentrations were determined in samples extracted with n pentane for isotope analysis see 2 2 the n pentane extracts were analyzed in a gas chromatograph gc model 7890a agilent technology equipped with an autosampler combi pal model ctc analytics and coupled to a mass spectrometer ms model 5975c agilent chromatographic conditions for gc ms concentration analysis were the same as described for isotopic analysis of btex compounds see 2 2 2 3 1 determination of isotopic signature of methane to determine the δ 13c of dissolved ch4 and co2 approximately 170 ml of groundwater were transferred into 200 ml serum bottles previously amended with approximately 20 g of nacl to reduce microbial metabolism and gas solubility favoring its partitioning to the headspace and the bottles were immediately closed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals samples were stored upside down at 4 c until the analysis directly before isotopic measurement the samples were acidified with hcl to reach ph 2 as described in the literature fischer et al 2004 subsequently headspace samples of 50 to 100 μl were injected into the gc equipped with a cp porabond q column 50 m 0 32 mm 0 5 μm varian and separated at a constant temperature of 40 c and a constant helium flow of 2 ml min as described in a recent study teramoto and chang 2019 each sample was analyzed at least three times to obtain the mean the standard deviation of the isotope value was typically better than 0 5 3 results 3 1 aqueous concentration of ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene during the sample collection for isotopic characterization the btex concentrations were measured in three sampling campaigns table 1 of the supplementary material and showed high variability the btex concentrations were measured in march 2015 and april 2016 fig 5 benzene and toluene were found in much lower concentration than ethylbenzene and xylenes btex concentrations are high in the center of the lnapl source zone and decrease with the groundwater flow toward the edges moreover btex concentrations are higher in wet season fig 5a e 5b than in dry season fig 5c in response to cyclic annual water table fluctuations teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b 3 2 isotopic analysis of btex within the source zone to evaluate the initial signature of btex compounds released into the aqueous phase we determined the isotopic signature of btex extracted from the oil phase under the assumption that the isotope signature of the residual fraction had not been altered by dissolution during the diffusion from lnapl to groundwater thullner et al 2013 table 1 presents the 13c for ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene in sampled lnapl showing an overall low variability in carbon isotope composition of less than one benzene and toluene concentrations were below the detection limit for isotope analysis and thus could not be used to evaluate the alteration of lnapl the variability of the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and xylenes in the lnapl was low and almost within the uncertainty of the analysis demonstrating that the isotope signatures of ethylbenzene and xylenes in the source were similar to those determined in the jet fuel fresh kerosene from the refinery site thus as expected the lnapl has conserved the isotope signature of the original jet fuel and the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and xylenes within the phase have not been altered by chemical or biological processes overtime to improve our understanding of the dynamics of mass transfer in the source zone we collected groundwater samples within the source zone during two sampling campaigns in march 2015 and april 2016 as presented in table 1 of the supplementary material the obtained results of δ 13c of ethylbenzene in aqueous phase indicate that two of six samples in the first sampling campaign and eight of eleven samples in the second sampling campaign deviate noticeably with respect to the carbon isotopic signature of this compound in lnapl 2 demonstrating an enrichment of the compound by biodegradation in the case of m p xylenes one sample was significantly enriched in only the first sampling campaign whereas the o xylene showed significant deviation in one sample in the second sampling campaign fig 3 in the case of the first campaign two of eight samples deviated more than 2 for ethylbenzene three samples for m p xylenes and none for o xylenes in the second campaign seven of eleven samples deviated more than 2 for ethylbenzene a lower enrichment of the isotope composition was observed for m p xylenes and o xylenes these results indicate specific trends of isotopic enrichment for the various compounds in general the results suggest that ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylene show higher isotopic enrichment compared to these compounds in the lnapl phase table 1 which clearly indicate degradation at high and low water table three samples re pm 115b re pm 101b and re pm 81b collected in the first and second sampling campaigns show a positive shift beyond 2 for m p xylenes downgradient of the lnapl source zone the plume of the dissolved phase is small to negligible because the high temperature provides conditions for fast mineralization of btex teramoto and chang 2019 the 13c of the isotopic signatures determined in lnapl and groundwater samples collected in march 2015 and april 2016 were compared to quantify isotope enrichment fig 6 the medians of 13c btex in the aqueous phase are shifted to higher values demonstrating the isotopic enrichment mediated by bacterial degradation likewise the variances of measured 13c btex in the aqueous phase are higher than those measured in lnapl the increase of standard deviation of 13c btex in the aqueous phase may be associated with isotopic enrichment reflecting the extent of biodegradation this parameter can be used as a criterion to diagnose the biodegradation within the lnapl source zone 3 3 isotopes of ch4 and co2 the evaluation of methane isotopic signature changes provides a complementary view of btex mineralization the isotopic characterization of methane conducted in april 2015 march 2016 and december 2017 are presented in table 3 of the supplementary material the determination of δ 2h ch4 was possible in only 40 of the 89 collected samples in the three sampling campaigns because of low methane concentration in these groundwater samples particularly downgradient of the source zone the range of 13c methane fig 6 varies in the three sampling campaigns while the median possesses very low variation the values of measured δ 2h and 13c projected in diagram of whiticar 1999 indicate that all samples fall within the field of bacterial production and most of them within the fermentation field indicating that methanogenesis in the studied site is mainly acetoclastic fig 7 the δ 2h ch4 is related to δ 2h h2o according empirical relationship described in eq 2 whiticar 1999 2 δ 2 h ch 4 m δ 2 h h 2 o β where m is equal to 1 in the case of carbonate reduction and 0 25 in the case of fermentation the m parameter varies between 300 and 377 whiticar 1999 the groundwater in the studied region have respectively δ 2h and δ 18o nearly 42 and 7 chang et al 2020 thus the expected range of δ 2h ch4 varies between 310 5 and 387 5 typical of fermentative methanogenesis most of samples fall within the isotope field of the fermentation acetoclastic when the values of 13c co2 and 13c ch4 are projected in diagram presented by milkov and etiope 2018 fig 8 indicating that this mechanism represents the prevailing process associated with methane production because of the reduced concentration it was not possible to determine the δ 2h of methane in groundwater collected downgradient of lnapl source zone which hampered our interpretation the 13c ch4 values are in general more positive downgradient of the lnapl source zone than inside it suggesting an isotopic enrichment derived from methane oxidation along the flowlines notably the map of 13c co2 displays a clear zoning with the enriched δ 13c co2 values occupying the borders south and north of the lnapl source zone and the more depleted values in the center fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 isotope fractionation pattern of ethylbenzene m p xylenes and o xylenes the mass transfer of lnapls to the aqueous phase is a complex phenomenon that is controlled by flow velocity porosity height of smear zone and geometry of the bubble and ganglia of the entrapped lnapl mobile et al 2016 saba and illangasekare 2000 saenton and illangasekare 2007 teramoto and chang 2017a 2017b the variation in biodegradation indicated by the 13c pattern of contaminants in the two sampling campaigns conducted in may 2015 and april 2016 fig 4 may therefore be attributed to the variation of flow rate and biodegradation kinetics hence despite the continuous input of contaminants with the isotope composition of the source material during the interphase mass transfer from the lnaps our results showed a noticeable isotope enrichment of the compounds in aqueous phase compared to lnapl this suggests that the csia is able to validate the biodegradation within the water saturated zone close to the lnapl source zone the isotopic composition of btex in the aqueous phase varies with time and reflects the extent of biodegradation the isotope composition of ethylbenzene and m p xylene show a more prominent isotopic shift in may 2015 and a less extensive shift in april 2016 whereas o xylene shows stronger enrichment in april 2016 these results indicate that the different compounds follow distinct temporal trends reflecting differences in the mineralization or dissolution kinetics the low enrichment in some samples may also be related to aerobic biodegradation these mechanisms were shown to be associated with rather small carbon isotope effects ɛc 0 6 while the anaerobic hydroxylation of the side chain of ethylbenzene by the enzyme ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is characterized by noticeable carbon and hydrogen isotope effects εc 3 7 monooxygenases acting on aromatics have been divided into four different types ullrich and hofrichter 2007 carbon isotope fractionation effects associated with monooxygenation of the aromatic ring were shown to range from low to considerable probably due to the different reaction mechanisms of the different types of monooxygenases vogt et al 2018 4 2 isotope pattern of of dic and ch4 in aqueous phase the occurrence of anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons driven mainly by iron reduction and methanogenesis was previously demonstrated by detection of a large plume of fe ii and methane teramoto and chang 2019 the isotopically heavy dic in the border of lnapl source zone fig 8 indicates the occurrence of anaerobic biodegradation mainly due to methanogenesis in contrast the similarity of 13c dic to the average 13c btex value 25 5 for the lnapl in the center of the source zone fig 6 strongly indicates aerobic biodegradation in this area dic progressively gets depleted in δ 13c downgradient of the southern edge of the source zone most likely reflecting methane oxidation fig 8 this assumption challenged the intuitive conceptual model of methanogenic biodegradation prevalence in the center of the source zone and that of aerobic biodegradation at the edge these results strongly suggest the dominance of the methanogenesis reaction along the north and south edges of the lnapl source zone 4 3 development of a conceptual model the seasonal fluctuating water table and air entrapment results in changing redox conditions in the smear zone teramoto and chang 2019 on this site air entrapment is a seasonal and additional time varying driving force for biodegradation the seasonal pattern is typically found in tropical areas with large seasonal precipitation patterns governing fluctuations of the water table the isotopic data presented in this work in combination with microbiological data presented by hidalgo et al 2019 reinforces the importance of air entrapment and supports the reexamination of the conceptual model previously presented by teramoto and chang 2019 the main improvement over the previous geochemical conceptual model was the identification of an oxygenated region within the lnapl source zone created by air entrapment during water table rise the new conceptual model is schematically illustrated in fig 10 4 3 1 typical mineral phases and geochemistry of a pristine aquifer the pristine groundwater displays low mineralization electrical conductibility lower than 20 μs cm due to the reduced residence time and simplicity of aquifer mineralogy teramoto and chang 2019 the mineral phases that were identified in the studied aquifer were quartz sio2 kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 and goethite feo oh these are compatible with the lateritic nature of the studied aquifer because of the simplistic mineralogy and direct input of groundwater recharge the electrical conductivity is usually greater than 20 μs cm the speciation calculation of the pristine groundwater buffered by a pco2 level of 10 1 5 atm indicating a ph value of approximately 4 7 and an alkalinity value of less than 1 mg l which are similar to the field measurements 4 3 2 lnapl source zone the analyses of 16s rna metagenomic and isotopic analysis indicate the stratification of the redox zone as well as the coexistence both aerobic and anaerobic zones within the lnapl source zone fig 9 this finding is different from that in many field sites in temperate climates e g sutton et al 2013 fahrenfeld et al 2014 irianni renno et al 2016 where microbes and functional genes strictly related to anaerobic biodegradation within the saturated zone containing lnapl were most abundant the existence of an aerobic environment in the studied site is induced by fluctuation of the water table during groundwater recharge water invades the pores both air and lnapl are entrapped by capillary forces bellow the water table creating a temporal zone with aerobic niches in the water saturated zone unless the oxygen from air entrapment is consumed this oxygen is released in the water saturated zone by solubilization of entrapped air bubbles which will form aerobic niches in an otherwise anoxic environment this is explained by the abundance of aerobic and anaerobic microbes in the same zone stretching along the fluctuation of the water table the evaluation of the lif transect fig 2 crossing the lnapl source zone reveals that lnapl in the center of the source zone is distributed in the uppermost region of the saturated zone determined by water table fluctuation on the other hand in the areas of middle to southern edges of the source zone lnapl is strongly entrapped and smeared along the depth interval of water fluctuations and a major portion of lnapl is located at the top of the water table thus within the lnapl source zone there is a stratified environment in which oxic and anoxic zones coexist the direct evidence of oxygenation stratification was obtained by metagenomic and 16s rrna investigations presented by hidalgo et al 2019 as demonstrated in this work aerobic degraders of aliphatic and aromatic compounds member of the moraxellaceae family revealed by metagenomic analysis are found at the top of the saturated zone the metagenomic analysis identified genes for benzoate degradation via catechol benabcd and encoded for catechol 1 2 dioxygenase cata both associated with the moraxellaceae family were identified thus the aerobic biodegradation in the center of the source zone indicated by the measured 13c dic is related to the distribution of lnapl within the aerobic zone fig 10 on the other hand in the southern region of the source zone lnapl is mainly distributed below the oxygenated zone fig 10 and anaerobic biodegradation prevails the values of 13c dic in the southern source zone indicate anaerobic biodegradation and correspond with the high concentrations of ch4 and fe2 observed in this region fig 3 an anoxic environment prevails below the zone of bubble entrapment with average ph and alkalinity of nearly 5 62 and 44 05 mg l respectively teramoto and chang 2019 the co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways indicate the existence of both hydrocarbon pathways which lead to high concentration of fe2 and ch4 within the lnapl source zone fig 3 several studies e g chapelle and lovley 1992 cozzarelli et al 2001 schreiber et al 2004 miles et al 2008 have demonstrated that biodegradation under fe iii reduction and methanogenesis can occur in biogeochemical niches of the same zone showing compartmentation of the soil column according to previous works e g siegert et al 2011 kato et al 2012 zhuang et al 2015 the syntrophic metabolism related to methanogenesis is favored in presence of iron oxides under this condition the abundance of iron oxide observed at the edge of lnapl source zone favors the co occurrence of iron reduction and methanogenesis pathways in some places where the iron was depleted by reductive reactions related to hydrocarbon biodegradation methanogenesis dominates and the concentration of ch4 is higher while the concentration of fe2 is modest as observed in fig 3 in the center of lnapl source zone the concentration of both ch4 and fe2 are lower suggesting the prevalence of aerobic biodegradation the presence of oxygen at the aerobic zone inhibits the methanogenesis and the transition of aerobic to methanogenic zones is likely abrupt although genes related to methanogenic have not been found via metagenomic analysis hidalgo et al 2019 found genes related to the initial steps of methanogenesis as well as those involved in other general cell cycle reactions such as hdrb2 and hdrc2 encoding for heterodisulfide reductase enzyme complex hidalgo et al 2019 also found propionibacteriaceae and enterobacteriaceae families at a depth of 1 2 m below the water table and geobacteriaceae and peptococcaceae familie colonizing in situ microcosm installed 1 2 to 3 2 m bellow the water table this finding supports the existence of anoxic environment bellow the oxygenated zone 4 3 3 fe2 and ch4 plume a plume of fe2 and ch4 stretches downgradient from the lnapl source zone this zone is generated by advective migration of fe2 and ch4 produced by hydrocarbon biodegradation under iron and methanogenesis respectively these are transported with the water flow downgradient from the lnapl source zone the values of average ph alkalinity and electrical conductivity are significantly lower than those values observed in the lnapl source zone the fe2 and ch4 concentrations with alternating cycles of varying concentrations display an inverse trend with respect to fluctuation of the water table teramoto and chang 2019 interpreted this variation as changes in redox state of the aquifer due to the influx of oxygen during water table rise and consequent air entrapment in the uppermost portion of the saturated zone however this behavior may reflect a simple dilution during groundwater recharge when there is an input of clean water at the top of the saturated zone the 13c ch4 and 13c dic in the metabolic plume are similar to that in the southern region of the lnapl source zone fig 8 suggesting that the methane oxidation contribution of light co2 is not very pronounced on the contrary enrichment of 13c ch4 and fractionation of 13c dic is only visible at the edge of the ch4 plume because the lnapl middle to southern edge of the source zone is distributed below the oxygenated zone the produced ch4 and fe2 plumes are also distributed below this zone fig 9 the low oxygenation content prevents the fe2 oxidation and maintains the 13c ch4 and 13c dic values as relatively stable over long distances from source zone 5 conclusions the new insights provided by csia in the present study significantly enhance the previous findings at the study site with respect to the mechanism involved in the release and mineralization of hydrocarbons our results demonstrate that isotopic analysis of groundwater collected within the source zone can be applied to understand the overlap of mass transfer and biodegradation within the source zone the isotope and geochemical parameters were used to characterize natural attenuation process of lnapls with an aquifer in tropical areas lateritic soil columns and with typical large fluctuation of the water columns the water table fluctuation formation of a smear zone and entrapment of air lead to a compartmentation of the aquifer into temporal geochemical niches disturbing a clear geochemical zonation according to the availability of electron acceptors and donators the zones of aerobic iron reducing and methanogenic biodegradation were overlapping and indicating a strong spatial and temporal fluctuation correlated the precipitation pattern and rise and fall of the water table the results

1493,visualization of napls in multiphase systems in porous media is important for determining contaminant transport in the environment in this study magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to confirm the recent observations of mobilisation of a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl trapped in wet sand under natural drying conditions of the wet porous medium visualization of lnapl motor oil and water mobility during the drying of wet glass beads 0 5 mm in a cylindrical glass column 15 mm id 45 mm long was obtained using spin echo based nmr microimaging performed at 500 mhz corresponding to a field of ca 11 75 t sagittal and axial images of lnapl and water in the porous medium were obtained at a spatial resolution of 59 μm pixel at different time intervals a rise of 15 20 mm was observed in the presence of evaporation of water as compared to a 2 3 mm rise in the absence of evaporation in a time span of about 1400 min the spatio temporal mri scans of the water and lnapl in the glass column reveals that lnapl rise occurs when the water evaporation front reaches the lnapl layer this implied that the enhanced lnapl rise was strongly linked to the process of water evaporation a linear correlation of the mri signal intensities of lnapl and water with reference to different saturation levels of lnapl and water in the porous media was obtained this calibration information was used to quantify the saturation levels of the lnapl and water during the drying process these findings show the application of non invasive techniques such as mri in quantifying and understanding the mechanism of fate and transport of lnapls in porous media towards effective environmental quality assessment keywords magnetic resonance imaging porous medium drying lnapl mobilisation 1 introduction the presence of non aqueous phase liquids napls in soils and sediments poses a potential risk of contamination of adjacent water and air phases and associated health risks chen et al 1999 ruder 2006 council 2009 for this reason the fate and transport of napls in the unsaturated and saturated liquid regions in the subsurface is important to understand their environmental impact the primary processes of napl fate and transport in natural porous media such as soils sediments or dredged materials are dissolution into pore water lekmine et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2016 volatilisation into pore air ma et al 2014 han et al 2018 spreading in pore water and dispersion or diffusion fenwick and blunt 1998 takamura et al 2012 interaction with the solid phase of soils sediments dredged material via sorption or wetting buczko et al 2006 travis et al 2008 lu et al 2017 and finally biodegradation yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 napl migration in the environment is also caused by human intervention during activities such as intensive pumping of groundwater and during remediation processes of contaminated soil sediments othman and benson 1993 catalan and dullien 1995 wet contaminated soils mudflats or exposed dredged sediment materials placed in confined disposal facilities are subject to drying and rewetting under natural exposure to the atmosphere geological fracture networks are also key conduits for migration of napl water and contaminants in groundwater systems berkowitz 2002 the combined movement of water and napl has been studied under various conditions such as gravity driven percolation towards groundwater reddi et al 1998 o carroll and sleep 2007 using solubilization enhancing agents boving and brusseau 2000 and due to an high externally applied pressure gradient against gravity in remediation applications such as vacuum extraction or air sparging bai et al 1997 taylor and nasr el din 1998 mandal et al 2010 however napl mobilisation under natural evaporation of water from wet porous media under very low pressure gradient caused due to natural air flows at the surface has not been investigated water evaporation from wet porous media has been studied in different laboratory and field systems in the context of the problem discussed in this paper water evaporation from water table is of interest this is generally influenced by hydraulic characteristics of the medium and the water table depth shokri and salvucci 2011 the evaporation process from water table is governed by upward capillary liquid flow from the water table to the evaporation front vapor diffusion through the overlying dry layer and mass transfer at the surface saravanapavan and salvucci 2000 il ichev et al 2008 it was found that continuous evaporation of water was significantly higher and preferentially from the finer soil particle size fractions than from coarser soil particle size or et al 2013 shahraeeni et al 2012 it is also reported that during the evaporation of water the water moves in thin films upwards at a certain velocity that is determined by the rate of evaporation coussot 2000 shokri et al 2008 yiotis et al 2003 yiotis et al 2015 in previous experiments conducted in our laboratory the effect of evaporation of water from water saturated sand containing a trapped layer of napl was examined by optical imaging govindarajan et al 2018 experiments examining a sandwiched napl rich sand layer between two layers of water rich sand revealed that trapped napl displays a significantly higher mobility in the upward direction during the evaporation of the water the optical imaging technique though very easy to accomplish provides only the information of the napl or water at the outer surface of the column it is necessary to visualise the behavior of the napl and the water in the bulk three dimensional space of the column this will also allow the estimation of the saturation levels of both the water and the napl that are crucial to properly evaluate or model fate and transport of the napl and its constituents in such porous systems to achieve these objectives a non invasive technique is required to study the behaviors of water and napl during water evaporation process werth et al 2010 summarised the various non invasive methods reported for in situ characterization of porous media using techniques such as uv visible spectroscopy chomsurin and werth 2003 fluorescence microscopy murphy 2001 ccd jones and smith 2005 x ray microtomography schnaar and brusseau 2005 dual gamma radiation brusseau et al 2008 and nuclear

technique which is used in studying the soft matter porous materials and process monitoring chen et al 1992 prado et al 1998 jiang et al 2013 baumann and werth 2005 reported colloid transport in a column packed with fine grained silica at 4 7 t using a spin echo mri imaging method in a similar study the effect of heterogeneous packing and grain size on the removal of decane from water doped with cuso4 saturated media using soil vapor extraction was examined by mri at 4 7 t chu et al 2004 for various water velocities through porous medium the dissolution of octanol within porous medium was studied using 1h mri at 4 77 t johns and gladden 1999 the potential of mri to observe the adsorption and mobilisation of metal ions such as cu2 gd3 and cr3 with spatial and temporal variation was evaluated using multislice spin echo imaging nestle et al 2002 effects of entrapped residual air bubbles on tracer transport in heterogeneous soil was examined using mri numerical simulation of water flow through a porous medium was aided with mri observations where a spin echo multi slice sems imaging was performed using water doped with mncl2 yoon et al 2008 mri was performed to determine napl distribution in a frozen core kiaalhosseini et al 2019 in another study mri was used to determine the molecular diffusion coefficient of toluene in a heavy oil system fayazi et al 2017 similar to 1h imaging 19f mri has also been used in the context of napl measurements zhang et al 2002 reported the dissolution of a dense napl 1 3 5 trifluoro benzene tfb in a silica gel packed column using a spin echo imaging sequence where 19f images were acquired for the tfb and 1h images were obtained for water magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to quantify in situ the recovery of crude oil from a strongly oil wet microporous limestone core plug yan et al 2012 the transport of napl through columns packed with porous medium has been investigated by several research groups using 1h 19f imaging and contrast agents most commonly at 4 7 t as mentioned above in the present study nuclear magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to visualise the changes in lnapl and water saturation during the drying of wet glass beads with a trapped lnapl rich layer underneath the water saturated layer in addition the mri technique was also employed to estimate the lnapl and water saturation as a function of space and time from the perspective of the mri methodology being used in this study there are two significant differences in the resulting mri compared to those previously reported a the use of much higher magnetic field 11 75 t as compared to 4 7 t and b selective imaging of water as well as napl without doping either of them with a contrast agent 2 experimental methods 2 1 water evaporation and lnapl mobilisation experiments the lnapl used in this study was a commercially available motor oil servo futura plus obtained from indian oil corporation the motor oil was colored 500 ppm using an oil soluble dye oil red o dye cas 1320 06 5 from sigma aldrich to enhance the optical visualization of the lnapl in the column though this was not required for the mri experiments this was used to enable direct comparison with the findings of the mri experiments with optical imaging which was also acquired for the same experimental system spherical borosilicate glass beads 0 5 mm diameter obtained from sigma aldrich were used as the porous medium experiments were conducted to study the redistribution of lnapl trapped within water saturated pores completely filled with de ionised water that was not degassed porous media during the evaporation of water using the test cell shown in fig 1a the de ionised water was obtained using a water purification system from millipore which generated 18 2 m ohm water that was further passed through a fine particulate filter and a disinfection system during a typical drying experiment airflow rate of 5 l min across the top surface of the wet glass beads in the glass column was used at several time intervals during the drying experiment the glass column was disengaged from the setup shown in fig 1a and inserted into the mri probe and further this mri probe was inserted into the magnet for analysis this was necessary because the mri probe 2 5 cm diameter could not accommodate the entire setup with the air inlet and outlet to allow the removal and transfer of the glass column with the least disturbance an air flow section top section was fabricated with teflon to fit snugly into the glass column containing the glass beads and the lnapl as shown in fig 1b this allowed the easy removal of the glass column and placement into the mri probe shown in fig 1c the disengaged column was covered with a teflon cap shown in fig 1c i and inserted into the mri probe fig 1c ii which was then placed into the mri instrument fig 1c iii the dimensions of the glass column were 15 mm id 18 mm od and 45 mm height they were chosen based on the restrictions of the maximum sample size allowable in the mri probe after the mri scan the glass column was returned to the drying experiment setup and the drying was resumed since the glass column was capped during the mri scan which lasted about 45 min it was assumed that the evaporation was insignificant during the scan in separate preliminary experiments the evaporation of the napl was examined by exposing it to air inside a fumehood for more than 10 h it was found that there was no perceptible loss of mass due to evaporation in that time scale there was also no perceptible interference of the red dye on the mri measurements of the motor oil since optical imaging was also being carried out simultaneously for the same system it was easy to verify if the napl had moved significantly during the mri scan mri measurements were performed using an 11 75 t 500 mhz bruker avance ii ultrashield plus nmr spectrometer with micro imaging capability 1h nmr signals on this system occurring nominally at 500 13 mhz spin echo imaging was used for visualizing the distribution of lnapl and water in the liquid saturated porous medium system initially we used a locally available construction brown sand for experiments at 4 7 t 200 mhz bruker biospec system in this case the quality of data from the mri measurements was significantly degraded in terms of inhomogeneity and signal to noise ratio of the lnapl and water signals due to the presence of certain mineral constituents in the sand indeed it is known that the mri signal is attenuated by the presence of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic substances werth et al 2010 in a recent study kiaalhosseini et al 2019 also discussed the effects of impurities in sand on resolving napl and water using mri and noted that the effect of ferromagnetic image distortion was present when sand was used our experiments with white sand commercially available white sand from tamilnadu minerals limited on the other hand resulted in good mri data at 200 mhz 4 7 t without any significant data degradation or issues in terms of image distortions perturbations however in order to exploit the superior mri image sensitivity and resolution at higher fields we preferred to make detailed measurements and analysis at 11 75 t 500 mhz it may be recalled that the basic nmr signal to noise ratio snr goes as b0 1 5 and the advantage at 11 75 t vis à vis 4 7 t thus works out to a factor of 3 95 further since glass beads have a more uniform size distribution than sand we preferred using glass beads 0 5 mm diameter in our detailed experiments at 500 mhz in a typical experimental run a known mass 0 2 g of the lnapl was loaded into a glass column and the glass beads were added when the desired depth of the lnapl saturated glass beads was obtained a small amount of water was added to the glass column glass beads were then added to this layer of water to target the formation of a layer of water saturated glass beads this was repeated in small segments until the water rich glass beads layer accumulated to the top of the glass column an analytical balance 4 digit balance with a minimum of 0 1 mg was used to weigh the column after each component was added the total average masses of lnapl water and glass beads were 0 2 g 1 9 g and 8 7 g respectively to create the desired test column in different experiments water evaporation from the column was induced by a flow of compressed air filtered through hepa filter across the top surface of the glass column the volumetric flow rate of air used in the experiments was 5 l min the relative humidty and temperature of the air was typically 10 14 and temperature 24 28 c respectively in all the experiments and were measured using testo bluetooth thermo hygrometer probes paired with testo smart app in an android phone the water flux was calculated from the difference in the absolute humidity of the inlet and outlet air in using calculations reported in govindarajan et al 2018 the glass column from the drying experiment setup described earlier was placed in a 25 mm insert which was placed into the micro imaging probe shown in fig 1c the sample was held tight in its position by using a teflon cap that wrapped around the glass column and fit tightly within the sample holder a flange on the top of the teflon cap ensured that the sample was always placed at the same height in the sample holder fig 1c shows the sample holder with the rf coil of the mri system at the top a zero degree mark was made on the sample and the sample holder and the sample was always placed in the same orientation along the mark making sure the same slice was measured each time during the time series of measurements within an experiment all mri data were processed using bruker paravision software and imagej software with the fiji image processing package https imagej net fiji 2 2 optimization of mri protocol for selective detection of lnapl and water parameters for the acquisition of signals using mri from pure water and pure lnapl were obtained initially without the porous media in the presence of glass beads chemical shift selective imaging was not effective due to the poor resolution of water and lnapl signals therefore a different strategy to image lnapl and water was adopted which was based on the differences in spin lattice t 1 relaxation of lnapl and water two separate vials of glass beads saturated with lnapl and water respectively were prepared and their t 1 relaxation times were measured with rare rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement sequence with a variable repetition time tr and with fixed echo time te of 12 3 ms tr and te were experimentally optimized the t 1 relaxation time of water and lnapl were found to be 3 1 s and 0 53 s respectively and based on this relative difference in t 1 the selective imaging was performed in another experiment a glass column with both lnapl and water in separate sections was prepared the bottom portion of the vial was saturated with water up to a height of 15 mm from the bottom and the top half of the glass column was saturated with the lnapl fig 2 shows the mri images of the sagittal slices vertical cross section of the entire test section in this experiment fig 2a shows a non selective 1h image of lnapl and water measured together by a single scan a rare sequence was used with te 6 35 ms tr 6 s field of view fov 5 cm 5 cm and with data matrix 256 256 when imaging was performed without any suppression of lnapl or water magnetization a bright signal for the entire sample was obtained therefore simultaneous detection of water and lnapl was not possible and was done sequentially in a sample fig 2b and c show the selective imaging of the lnapl and water respectively in the test column selective lnapl signal was acquired with te 30 ms tr 300 ms and in order to have an enhanced signal pre inversion zero crossing technique was used the selective water signal was acquired using te 6 35 ms tr 6 s and inversion time ti 290 ms the resolution of 195 μm pixel was obtained for both the water and lnapl selective images these optimized protocols were used in all experiments to visualise lnapl and water mobility in the glass beads during water evaporation 2 3 mri measurements of lnapl and water distribution during a typical experiment the glass column loaded with the lnapl and water was subjected to evaporation caused by air flow across the top surface at different intervals in time the airflow was stopped and the distribution of the water and lnapl in the glass column was measured using mri after the placement of the nmr probe with the glass column into the mri instrument the bruker system software paravision was used to perform tuning matching and shimming for this sample the t 1 relaxation time of water and lnapl was used as a contrast to distinguish between the two fluids for the typical experiments sagittal vertical cross section and axial horizontal cross section imaging was done at a resolution of 512 512 pixels in a field of view fov of 3 3 cm which corresponded to a spatial resolution of 59 μm pixel the sequence used for lnapl measurement was spin echo imaging with an echo time te of 16 ms and repetition time tr of 203 ms images of water were obtained with a te 8 ms and tr 6 s here the spin echo method was used with pre inversion zero crossing of lnapl signal to obtain better lnapl suppression inversion time ti 290 ms with a rare factor 4 and a number of scans 1 for sagittal and axial imaging the thickness of the slice was 3 mm and 2 5 mm respectively and consequently the data of water or lnapl intensity obtained from the scan of a particular slice was an average value of the volume corresponding to this slice 2 4 correlation of mri signal intensity and quantity of lnapl and water one of the objectives of the study was to quantify the amount of lnapl and water in the porous media as a function of space and time to facilitate this calibration of the mri signal intensity of the lnapl and water signals was performed individually in terms of the saturation of water and lnapl in the porous media the total porosity of the glass beads was estimated as 0 4 and different amounts of water and lnapl were added to the glass beads to obtain different saturation levels the different lnapl saturation obtained were 7 15 30 51 71 and 90 and the different water saturations obtained were 11 20 36 57 77 and 100 these samples were prepared in ceramic crucibles with 7 g of glass beads and loaded into the glass column used for the mri signal acquisition the mri intensities for the lnapl and water which were measured separately were correlated to the actual saturation levels of lnapl and water respectively the intensities of the mri signals corresponded to images obtained with a resolution of 512 512 pixels fig 3 shows this calibration of the lnapl and water mri signal with the actual lnapl and water saturation used in the porous media 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of lnapl and water distribution during evaporation during the drying experiments the glass column was detached from the teflon setup and inserted into the mri probe for measurements at an evaporation rate corresponding to a surface airflow rate of 5 l min as described earlier the inserted glass column was analysed separately for lnapl and for water in the same position fig 4a and b show the sagittal vertical cross section view of the lnapl and water respectively for different vertical slices 3 mm thick at different times in fig 4a and b the vertical cross sections are numbered from the nearest to the farthest slice since the glass tube was cylindrical the 1st and the 5th slice were thinner than the 2nd 3rd and 4th slices the bright regions in fig 4a and b corresponded to the presence of lnapl and water respectively in the porous media in fig 4a it was observed that in all the slices until past time t 450 min the lnapl did not redistribute in the image corresponding to the later time of 765 min significant redistribution of bright patches above the region was observed implying lnapl migration upwards and was observed to continue until a time of 1445 min fig 4b shows the images of the water distribution it was observed that after time t 0 there was a change in the water signal uniformity and it was very perceptible at time t 450 min where there were patches of dark spots possibly indicating loss of water the potential water loss extended downwards with time and at time t 765 mins the dark patches extended towards the region where the lnapl was present clearly indicating that the redistribution of lnapl is correlated to the mobilisation of the water layers near the lnapl figure s1 shows the comparison of the lnapl rise from the mri and the optical images from the beginning of the experiment to time t 1445 min end of the experiment beyond which time there was no significant water or lnapl redistribution fig 5a and b show the axial images of the lnapl and water distribution respectively corresponding to different slices at different times slice 1 corresponds to the layer at the bottom of the glass column and slice 5 corresponds to the top region of the column it is observed that the patterns of water and lnapl distribution in the axial cross section as a function of time correspond to the distribution observed in the sagittal images fig 6a and b show the pixel wise distribution of the lnapl and water respectively in one of the axial slices of the sample in the field of view 4th slice this clearly showed the increase in the intensity of the lnapl in fig 6a from time t 0 to time t 945 min correspondingly there was a decrease in the water intensity in fig 6b between time t 0 to time t 945 min figs 5 and 6 also indicated that the lnapl distribution was non uniform throughout the column without preference for any specific location within the volume of interest and correlates with the water redistribution due to evaporation fig 7a and b show the plot comparing the lnapl rise as observed by the mri and optical technique respectively along with the time series of the water evaporation flux the total mri sampling time for lnapl and water to obtain multi slice data in both sagittal and in axial directions was 45 min therefore the number of mri scans were limited as compared to the frequency of the acquisition of the optical images however despite the lower number of the mri measurements the trends of the lnapl rise shown in fig 7a and b corresponding to the mri data and the optical images were similar in fig 7a after 450 min the next mri measurement was taken at 765 min fig 7b shows that perceptible lnapl rise started only around 700 min from the mri scan images in figs 4 and 5 it was seen that the lnapl rise commenced when the water redistribution near the lnapl occured fig 7 also shows that lnapl rise is correlated with the water evaporation flux which is also evident from the observation that there was no lnapl movement when the column was relatively drier the water evaporation flux or rate decreased until a time when the lnapl rise continued and then remained at that lower level the decrease in the water evaporation rate can be attributed to two possible effects first there was lesser water in the lnapl rich region and consequently there was lesser flux second any water trapped below the lnapl layer encountered additional diffusional resistance due to the redistribution of the lnapl this comparison also confirmed that the lnapl rise was a phenomenon that occurred throughout the bulk of the porous media and was related to the water evaporation 3 2 estimation of lnapl and water saturation in pores from the axial time series images of the lnapl and water in the porous media the saturation of the lnapl and water were obtained using the calibration shown in fig 3 fig 8a and b show the time series for lnapl and water respectively the intensity of the water reduced with time implying that water was leaving the region of the scan driven by evaporation the intensity of lnapl and water obtained from an entire slice was estimated from the mri data and the corresponding lnapl or water saturation values were obtained from the calibration fig 8a showed the change in the lnapl saturation as a function of time initially the lnapl was present at the bottom of the glass column with a thickness of about 8 mm this region was indicated by the shaded bar at the bottom of the graph marked in the legend as initial and this region extended over 2 axial slices nearly 5 mm in this region near saturation of the lnapl in the pore spaces was expected fig 8a shows the average lnapl saturation for a slice at different times during the evaporation of the water the lnapl saturation shown at time t 765 min was based on the data from fig 4a and 5a where the lnapl re distribution was observed in the slices corresponding to time t 765 min the lnapl had already spread upwards from its initial position so there was a decrease in the lnapl saturation that was visible in the axial slice shown in fig 5a corresponding to t 765 min in comparison to the previous image corresponding to t 450 min the bulk of the rise happened within a few millimeters above the initial location corresponding to two slices above the initial region the top three slices show lower lnapl saturation at time t 765 min at longer times there is a decrease in the saturation in the region 5 10 mm and a corresponding increase in the saturation in the top three slices this clearly shows the movement of the lnapl upwards corresponding to this in fig 8b the distribution of water in the same system is observed from time t 0 to about time t 450 min the pores were nearly fully saturated as time progressed the water content decreased between time t 450 and time t 765 min there was a significant change in the water content further redistribution is observed at time t 945 min data was collected until 1485 min however the distribution is not shown in fig 8 since the field of view did not cover the entire region of the column all the way to the top some migration that occurred into this unscanned region near the top will not be taken into account in the distribution therefore the distribution at these times was not shown in figure the distribution of saturation shown in figure until 945 min illustrates that redistribution of the lnapl does take place analysis of the intensities of the mri signal in relation to the slice location and time showed that in regions which are water saturated i e at all slices 3 8 and at time t 0 the average mri intensity for napl was 251 344 18 898 based on the calibration in fig 3 this corresponds to a napl value of 5 41 this implies that in this particular experimental setup the quantitative limit for napl saturation is 5 41 this happens specifically when the resolution of imaging is 512 512 and does not happen when the resolution is 256 256 the napl saturation values shown in fig 8 account for this correction the lnapl and water saturation values can be useful in estimating the fate and transport of solutes within a porous medium using an advection diffusion contaminant transport model 3 3 mechanism of lnapl movement spontaneous napl rise is reported in literature as a result of capillary forces and wetting washburn 1921 harkins and feldman 1922 hirasaki 1993 vizika et al 1996 zhou and blunt 1997 takamura et al 2012 singh et al 2016 xu et al 2008 since it is established in our study that the lnapl rise is due to the water evaporation the mechanism of water evaporation in porous media was examined there is significant evidence of the water film formation during water evaporation in porous media and its upward movement shokri et al 2008 yiotis et al 2003 when the water evaporation front reach the region of the initial napl position a three phase region air water napl may be formed based on the presence of the water film during water evaporation two hypotheses were presented in our previous work govindarajan et al 2018 here we provide additional tests done to resolve the mechanism based on these hypotheses which are re stated here a the napl spontaneously spreads on a thin film of water formed during the evaporation of water if the napl has a positive spreading coefficient b the moving water film during evaporation drags the napl along with it to test hypothesis a the spreading coefficients of the napls used in this study and the previous motor oil light crude oil were estimated spreading coefficient s is defined as s γaw γan γnw harkins and feldman 1922 where γaw γan and γnw are the interfacial tensions between air water air napl and napl water respectively based on their theory if the spreading coefficient value of a napl was positive then the napl was expected to spread on water as a thin film conversely if the spreading coefficient value of a napl was negative then napl was not expected to spread on water and would stay as a thick lens in the previous work govindarajan et al 2018 the rise of three different lnapls were reported motor oil light crude oil and bunker oil the spreading coefficients of motor oil mo and light crude oil lco were estimated from the interfacial tensions between napl water and napl air the interfacial tension of lco water and mo water were estimated as 25 63 mn m and 14 05 mn m respectively the surface tension of lco motor oil and water was 32 7 mn m 29 93 mn m and 72 mn m respectively the values of the spreading coefficient s for motor oil and light crude oil were found to be 28 02 and 13 67 the interfacial tension between bunker oil and water could not be measured accurately and therefore the spreading coefficient of bunker oil was not reported the positive spreading coefficients imply that the napl would spread spontaneously on thin film of water that was created during the evaporation of water from the porous media in order to test if just the mere presence of a thin film is sufficient to cause the spreading of the napl on the water film additional experiments were performed to create a system with a thin film of water and observe the napl behavior in our experimental system we placed a layer of wet sand with 30 saturation on top of the napl motor oil saturated layer shown in figure s2 in the supplementary file the target conditions in the unsaturated zone were to ensure i a continuous water film on the sand surface and ii an air water napl interface at the junction between the napl saturated zone and the unsaturated zone if the saturation levels were too high then the water layer will drain down to the napl layer and eliminate the pore air thus making it a two phase system instead of three phase system if the saturation levels were too low there might not be a continuous water film therefore a suitably low value of saturation 30 was determined by trial and error from the observation of the water at the napl water interface visually water and white sand were mixed in a crucible with appropriate amounts corresponding to estimated water saturation of 30 and then added on top of the napl saturated layer in the glass tube in these experiments water was colored with a water soluble blue dye for better visualization there was no air flow across the surface of the sand column to reduce the evaporation to nearly zero only diffusion transport of water takes place during that time which is significantly lower than evaporation driven by the convective mass transfer at the surface the top end of the column was open but was not connected to any air supply and kept away from any air movement and inside an analytical balance to verify any mass loss the experimental setup was observed for about 24 h no significant napl rise was observed and there was no measureable mass loss this implied that without water evaporation napl rise was not observed at partial water saturation in the presence of films this could imply two possibilities i spreading is not occurring on the films of water as predicted by the spreading coefficient theory or ii there are no films of water in the experiment as intended there are several uncertainties with reference to the presence and stability of the water films to address these uncertainties an alternative set of experiments was conducted in these experiments the water was allowed to evaporate under conditions of air flow at 5 l min napl rise was observed using optical imaging when the napl rise commenced the air flow across the top surface was shut off when the napl rise of 3 4 mm was observed this resulted in decrease of the water evaporation rate to nearly zero while the system was still under atmospheric pressure at the surface fig 9a shows the napl rise for triplicate experiments when water evaporation was halted in comparison to the original case where water evaporation continued for longer periods in fig 9a the legend partial drying corresponds to the case where the evaporation was halted after 300 min of drying and when the napl rise has commenced fig 9a shows that when the evaporation was halted the napl rise also stopped it is expected that at this point in the evaporation of water there is a significant three phase region above the napl saturated zone if water wetting effect based on the positive spreading coefficient were to dominate the napl rise should have continued even when the water evaporation was halted this also shows that the spreading theory based on the spreading coefficient is not sufficient to explain the napl rise during evaporation another set of experiments was performed with a napl hexadecane with negative spreading coefficient if spreading on water films was the dominant mechanism then napl rise should not be observed in such an experiment since hexadecane had a spreading co efficient value of 9 hirasaki 1993 experiments performed with hexadecane are shown in comparison with those for lco and mo for the same conditions of experiment in fig 9b this data shows that the napl rise for hexadecane was higher than that of lco or mo this shows that the theory of the spreading based on the spreading coefficient does not seem to have an effect on the napl rise on the other hand hexadecane has a lower viscosity than the lco and a higher napl rise implying that napl viscosity plays a larger role the other significant aspect about either hypotheses with reference to the presence of a napl and water film during evaporation the mri experiments fill in this critical piece of information to address this higher resolutions using the mri to observe the lnapl and water films higher resolution images 22 μm pixel with a field of view of 1 4 cm 1 4 cm were obtained for the axial and sagittal views of the lnapl rise and water evaporation these images were acquired in the region where visually observable lnapl rise had already commenced figures s3a and s3b and s3b show the high resolution axial images of lnapl and water respectively for a system of 0 5 mm glass beads figure s3a and s3b and s3b show the distribution of lnapl and water respectively in the same axial slice the intensities of the lnapl and water in figs s3a and s3b are shown as bright field in the image the dark regions could be both air and glass beads which do not display an mri signal fig s2c shows an overlay of figs s3a and s3b where the lnapl is shown in green and the water is shown as red the distribution pattern in the overlay fig s3c corresponds to the individual images of the lnapl and water seen in figs s3a and s3b there are separate regions that were water rich and lnapl rich however there were a large number of regions that contained thin water films mixed with regions of lnapl throughout since the slice thickness was 2 5 mm and the glass beads were 0 5 mm each image potentially showed the overlap of at least six glass bead layers the lnapl and water intensity displayed in the images were a sum of all the lnapl and water intensities in the entire slice it was therefore difficult to delineate the individual layer of glass beads and associate the observed intensities to the thin films of lnapl and water to help study this aspect in more detail and reduce the effect of the overlap additional lnapl rise experiments and mri imaging was performed with larger diameter 1 mm glass beads with larger pore spaces and lesser overlap fig 10a b and c show the high resolution mri images for lnapl water and the overlay of lnapl water respectively with 1 mm grain size glass beads in an axial slice in a region where lnapl rise had been visually observed in these images several borders of the glass beads are clearly visible along with the overlapping of the glass beads as well the minimum number of overlap is reduced to three in this case as compared to six grains in the case of the 0 5 mm glass beads in a given slice of 2 5 mm these images show films of lnapl and water in the gaps between the glass beads and around the glass beads in the image overlay of the lnapl and water fig 10c the presence of lnapl and water at the same site occurred in more locations than observed in the 0 5 mm glass beads images there are however regions where either the water or the lnapl dominated since the slice thickness was larger than the grain size it is possible that these bulk images show a composite of thin films that are aligned horizontally despite these artifacts there are clear indications of the presence of the lnapl and water in the pore spaces and as thin films and lends support to the mechanistic hypothesis discussed earlier the pore space between two grains 1 mm thick can be as large as 50 μm under a particular set of grain orientation and arrangement as observed under a microscope the lnapl and water films of lnapl and water can be expected to be between 10 and 50 μm under different levels of pore saturation figs 10 d e and f show a magnified view of a particular section of the images shown in fig 10 where it is clear that both lnapl and water occupy the region next to the glass beads as evident from the bright curvatures that appear around the dark regions represented by the glass beads since the glass beads do not display an mri signal magnified sections of the images in fig 10a b c are shown in figs 10 d e f respectively these magnified sections show the presence of thin films that are a few microns thick in the region of the napl water interface thus the combination of the optical and the mri images further the understanding of the observations of napl rise the theory of spreading using the spreading coefficient is not supported in these sets of experiments and observations the alternative hypothesis of the moving film of water dragging the napl also seen as thin films in the mri images is a viable hypothesis the spatio temporal mri scans of the water and napl in the glass column reveals that the napl rise occurs when the water evaporation front reaches the napl layer this implied that the enhanced napl rise was strongly linked to the water evaporation there is evidence in literature on the flow of immiscible fluids in contact with each other corey 2003 all these studies have given us sufficient basis to work on the mathematical modeling of the processes observed in continuing work further experiments must be done using a single layer of glass beads and observe the evolution of the lnapl water air interface and the orientation of the system as a function of time it is possible to do experiments with the mri system by designing a single grain layer and studying this process in situ using the pore scale mri data pore scale modeling may be attempted to simulate the process of lnapl rise this information can help devise an effective approach to model the lnapl rise 4 conclusions the spontaneous rise of lnapl during the natural evaporation of water from porous media comprising glass beads was observed using magnetic resonance imaging mri the selective measurement of lnapl and water in the porous medium was successfully demonstrated without the addition of any tracer doping substance paramagnetic agent the mri data was used to estimate the lnapl and water saturation levels in the porous media this is useful from a perspective of the modeling of contaminant fate and transport in porous media where such lnapl redistribution might occur using these and other observations in the literature about the evaporation of water it was hypothesised that the lnapl rise occurs in association with the behavior of the thin films of water that are formed during the evaporation of water from porous media which is not possible from optical imaging high resolution images of the pore level distribution of lnapl and water are obtained to study the geometry and relative positioning of the lnapl and water the imaging showed that the lnapl and water films co existed and provided estimates of the film thickness which are useful parameters that can be used in mathematical modeling of the process however the experimental artifacts mainly arising from the thickness of the slice of the mri image must be overcome to further examine the evolution of the lnapl rise process the mri methodology is also useful in probing the transport of other solutes in this scenario or the partitioning of solutes present in the lnapl phase and the possible stratification of the different fractions of lnapls such as petrol and diesel declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgement this study

1493,visualization of napls in multiphase systems in porous media is important for determining contaminant transport in the environment in this study magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to confirm the recent observations of mobilisation of a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl trapped in wet sand under natural drying conditions of the wet porous medium visualization of lnapl motor oil and water mobility during the drying of wet glass beads 0 5 mm in a cylindrical glass column 15 mm id 45 mm long was obtained using spin echo based nmr microimaging performed at 500 mhz corresponding to a field of ca 11 75 t sagittal and axial images of lnapl and water in the porous medium were obtained at a spatial resolution of 59 μm pixel at different time intervals a rise of 15 20 mm was observed in the presence of evaporation of water as compared to a 2 3 mm rise in the absence of evaporation in a time span of about 1400 min the spatio temporal mri scans of the water and lnapl in the glass column reveals that lnapl rise occurs when the water evaporation front reaches the lnapl layer this implied that the enhanced lnapl rise was strongly linked to the process of water evaporation a linear correlation of the mri signal intensities of lnapl and water with reference to different saturation levels of lnapl and water in the porous media was obtained this calibration information was used to quantify the saturation levels of the lnapl and water during the drying process these findings show the application of non invasive techniques such as mri in quantifying and understanding the mechanism of fate and transport of lnapls in porous media towards effective environmental quality assessment keywords magnetic resonance imaging porous medium drying lnapl mobilisation 1 introduction the presence of non aqueous phase liquids napls in soils and sediments poses a potential risk of contamination of adjacent water and air phases and associated health risks chen et al 1999 ruder 2006 council 2009 for this reason the fate and transport of napls in the unsaturated and saturated liquid regions in the subsurface is important to understand their environmental impact the primary processes of napl fate and transport in natural porous media such as soils sediments or dredged materials are dissolution into pore water lekmine et al 2014 vasudevan et al 2016 volatilisation into pore air ma et al 2014 han et al 2018 spreading in pore water and dispersion or diffusion fenwick and blunt 1998 takamura et al 2012 interaction with the solid phase of soils sediments dredged material via sorption or wetting buczko et al 2006 travis et al 2008 lu et al 2017 and finally biodegradation yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 napl migration in the environment is also caused by human intervention during activities such as intensive pumping of groundwater and during remediation processes of contaminated soil sediments othman and benson 1993 catalan and dullien 1995 wet contaminated soils mudflats or exposed dredged sediment materials placed in confined disposal facilities are subject to drying and rewetting under natural exposure to the atmosphere geological fracture networks are also key conduits for migration of napl water and contaminants in groundwater systems berkowitz 2002 the combined movement of water and napl has been studied under various conditions such as gravity driven percolation towards groundwater reddi et al 1998 o carroll and sleep 2007 using solubilization enhancing agents boving and brusseau 2000 and due to an high externally applied pressure gradient against gravity in remediation applications such as vacuum extraction or air sparging bai et al 1997 taylor and nasr el din 1998 mandal et al 2010 however napl mobilisation under natural evaporation of water from wet porous media under very low pressure gradient caused due to natural air flows at the surface has not been investigated water evaporation from wet porous media has been studied in different laboratory and field systems in the context of the problem discussed in this paper water evaporation from water table is of interest this is generally influenced by hydraulic characteristics of the medium and the water table depth shokri and salvucci 2011 the evaporation process from water table is governed by upward capillary liquid flow from the water table to the evaporation front vapor diffusion through the overlying dry layer and mass transfer at the surface saravanapavan and salvucci 2000 il ichev et al 2008 it was found that continuous evaporation of water was significantly higher and preferentially from the finer soil particle size fractions than from coarser soil particle size or et al 2013 shahraeeni et al 2012 it is also reported that during the evaporation of water the water moves in thin films upwards at a certain velocity that is determined by the rate of evaporation coussot 2000 shokri et al 2008 yiotis et al 2003 yiotis et al 2015 in previous experiments conducted in our laboratory the effect of evaporation of water from water saturated sand containing a trapped layer of napl was examined by optical imaging govindarajan et al 2018 experiments examining a sandwiched napl rich sand layer between two layers of water rich sand revealed that trapped napl displays a significantly higher mobility in the upward direction during the evaporation of the water the optical imaging technique though very easy to accomplish provides only the information of the napl or water at the outer surface of the column it is necessary to visualise the behavior of the napl and the water in the bulk three dimensional space of the column this will also allow the estimation of the saturation levels of both the water and the napl that are crucial to properly evaluate or model fate and transport of the napl and its constituents in such porous systems to achieve these objectives a non invasive technique is required to study the behaviors of water and napl during water evaporation process werth et al 2010 summarised the various non invasive methods reported for in situ characterization of porous media using techniques such as uv visible

strongly oil wet microporous limestone core plug yan et al 2012 the transport of napl through columns packed with porous medium has been investigated by several research groups using 1h 19f imaging and contrast agents most commonly at 4 7 t as mentioned above in the present study nuclear magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to visualise the changes in lnapl and water saturation during the drying of wet glass beads with a trapped lnapl rich layer underneath the water saturated layer in addition the mri technique was also employed to estimate the lnapl and water saturation as a function of space and time from the perspective of the mri methodology being used in this study there are two significant differences in the resulting mri compared to those previously reported a the use of much higher magnetic field 11 75 t as compared to 4 7 t and b selective imaging of water as well as napl without doping either of them with a contrast agent 2 experimental methods 2 1 water evaporation and lnapl mobilisation experiments the lnapl used in this study was a commercially available motor oil servo futura plus obtained from indian oil corporation the motor oil was colored 500 ppm using an oil soluble dye oil red o dye cas 1320 06 5 from sigma aldrich to enhance the optical visualization of the lnapl in the column though this was not required for the mri experiments this was used to enable direct comparison with the findings of the mri experiments with optical imaging which was also acquired for the same experimental system spherical borosilicate glass beads 0 5 mm diameter obtained from sigma aldrich were used as the porous medium experiments were conducted to study the redistribution of lnapl trapped within water saturated pores completely filled with de ionised water that was not degassed porous media during the evaporation of water using the test cell shown in fig 1a the de ionised water was obtained using a water purification system from millipore which generated 18 2 m ohm water that was further passed through a fine particulate filter and a disinfection system during a typical drying experiment airflow rate of 5 l min across the top surface of the wet glass beads in the glass column was used at several time intervals during the drying experiment the glass column was disengaged from the setup shown in fig 1a and inserted into the mri probe and further this mri probe was inserted into the magnet for analysis this was necessary because the mri probe 2 5 cm diameter could not accommodate the entire setup with the air inlet and outlet to allow the removal and transfer of the glass column with the least disturbance an air flow section top section was fabricated with teflon to fit snugly into the glass column containing the glass beads and the lnapl as shown in fig 1b this allowed the easy removal of the glass column and placement into the mri probe shown in fig 1c the disengaged column was covered with a teflon cap shown in fig 1c i and inserted into the mri probe fig 1c ii which was then placed into the mri instrument fig 1c iii the dimensions of the glass column were 15 mm id 18 mm od and 45 mm height they were chosen based on the restrictions of the maximum sample size allowable in the mri probe after the mri scan the glass column was returned to the drying experiment setup and the drying was resumed since the glass column was capped during the mri scan which lasted about 45 min it was assumed that the evaporation was insignificant during the scan in separate preliminary experiments the evaporation of the napl was examined by exposing it to air inside a fumehood for more than 10 h it was found that there was no perceptible loss of mass due to evaporation in that time scale there was also no perceptible interference of the red dye on the mri measurements of the motor oil since optical imaging was also being carried out simultaneously for the same system it was easy to verify if the napl had moved significantly during the mri scan mri measurements were performed using an 11 75 t 500 mhz bruker avance ii ultrashield plus nmr spectrometer with micro imaging capability 1h nmr signals on this system occurring nominally at 500 13 mhz spin echo imaging was used for visualizing the distribution of lnapl and water in the liquid saturated porous medium system initially we used a locally available construction brown sand for experiments at 4 7 t 200 mhz bruker biospec system in this case the quality of data from the mri measurements was significantly degraded in terms of inhomogeneity and signal to noise ratio of the lnapl and water signals due to the presence of certain mineral constituents in the sand indeed it is known that the mri signal is attenuated by the presence of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic substances werth et al 2010 in a recent study kiaalhosseini et al 2019 also discussed the effects of impurities in sand on resolving napl and water using mri and noted that the effect of ferromagnetic image distortion was present when sand was used our experiments with white sand commercially available white sand from tamilnadu minerals limited on the other hand resulted in good mri data at 200 mhz 4 7 t without any significant data degradation or issues in terms of image distortions perturbations however in order to exploit the superior mri image sensitivity and resolution at higher fields we preferred to make detailed measurements and analysis at 11 75 t 500 mhz it may be recalled that the basic nmr signal to noise ratio snr goes as b0 1 5 and the advantage at 11 75 t vis à vis 4 7 t thus works out to a factor of 3 95 further since glass beads have a more uniform size distribution than sand we preferred using glass beads 0 5 mm diameter in our detailed experiments at 500 mhz in a typical experimental run a known mass 0 2 g of the lnapl was loaded into a glass column and the glass beads were added when the desired depth of the lnapl saturated glass beads was obtained a small amount of water was added to the glass column glass beads were then added to this layer of water to target the formation of a layer of water saturated glass beads this was repeated in small segments until the water rich glass beads layer accumulated to the top of the glass column an analytical balance 4 digit balance with a minimum of 0 1 mg was used to weigh the column after each component was added the total average masses of lnapl water and glass beads were 0 2 g 1 9 g and 8 7 g respectively to create the desired test column in different experiments water evaporation from the column was induced by a flow of compressed air filtered through hepa filter across the top surface of the glass column the volumetric flow rate of air used in the experiments was 5 l min the relative humidty and temperature of the air was typically 10 14 and temperature 24 28 c respectively in all the experiments and were measured using testo bluetooth thermo hygrometer probes paired with testo smart app in an android phone the water flux was calculated from the difference in the absolute humidity of the inlet and outlet air in using calculations reported in govindarajan et al 2018 the glass column from the drying experiment setup described earlier was placed in a 25 mm insert which was placed into the micro imaging probe shown in fig 1c the sample was held tight in its position by using a teflon cap that wrapped around the glass column and fit tightly within the sample holder a flange on the top of the teflon cap ensured that the sample was always placed at the same height in the sample holder fig 1c shows the sample holder with the rf coil of the mri system at the top a zero degree mark was made on the sample and the sample holder and the sample was always placed in the same orientation along the mark making sure the same slice was measured each time during the time series of measurements within an experiment all mri data were processed using bruker paravision software and imagej software with the fiji image processing package https imagej net fiji 2 2 optimization of mri protocol for selective detection of lnapl and water parameters for the acquisition of signals using mri from pure water and pure lnapl were obtained initially without the porous media in the presence of glass beads chemical shift selective imaging was not effective due to the poor resolution of water and lnapl signals therefore a different strategy to image lnapl and water was adopted which was based on the differences in spin lattice t 1 relaxation of lnapl and water two separate vials of glass beads saturated with lnapl and water respectively were prepared and their t 1 relaxation times were measured with rare rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement sequence with a variable repetition time tr and with fixed echo time te of 12 3 ms tr and te were experimentally optimized the t 1 relaxation time of water and lnapl were found to be 3 1 s and 0 53 s respectively and based on this relative difference in t 1 the selective imaging was performed in another experiment a glass column with both lnapl and water in separate sections was prepared the bottom portion of the vial was saturated with water up to a height of 15 mm from the bottom and the top half of the glass column was saturated with the lnapl fig 2 shows the mri images of the sagittal slices vertical cross section of the entire test section in this experiment fig 2a shows a non selective 1h image of lnapl and water measured together by a single scan a rare sequence was used with te 6 35 ms tr 6 s field of view fov 5 cm 5 cm and with data matrix 256 256 when imaging was performed without any suppression of lnapl or water magnetization a bright signal for the entire sample was obtained therefore simultaneous detection of water and lnapl was not possible and was done sequentially in a sample fig 2b and c show the selective imaging of the lnapl and water respectively in the test column selective lnapl signal was acquired with te 30 ms tr 300 ms and in order to have an enhanced signal pre inversion zero crossing technique was used the selective water signal was acquired using te 6 35 ms tr 6 s and inversion time ti 290 ms the resolution of 195 μm pixel was obtained for both the water and lnapl selective images these optimized protocols were used in all experiments to visualise lnapl and water mobility in the glass beads during water evaporation 2 3 mri measurements of lnapl and water distribution during a typical experiment the glass column loaded with the lnapl and water was subjected to evaporation caused by air flow across the top surface at different intervals in time the airflow was stopped and the distribution of the water and lnapl in the glass column was measured using mri after the placement of the nmr probe with the glass column into the mri instrument the bruker system software paravision was used to perform tuning matching and shimming for this sample the t 1 relaxation time of water and lnapl was used as a contrast to distinguish between the two fluids for the typical experiments sagittal vertical cross section and axial horizontal cross section imaging was done at a resolution of 512 512 pixels in a field of view fov of 3 3 cm which corresponded to a spatial resolution of 59 μm pixel the sequence used for lnapl measurement was spin echo imaging with an echo time te of 16 ms and repetition time tr of 203 ms images of water were obtained with a te 8 ms and tr 6 s here the spin echo method was used with pre inversion zero crossing of lnapl signal to obtain better lnapl suppression inversion time ti 290 ms with a rare factor 4 and a number of scans 1 for sagittal and axial imaging the thickness of the slice was 3 mm and 2 5 mm respectively and consequently the data of water or lnapl intensity obtained from the scan of a particular slice was an average value of the volume corresponding to this slice 2 4 correlation of mri signal intensity and quantity of lnapl and water one of the objectives of the study was to quantify the amount of lnapl and water in the porous media as a function of space and time to facilitate this calibration of the mri signal intensity of the lnapl and water signals was performed individually in terms of the saturation of water and lnapl in the porous media the total porosity of the glass beads was estimated as 0 4 and different amounts of water and lnapl were added to the glass beads to obtain different saturation levels the different lnapl saturation obtained were 7 15 30 51 71 and 90 and the different water saturations obtained were 11 20 36 57 77 and 100 these samples were prepared in ceramic crucibles with 7 g of glass beads and loaded into the glass column used for the mri signal acquisition the mri intensities for the lnapl and water which were measured separately were correlated to the actual saturation levels of lnapl and water respectively the intensities of the mri signals corresponded to images obtained with a resolution of 512 512 pixels fig 3 shows this calibration of the lnapl and water mri signal with the actual lnapl and water saturation used in the porous media 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of lnapl and water distribution during evaporation during the drying experiments the glass column was detached from the teflon setup and inserted into the mri probe for measurements at an evaporation rate corresponding to a surface airflow rate of 5 l min as described earlier the inserted glass column was analysed separately for lnapl and for water in the same position fig 4a and b show the sagittal vertical cross section view of the lnapl and water respectively for different vertical slices 3 mm thick at different times in fig 4a and b the vertical cross sections are numbered from the nearest to the farthest slice since the glass tube was cylindrical the 1st and the 5th slice were thinner than the 2nd 3rd and 4th slices the bright regions in fig 4a and b corresponded to the presence of lnapl and water respectively in the porous media in fig 4a it was observed that in all the slices until past time t 450 min the lnapl did not redistribute in the image corresponding to the later time of 765 min significant redistribution of bright patches above the region was observed implying lnapl migration upwards and was observed to continue until a time of 1445 min fig 4b shows the images of the water distribution it was observed that after time t 0 there was a change in the water signal uniformity and it was very perceptible at time t 450 min where there were patches of dark spots possibly indicating loss of water the potential water loss extended downwards with time and at time t 765 mins the dark patches extended towards the region where the lnapl was present clearly indicating that the redistribution of lnapl is correlated to the mobilisation of the water layers near the lnapl figure s1 shows the comparison of the lnapl rise from the mri and the optical images from the beginning of the experiment to time t 1445 min end of the experiment beyond which time there was no significant water or lnapl redistribution fig 5a and b show the axial images of the lnapl and water distribution respectively corresponding to different slices at different times slice 1 corresponds to the layer at the bottom of the glass column and slice 5 corresponds to the top region of the column it is observed that the patterns of water and lnapl distribution in the axial cross section as a function of time correspond to the distribution observed in the sagittal images fig 6a and b show the pixel wise distribution of the lnapl and water respectively in one of the axial slices of the sample in the field of view 4th slice this clearly showed the increase in the intensity of the lnapl in fig 6a from time t 0 to time t 945 min correspondingly there was a decrease in the water intensity in fig 6b between time t 0 to time t 945 min figs 5 and 6 also indicated that the lnapl distribution was non uniform throughout the column without preference for any specific location within the volume of interest and correlates with the water redistribution due to evaporation fig 7a and b show the plot comparing the lnapl rise as observed by the mri and optical technique respectively along with the time series of the water evaporation flux the total mri sampling time for lnapl and water to obtain multi slice data in both sagittal and in axial directions was 45 min therefore the number of mri scans were limited as compared to the frequency of the acquisition of the optical images however despite the lower number of the mri measurements the trends of the lnapl rise shown in fig 7a and b corresponding to the mri data and the optical images were similar in fig 7a after 450 min the next mri measurement was taken at 765 min fig 7b shows that perceptible lnapl rise started only around 700 min from the mri scan images in figs 4 and 5 it was seen that the lnapl rise commenced when the water redistribution near the lnapl occured fig 7 also shows that lnapl rise is correlated with the water evaporation flux which is also evident from the observation that there was no lnapl movement when the column was relatively drier the water evaporation flux or rate decreased until a time when the lnapl rise continued and then remained at that lower level the decrease in the water evaporation rate can be attributed to two possible effects first there was lesser water in the lnapl rich region and consequently there was lesser flux second any water trapped below the lnapl layer encountered additional diffusional resistance due to the redistribution of the lnapl this comparison also confirmed that the lnapl rise was a phenomenon that occurred throughout the bulk of the porous media and was related to the water evaporation 3 2 estimation of lnapl and water saturation in pores from the axial time series images of the lnapl and water in the porous media the saturation of the lnapl and water were obtained using the calibration shown in fig 3 fig 8a and b show the time series for lnapl and water respectively the intensity of the water reduced with time implying that water was leaving the region of the scan driven by evaporation the intensity of lnapl and water obtained from an entire slice was estimated from the mri data and the corresponding lnapl or water saturation values were obtained from the calibration fig 8a showed the change in the lnapl saturation as a function of time initially the lnapl was present at the bottom of the glass column with a thickness of about 8 mm this region was indicated by the shaded bar at the bottom of the graph marked in the legend as initial and this region extended over 2 axial slices nearly 5 mm in this region near saturation of the lnapl in the pore spaces was expected fig 8a shows the average lnapl saturation for a slice at different times during the evaporation of the water the lnapl saturation shown at time t 765 min was based on the data from fig 4a and 5a where the lnapl re distribution was observed in the slices corresponding to time t 765 min the lnapl had already spread upwards from its initial position so there was a decrease in the lnapl saturation that was visible in the axial slice shown in fig 5a corresponding to t 765 min in comparison to the previous image corresponding to t 450 min the bulk of the rise happened within a few millimeters above the initial location corresponding to two slices above the initial region the top three slices show lower lnapl saturation at time t 765 min at longer times there is a decrease in the saturation in the region 5 10 mm and a corresponding increase in the saturation in the top three slices this clearly shows the movement of the lnapl upwards corresponding to this in fig 8b the distribution of water in the same system is observed from time t 0 to about time t 450 min the pores were nearly fully saturated as time progressed the water content decreased between time t 450 and time t 765 min there was a significant change in the water content further redistribution is observed at time t 945 min data was collected until 1485 min however the distribution is not shown in fig 8 since the field of view did not cover the entire region of the column all the way to the top some migration that occurred into this unscanned region near the top will not be taken into account in the distribution therefore the distribution at these times was not shown in figure the distribution of saturation shown in figure until 945 min illustrates that redistribution of the lnapl does take place analysis of the intensities of the mri signal in relation to the slice location and time showed that in regions which are water saturated i e at all slices 3 8 and at time t 0 the average mri intensity for napl was 251 344 18 898 based on the calibration in fig 3 this corresponds to a napl value of 5 41 this implies that in this particular experimental setup the quantitative limit for napl saturation is 5 41 this happens specifically when the resolution of imaging is 512 512 and does not happen when the resolution is 256 256 the napl saturation values shown in fig 8 account for this correction the lnapl and water saturation values can be useful in estimating the fate and transport of solutes within a porous medium using an advection diffusion contaminant transport model 3 3 mechanism of lnapl movement spontaneous napl rise is reported in literature as a result of capillary forces and wetting washburn 1921 harkins and feldman 1922 hirasaki 1993 vizika et al 1996 zhou and blunt 1997 takamura et al 2012 singh et al 2016 xu et al 2008 since it is established in our study that the lnapl rise is due to the water evaporation the mechanism of water evaporation in porous media was examined there is significant evidence of the water film formation during water evaporation in porous media and its upward movement shokri et al 2008 yiotis et al 2003 when the water evaporation front reach the region of the initial napl position a three phase region air water napl may be formed based on the presence of the water film during water evaporation two hypotheses were presented in our previous work govindarajan et al 2018 here we provide additional tests done to resolve the mechanism based on these hypotheses which are re stated here a the napl spontaneously spreads on a thin film of water formed during the evaporation of water if the napl has a positive spreading coefficient b the moving water film during evaporation drags the napl along with it to test hypothesis a the spreading coefficients of the napls used in this study and the previous motor oil light crude oil were estimated spreading coefficient s is defined as s γaw γan γnw harkins and feldman 1922 where γaw γan and γnw are the interfacial tensions between air water air napl and napl water respectively based on their theory if the spreading coefficient value of a napl was positive then the napl was expected to spread on water as a thin film conversely if the spreading coefficient value of a napl was negative then napl was not expected to spread on water and would stay as a thick lens in the previous work govindarajan et al 2018 the rise of three different lnapls were reported motor oil light crude oil and bunker oil the spreading coefficients of motor oil mo and light crude oil lco were estimated from the interfacial tensions between napl water and napl air the interfacial tension of lco water and mo water were estimated as 25 63 mn m and 14 05 mn m respectively the surface tension of lco motor oil and water was 32 7 mn m 29 93 mn m and 72 mn m respectively the values of the spreading coefficient s for motor oil and light crude oil were found to be 28 02 and 13 67 the interfacial tension between bunker oil and water could not be measured accurately and therefore the spreading coefficient of bunker oil was not reported the positive spreading coefficients imply that the napl would spread spontaneously on thin film of water that was created during the evaporation of water from the porous media in order to test if just the mere presence of a thin film is sufficient to cause the spreading of the napl on the water film additional experiments were performed to create a system with a thin film of water and observe the napl behavior in our experimental system we placed a layer of wet sand with 30 saturation on top of the napl motor oil saturated layer shown in figure s2 in the supplementary file the target conditions in the unsaturated zone were to ensure i a continuous water film on the sand surface and ii an air water napl interface at the junction between the napl saturated zone and the unsaturated zone if the saturation levels were too high then the water layer will drain down to the napl layer and eliminate the pore air thus making it a two phase system instead of three phase system if the saturation levels were too low there might not be a continuous water film therefore a suitably low value of saturation 30 was determined by trial and error from the observation of the water at the napl water interface visually water and white sand were mixed in a crucible with appropriate amounts corresponding to estimated water saturation of 30 and then added on top of the napl saturated layer in the glass tube in these experiments water was colored with a water soluble blue dye for better visualization there was no air flow across the surface of the sand column to reduce the evaporation to nearly zero only diffusion transport of water takes place during that time which is significantly lower than evaporation driven by the convective mass transfer at the surface the top end of the column was open but was not connected to any air supply and kept away from any air movement and inside an analytical balance to verify any mass loss the experimental setup was observed for about 24 h no significant napl rise was observed and there was no measureable mass loss this implied that without water evaporation napl rise was not observed at partial water saturation in the presence of films this could imply two possibilities i spreading is not occurring on the films of water as predicted by the spreading coefficient theory or ii there are no films of water in the experiment as intended there are several uncertainties with reference to the presence and stability of the water films to address these uncertainties an alternative set of experiments was conducted in these experiments the water was allowed to evaporate under conditions of air flow at 5 l min napl rise was observed using optical imaging when the napl rise commenced the air flow across the top surface was shut off when the napl rise of 3 4 mm was observed this resulted in decrease of the water evaporation rate to nearly zero while the system was still under atmospheric pressure at the surface fig 9a shows the napl rise for triplicate experiments when water evaporation was halted in comparison to the original case where water evaporation continued for longer periods in fig 9a the legend partial drying corresponds to the case where the evaporation was halted after 300 min of drying and when the napl rise has commenced fig 9a shows that when the evaporation was halted the napl rise also stopped it is expected that at this point in the evaporation of water there is a significant three phase region above the napl saturated zone if water wetting effect based on the positive spreading coefficient were to dominate the napl rise should have continued even when the water evaporation was halted this also shows that the spreading theory based on the spreading coefficient is not sufficient to explain the napl rise during evaporation another set of experiments was performed with a napl hexadecane with negative spreading coefficient if spreading on water films was the dominant mechanism then napl rise should not be observed in such an experiment since hexadecane had a spreading co efficient value of 9 hirasaki 1993 experiments performed with hexadecane are shown in comparison with those for lco and mo for the same conditions of experiment in fig 9b this data shows that the napl rise for hexadecane was higher than that of lco or mo this shows that the theory of the spreading based on the spreading coefficient does not seem to have an effect on the napl rise on the other hand hexadecane has a lower viscosity than the lco and a higher napl rise implying that napl viscosity plays a larger role the other significant aspect about either hypotheses with reference to the presence of a napl and water film during evaporation the mri experiments fill in this critical piece of information to address this higher resolutions using the mri to observe the lnapl and water films higher resolution images 22 μm pixel with a field of view of 1 4 cm 1 4 cm were obtained for the axial and sagittal views of the lnapl rise and water evaporation these images were acquired in the region where visually observable lnapl rise had already commenced figures s3a and s3b and s3b show the high resolution axial images of lnapl and water respectively for a system of 0 5 mm glass beads figure s3a and s3b and s3b show the distribution of lnapl and water respectively in the same axial slice the intensities of the lnapl and water in figs s3a and s3b are shown as bright field in the image the dark regions could be both air and glass beads which do not display an mri signal fig s2c shows an overlay of figs s3a and s3b where the lnapl is shown in green and the water is shown as red the distribution pattern in the overlay fig s3c corresponds to the individual images of the lnapl and water seen in figs s3a and s3b there are separate regions that were water rich and lnapl rich however there were a large number of regions that contained thin water films mixed with regions of lnapl throughout since the slice thickness was 2 5 mm and the glass beads were 0 5 mm each image potentially showed the overlap of at least six glass bead layers the lnapl and water intensity displayed in the images were a sum of all the lnapl and water intensities in the entire slice it was therefore difficult to delineate the individual layer of glass beads and associate the observed intensities to the thin films of lnapl and water to help study this aspect in more detail and reduce the effect of the overlap additional lnapl rise experiments and mri imaging was performed with larger diameter 1 mm glass beads with larger pore spaces and lesser overlap fig 10a b and c show the high resolution mri images for lnapl water and the overlay of lnapl water respectively with 1 mm grain size glass beads in an axial slice in a region where lnapl rise had been visually observed in these images several borders of the glass beads are clearly visible along with the overlapping of the glass beads as well the minimum number of overlap is reduced to three in this case as compared to six grains in the case of the 0 5 mm glass beads in a given slice of 2 5 mm these images show films of lnapl and water in the gaps between the glass beads and around the glass beads in the image overlay of the lnapl and water fig 10c the presence of lnapl and water at the same site occurred in more locations than observed in the 0 5 mm glass beads images there are however regions where either the water or the lnapl dominated since the slice thickness was larger than the grain size it is possible that these bulk images show a composite of thin films that are aligned horizontally despite these artifacts there are clear indications of the presence of the lnapl and water in the pore spaces and as thin films and lends support to the mechanistic hypothesis discussed earlier the pore space between two grains 1 mm thick can be as large as 50 μm under a particular set of grain orientation and arrangement as observed under a microscope the lnapl and water films of lnapl and water can be expected to be between 10 and 50 μm under different levels of pore saturation figs 10 d e and f show a magnified view of a particular section of the images shown in fig 10 where it is clear that both lnapl and water occupy the region next to the glass beads as evident from the bright curvatures that appear around the dark regions represented by the glass beads since the glass beads do not display an mri signal magnified sections of the images in fig 10a b c are shown in figs 10 d e f respectively these magnified sections show the presence of thin films that are a few microns thick in the region of the napl water interface thus the combination of the optical and the mri images further the understanding of the observations of napl rise the theory of spreading using the spreading coefficient is not supported in these sets of experiments and observations the alternative hypothesis of the moving film of water dragging the napl also seen as thin films in the mri images is a viable hypothesis the spatio temporal mri scans of the water and napl in the glass column reveals that the napl rise occurs when the water evaporation front reaches the napl layer this implied that the enhanced napl rise was strongly linked to the water evaporation there is evidence in literature on the flow of immiscible fluids in contact with each other corey 2003 all these studies have given us sufficient basis to work on the mathematical modeling of the processes observed in continuing work further experiments must be done using a single layer of glass beads and observe the evolution of the lnapl water air interface and the orientation of the system as a function of time it is possible to do experiments with the mri system by designing a single grain layer and studying this process in situ using the pore scale mri data pore scale modeling may be attempted to simulate the process of lnapl rise this information can help devise an effective approach to model the lnapl rise 4 conclusions the spontaneous rise of lnapl during the natural evaporation of water from porous media comprising glass beads was observed using magnetic resonance imaging mri the selective measurement of lnapl and water in the porous medium was successfully demonstrated without the addition of any tracer doping substance paramagnetic agent the mri data was used to estimate the lnapl and water saturation levels in the porous media this is useful from a perspective of the modeling of contaminant fate and transport in porous media where such lnapl redistribution might occur using these and other observations in the literature about the evaporation of water it was hypothesised that the lnapl rise occurs in association with the behavior of the thin films of water that are formed during the evaporation of water from porous media which is not possible from optical imaging high resolution images of the pore level distribution of lnapl and water are obtained to study the geometry and relative positioning of the lnapl and water the imaging showed that the lnapl and water films co existed and provided estimates of the film thickness which are useful parameters that can be used in mathematical modeling of the process however the experimental artifacts mainly arising from the thickness of the slice of the mri image must be overcome to further examine the evolution of the lnapl rise process the mri methodology is also useful in probing the transport of other solutes in this scenario or the partitioning of solutes present in the lnapl phase and the possible stratification of the different fractions of lnapls such as petrol and diesel declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgement this study

do 3 0 mg l our analyses suggest that these conditions may allow the presence of nitrifying microorganisms which can couple with anammox n damo and denitrifying bacteria in interrelated biogeochemical pathways gene density as the number of gene copies per litre was lower in the rainy season than in the dry season possibly due to dilution by rainwater infiltration yet the numbers of hzo gene copies here found were similar to those reported in oceanic oxygen minimum zones and in a carbonate rock aquifer the transcript sequences showed that candidatus brocadia spp anammox candidatus methylomirabilis spp n damo and autotrophic denitrifying betaproteobacteria coexist in the groundwater environment with the potential to attenuate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by

nitrous oxide reduction nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation anaerobic ammonium oxidation 1 introduction agricultural activities such as fertilization livestock farming and irrigation with reclaimed water often contaminate groundwater with nitrogen desimone and howes 1998 lockhart et al 2013 in addition there are other non agricultural sources in urban areas such as discharges from septic tanks and leakages of sewers landfills and wastewater treatment ponds that contribute to this problem wakida and lerner 2005 groundwater pollution with nitrate has consequences for human and

subsurface microbiota can attenuate the concentration of n pollutants triggering biological processes including the well known denitrification pathway and the recently detected anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process singleton et al 2007 moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2019 these observations highlight the role of aquifer bacteria and suggest their participation in the removal of contaminants dojka et al 1998 this important ecosystem service griebler and avramov 2014 needs to be investigated in more detail since it offers opportunities for decontamination of polluted aquifers the recent use of culture independent techniques in microbiological surveys has increased our knowledge about aquifer bacteria due to this it is known that several factors shape the microbial community structure including lithostratigraphy beyer et al 2015 spatial heterogeneity lima et al 2018 and disturbances such as pollution alfreider and vogt 2007 showing the relevance of the geochemical conditions in the diversity and activity of groundwater microorganisms yet just a few studies have observed the temporal variability of the microbial communities in shallow aquifers which are highly subjected to hydrochemical variations clay et al 1996 pauwels et al 2001 recently zelaya et al 2019 surveyed a non contaminated aquifer using a 16s rrna approach and observed that each well had a characteristic microbial community relatively stable over time and with a constant functional gene diversity in addition to the 16s rrna gene surveys analysing functional gene expression within natural microbial communities allows us to link the potential biogeochemical activity of microorganisms and to verify the transcription of relevant processes in the field avoiding laboratory incubation artefacts these studies consider in situ conditions such as stressors and nutrient concentrations at sub micromolar levels konopka and wilkins 2012 which constrain microbial activity and might be difficult to mimic in the laboratory especially for processes that depend on subsurface gases such as h2 ch4 and n2o for example transcript analyses have been used to detect thiobacillus denitrificans related organisms heterotrophic denitrification in a microbial consortium enriched from an oligotrophic limestone aquifer kumar et al 2018 suggesting its application in groundwater studies nitrate concentration in shallow aquifers is influenced by seasonal cycles clay et al 1996 pauwels et al 2001 mainly due to its high solubility and mobility yet there is little information regarding the temporal variability of the microbial communities in shallow aquifers and the variations in the number of bacteria capable of transforming inorganic n forms no3 no2 and nh4 into n2 microbial processes such as nitrous oxide reduction last step of denitrification anammox and nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo are known to transform dissolved n forms into

10 of the added n leaches as no3 beyond the root zone hernández martínez et al 2018 nitrate concentration in this aquifer ranges between 17 and 23 mg l no3 n hernández martínez et al 2018 the dominant soil types in the piedmont are haplic and vertic phaeozems 0 4 1 5 m depth hernández martínez 2017 which are delimited at the bottom by a dense and compact volcanic tuff locally known as tepetate this tepetate has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the soil and contributes to the formation of lateral flows during irrigation events the intermediate vadose zone is formed by pseudostratified volcanic materials with variable hydraulic conductivity mainly composed of lahars and pyroclasts with low organic matter content carbonates in this zone can represent up to 25 caco3 displaying thus a slightly alkaline nature hernández martínez 2017 finally the saturated zone is a mix of alluvial and volcanic deposits where its limits vary according to the piedmont site lithologic descriptions suggest a low content of caco3 in the saturated zone 0 2 and the presence of reduced precipitated minerals in the lower stratum hernández martínez 2017 the groundwater samples here studied were obtained from a local domestic driven well well at 10 m depth 1 5 m ø rock wall and from a deep piezometer piezometer installed at 24 m depth and equipped with hydraulic pvc 4 ø a silica gravel filter and a bentonite seal fig 2 previous studies suggest that these sampling sites can be used for monitoring groundwater pollutants hernández martínez et al 2014 the static level water in the piezometer was 12 13 m below ground level and 6 7 m in the well being slightly lower during the dry season thus the water column in the well site was about 3 4 m tall and 11 12 m in the piezometer monitoring during the last years suggests that the rainwater infiltration slightly increases the level of the water column during the rainy season yet the concentration of nitrate seems relatively stable through the year but further studies must be done to clarify this issue samplings between 2012 and 2015 finally this aquifer discharges in a local spring named cerro colorado spring at 2055 m a s l del arenal 1985 hernández martínez et al 2014 which was also included for this study this spring appeared as the result of substantial inflows such as wastewater irrigation returns inputs from a local dam requena dam and infiltrations from the salado river del arenal 1985 with a discharge rate of 600 l s bsg and conagua 1998 2 2 water sampling and physicochemical characterization the sampling was carried out in 2017 february may august october and november and 2018 january the samples included the wastewater used for irrigation canal and the groundwater from the piezometer the local well and the spring fig 2 the canal and spring were directly sampled using 500 ml sterile polyethylene containers while the piezometer and the well were sampled using a stainless steel discrete groundwater sampler discrete interval sampler model 425 1 66 ø solinst before sampling the piezometer was purged by removing the stagnant water using a pvc bailer and left to recover for 10 min the well was also purged before sampling using an electric pump this methodology has been proved to be proper for both sites hernández martínez 2017 for the spring samples were collected at 50 cm from the point of discharge once collected the samples for biological analyses were transferred into 500 ml sterile polyethylene containers all the samples were collected the same day during light day 10 00 16 00 h the

from the filter membranes using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen according to the instructions of the manufacturer 1 3 days after the sampling and filtration processes the same kit was also employed for the wastewater samples but instead of membranes the resuspended pellets were used for total rna isolation from the piezometer samples the rneasy powerwater kit qiagen was used following the manufacturer s protocol the obtained rna was further treated with dnase rq1 rnase free dnase promega to remove residual dna and then purified with the rneasy mini kit qiagen every rna sample was tested by pcr to ensure that they were dna free using 2 μl of the eluted material and primers targeting rpob table 1 finally the rna molecules were reverse transcribed to cdna using the goscript

wallis analyses were performed to assess differences among the physicochemical conditions between the sites while mann whitney s tests were used for paired comparisons these statistical analyses were done with the program graphpad prism 6 graphpad software la jolla california usa finally to relate the effect of the physicochemical characteristics of each site with the microbial community structure canonical correspondence analyses cca were done with the function cca in vegan package based on legendre and legendre 2012 algorithm then we used the envfit function vegan to obtain the correlation for each variable and select those with p 05 permutations 999 which were included in the figures shown these analyses were done in the r statistical environment v 3 6 0 3 results 3 1 physicochemical environment the measured physicochemical characteristics were within the often reported parameters for wastewater and groundwater the canal is an open distribution channel where the wastewater temperature is slightly higher and more variable 20 9 1 8 c than in groundwater 19 1 0 c fig 3 possibly due to solar radiation seasonal changes air currents and day night cycles the ph values in the wastewater and in all groundwater samples was circumneutral 7 2 and with slight variations the electrical conductivity of wastewater 1419 μs cm was found to be slightly saline for agricultural irrigation according to the mexican environmental agreement ce cca 001 89 where the maximum limit recommended is 1000 μs cm yet differences between the temperature ph and ce values were not significant among the sampling sites the oxidation reduction potential orp of the wastewater had negative values 88 mv indicating a reducing environment wastewater often contains a high proportion of organic carbon fig 2 that increases o2 consumption by heterotrophs this demand decreases the concentration of dissolved o2 do until exhaustion and as a result oxygen is found below the detection levels in wastewater fig 3 these two characteristics orp and do were significantly different between the wastewater canal and the groundwater samples piezometer well and spring in contrast the groundwater samples had average values of 145 166 mv of orp with 2 77 4 22 mg l of do where inorganic carbon is essential for autotrophic metabolisms fig 2 the inorganic n forms that are also associated with anammox n damo and denitrification were also quantified nitrate was found in all the groundwater samples well piezometer and spring with mean values ranging from 17 7 to 22 5 mg l no3 n while small amounts were found in the wastewater fig 3 in contrast dissolved nh4 was the main n form in the canal 27 7 mg l nh4 n but in groundwater it was only possible to detect it occasionally with a handheld colorimeter 0 016 0 031 mg l nh4 n the concentration of both n species no3 n and nh4 n was also significantly different between the wastewater and the groundwater similar to the do and orp values nitrite was only detected in the groundwater samples especially in the piezometer 0 04 0 01 μg l no2 n and at times in the well and spring thus nitrite concentration showed significant differences between the piezometer with the well and canal 3 2 16s rrna analysis the bacterial and archaeal communities in the wastewater and groundwater were surveyed with the hypervariable region v4 of the 16s rrna gene following an ngs approach the diversity and rarefaction analyses showed that the wastewater contained the lowest number of observed asvs 199 in average while the well had the highest 831 table 2 similarly the shannon index showed a relationship with these results where all the values were near or above four in the groundwater samples therefore the wastewater used for irrigation has a low bacterial and archaeal diversity while groundwater has a higher one the 16s rrna gene survey also showed that the main bacterial archaeal community structure was different at each site i e at the canal piezometer well and spring and it can be noticed from the recharge to the discharge zone of the piedmont fig 4a the wastewater canal had the phylum proteobacteria as the most abundant in all the sampled months 70 with a lower proportion of bacteroidetes firmicutes and fusobacteria the piezometer had a predominance of proteobacteria nevertheless groups such as bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria exhibited 16s rrna abundances from 2 to 50 which increased in october 30 and november 50 the well showed a similar 16s rrna based community throughout the sampling times where proteobacteria 30 40 was the main phylum followed by firmicutes op3 actinobacteria and nitrospira in contrast in the spring photosynthetic oxygenic cyanobacteria and microalgae chloroplasts were the main microorganisms 34 78 a deeper analysis at order level showed that there is a co occurrence of the orders brocadiales and methylomirabiales in the piezometer and well associated with the anammox and n damo pathways respectively fig 4a the similarities among the canal piezometer well and spring samples were further studied with a canonical correspondence analysis cca displaying the correlations between the microbial community structure and the hydrochemical characteristics at each site fig 4b this analysis indicated that the samples were clustered by site regardless of the month of collection however in open systems such as the canal and the spring which are prone to temporal variations by temperature changes and the entrance of rainwater the samples collected in january and august were slightly separated from the other ones yet the subsurface water samples piezometer and well did not show changes along the year and had a relatively stable composition over time in addition the piezometer and well had a similar but not identical microbial community structure the canal samples were mainly associated with the presence of nh4 and po4 3 in contrast the groundwater samples piezometer and well were defined by cations such as ca2 and mg2 and in broader view by the amount of do and nitrate additionally the spring was associated with the concentration of so4 2 we also tested the correlation of the environmental characteristics with the microbial community fitting the physicochemical variables into the ordination space as vectors the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium were the variables which mostly contributed to the structure of the microbial community p 001 followed by the amount of dissolved oxygen and sulphates also with p 001 but with lower r2 values fig 4b the taxonomic 16s rrna gene affiliation also suggested the presence of groups involved in the transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammonia and nitrite oxidizers nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrospira and nitrospina were found in the groundwater mainly in the piezometer and the well at a relative abundance of 0 73 and 0 55 respectively fig 5a anammox and n damo bacteria including candidatus brocadia candidatus scalindua and candidatus methylomirabilis were also encountered in groundwater piezometer 0 3 3 6 well 1 7 4 9 fig 5b but at a higher relative abundance than nitrifiers finally potential denitrifying bacteria were also detected such as hydrogenophaga thauera and pseudomonas fig 5c a multivariate analysis was also done to correlate the physicochemical water characteristics with the shifts in the community composition of these n cycle microorganisms fig 5d the canonical correspondence analysis cca analysis showed that the higher relative abundance of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers was correlated with orp do values and no3 concentration suggesting that the presence of nitrifiers was favoured by positive orps and the presence of its final metabolic product anammox bacteria such as c brocadia were related to orp values and no3 concentration while c scalindua with the concentration of no2 c methylomirabilis n damo was also correlated with opr and no3 concentration these results suggest that the presence of nitrifying anammox and n damo bacteria is favoured in groundwater sites that contain no3 and no2 besides the orp do conditions which allow them to co exist while potential denitrifiers are found in both wastewater and groundwater 3 3 nosz hzo nod and pmoa gene analyses the genetic potential for nitrous oxide reduction anammox and n damo was determined by quantifying the number of nosz hzo nod and pmoa gene copies at two sampling times i the dry and ii the rainy seasons fig 6 to validate the assay a constitutive control was also measured i e the gene encoding for the β subunit of the rna polymerase rpob deslippe et al 2014 the qpcr analyses confirmed the presence of rpob nosz hzo nod and pmoa genes at all the sites in both seasons especially in the groundwater samples the number of gene copies was higher in the dry season may than in the rainy season august this might be possibly due to rainwater which dilutes the wastewater or infiltrates into the shallow aquifer the wastewater canal contained the highest number of gene copies per unit of volume among the sampled sites showing that the bacterial density in the wastewater is higher than in the shallow groundwater as expected regarding the genetic potential for anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction in the groundwater samples the number of nosz copies was 0 01 4 5 109 copies l nod 1 1 133 105 copies l hzo 1 4 39 104 copies l and pmoa 0 709 168 104 copies l in a trend where nosz nod pmoa hzo fig 6 the high amount of nosz copies at all sites might be due to its wide distribution in several bacterial groups and its repeated presence in some genomes jones et al 2008 while rpob is known to be only in one copy per genome dahllöf et al 2000 this can be confirmed with the nosz rpob ratio showing values 1 table 3 however despite finding a higher number of gene copies during the dry season the gene rpob ratio showed a higher proportion of hzo nod pmoa and nosz genes within the community during the rainy season being these ratios higher in the surface systems i e canal and spring than in the below ground sites i e piezometer and well unfortunately there is not clear evidence of a measured physicochemical property contributing to this shift and we can only observe that the temperature was slightly lower in the rainy season 1 5 c and with a slightly reduced concentration of no3 n 2 0 mg l no3 n thus further studies must be done to clarify the increase of the potential anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reducing communities during the rainy season it is worth noting that the hzo nod and pmoa genes were also detected in the wastewater samples 6 106 to 1 8 108 gene copies l fig 6 but the 16s rrna sequences belonging to the brocadiales and methylomirabiales were not found fig 4 section 3 2 to verify the presence of anammox and n damo bacteria we quantified the wastewater transcripts during the dry season which is the one with the highest number of gene copies we found that the nod transcripts were present 1 4 104 transcripts l while hzo and pmoa were below the detection level these results agree with the fact that hzo and nod genes are often found in sludges from wastewater treatment plants and consequently both can be present in wastewater samples yet the physicochemical conditions in the distribution canal might not be favourable for the activity of brocadiales hzo and methylomirabiales pmoa bacteria as suggested by the low abundance of their 16s rrna sequences which were not detected with the methodology employed here thus the transcribed nod genes might belong to unknown nor related genes zu et al 2017 such as those from bacteroidetes which represented 6 to 18 of the wastewater 16s rrna relative abundance fig 4 the number of transcripts associated with anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction was determined in the piezometer samples using cdna synthetized from the total rna extracted in both seasons fig 7a the number of transcripts quantified in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season following a similar trend as the gene copies possibly due to dilution by rainwater another difference was that the nod gene was the one with the highest number of transcripts 1 23 88 7 104 copies l followed by pmoa 0 89 7 33 104 copies l hzo 2 54 33 7 103 copies l and nosz 2 46 50 5 103 copies l then the number of transcripts followed the order nod pmoa hzo nosz the nod rpob ratio of the transcripts suggests that nod is the most actively transcribed and that it is the only gene that shows differences in the ratio of transcripts compared to the control rpob dry 0 57 rainy 0 81 increasing its transcription during the rainy season for the other genes hzo nosz and pmoa the ratio did not show differences among seasons being hzo and nosz those with the lowest number of transcripts in the piezometer in addition the cdna dna ratio was also determined and showed that nod and pmoa n damo pathway had the highest number of transcripts in relationship with the genetic potential encoded in the genome this ratio was similar to the constitutive control rpob confirming a high transcriptional activity of the nod and pmoa genes finally the lowest proportion of transcripts and gene copies was related to the nitrous oxide reduction process nosz rainy 0 0002 dry 0 0011 showing a high genetic potential but a low number of transcripts finally to verify the identity of the actively transcribing bacteria in the piezometer the amplified hzo pmoa nod and nosz gene fragments were sequenced the hzo sequences were grouped in only one phylotype and related to candidatus brocadia fulgida with 91 identity fig 7b previously reported in an aquifer system kumar et al 2017 the pmoa sequences were related to c methylomirabilis oxyfera and c methylomirabilis sinica and to other environmental phylotypes 90 98 identity most of the nod sequences were clustered within a unique group mezquital cluster and related to those sequences belonging to c methylomirabilis oxyfera 78 91 identity and others detected in btex contaminated aquifers zhu et al 2017 while the nosz fragments were affiliated to beta and gammaproteobacteria of known autotrophic denitrifiers such as thauera 93 identity which has been also found in the sediments of a shallow aquifer in the hetao basin inner mongolia li et al 2014 4 discussion our results showed a highly diverse microbial community in the studied shallow aquifer based on the 16s rrna gene analysis where nitrate concentration is above the limit of the mexican norm for drinking water 10 mg l no3 n the comparison of the groundwater microbial communities here surveyed with those reported showed that they had similar shannon index values h table 2 this was especially true for the canal piezometer and spring while the well presented a slightly higher h value furthermore it was also found that the bacterial and archaeal composition was distinctive at each site despite of the sampled month season and there was a co occurrence of microorganisms capable of transforming dissolved inorganic nitrogen by anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction the bacterial community structure at the below ground sites was relatively stable at the surveyed moments while those from the surface water bodies canal and spring showed slight variations mainly during the rainy season these results are similar to those of zelaya et al 2019 where each surveyed well had a distinctive microbial community considering a sampling frequency of twice a week for three months the differences among the below ground sites can be also related to their intrinsic characteristics especially considering the environment of the well and the piezometer for example the sampled well represents a typical local well permanent open and with a wide diameter that allows the rapid interchange with the atmosphere together with a water column of 3 4 m in comparison the deep piezometer has a narrower entrance and a water column of approximately 11 12 m despite there are no significant differences in parameters such as do and orp among both sites fig 3 the almost constant presence of detectable no2 in the piezometer suggests the occurrence of microoxic layers that are probably mixed during the recovery process after purging and that are collected during sampling consequently the microbial community within the piezometer shows a higher number of gene copies related to anammox n damo and denitrification than the well these slight differences in the aquifer microbiota can be observed in fig 4b further the subsurface environment of the well and piezometer differs due to hydrologic and geochemical dynamics at each site which are also related to their position in the piedmont this can be observed in the water level of the piezometer 12 13 m below ground and the well 6 7 m according to their altitude fig 2 also the lithology of each site might contribute to a differentiated presence of electron donors such as particulate organic c pyrite or non pyrite ferrous iron that can be coupled in different microbial metabolisms böhlke et al 2002 stenger et al 2018 however further studies must be done to clarify the changes in the groundwater environment along the flowpath the groundwater community structure and the occurrence of nitrifying anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reducing bacteria were associated with the concentration of no2 no3 and orp do values figs 4 and 5 nitrate was the most abundant dissolved inorganic n form in the piezometer and well where oxic conditions prevail orp 145 mv and 3 mg l of do yet nh4 and no2 were also detected in small amounts these low concentrations of nh4 and no2 suggest that the physicochemical conditions might not be favourable for their presence i e nh4 is the main dissolved inorganic n form in suboxic groundwater böhlke et al 2006 and no2 is uncommon under oxic conditions yet it might be possible that these substrates are also subjected to high turnover due to their active consumption and substrate competition through nitrification n damo anammox and denitrification or other processes such as assimilation studies in reactors and groundwater samples have observed that nitrate reduction and anammox processes are carried out despite low concentration of nh4 and no2 postma et al 1991 connan et al 2016 the orp do conditions measured in the mezquital valley groundwater would seem unsuitable for optimal anammox and n damo processes nonetheless anammox activity has been confirmed in reactors with orp values from 107 to 375 mv gao et al 2014 while groundwater samples dominated by c brocadia fulgida up to 10 6 can register 3 mg l oxygen kumar et al 2017 the orp do conditions here observed may allow the presence of other bacterial archaeal metabolisms that can be coupled in interrelated biogeochemical pathways for example nitrifiers are known to grow under a wide do range park et al 2010 and under the proper conditions they can be interconnected with anammox n damo and denitrifying bacteria in the aquifer system fig 8 high metabolic couplings have been observed in an aquifer adjacent to the colorado river anantharaman et al 2016 thus possibly under the physicochemical conditions of the shallow aquifer of the mezquital valley taxonomically and metabolically diverse bacteria and archaea can thrive in the saturated zone transforming several substrates and contaminants especially those derived from n pollution showing thus functional diversity previous reports have shown the presence of microorganisms that are able to transform n compounds in aquifers by either denitrification anammox or n damo moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however here we show that the mezquital valley aquifer has the genetic potential for the three processes the quantification assays of the hzo nod pmoa and nosz genes in the mgdna and cdna confirmed the genetic potential and or transcription in groundwater samples for anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction mainly in the piezometer our results suggest that the gene density as number of copies per litre was higher in the dry season while the gene rpob ratio indicates that the n transforming bacterial communities might be enriched during the rainy season yet this relationship could not be clarified with the data here obtained and further studies are necessary to address this issue the number of hzo gene copies here found was similar to those reported in oceanic oxygen minimum zones hzo 104 copies l kong et al 2013 and in a carbonate rock aquifer hzsa 105 copies l kumar et al 2017 though there are other studies reporting hzo and nosz gene copies in the aquifer environments smith et al 2015 hernández del amo et al 2018 comparisons are difficult due to the ratios employed which are based on 16s rrna gene counts it is tempting to conclude that the n damo activity is higher than nitrous oxide reduction and anammox based on the number of transcripts in the piezometer nod pmoa nosz hzo as some studies have shown a correlation among functional gene expression and activity bælum et al 2008 however it is not very reliable to relate nod pmmo hzo and nos activities with the number of transcripts nitrogen removal efficiencies have been related to hzo gene concentrations dna copies in anammox reactors but no correlation has been observed with the number of mrna molecules wang et al 2016 in addition genes used to survey anammox nir hzs and hzo have shown differences in several orders of magnitude in dna and cdna quantifications wang et al 2016 these differences might be due to the presence of more than one copy encoded in the genome of anammox bacteria and their transcription patterns consequently isotopic experiments encompassed with transcriptional activity assays are needed to know the relevance of n cycle processes in the mezquital valley aquifer and their transcriptional patterns furthermore groundwater microorganisms can migrate within the aquifer and consequently their co location can be a limiting factor establishing their activity at a precise spatial location 5 conclusions this study reflects the first genetic survey of the mezquital valley aquifer that may help orient future research in n polluted shallow aquifers though several approaches have suggested the biogeochemical transformations in these underground systems studying the microbial diversity by the 16s rrna and their functional gene abundances together with their transcription in the subsurface increases the understanding of this underground biosphere yet further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationships between the microbial community and the environmental and geochemical conditions in these complex environments including other shallow aquifers to contrast different geological settings and pollution levels especially when addressing temporal shifts and their possible causes our results show that c brocadia spp c methylomirabilis spp and autotrophic denitrifying betaproteobacteria coexist in the groundwater environment with the potential to attenuate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen nh4 no3 no2 and greenhouse gasses such as ch4 and n2o delivering thus an important ecosystem service to remove

1494,groundwater n pollution derives from agricultural and urban activities and compromises water quality in shallow aquifers putting human and environmental health at risk nonetheless subsurface microbiota can transform dissolved inorganic nitrogen into n2 in this study we surveyed the microbial community of a shallow aquifer by sampling one well one piezometer and a spring within an agricultural area that receives n inputs of more than 700 kg ha per year through irrigation with wastewater the survey was conducted during a year with a 16s rrna next gen approach in parallel we quantified the number of gene copies and transcripts related to anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox hzo nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo nod and pmoa and nitrous oxide reduction last step of denitrification nosz during the dry and rainy seasons our results showed that the groundwater samples had 17 7 to 22 5 mg l of no3 n the bacterial and archaeal community structure was distinctive at each site and it remained relatively stable over time we verified the co occurrence of n transforming bacteria which was correlated with the concentration of no2 no3 and orp do values do 3 0 mg l our analyses suggest that these conditions may allow the presence of nitrifying microorganisms which can couple with anammox n damo and denitrifying bacteria in interrelated biogeochemical pathways gene density as the number of gene copies per litre was lower in the rainy season than in the dry season possibly due to dilution by rainwater infiltration yet the numbers of hzo gene copies here found were similar to those reported in oceanic oxygen minimum zones and in a carbonate rock aquifer the transcript sequences showed that candidatus brocadia spp anammox candidatus methylomirabilis spp n damo and autotrophic denitrifying betaproteobacteria coexist in the groundwater environment with the potential to attenuate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by reducing it to n2 rather than n2o delivering thus an important ecosystem service to remove contaminants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen transformation groundwater bacteria nitrous oxide reduction nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation anaerobic ammonium oxidation 1 introduction agricultural activities such as fertilization livestock farming and irrigation with reclaimed water often contaminate groundwater with nitrogen desimone and howes 1998 lockhart et al 2013 in addition there are other non agricultural sources in urban areas such as discharges from septic tanks and leakages of sewers landfills and wastewater treatment ponds that contribute to this problem wakida and lerner 2005 groundwater pollution with nitrate has consequences for human and environmental health generating infant methemoglobinemia and eutrophication of groundwater dependent surface waters johnson and kross 1990 bouchard et al 1992 bruning fann and kaneene 1993 nonetheless subsurface microbiota can attenuate the concentration of n pollutants triggering biological processes including the well known denitrification pathway and the recently detected anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process singleton et al 2007 moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2019 these observations highlight the role of aquifer bacteria and suggest their participation in the removal of contaminants dojka et al 1998 this important ecosystem service griebler and avramov 2014 needs to be investigated in more detail since it offers opportunities for decontamination of polluted aquifers the recent use of culture independent techniques in microbiological surveys has increased our knowledge about aquifer bacteria due to this it is known that several factors shape the microbial community structure including lithostratigraphy beyer et al 2015 spatial heterogeneity lima et al 2018 and disturbances such as pollution alfreider and vogt 2007 showing the relevance of the geochemical conditions in the diversity and activity of groundwater microorganisms yet just a few studies have observed the temporal variability of the microbial communities in shallow aquifers which are highly subjected to hydrochemical variations clay et al 1996 pauwels et al 2001 recently zelaya et al 2019 surveyed a non contaminated aquifer using a 16s rrna approach and observed that each well had a characteristic microbial community relatively stable over time and with a constant functional gene diversity in addition to the 16s rrna gene surveys analysing functional gene expression within natural microbial communities allows us to link the potential biogeochemical activity of microorganisms and to verify the transcription of relevant processes in the field avoiding laboratory incubation artefacts these studies consider in situ conditions such as stressors and nutrient concentrations at sub micromolar levels konopka and wilkins 2012 which constrain microbial activity and might be difficult to mimic in the laboratory especially for processes that depend on subsurface gases such as h2 ch4 and n2o for example transcript analyses have been used to detect thiobacillus denitrificans related organisms heterotrophic denitrification in a microbial consortium enriched from an oligotrophic limestone aquifer kumar et al 2018 suggesting its application in groundwater studies nitrate concentration in shallow aquifers is influenced by seasonal cycles clay et al 1996 pauwels et al 2001 mainly due to its high solubility and mobility yet there is little information regarding the temporal variability of the microbial communities in shallow aquifers and the variations in the number of bacteria capable of transforming inorganic n forms no3 no2 and nh4 into n2 microbial processes such as nitrous oxide reduction last step of denitrification anammox and nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo are known to transform dissolved n forms into inert and non polluting molecular nitrogen n2 bruning fann and kaneene 1993 shi et al 2013 fig 1 the occurrence of denitrifying and anammox bacteria has been demonstrated in several aquifers moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 while n damo has been mainly observed in unconfined aquifer soils and wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 yet these three processes might be occurring simultaneously in some aquifers showing that the bacterial community has functional diversity for in situ n attenuation in this study we surveyed the microbial community of a shallow aquifer within an agricultural area during a year sampling at six different months and we quantified the number of gene copies dna gene potential and transcripts rna cdna transcription related to n transforming processes during the dry and rainy seasons the bioattenuation pathways studied here were i the last step of denitrification i e nitrous oxide reduction quantifying the nosz gene ii anammox hzo gene and iii nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation or n damo using the pmoa and nod genes fig 1 in addition hydrochemical parameters were also determined and related to the results of the bacterial community structure 2 material and methods 2 1 site description in the mezquital valley central mexico 20 07 n 99 14 w 1700 2100 m above the sea level we instrumented a critical zone observatory www czen org within a managed ecosystem in which fodder and maize crops are cultivated using wastewater for irrigation for over the last 100 years this area represents the largest and oldest agricultural area that uses wastewater for irrigation in mexico and also the largest unmanaged aquifer recharge scheme in the world hernández espriú et al 2017 there are three main aquifer horizons in the mezquital valley bgs and conagua 1998 though different conceptualizations have been also mentioned depending of the studied area hernández espriú et al 2017 firstly there is a deep aquifer located in cretaceous limestones followed by a second unit in tertiary lava pyroclastic deposits and finally a shallow unconfined aquifer in alluvial and lacustrine deposits this shallow aquifer is at a variable depth depending on the location jiménez and chávez 2004 lesser carrillo et al 2011 hernández martínez et al 2014 and is highly susceptible to biological and chemical contaminants derived from wastewater infiltration del arenal 1985 jiménez and chávez 2004 the aquifer recharge is mainly by wastewater infiltrations all year through with additional rainwater infiltrations during the rainy season june to september del arenal 1985 the recharge rate due to wastewater irrigation has been calculated at 25 m3 s which corresponds to 13 3 times the natural recharge jimenez et al 2000 the valley is located in a semi arid region with an average annual temperature of 16 18 c and a mean annual precipitation of 450 mm mainly limited to four months from june to september rainy season www inegi com jiménez and chávez 2004 with a mean annual evapotranspiration rate of 1800 mm siebe et al 2016 the area has undergone a radical land use transformation from a native xerophytic shrubland into an intensively managed agricultural system cropped with maize bean oat fodder and lucerne crops among others romero álvarez 1997 sánchez gonzález et al 2012 lüneberg et al 2018 these plots are managed under different regimes such as rain fed irrigation with well water and more commonly with wastewater this agricultural area receives n inputs of more than 700 kg ha per year through irrigation with wastewater siebe 1998 for this study a piedmont formed out of volcaniclastic tuff layers was selected to survey the microbial diversity of the shallow aquifer and the bacterial groups potentially involved in n transformation fig 2 this shallow aquifer is mainly formed by wastewater irrigation returns and wastewater infiltrations from the distribution canals bgs and conagua 1998 the piedmont is delimited at the top by an unlined wastewater distribution canal canal located at 2093 m a s l this canal distributes wastewater into the plots which are irrigated by overflow with 16 22 mm at least once a month it has been estimated that approximately 20 of the water moves by subsurface flow into the unsaturated zone hernández martínez et al 2014 and between 7 and 10 of the added n leaches as no3 beyond the root zone hernández martínez et al 2018 nitrate concentration in this aquifer ranges between 17 and 23 mg l no3 n hernández martínez et al 2018 the dominant soil types in the piedmont are haplic and vertic phaeozems 0 4 1 5 m depth hernández martínez 2017 which are delimited at the bottom by a dense and compact volcanic tuff locally known as tepetate this tepetate has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the soil and contributes to the formation of lateral flows during irrigation events the intermediate vadose zone is formed by pseudostratified volcanic materials with variable hydraulic conductivity mainly composed of lahars and pyroclasts with low organic matter content carbonates in this zone can represent up to 25 caco3 displaying thus a slightly alkaline nature hernández martínez 2017 finally the saturated zone is a mix of alluvial and volcanic deposits where its limits vary according to the piedmont site lithologic descriptions suggest a low content of caco3 in the saturated zone 0 2 and the presence of reduced precipitated minerals in the lower stratum hernández martínez 2017 the groundwater samples here studied were obtained from a local domestic driven well well at 10 m depth 1 5 m ø rock wall and from a deep piezometer piezometer installed at 24 m depth and equipped with hydraulic pvc 4 ø a silica gravel filter and a bentonite seal fig 2 previous studies suggest that these sampling sites can be used for monitoring groundwater pollutants hernández martínez et al 2014 the static level water in the piezometer was 12 13 m below ground level and 6 7 m in the well being slightly lower during the dry season thus the water column in the well site was about 3 4 m tall and 11 12 m in the piezometer monitoring during the last years suggests that the rainwater infiltration slightly increases the level of the water column during the rainy season yet the concentration of nitrate seems relatively stable through the year but further studies must be done to clarify this issue samplings between 2012 and 2015 finally this aquifer discharges in a local spring named cerro colorado spring at 2055 m a s l del arenal 1985 hernández martínez et al 2014 which was also included for this study this spring appeared as the result of substantial inflows such as wastewater irrigation returns inputs from a local dam requena dam and infiltrations from the salado river del arenal 1985 with a discharge rate of 600 l s bsg and conagua 1998 2 2 water sampling and physicochemical characterization the sampling was carried out in 2017 february may august october and november and 2018 january the samples included the wastewater used for irrigation canal and the groundwater from the piezometer the local well and the spring fig 2 the canal and spring were directly sampled using 500 ml sterile polyethylene containers while the piezometer and the well were sampled using a stainless steel discrete groundwater sampler discrete interval sampler model 425 1 66 ø solinst before sampling the piezometer was purged by removing the stagnant water using a pvc bailer and left to recover for 10 min the well was also purged before sampling using an electric pump this methodology has been proved to be proper for both sites hernández martínez 2017 for the spring samples were collected at 50 cm from the point of discharge once collected the samples for biological analyses were transferred into 500 ml sterile polyethylene containers all the samples were collected the same day during light day 10 00 16 00 h the physicochemical characteristics were determined in situ with a multiparameter probe hi 9828 hanna instruments including ph temperature oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do and electric conductivity ec to quantify the dissolved inorganic nitrogen forms nh4 no3 and no2 samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane in situ millipore usa and stored at 4 c for one week

n forms other major ions such as na k ca 2 mg 2 cl po4 3 and so4 2 were determined by ion chromatography the water samples for microbial analyses were kept at 4 c during transport filtered in the laboratory through 0 22 μm durapore membranes millipore ireland 400 ml for dna and 800 ml for rna and the filter membranes were stored in sterile eppendorf tubes until dna rna extraction 20 c for dna and 80 c for rna the wastewater samples which contained high concentrations of suspended solids were placed in 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min and the obtained pellet resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer 100 mmol l tris hcl 20 mmol l nacl 100 mmol l edta ph 8 for dna extraction 2 3 nucleic acid extraction and cdna synthesis metagenomic dna mgdna was extracted from the filter membranes using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen according to the instructions of the manufacturer 1 3 days after the sampling and filtration processes the same kit was also employed for the wastewater samples but instead of membranes the resuspended pellets were used for total rna isolation from the piezometer samples the rneasy powerwater kit qiagen was used following the manufacturer s protocol the obtained rna was further treated with dnase rq1 rnase free dnase promega to remove residual dna and then purified with the rneasy mini kit qiagen every rna sample was tested by pcr to ensure that they were dna free using 2 μl of the eluted material and primers targeting rpob table 1 finally the rna molecules were reverse transcribed to cdna using the goscript reverse transcription mix promega with the protocol recommended by the manufacturer both mgdna and cdna were quantified with a qubit dsdna hs assay kit thermofisher scientific in a qubit 4 fluorometer thermofisher scientific and stored at 20 c until analysis the same process was used for a wastewater sample collected in the dry season employed to verify the transcriptional activity of brocadiales

wallis analyses were performed to assess differences among the physicochemical conditions between the sites while mann whitney s tests were used for paired comparisons these statistical analyses were done with the program graphpad prism 6 graphpad software la jolla california usa finally to relate the effect of the physicochemical characteristics of each site with the microbial community structure canonical correspondence analyses cca were done with the function cca in vegan package based on legendre and legendre 2012 algorithm then we used the envfit function vegan to obtain the correlation for each variable and select those with p 05 permutations 999 which were included in the figures shown these analyses were done in the r statistical environment v 3 6 0 3 results 3 1 physicochemical environment the measured physicochemical characteristics were within the often reported parameters for wastewater and groundwater the canal is an open distribution channel where the wastewater temperature is slightly higher and more variable 20 9 1 8 c than in groundwater 19 1 0 c fig 3 possibly due to solar radiation seasonal changes air currents and day night cycles the ph values in the wastewater and in all groundwater samples was circumneutral 7 2 and with slight variations the electrical conductivity of wastewater 1419 μs cm was found to be slightly saline for agricultural irrigation according to the mexican environmental agreement ce cca 001 89 where the maximum limit recommended is 1000 μs cm yet differences between the temperature ph and ce values were not significant among the sampling sites the oxidation reduction potential orp of the wastewater had negative values 88 mv indicating a reducing environment wastewater often contains a high proportion of organic carbon fig 2 that increases o2 consumption by heterotrophs this demand decreases the concentration of dissolved o2 do until exhaustion and as a result oxygen is found below the detection levels in wastewater fig 3 these two characteristics orp and do were significantly different between the wastewater canal and the groundwater samples piezometer well and spring in contrast the groundwater samples had average values of 145 166 mv of orp with 2 77 4 22 mg l of do where inorganic carbon is essential for autotrophic metabolisms fig 2 the inorganic n forms that are also associated with anammox n damo and denitrification were also quantified nitrate was found in all the groundwater samples well piezometer and spring with mean values ranging from 17 7 to 22 5 mg l no3 n while small amounts were found in the wastewater fig 3 in contrast dissolved nh4 was the main n form in the canal 27 7 mg l nh4 n but in groundwater it was only possible to detect it occasionally with a handheld colorimeter 0 016 0 031 mg l nh4 n the concentration of both n species no3 n and nh4 n was also significantly different between the wastewater and the groundwater similar to the do and orp values nitrite was only detected in the groundwater samples especially in the piezometer 0 04 0 01 μg l no2 n and at times in the well and spring thus nitrite concentration showed significant differences between the piezometer with the well and canal 3 2 16s rrna analysis the bacterial and archaeal communities in the wastewater and groundwater were surveyed with the hypervariable region v4 of the 16s rrna gene following an ngs approach the diversity and rarefaction analyses showed that the wastewater contained the lowest number of observed asvs 199 in average while the well had the highest 831 table 2 similarly the shannon index showed a relationship with these results where all the values were near or above four in the groundwater samples therefore the wastewater used for irrigation has a low bacterial and archaeal diversity while groundwater has a higher one the 16s rrna gene survey also showed that the main bacterial archaeal community structure was different at each site i e at the canal piezometer well and spring and it can be noticed from the recharge to the discharge zone of the piedmont fig 4a the wastewater canal had the phylum proteobacteria as the most abundant in all the sampled months 70 with a lower proportion of bacteroidetes firmicutes and fusobacteria the piezometer had a predominance of proteobacteria nevertheless groups such as bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria exhibited 16s rrna abundances from 2 to 50 which increased in october 30 and november 50 the well showed a similar 16s rrna based community throughout the sampling times where proteobacteria 30 40 was the main phylum followed by firmicutes op3 actinobacteria and nitrospira in contrast in the spring photosynthetic oxygenic cyanobacteria and microalgae chloroplasts were the main microorganisms 34 78 a deeper analysis at order level showed that there is a co occurrence of the orders brocadiales and methylomirabiales in the piezometer and well associated with the anammox and n damo pathways respectively fig 4a the similarities among the canal piezometer well and spring samples were further studied with a canonical correspondence analysis cca displaying the correlations between the microbial community structure and the hydrochemical characteristics at each site fig 4b this analysis indicated that the samples were clustered by site regardless of the month of collection however in open systems such as the canal and the spring which are prone to temporal variations by temperature changes and the entrance of rainwater the samples collected in january and august were slightly separated from the other ones yet the subsurface water samples piezometer and well did not show changes along the year and had a relatively stable composition over time in addition the piezometer and well had a similar but not identical microbial community structure the canal samples were mainly associated with the presence of nh4 and po4 3 in contrast the groundwater samples piezometer and well were defined by cations such as ca2 and mg2 and in broader view by the amount of do and nitrate additionally the spring was associated with the concentration of so4 2 we also tested the correlation of the environmental characteristics with the microbial community fitting the physicochemical variables into the ordination space as vectors the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium were the variables which mostly contributed to the structure of the microbial community p 001 followed by the amount of dissolved oxygen and sulphates also with p 001 but with lower r2 values fig 4b the taxonomic 16s rrna gene affiliation also suggested the presence of groups involved in the transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ammonia and nitrite oxidizers nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrospira and nitrospina were found in the groundwater mainly in the piezometer and the well at a relative abundance of 0 73 and 0 55 respectively fig 5a anammox and n damo bacteria including candidatus brocadia candidatus scalindua and candidatus methylomirabilis were also encountered in groundwater piezometer 0 3 3 6 well 1 7 4 9 fig 5b but at a higher relative abundance than nitrifiers finally potential denitrifying bacteria were also detected such as hydrogenophaga thauera and pseudomonas fig 5c a multivariate analysis was also done to correlate the physicochemical water characteristics with the shifts in the community composition of these n cycle microorganisms fig 5d the canonical correspondence analysis cca analysis showed that the higher relative abundance of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers was correlated with orp do values and no3 concentration suggesting that the presence of nitrifiers was favoured by positive orps and the presence of its final metabolic product anammox bacteria such as c brocadia were related to orp values and no3 concentration while c scalindua with the concentration of no2 c methylomirabilis n damo was also correlated with opr and no3 concentration these results suggest that the presence of nitrifying anammox and n damo bacteria is favoured in groundwater sites that contain no3 and no2 besides the orp do conditions which allow them to co exist while potential denitrifiers are found in both wastewater and groundwater 3 3 nosz hzo nod and pmoa gene analyses the genetic potential for nitrous oxide reduction anammox and n damo was determined by quantifying the number of nosz hzo nod and pmoa gene copies at two sampling times i the dry and ii the rainy seasons fig 6 to validate the assay a constitutive control was also measured i e the gene encoding for the β subunit of the rna polymerase rpob deslippe et al 2014 the qpcr analyses confirmed the presence of rpob nosz hzo nod and pmoa genes at all the sites in both seasons especially in the groundwater samples the number of gene copies was higher in the dry season may than in the rainy season august this might be possibly due to rainwater which dilutes the wastewater or infiltrates into the shallow aquifer the wastewater canal contained the highest number of gene copies per unit of volume among the sampled sites showing that the bacterial density in the wastewater is higher than in the shallow groundwater as expected regarding the genetic potential for anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction in the groundwater samples the number of nosz copies was 0 01 4 5 109 copies l nod 1 1 133 105 copies l hzo 1 4 39 104 copies l and pmoa 0 709 168 104 copies l in a trend where nosz nod pmoa hzo fig 6 the high amount of nosz copies at all sites might be due to its wide distribution in several bacterial groups and its repeated presence in some genomes jones et al 2008 while rpob is known to be only in one copy per genome dahllöf et al 2000 this can be confirmed with the nosz rpob ratio showing values 1 table 3 however despite finding a higher number of gene copies during the dry season the gene rpob ratio showed a higher proportion of hzo nod pmoa and nosz genes within the community during the rainy season being these ratios higher in the surface systems i e canal and spring than in the below ground sites i e piezometer and well unfortunately there is not clear evidence of a measured physicochemical property contributing to this shift and we can only observe that the temperature was slightly lower in the rainy season 1 5 c and with a slightly reduced concentration of no3 n 2 0 mg l no3 n thus further studies must be done to clarify the increase of the potential anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reducing communities during the rainy season it is worth noting that the hzo nod and pmoa genes were also detected in the wastewater samples 6 106 to 1 8 108 gene copies l fig 6 but the 16s rrna sequences belonging to the brocadiales and methylomirabiales were not found fig 4 section 3 2 to verify the presence of anammox and n damo bacteria we quantified the wastewater transcripts during the dry season which is the one with the highest number of gene copies we found that the nod transcripts were present 1 4 104 transcripts l while hzo and pmoa were below the detection level these results agree with the fact that hzo and nod genes are often found in sludges from wastewater treatment plants and consequently both can be present in wastewater samples yet the physicochemical conditions in the distribution canal might not be favourable for the activity of brocadiales hzo and methylomirabiales pmoa bacteria as suggested by the low abundance of their 16s rrna sequences which were not detected with the methodology employed here thus the transcribed nod genes might belong to unknown nor related genes zu et al 2017 such as those from bacteroidetes which represented 6 to 18 of the wastewater 16s rrna relative abundance fig 4 the number of transcripts associated with anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction was determined in the piezometer samples using cdna synthetized from the total rna extracted in both seasons fig 7a the number of transcripts quantified in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season following a similar trend as the gene copies possibly due to dilution by rainwater another difference was that the nod gene was the one with the highest number of transcripts 1 23 88 7 104 copies l followed by pmoa 0 89 7 33 104 copies l hzo 2 54 33 7 103 copies l and nosz 2 46 50 5 103 copies l then the number of transcripts followed the order nod pmoa hzo nosz the nod rpob ratio of the transcripts suggests that nod is the most actively transcribed and that it is the only gene that shows differences in the ratio of transcripts compared to the control rpob dry 0 57 rainy 0 81 increasing its transcription during the rainy season for the other genes hzo nosz and pmoa the ratio did not show differences among seasons being hzo and nosz those with the lowest number of transcripts in the piezometer in addition the cdna dna ratio was also determined and showed that nod and pmoa n damo pathway had the highest number of transcripts in relationship with the genetic potential encoded in the genome this ratio was similar to the constitutive control rpob confirming a high transcriptional activity of the nod and pmoa genes finally the lowest proportion of transcripts and gene copies was related to the nitrous oxide reduction process nosz rainy 0 0002 dry 0 0011 showing a high genetic potential but a low number of transcripts finally to verify the identity of the actively transcribing bacteria in the piezometer the amplified hzo pmoa nod and nosz gene fragments were sequenced the hzo sequences were grouped in only one phylotype and related to candidatus brocadia fulgida with 91 identity fig 7b previously reported in an aquifer system kumar et al 2017 the pmoa sequences were related to c methylomirabilis oxyfera and c methylomirabilis sinica and to other environmental phylotypes 90 98 identity most of the nod sequences were clustered within a unique group mezquital cluster and related to those sequences belonging to c methylomirabilis oxyfera 78 91 identity and others detected in btex contaminated aquifers zhu et al 2017 while the nosz fragments were affiliated to beta and gammaproteobacteria of known autotrophic denitrifiers such as thauera 93 identity which has been also found in the sediments of a shallow aquifer in the hetao basin inner mongolia li et al 2014 4 discussion our results showed a highly diverse microbial community in the studied shallow aquifer based on the 16s rrna gene analysis where nitrate concentration is above the limit of the mexican norm for drinking water 10 mg l no3 n the comparison of the groundwater microbial communities here surveyed with those reported showed that they had similar shannon index values h table 2 this was especially true for the canal piezometer and spring while the well presented a slightly higher h value furthermore it was also found that the bacterial and archaeal composition was distinctive at each site despite of the sampled month season and there was a co occurrence of microorganisms capable of transforming dissolved inorganic nitrogen by anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction the bacterial community structure at the below ground sites was relatively stable at the surveyed moments while those from the surface water bodies canal and spring showed slight variations mainly during the rainy season these results are similar to those of zelaya et al 2019 where each surveyed well had a distinctive microbial community considering a sampling frequency of twice a week for three months the differences among the below ground sites can be also related to their intrinsic characteristics especially considering the environment of the well and the piezometer for example the sampled well represents a typical local well permanent open and with a wide diameter that allows the rapid interchange with the atmosphere together with a water column of 3 4 m in comparison the deep piezometer has a narrower entrance and a water column of approximately 11 12 m despite there are no significant differences in parameters such as do and orp among both sites fig 3 the almost constant presence of detectable no2 in the piezometer suggests the occurrence of microoxic layers that are probably mixed during the recovery process after purging and that are collected during sampling consequently the microbial community within the piezometer shows a higher number of gene copies related to anammox n damo and denitrification than the well these slight differences in the aquifer microbiota can be observed in fig 4b further the subsurface environment of the well and piezometer differs due to hydrologic and geochemical dynamics at each site which are also related to their position in the piedmont this can be observed in the water level of the piezometer 12 13 m below ground and the well 6 7 m according to their altitude fig 2 also the lithology of each site might contribute to a differentiated presence of electron donors such as particulate organic c pyrite or non pyrite ferrous iron that can be coupled in different microbial metabolisms böhlke et al 2002 stenger et al 2018 however further studies must be done to clarify the changes in the groundwater environment along the flowpath the groundwater community structure and the occurrence of nitrifying anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reducing bacteria were associated with the concentration of no2 no3 and orp do values figs 4 and 5 nitrate was the most abundant dissolved inorganic n form in the piezometer and well where oxic conditions prevail orp 145 mv and 3 mg l of do yet nh4 and no2 were also detected in small amounts these low concentrations of nh4 and no2 suggest that the physicochemical conditions might not be favourable for their presence i e nh4 is the main dissolved inorganic n form in suboxic groundwater böhlke et al 2006 and no2 is uncommon under oxic conditions yet it might be possible that these substrates are also subjected to high turnover due to their active consumption and substrate competition through nitrification n damo anammox and denitrification or other processes such as assimilation studies in reactors and groundwater samples have observed that nitrate reduction and anammox processes are carried out despite low concentration of nh4 and no2 postma et al 1991 connan et al 2016 the orp do conditions measured in the mezquital valley groundwater would seem unsuitable for optimal anammox and n damo processes nonetheless anammox activity has been confirmed in reactors with orp values from 107 to 375 mv gao et al 2014 while groundwater samples dominated by c brocadia fulgida up to 10 6 can register 3 mg l oxygen kumar et al 2017 the orp do conditions here observed may allow the presence of other bacterial archaeal metabolisms that can be coupled in interrelated biogeochemical pathways for example nitrifiers are known to grow under a wide do range park et al 2010 and under the proper conditions they can be interconnected with anammox n damo and denitrifying bacteria in the aquifer system fig 8 high metabolic couplings have been observed in an aquifer adjacent to the colorado river anantharaman et al 2016 thus possibly under the physicochemical conditions of the shallow aquifer of the mezquital valley taxonomically and metabolically diverse bacteria and archaea can thrive in the saturated zone transforming several substrates and contaminants especially those derived from n pollution showing thus functional diversity previous reports have shown the presence of microorganisms that are able to transform n compounds in aquifers by either denitrification anammox or n damo moore et al 2011 smith et al 2015 kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however here we show that the mezquital valley aquifer has the genetic potential for the three processes the quantification assays of the hzo nod pmoa and nosz genes in the mgdna and cdna confirmed the genetic potential and or transcription in groundwater samples for anammox n damo and nitrous oxide reduction mainly in the piezometer our results suggest that the gene density as number of copies per litre was higher in the dry season while the gene rpob ratio indicates that the n transforming bacterial communities might be enriched during the rainy season yet this relationship could not be clarified with the data here obtained and further studies are necessary to address this issue the number of hzo gene copies here found was similar to those reported in oceanic oxygen minimum zones hzo 104 copies l kong et al 2013 and in a carbonate rock aquifer hzsa 105 copies l kumar et al 2017 though there are other studies reporting hzo and nosz gene copies in the aquifer environments smith et al 2015 hernández del amo et al 2018 comparisons are difficult due to the ratios employed which are based on 16s rrna gene counts it is tempting to conclude that the n damo activity is higher than nitrous oxide reduction and anammox based on the number of transcripts in the piezometer nod pmoa nosz hzo as some studies have shown a correlation among functional gene expression and activity bælum et al 2008 however it is not very reliable to relate nod pmmo hzo and nos activities with the number of transcripts nitrogen removal efficiencies have been related to hzo gene concentrations dna copies in anammox reactors but no correlation has been observed with the number of mrna molecules wang et al 2016 in addition genes used to survey anammox nir hzs and hzo have shown differences in several orders of magnitude in dna and cdna quantifications wang et al 2016 these differences might be due to the presence of more than one copy encoded in the genome of anammox bacteria and their transcription patterns consequently isotopic experiments encompassed with transcriptional activity assays are needed to know the relevance of n cycle processes in the mezquital valley aquifer and their transcriptional patterns furthermore groundwater microorganisms can migrate within the aquifer and consequently their co location can be a limiting factor establishing their activity at a precise spatial location 5 conclusions this study reflects the first genetic survey of the mezquital valley aquifer that may help orient future research in n polluted shallow aquifers though several approaches have suggested the biogeochemical transformations in these underground systems studying the microbial diversity by the 16s rrna and their functional gene abundances together with their transcription in the subsurface increases the understanding of this underground biosphere yet further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationships between the microbial community and the environmental and geochemical conditions in these complex environments including other shallow aquifers to contrast different geological settings and pollution levels especially when addressing temporal shifts and their possible causes our results show that c brocadia spp c methylomirabilis spp and autotrophic denitrifying betaproteobacteria coexist in the groundwater environment with the potential to attenuate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen nh4 no3 no2 and greenhouse gasses such as ch4 and n2o delivering thus an important ecosystem service to remove contaminants the biosphere and specially the microorganisms in the critical zone are active agents that influence groundwater quality and transform organic and inorganic compounds including pollutants
