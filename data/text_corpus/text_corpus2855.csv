14275,in this study the biological characteristics of a microorganisms immobilization media composed of polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyethylene glycol peg were investigated scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx live dead cell analysis respiration rate measurement and microbial mass analysis confirmed greater biomass compared to the conventional biological treatment process the mlvss curve revealed 2 128 mg l and 4 626 mg l immobilized nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms respectively the specific nitrification rate was at 0 0024 mg nh4 n mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss hr the specific denitrification rate was at 0 0052 mg no3 n mg mlvss hr thus the nitrification and denitrification rates were higher when using the microorganisms immobilization media compared to the conventional methods based on the results related to cn which is one of the famous toxic materials the microorganisms immobilization media was twice stronger than that of the activated sludge generated via the a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic process keywords microorganisms immobilization media nitrification denitrification toxicity 1 introduction wastewater treatment is mainly done using the activated sludge method according to the water quality standard of the discharged water 1 recent examinations intended to identify a stable treatment process have included the membrane bio reactor mbr sharon anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and aerobic granule processes the mbr method has been applied to various sewage treatment facilities since 2010 as a method to maintain the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of bioreactor at a high concentration 2 3 however there are many problems with this approach such as the difficulty in operating due to membrane fouling 4 6 and the high maintenance cost 7 8 the sharon 10 and anammox process 9 consume less energy by shortening the nitrification step these processes have been studied continuously since the 2000s they are still challenged by the difficulties in culturing and propagating bacteria in the anammox environment 11 12 recently the aerobic granule process has been actively researched because it can be applied to sewage and also to high concentration wastewater by maintaining high concentration mlvss using a gel composed of microbial communities 13 however granule production is difficult and it is impossible to recover disassembled granules by empty load inflow of toxic substances or other means the microorganisms immobilization media method has been studied as an alternative way to maintain the microorganisms in a reactor at a high concentration 14 15 the method has been used in countries such as japan and europe for various purposes such as treatment side stream and recycle water load reduction processes 16 the microorganism immobilization method can shorten the residence time in the reactor an additional advantage is the minimal change in microbial activity compared to the conventional treatment method due to sudden changes in the influent load or operating conditions or a buffering effect on the inflow of toxic substances 17 18 this advantage ensures the stability of the bioreactor when various toxic chemicals in the water inflow the treatment facility 41 42 in this study to analyze the biological characteristics of the microorganisms immobilization media we assessed the immobilization of microorganisms in media and compared the reliability of the measurements made through the mlvss and bicinchoninic acid bca methods in addition the specific nitrification rate snr and denitrification rate sdnr derived from nitrification and denitrification rate experiments on the microorganisms immobilization media and the existing process were compared finally the cn toxicity of the microorganisms immobilization media was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 production of microorganisms immobilization media the microorganisms immobilization media was manufactured by a crosslinking method by mixing 20 of polyvinyl alcohol pva polymerization degree 2 000 and 15 polyethylene glycol peg and adding 10 v v of activated sludge mlvss 56 000 mg l the crosslinking agent used was saturated boric acid and 2 cacl2 and kh2po4 0 5 m were used to strengthen the media media production method is presented in detail in the previous study 40 after all the manufacture process was completed the media was washed with water and activated using lb broth and synthetic wastewater the composition of the nitrification synthetic wastewater follows c6h12o6 150 mg l nh4cl 50 mg l kh2po4 4 mg l nahco3 450 mg l n s 1 ml 1 l and denitrification synthetic wastewater c6h12o6 300 mg l kno3 50 mg l kh2po4 4 mg l n s 1 ml 1 l n s was used as a nutrient solution for the growth of microorganisms s previously proposed 19 2 2 analysis of immobilization of microorganisms scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx were used to indirectly identify microorganisms in the media in addition the viability of immobilized microorganisms was analyzed using flow cytometry live dead cell staining the zero base control was the media used for direct production nitrification and denitrification media were compared for 10 days after activation using a de axio imager a1 fluorescence microscope carl zeiss with syto 9 and propidium iodide used as fluorescent dyes 2 3 analysis of the amount of microorganisms since the performance or efficiency of the microorganisms immobilization media varies depending on the amount of microorganisms in the media enumeration of the microorganisms is crucial microorganisms were counted through protein analysis together with analysis of mlvss expressed by microorganisms in the bioreactor since proteins in microorganisms generally account for 60 of the biomass 20 21 the amount of proteins is indicative of the amount of microorganisms for this purpose we used the bca method for counting microorganisms sigma aldrich usa as previously described 22 the assay utilizes the ability of proteins to reduce copper ions cu2 cu1 according to previous studies the content of proteins in microorganisms varies between 40 70 21 the microorganisms in the immobilization media used for this study originated from activated sludge and had a diverse composition considering this complexity two types of calibration curves were prepared one was based on absorbance of various protein concentrations the other was an mlvss curve based on the bca assay 2 4 nitrification denitrification rate determinations the rates of nitrification and denitrification of the immobilized microorganisms were compared with those obtained using the conventional floating growth method using synthetic wastewater the experiment was carried out in a batch mode using a 5 l acrylic reactor the filling rate of the microorganisms immobilization media was 20 v v the initial nh4 n concentration in the nitrification reaction started at approximately 50 mg l and nh4 n alkalinity alk initial 450 mg l as caco3 and common chemical oxygen demand codcr values were measured at intervals of 1 h the initial concentration of no3 n in the denitrification was approximately 50 mg l and no3 n and codcr initial 300 mg l were measured at 1 h intervals the nitrification and denitrification rate experiments were carried out at room temperature approximately about 18 using synthetic wastewater 2 5 evaluation of tolerance to toxicity of immobilized microorganisms the effect of the microorganisms immobilization media prepared in this study on toxicity due to cn was examined the evaluation of toxicity was carried out by adding activated sludge mlvss 3 000 mg l and microorganisms immobilization media filling rate 20 to 500 ml flasks containing cyanide cn 2 5 mg l at a temperature of 20 2 nh4 n was measured at regular intervals toxicity in addition respirometry was performed to analyze the effect of microbial nitrifying activity of cn 3 results 3 1 evaluation of microorganisms immobilization and activation 3 1 1 sem and edx analyses sem was performed to confirm the presence of microorganisms and growth of the microorganisms immobilized in the media following the activation step pores formed in the media were retained even after the activation fig 1 a clusters of circular microorganisms presumed to be staphylococci were evident fig 1 c similar to those observed in a prior study 26 this is similar to nitrosospira as presented by koops 1992 43 and can be considered as the various types of nitrifying microorganisms shown in stanley w 44 a likely scenario was that the microorganisms formed a community inside the pores following activation and immobilization edx analysis was performed on the base point and the microorganisms expected point and the results are shown in table 1 carbon and sulfur were lower in the microorganisms expected point compared to base point however oxygen increased from 13 42 to 19 19 and nitrogen increased from 1 04 to 9 56 edx analysis should take this into account because it presents results based on qualitative analysis 3 1 2 analysis of viable and nonviable cells an analysis was carried out to assess whether the immobilization process for the microorganisms caused cell death and the growth of the immobilized microorganisms grow after validating in the results shown in fig 2 viable microorganisms appeared green and nonviable microorganisms appeared red the baseline survival rate of the microorganisms inside the microorganisms immobilization media immediately after production was approximately 60 the microorganisms in the media comprised 56 000 8 000 mg l based on mlvss with death occurring due to the high temperature and strong acid conditions during the production process however recovery was evident after nitrification and denitrification activation for 10 days microorganisms survival in the media was 99 fig 2 b and c 3 2 microorganisms quantity 3 2 1 mlvss analysis the results of the microorganisms immobilization media analysis corresponding to 1 ml are shown in fig 3 the microorganisms quantity was analyzed through mlvss in this analysis the pva media that does not immobilize microorganisms was used as the blank the blank value prior to activation was 2 930 mg l following activation the nitrification and denitrification values for the microorganisms immobilization media were 5 870 mg l and 3 730 mg l respectively therefore the mlvss after activation than before activation was confirmed that the denitrification media increased by about two times the nitrification media about 1 000 mg l the mlvss value of the denitrification media exceeded the mlvss value of the nitrification media the results were similar to the results in section 3 1 2 pronounced changes in mlvss were evident because the size of the media and the pore size inside the meddia were not constant especially the blank value displayed marked variation therefore it was difficult to accurately determine microorganisms through the mlvss measurement method thus a large number of samples should be selected to accurately quantify the amount of microorganisms using mlvss 3 2 2 protein analysis the results of the calibration curve using mlvss and protein were as follows 1 mlvss curve equation y 0 0004x 0 00174 r2 0 9971 2 protein curve equation y 0 0021x 0 1506 r2 0 9907 samples were taken from 1 ml aliquots of the microorganisms immobilization media recovered after more than 50 days in each reaction tank the absorbance value obtained in the first experiment was lower in the case of the media with immobilized nitrifying microorganisms that were re measured after culturing in lb broth for 24 h in the second measurement the absorbance value was approximately double that obtained prior to culturing these results indicate that the activation of the nitrification microorganisms immobilization media likely takes a long time and that the use of the microbial media is more effective the amount of microorganisms counted based on the absorbance method is depicted in fig 4 the protein curve revealed 793 mg l of immobilized nitrifying microorganisms and 1 764 mg l immobilized denitrifying microorganisms assuming that 60 of the microbial biomass was comprised of proteins the mlvss curve revealed 2 128 mg l and 4 626 mg l immobilized nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms respectively since the protein content varies depending on the type of microorganisms the microbial amount determined using mlvss was low therefore the snr and sdnr were calculated based on the microbial count obtained through the protein absorbance method absorbance mlvss curve 3 3 kinetics of microorganisms immobilization media 3 3 1 nitrification kinetics as shown in fig 5 the nitrification rate was 51 18 mg l which represented a decline of 0 51 mg l after 7 h compared to the initial nh4 n concentration of 51 99 mg l the rate of nitrification was 12 04 mg l h for the first hour and averaged at 6 57 mg l h thereafter with a linear decrease being evident a prior study 27 reported the nitrification rate of conventional activated sludge as 3 93 mg l h which was at least 1 5 times faster than the conventional biological process from 1 6 h the decrease was relatively constant based on the sum of nh4 n 7 9 mg l h and codcr 30 17 mg l h the mass transfer could be assumed to be 37 69 mg l h the snr was calculated as 0 0024 mg nh4 n mg mlvss h using 2 128 mg l since the snr of the general a2o process is 0 0013 to 0 0021 mg nh4 n mg mlvss h it can be confirmed that the snr is more than two times higher table 2 shows the comparison with other processes 3 3 2 denitrification kinetics the denitrification rate analysis results are shown in fig 5 the initial no3 n concentration was 104 2 mg l after 5 h the concentration was 1 4 mg l representing a removal of 102 8 mg l the denitrification rate of 23 85 mg l h was three times faster than the nitrification rate unlike the nitrification reaction the denitrification rate was constant with time the sdnr of the microorganisms immobilization media was 0 0052 mg no3 n mg mlvss hr which was calculated by applying 4 626 mg l table 3 summarizes the sdnr values of previous studies on actual wastewater the sdnr values presented in this study were the highest with the exception of one study 32 the united states environmental protection agency suggests a specific denitrification rate depending on the type of carbon source as shown in the following table 4 37 when the carbon source was methanol the highest specific denitrification rate was 0 0133 mg no3 n mg mlvss h glucose was used in this study therefore compared with the same temperature conditions the rate of microbial ingestion for methanol was faster than that of glucose another study 38 reported similar values to the present study 0 001 0 005 mg no3 n mg mlvss h for ethanol at 20 3 4 assessment of tolerance to toxicity nitrifying microorganisms are known sensitive to toxic substances present in wastewater with nitrosomonas being more sensitive than nitrobacter 23 cyanide cn is particularly toxic to nitrifying microorganisms and has been reported to have a greater effect at concentrations above 0 11 mg l 24 immobilized microorganisms are reportedly more resistant to toxicity than microorganisms grown in suspension or attached to a surface 25 the results of the evaluation of toxicity for activated sludge and microorganisms immobilization media are shown in fig 6 in the case of activated sludge reaction without cn yielded a total removal of 32 65 mg l for 7 h with total removal of 9 87 mg l in the presence of cn the inhibition of cn through nitrification was approximately 70 on the other hand in the case of a microorganisms immobilization media the reaction occurring in the absence of cn the initial 40 1 mg l was changed to 38 mg l after 7 h removal of 2 1 mg l however in the presence of cn the initial 38 6 mg l was reduced by 17 51 mg l to 21 09 mg l with an inhibition rate of approximately 45 5 the inhibition rate was 65 when compared with the control sludge these findings confirmed that the toxic resistance to cn was stronger than that of activated sludge when the microorganisms immobilization media was used the concentration of cn representing the ic50 of the noxious nitrification bacteria was reported to be 0 074 mg l 39 in this study the concentration of cyanide was 2 5 mg l thus the nitrification inhibition rate was below 50 at concentrations higher than the ic50 of the previous study therefore even if a toxic substance is introduced into a reaction tank to which a microorganisms immobilization media is applied resistance is expected to be excellent in addition to the toxicity assessment respiration rate measures were performed on the microorganisms immobilization media and activated sludge to evaluate the microbial activity with and without cn the inhibition rates of the microorganisms immobilization media and the activated sludge were calculated the amount of activated sludge decreased by 63 5 oxygen consumption 104 3 mgo2 l 38 1 mgo2 l after cn addition but decreased by 30 6 oxygen consumption 266 3 mgo2 l 184 7 mgo2 l for the microorganisms immobilization media confirming that the tolerance to toxicity was more than doubled 4 conclusion when applying the microorganisms immobilization media with respect to nitrogen removal various biological benefits could be identified microorganisms can be maintained at a higher concentration than that in the conventional biological treatment process when the microorganisms immobilization media is applied moreover snr and sdnr values using the microorganisms immobilization method were confirmed to be higher than those obtained in previous studies in addition a sufficient response time could be possible when toxic substances introduced into wastewater treatment plants because they have an excellent resistance to toxicity declaration of competing interest none

14276,a ternary photocatalyst cu doped 0 to 10 wt zno hybridized graphene nanocomposite gzcu was prepared by hydrothermal method a detailed analysis by xrd raman ftir and fesem showed a formation of zno nanorods with hexagonal wurtzite structure on graphene sheets optical band gap has been decreased from 3 12 ev for gzno undoped zno to 2 89 ev for gzcu subsequently intensity of pl emission and pl lifetime have also been decreased with increasing cu ion content in zno photocatalytic studies under uv and sunlight irradiations were done on the photodegradation of organic dyes such as methyl orange mo the gzcu with 0 5 wt cu showed the highest photodegradation of mo the maximum mo degradation was 85 7 and 89 1 under uv and sunlight irradiation respectively for gzcu and this was 12 and 11 higher than the same shown by undoped gzno the enhanced degradation observed at lower cu doping 0 5 wt in zno was attributed to the optimum doping concentration which is responsible for reduced charge recombination increased pl lifetime and increased oh radical generation during the photocatalytic reaction photocatalytic experiments under different ph conditions showed that the photocatalyst could effectively degrade cationic dye in basic medium because under basic conditions the catalyst s surface become negatively charged whereby more adsorption of the cationic dye took place on its surface and resulted in enhanced degradation keywords cu doped zno graphene nanocomposite photocatalyst uv light irradiation organic dyes pl lifetime 1 introduction graphene based semiconductor materials have attracted much research interest because of their exciting and unique properties 1 2 graphene is a 2 d honeycomb shaped material with phenomenal electronic mechanical thermal and optical properties 3 theoretically it has been reported to have a high surface area 2630 m2 g 1 4 good thermal conductivity 5000 wm 1 k 1 5 better young s modulus 1 t pa 6 excellent charge carrier mobility 200 000 cm2v 1s 1 due to π conjugation structure 7 8 and good optical transparency 97 7 9 with a slight overlap of valence band with conduction band graphene is considered as a zero bandgap semiconductor 10 these properties have proved graphene as a potential candidate for applications in nanoelectronics 11 h2 production and storage 12 13 biosensors 14 li ion batteries 15 16 reinforced composite materials supercapacitors 17 solar cells 18 liquid crystal display 19 and photocatalysis 20 23 in order to solve the biggest challenge of energy and environmental issues semiconductor nanocomposites based on graphene have been largely used because the synergistic effect of the semiconductor and graphene can overcome their individual demerits chemical synthesis of graphene can pose a problem of graphene sheets restacking it becomes onerous to maintain its surface area to be large among various methods available decoration of graphene sheets with metals metal oxides nanoparticles has been used as a very interesting approach to approach this problem 24 25 due to unique electronic structures comprising completely filled valence band vb and an empty partially filled conduction band cb the semiconducting metal oxides can act as a photocatalyst when they interact with the radiation of higher energy than their band gap energy electrons are excited to the conduction band from valence band thereby creating a hole in the valence band these photogenerated electron hole pairs play a major role in further generating active species that would degrade the organic dyes however efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst is highly depending on the speed of recombination of the photo generated electrons from cb to vb and gets reduced if the recombination is fast presence of graphene component along with the semiconductor has proved to be beneficial in a number of ways like i improved charge separation of photogenerated charges thereby reducing their recombination ii increased surface area to provide support to photocatalysts preventing their aggregation and iii better absorption of the dye molecules through π π interaction of graphene with molecules 20 26 27 in addition to these when graphene based semiconductors are considered as photocatalysts the semiconductor acts as a photocatalyst whereas graphene helps to promote migration of the photogenerated electrons carriers to inhibit electron hole recombination 28 because of high surface area and electron conduction graphene can very efficiently transfer these electons therefore in this nanocomposite presence of each material helps each other to overcome their individual demerits i e graphene reduces the charge recombination in semiconductor whereas the semiconductor material solves the problem of restacking of graphene sheets thus creating a symbiotic situation variety of semiconductor metal oxides like tio2 21 zno 27 sno2 29 cu2o 25 etc have been made composite with graphene and studied for photocatalytic applications amongst all because of non toxicity strong oxidizing power easy synthesis and low cost zno has been very much used as photocatalyst graphene zno nanocomposites have been extensively studied to show an enhanced performance in various applications in comparison to pure zno despite vast research that had been reported two basic problems that limit these materials for a large scale industrial applications are their active responsive range that is narrow and restricted in the uv region this limits the use of entire solar spectrum and high rate of charge recombination 30 presence of graphene in the nanocomposite graphene zno has the ability up to certain extent to reduce impede the recombination of charges but still due to larger band gap the zno is mostly active in the uv region therefore many efforts such as non metal metal ion doping 31 33 noble metal loading 34 surface modification 35 heterojunction formation 36 38 etc have been made to increase the light absorption by extending the absorption range and increase the lifetime of the photoexcited electrons doping has been adopted as the most suitable method to preserve favorable properties of semiconductors as a photocatalyst and also endow them a visible light activity when the zno lattice is introduced with the dopant ions there expects intermediate energy levels i e allowed states generated within the forbidden bandgap thereby reducing the absorption energy compared to the band band transition of the semiconductor 20 39 40 copper out of various elements used for doping has been considered as a suitable dopant to achieve photo activity in zno under visible light irradiation 41 especially when ii vi semiconductor such as zno is used the element cu can act as luminescence activator and therefore it is also expected to modify optical electrical physical magnetic properties gas sensitivity and photocatalytic activity 42 since cu has similar chemical physical and electronic structure like zn cu can substitutionally enter the zno lattice use of copper as a doping element can lead to a development of low cost photocatalytic material 42 44 with improved optical properties thus high performance photocatalytic materials with low cost as well as active in the visible light region are always in high demand this paper presents the preparation of cu doped zno graphene nanocomposites by hydrothermal method with varied concentrations of cu in zno and their characterization further their photocatalytic performance has been investigated on the degradation of methyl orange dye and the complete results are reported 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of cu doped zno graphene photocatalyst graphite flakes zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o copper acetate monohydrate cuch3cooh h2o and sulfuric acid h2so4 from himedia chemicals india ammonia sodium hydroxide isopropanol and terepthalic acid from merck india potassium permanganate kmno4 and hydrogen peroxide from nice chemicals india sodium nitrate nano3 fischer scientific and sodium oxalate loba were used all of them were used as received and double distilled water was used prior to the preparation of graphene zno nanocomposite hummer s method was used and graphene oxide go was prepared 45 46 then by using hydrothermal method relatively at low temperature cu ion doped zno graphene gzcu was synthesized by first preparing two different solutions in the first solution solution a a 0 45 g of go was taken in water 50 ml and agitated using ultrasonication for 30 min then its ph value was raised from 2 to 4 by adding naoh simultaneously solution b was prepared separately in 50 ml of water by adding 0 15 m zinc nitrate hexahydrate then homogenously mixed for 15 min and later cuch3cooh h2o was added then by adding ammonium hydroxide ph value of solution b was raised to 11 in order to increase the conversion rate of zn oh 2 to obtain a precipitate later solution b was added to solution a the final graphene cu zno composites prepared with 0 5 1 3 5 8 and 10 wt of copper acetate were coded as gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively and gzcu is used for the common reference the combined solution was stirred for another 30 min to get homogeneity and then it was kept in a sealed hydrothermal reactor and heated at 90 c for 10 h in an oven once the reaction was finished the solution was centrifuged and dried at 70 c in vacuum later in order to remove the hydroxides it was tempered at 350 c as a control sample pure zno graphene nanocomposite was also prepared and this was the optimized sample from our previous work 47 studies on pristine zno and cu doped zno have also been reported by us in our earlier work and that results can be compared wherever required 48 2 2 characterization x ray diffraction ultima iv rigaku analysis was carried out on powder samples by using cu kα1 radiation raman spectra were acquired in a micro raman spectrometer in via renishaw microstructure was analyzed by tem microscope tecnai g2 f30stwin fei and sem microscope zeiss crossbeam 340 equipped with field emission source x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was done by recording xps spectra under ultrahigh vacuum in omicron esca by using al kα radiation to acquire the survey and high resolution scans 50 and 20 ev were the respective pass energies used shimadzu uv3600 plus the optical absorption spectrometer was used to acquire uv vis absorption spectra steady state photoluminescence measurements were done in a fluromax 4 horiba scientific spectrophotometer using xenon lamp time resolved photoluminescence trpl decay profiles were measured in a flurolog fl3 111 spectrofluorometer using emission and excitation wavelengths of 390 and 290 nm respectively intensity of the light used in photocatalytic experiment was measured by a digital lux meter lt luxtron lx 1102 2 3 photocatalytic activity experiment photodegradation of methyl orange mo in the presence of gzcu as photocatalysts under the uv light irradiation was studied to understand the photocatalytic strength of these photocatalysts initially 0 05 mm of mo was prepared in 100 ml water and homogeneously mixed overnight then 50 mg of gzcu was added and to attain adsorption desorption equilibrium it was stirred for 1 h in dark then the whole solution was irradiated separately under two different light sources 8w uv lamp and direct sun light every 30 min a 3 ml of the irradiated solution was collected and their uv vis absorption spectra were measured the normalized maximum absorbance a a 0 is proportional to the degraded concentration c c0 of the dye with irradiation time and the latter was obtained from the former 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis structural phase of the gzcu was analyzed through xrd see fig 1 for their xrd patterns and the obtained xrd peaks confirm the hexagonal wurtzite phase of zno and the bragg reflections observed at 2θ values of 31 7 34 4 36 2 47 5 56 6 62 7 67 7 and 68 9 are respectively attributed to the planes 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 and 112 of the wurtzite phase in comparison with the standard icdd data card 98 000 9340 when the alien cu ion is introduced into the lattice of zno up to 5 wt of doping the reflections corresponding to hexagonal zno phase alone were obtained with further increase in doping content additional peaks corresponding to a monoclinic phase of cuo icdd card no 98 005 998 are evolved the magnified image in fig 1 shows the presence of graphene and the secondary phase cuo it should be also noted that there is no sharp peak observed at 11 corresponding to 002 planes of graphene oxide go this implies that go has been completely reduced to graphene shown as zoomed in image in fig 1 during the process of synthesis although there is no noticeable peak shift observed a significant peak broadening orginating from the change in crystallite size is observed this is because the ionic radii of cu2 0 073 nm ion lies closer to that of zn2 0 074 nm ion when the doping concentration is lower than 5 wt cu ion substitutes the zn ions whereas increasing the dopant beyond 5 wt substitution of the dopant ion reaches its saturation limit and thereby the excess cu ions have formed the secondary phase which is apparently the monoclinic strucutred cuo that is the cu ion has solubility in zno lattice only up to 5 wt in this case therefore beyond 5 wt a mixed phase of zno and cuo is formed similar results for cu ion doping in zno were reported previously in the literature 49 51 3 2 raman analysis raman spectroscopy is the sensitive probe for providing information about disorder present in sp2 hybridized carbon materials and crystal structure of the samples 48 in particular for doped samples the raman analysis helps much to identify the possible secondary phases fig 2 presents the raman spectra of gzno and gzcu nanocomposites the raman spectra clearly show two peaks one is at 1592 cm 1 and the other one is at 1316 cm 1 they can be respectively attributed to the characteristic g and d bands of graphene the g band arising from the vibration of sp2 hybridized bonded carbon atom is a graphitic band whereas the d band attributed to the structural disorder mostly occurring at the edges of graphene sheets is the defect band 40 47 the ratio of integrated intensity of the d to g bands i e id ig is usually taken as a measure of sp2 domain size and degree of disorder in addition the ratio can also hint about the graphitic structures quality because this ratio approaches to zero for a highly pyrolitic graphite 27 therefore higher intensity ratio denotes more defects and disorder formed at the edges of carbon platelets the id ig ratio for the present nanocomposites is obtained to be 1 44 1 56 1 58 1 59 1 68 1 69 and 1 74 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively that are much greater than the same for graphene oxide i e 0 90 this higher id ig values imply a significant introduction of defect sites and degree of disorder in the graphene sheets and also gives a clear indication that go has been reduced to graphene 52 inset of the fig 2 presents the 2d band which is a fingerprint confirming the formation and the number of layers in graphene sheets 53 3 3 microstructure analysis by fesem the fesem micrographs in fig 3 present the morphological features of gzcu nanocomposites typically for two compositions of cu the gzcu nanocomposites exhibit a sheet like structure that corresponds to graphene sheets marked by arrows in fig 3 whereas the rod and particle like morphologies are corresponding to cu doped zno rods particles the latter is densely packed into the sheets of the former showing a formation of cu zno graphene nanocomposites 3 4 microstructure analysis by tem the microstructure of gzcu nanocomposite was further investigated through transmission electron microscopy fig 4 a and b present the typical bright field images of the nanocomposite which clearly show two well distinguished regions the one with the darker contrast is attributed to the cu doped zno nanorods whereas the lighter region surrounding it corresponds to the graphene sheets this contrast is related to the mass difference between graphene sheets and zno the latter has higher average atomic number and scatters more to appear dark whereas the reverse is true for graphene sheets interplanar spacing was calculated from the lattice fringes seen in the hrtem image fig 4c and was obtained to be 0 282 nm that very well resolves the 010 plane of hexagonal zno confirming the crystal phase of zno in addition the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 4d for the samples are also indexed with the corresponding crystal planes of zno with hexagonal wurtzite structure 3 5 xps analysis the chemical oxidation states of the elements present in gzcu were identified using xps analysis and the corresponding results for the gzcu0 5 are presented in fig 5 presence of three dominative elements c o and zn is seen from the survey spectrum in fig 5a the high resolution xps spectrum for the element zn in fig 5b shows a doublet at 1023 12 and 1046 36 ev that can be ascribed to zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p3 2 states respectively and the spin orbit energy split between them is 23 24 ev the peak positions and the difference in the binding energy between them correspond to the zn2 state in the sample 54 the high resolution spectrum for c1 s in fig 5c is further deconvoluted to obtain peaks at 284 86 ev from non oxygenated cc 286 09 ev c o and 288 82 oc o in a similar way the asymmetric o1s xps profile see fig 5d is deconvoluted and fitted with two symmetrical peaks one at 531 41 ev is attributed to the o2 ion in the zn o bond of wurtzite zno and the other one at 532 52 ev appeared as a shoulder peak is because of the surface adsorbed oh group and from c o and c o zn bonds 55 57 as found in the literature the cu 2p xps peak is found to contain two peaks with their maxima at 952 1 and 932 4 ev that are correlated respectively to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 states finding cu in this sample is not that easy as for other elements because of lower content of cu in this particular case 0 5 cu doped sample however the high resolution spectrum of cu element in fig 5e shows two small humps present at 933 ev and 951 ev that are being originated from cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 states respectively confirming the presence of cu in the nanocomposite it is to be noted that the noisy nature of xps of cu in fig 5e is due to the lower concentration of cu and also the raw data is presented 3 6 optical properties variation of band gap energy in gzno as an effect of cu doping was studied by uv vis absorption spectroscopy the corresponding absorption spectra for gzno and gzcu nanocomposites are compared in fig 6 a in the uv region a strong absorption is observed which is generally due to the electronic transitions from vb to cb o2p zn3d and referred to the characteristic band gap absorption of zno 58 this absorption is otherwise called as band edge absorption it is crucial to note that there is a red shift observed in the band edge absorption with respect to increasing cu content the band gap values of these samples were estimated from tauc plots fig s1 of the supplementary file and are obtained to be 3 12 3 04 3 02 2 89 2 92 3 00 and 2 94 ev for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively variation of the band gap energies may be connected to two primary reasons the first one is the size induced quantum confinement effect that depends on the size of the nanoparticles and the second one is the modification of the electronic structure the former effect is dependent on the size which when below the excitonic bohr radius influences a lot on the band gap the value of excitonic bohr radius for zno usually lies in the range from 0 9 to 2 4 nm as found in the literature which implies that the zno shows a high band gap tuning within this particle size range whereas in this work the particle size of zno is obtained to vary from 15 to 20 nm which is way away from the excitonic bohr radius of zno and therefore lowering of band gap in the present case cannot be directly attributed to size induced quantum confinement effect therefore the band gap decrease with cu doping content may be attributed to band edge bending induced by doping where because of the coupling of localized cu2 impurity spins with band electrons there occurs a strong shift in the valence and conduction bands 43 it is known when impurity atoms are doped the dopant atoms can introduce shallow levels within the forbidden band gap this is initiated through the s d or p d exchange interaction between host and dopant atoms with the substitution of zn2 by cu2 the cu ions provide electrons from its 3d shell so that the valence band o 2p of zno is shifted via hybridization of cu 3d shell thus resulting in a strong cu 3d o 2p interaction which narrows the bandgap 59 thus uniform substitution of cu ions in the zno lattice is confirmed by this red shift in the band gap 51 moreover additional pathways for electronic transition are made feasible via these new electronic states whereby the absorption edge is red shifted towards visible region 41 60 because of this introduction of new intermediate states the nanocomposites can now be excited by light energy lower than their real band gap energy thereby generating extra charge carriers which can enhance its photo conversion efficiency as well as photocatalytic efficiency the cb and vb potentials can be also determined from the classical formula presented in eq 1 and eq 2 below 61 1 e c b x e c 1 2 e g 2 e v b e c b e g where ecb is the conduction band edge at point zero charge phzpc evb is the valence band edge x is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor and is expressed as the geometric mean of the atomic electro affinity i e the arithmetic mean of the atomic electronic affinity and first ionization energy ec represents the energy of free electron on hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and eg is the band gap of the semiconductor applying the obtained band gap from tauc plot into the eq 1 the values of e vb and e cb for gzcu0 5 and gzcu1 are obtained to be 0 089 ev 2 9513 ev and 0 0387 ev 2 9013 ev respectively further luminescence characteristics and nature of electron transfer between zno and graphene sheets were studied through steady state pl spectra for gzcu obtained at the laser excitation of 325 nm and compared with gzno in fig 6b the pl emission maximum observed at 380 nm is connected either to near band edge nbe emission or free exciton emission 47 in addition the gzcu has shown a decreasing emission intensity compared to that of gzno since recombination of the excited electrons with holes in the valence band gives out the nbe emission decreasing intensity of this emission signifies the lowering of charge recombination already there has been a number of works in the literature reporting that in case of graphene zno nanocomposite introduction of graphene effectively impedes the recombination of the photoelectrons thereby quenches the fluorescence 62 63 because zno being a good donor of electrons and comparatively graphene being a good acceptor an efficient charge transfer at their zno and graphene interface would reduce the charge recombination this present study investigates in addition to the graphene zno nanocomposite the effect of cu ion that is doped into zno doping of copper ion introduces new intermediate states within the forbidden band gap this was also concluded from the uv results discussed above providing additional pathways for the transfer of electrons from cb of zno decrease in the nbe emission would have also resulted from the non radiative centers that are formed in the samples with cu doping therefore transfer of electrons into the intermediate states reduces the recombination process whereby more electrons and holes are available to form radical species in the case of photocatalysis that assists to enhance their photocatalytic activity also cu ion introduction into the zno graphene system has affected the charge transfer in the host system and the variation was explored by conducting the trpl pl measurements fig 7 compares the pl lifetime decay profiles of gzcu with gzno recorded with an excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 390 nm respectively it is visualized that the electronic interaction between host and the dopant ions is strongly influenced by cu ion doping thereby resulting in a difference in lifetimes generally the decay curves for zno follows a multi exponential processes consisting of many long and short lifetime components therefore these decay curves which follow triexponential behavior are fitted well to the triexponential model explained by the expression 47 48 given in eq 1 of supplementary information and the average pl lifetime τ is estimated from the formula given in eq 2 of supplementary information the fast and slow lifetime components are due the excitonic recombination and recombination through surface defects that lead to non radiative and radiative trapping processes respectively 64 the average lifetime is obtained to be 15 05 15 63 15 01 17 65 18 39 16 42 and 16 61 ns for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzc5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively table 1 provides the average lifetime values and their decay components the average pl lifetime is found to increase up to 5 wt cu in zno and then decreases beyond 5 wt of cu the initial increase in the lifetime is due to the introduction of intermediate states on cu doping also confirmed from uv vis absorption and pl emission results that provides an additional pathway to impede the recombination of the excited electrons and thus elongating their lifetime the decrease in the lifetime value after 5 wt of cu doping can be attributed to the secondary phase cuo that can provide an additional non radiative pathway for the charge transfer thus decreasing the lifetime 3 7 photocatalytic performance of gzcu photocatalytic behavior of the gzcu nanocomposites was analyzed through the photodegradation of methyl orange dye under the irradiation of uv light before performing real photocatalytic experiments the photocatalysts gzcu were added to an aqueous solution of mo dye and homogenously mixed in dark without exposing to any irradiation light and that had slightly decreased the dye concentration during this process the dye molecules are adsorbed on the catalyst s surface so that the concentration is reduced in this particular case because of a very high surface area of graphene it has resulted in a maximum adsorption of 50 within a stirring time of 60 min in dark condition as reported in the literature 27 57 adsorption of dye onto the catalyst is a common phenomenon in this kind of graphitic materials fig 8 presents the photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposites to photodegrade mo when irradiated with uv light the ratio of instantaneous concentration of the dye to the initial concentration varying with respect to time would be estimated from the value of a a0 obtained from the absorption spectra where a0 is the absorption maxima without light irradiation and a is the instantaneous absorption maxima this quantification is possible because change in a a0 is directly proportional to the degraded quantity of the dye usually langmuir hinshelwood model is used to explain the photodegradation of organic dyes that are adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts by this model pseudo first order kinetic reaction is occurring during photocatalytic reaction and therefore the reaction time t and the ln ct c0 are linearly related the first order kinetic equation is given as ln c0 ct kt 65 and the efficiency of degradation η expressed in is estimated through the expression given as 3 η c 0 c t c t 100 a 0 a t a t 100 where c0 and ct are the initial and instantaneous dye concentrations respectively and the their corresponding absorbance values are a 0 and at the degradation efficiency in estimated by using the eq 3 is obtained to be 73 2 81 7 85 6 45 1 15 3 13 2 and 9 6 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively the corresponding reaction rate constant k is obtained from the slope of the linear fitted curve of the plot of ln c0 ct versus time fig 8b the rate constant for photocatalytic reactions in the presence of gzcu are obtained to be 0 0025 0 0036 0 0032 0 0014 0 0004 0 0003 and 0 0002 min 1 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively see fig 8c the reaction kinetics is found to be increased with the initial doping of cu i e 0 5 wt which is reflected in the increased rate constant k from 0 0025 min 1 for the undoped gzno to 0 0036 min 1 for gzcu0 5 increasing the doping concentration beyond 0 5 wt cu has lowered the photocatalytic performance which can also be observed from the decreasing k value from 0 0032 min 1 for gzcu1 to 0 0002 min 1 for gzcu10 thus the highest photocatalytic activity is achieved in gzcu by having 0 5 wt of cu doped in zno which is obtained to be an optimum content in this case to further extend the use of these photocatalysts the same set of photocatalytic studies were conducted under direct sunlight irradiation in addition to the uv light irradiation this particular experiment was done to understand the efficiency of these photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation because of the natural abundance of sun light the location for carrying out the sun light experiment was 11 9139 n latitude and 79 8145 e longitude in the south east coast of india keeping all the experimental procedures parameters the same as in the case laboratory uv light experiment the results obtained for sunlight experiments are summarized in fig 9 the corresponding efficiency of degradation and reaction rate constants are listed in table 2 the degradation efficiency is found to vary from 11 0 to 89 1 for the irradiation time of 3 h what was achieved in the uv irradiation 81 7 in 6 h is achieved better in 3 h 89 2 under sun light irradiation this faster and enhanced activity could be attributed firstly to doping induced additional pathways that impede the recombination process and secondly to the lowering of band gap energy that makes these materials active in the near visible region apart from contributions from the changes in the material properties high intensity of the sun light would also have added on to the enhanced dye degradation in comparison to the same under uv light irradiation at a very high light intensity the rate at which e h separation happening just surpasses the rate of recombination of the excited electrons with the holes thereby increasing the availability of more electrons and holes to generate free radicals that enhanced the degradation activity 66 67 because environmental conditions vary with the geographical location the photocatalytic experiments were conducted under both uv as well as sunlight to confirm the consistency in the results thus the results conclude that doping of cu at lower percentages 0 5 1 can better degrade the dye under uv irradiation and much better under direct sunlight than the undoped zno table 2 presents a comparative statement of degradation of methyl orange under uv and sunlight radiations photocatalytic experiment for pure zno and cu doped zno were also carried out a complete study on the change in the material properties and their effect on the photocatalytic activity was reported in our earlier work 48 photocatalytic experiments were performed under uv as well under direct sunlight and the results showed that cu doped samples did not show any enhancement in the activity under uv light irradiation when compared with pure zno at the same time catalytic experiment under sunlight showed that 1 cu doped zno showed a minimal enhancement in the degradation of mo where the degradation rate had increased from 0 0279 min 1 pure zno to 0 0326 min 1 1 cu doped zno in the present work gzcu nanocomposites i e cu doped zno graphene nanocomposite shows a significant enhancement 11 12 in the catalytic activity as compared to its base materials gzno graphene zno nanocomposite both under uv and sunlight irradiation degradation of the organic dye mo through photocatalysis occurs due to the formation presence of various reactive species such as e h o2 and oh it is therefore to identify the particular species involved in the reaction controlled experiments containing individual radical scavengers were conducted sodium oxalate benzoquinine and isopropanol were added as scavenger molecules for trapping h o2 and oh species respectively presence of individual scavenger molecules traps that particular radical species generated thereby lowering the availability of the active radicals to effectively photodegrade the organic dye present in the reaction mixture therefore by calculating the degradation efficiency in one can easily identify the contribution of individual radicals towards the degradation of the dyes when the degradation is less it implies more contribution from that particular species towards degradation in a typical experiment 50 ml of aqueous dye solution was used with scavenger molecules and 25 mg of the appropriate photocatalyst then it was irradiated with uv light for 2 h and the results are presented in fig 10 a presence of scavenger molecule has influenced the degradation performance that is the degradation efficiency had decreased with their presence the solution containing isopropanol had shown the least degradation of the dye thus confirming that oh radicals are the most contributing radicals towards dye degradation in the real photocatalytic reactions fig s2 in the supplementary information presents the uv vis absorption spectra of these experiments further another experiment was carried out to check the amount of oh radical generation during the photocatalytic process by using a probe molecule terepthalic acid and pl technique in this procedure firstly a stock solution of 1 4 m concentrations of terepthalic acid and sodium hydroxide was prepared for every experiment 20 mg of photocatalyst was taken with the stock solution 50 ml then it was irradiated with uv light aliquots of 3 ml solution were collected every 15 min and their pl emission spectra were recorded by exciting them at 315 nm this would result in a formation of a highly fluorescent product 2 hydroxyterepthalic acid 68 which is formed by the interaction of terepthalic acid with oh radicals and its pl emission peak is observed at 425 nm it is known that the concentration of oh radicals generated during the reaction is proportional to the pl intensity of the 2 hydroxyterepthalic acid intensity of the pl emission at 425 nm for gzcu varies with time and the relevant pl graphs of three different samples gzno gzcu0 5 and gzcu1 are presented in supplementary information fig s3 for a given photocatalyst the pl intensity gradually increases with time of uv light irradiation however negligible pl intensity was recorded without light irradiation which implies that the formation of the fluorescent product occurs only after the chemical reaction between terepthalic acid and oh radicals generated upon illumination it is also observed that at particular interval of time the amount of oh generation is different for different photocatalysts amongst all the photocatalyst gzcu 0 5 have shown the highest generation of oh radicals followed by gzcu1 and then gzno this highest generation of oh had resulted in the highest degradation rate of the mo dye in that subsequent order since real industrial effluents can exist in a range of ph and dependence of photodegradation on initial ph value of the solution is vital and considered in this study the degradation activity is estimated from the surface charge and size of the aggregates of the photocatalysts in acidic medium the functional groups are protonated and the net surface charge of photocatalyst would increase similarly the catalyst possesses a negative surface charge in basic medium and it increases the adsorption affinity towards cationic dyes therefore type of the charge on the photocatalyst s surface influences its capability to adsorb the dye molecules and therefore its photodegradation performance regarding the role of active species in the reaction positive holes and hydroxyl radicals have participated in the effective oxidation at lower and higher ph conditions respectively therefore the degradation experiments on mb and mo dyes were done at three various ph conditions i e basic neutral and acidic with the ph values of 10 7 and 1 respectively different ph values were maintained by adding an appropriate amount of 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh solution fig 10c presents the influence of ph on the photodegradation performance of gzcu on mo and mb it is seen that the mo was most degraded at lower ph value i e in acidic medium and that of mb was the highest in higher ph value i e in basic medium this change in the catalytic activity can be explained as follows acidic medium protonates the photocatalyst s surface and facilitates the anionic dye molecules to be absorbed more and more on the contrary the surface become negatively charged in the basic medium because of the hydroxide anions that promote more adsorption of the cationic dye increased adsorption can facilitate better transfer of the generated radicals and had increased the degradation of the organic dyes 69 70 hence it is concluded that gzcu works better for cationic dyes in basic medium and anionic dye in acidic medium reusability test of these photocatalysts was also performed to check their efficiency over repeated cycles use to do this a regular photocatalysis experiment was done called as one cycle and after each cycle of this experiment used photocatalyst from the preceding cycle was collected through centrifuge dried and was again used in the next consecutive cycle of photocatalytic reaction as a fresh catalyst photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst gzcu0 5 during each cycle for the total of five cycles is presented in fig 11 a the result shows the high stability of the photocatalyst for the five consecutive cycles of the reaction with more or less similar degradation performance in each cycle structural stability of the photocatalyst is a crucial parameter for the photocatalysts for sustainable use and therefore it was checked by using raman analysis of the fresh and used photocatalysts after five consecutive cycles of photocatalysis fig 11b compares the raman spectra typically for gzcu0 5 recorded when it was fresh and used in five cycles it can be seen that the spectral features remain intact implying that these photocatalysts are structurally stable 4 conclusion to summarize the cu doped zno graphene ternary nanocomposites have been prepared by low temperature hydrothermal method their structure and optical characteristics have been thoroughly studied they were used as photocatalysts for the degradation mo when treated with uv light and sunlight irradiation methyl orange was maximum degraded up to 85 7 under uv irradiation in 6 h and 89 1 under sunlight irradiation in 3 h which were the enhanced activities shown by the cu doped zno graphene nanocomposites compared to their undoped counterpart gzno the optimum cu doping concentration was found to be 0 5 wt which also showed the highest photocatalytic reaction rate this enhanced catalytic activity was correlated to the significantly modified optical and structural properties of the gzno photocatalyst when doped with cu ions the cu ion doping in the zno lattice had led to a decrease in the bandgap which was due to the hike in the free carriers causing the fermi level shift downward decreasing band gap have stimulated the photocatalyst to be active with lower excitation energy again doping introduced intermediate levels within the forbidden region that retarded the recombination process confirmed from the decreased nbe emission in pl and increased pl lifetime photodegradation of mo under sunlight was found to be much higher than that under uv light implying the superiority of the natural light source for the present photocatalysts to perform better in photocatalytic reactions examining the role of various radical species showed that the oh radicals have been the major player in the degradation process and the photocatalyst with the highest generation of oh radicals have degraded the maximum amount of dye therefore the photocatalyst gzcu showed the enhanced photoactivity the decreased band gap in gzcu enables the material to be active in the near visible range that makes them lower band gap photocatalyst material with superior photocatalytic performance in addition they are found to be structurally very stable and therefore can be used for many continuous cycles a complete understanding of the structural optical properties of gzcu and their application towards photocatalytic degradation of the model organic dye has been achieved that could provide a better insight for an effective removal of pollutants that are present in the

14276,a ternary photocatalyst cu doped 0 to 10 wt zno hybridized graphene nanocomposite gzcu was prepared by hydrothermal method a detailed analysis by xrd raman ftir and fesem showed a formation of zno nanorods with hexagonal wurtzite structure on graphene sheets optical band gap has been decreased from 3 12 ev for gzno undoped zno to 2 89 ev for gzcu subsequently intensity of pl emission and pl lifetime have also been decreased with increasing cu ion content in zno photocatalytic studies under uv and sunlight irradiations were done on the photodegradation of organic dyes such as methyl orange mo the gzcu with 0 5 wt cu showed the highest photodegradation of mo the maximum mo degradation was 85 7 and 89 1 under uv and sunlight irradiation respectively for gzcu and this was 12 and 11 higher than the same shown by undoped gzno the enhanced degradation observed at lower cu doping 0 5 wt in zno was attributed to the optimum doping concentration which is responsible for reduced charge recombination increased pl lifetime and increased oh radical generation during the photocatalytic reaction photocatalytic experiments under different ph conditions showed that the photocatalyst could effectively degrade cationic dye in basic medium because under basic conditions the catalyst s surface become negatively charged whereby more adsorption of the cationic dye took place on its surface and resulted in enhanced degradation keywords cu doped zno graphene nanocomposite photocatalyst uv light irradiation organic dyes pl lifetime 1 introduction graphene based semiconductor materials have attracted much research interest because of their exciting and unique properties 1 2 graphene is a 2 d honeycomb shaped material with phenomenal electronic mechanical thermal and optical properties 3 theoretically it has been reported to have a high surface area 2630 m2 g 1 4 good thermal conductivity 5000 wm 1 k 1 5 better young s modulus 1 t pa 6 excellent charge carrier mobility 200 000 cm2v 1s 1 due to π conjugation structure 7 8 and good optical transparency 97 7 9 with a slight overlap of valence band with conduction band graphene is considered as a zero bandgap semiconductor 10 these properties have proved graphene as a potential candidate for applications in nanoelectronics 11 h2 production and storage 12 13 biosensors 14 li ion batteries 15 16 reinforced composite materials supercapacitors 17 solar cells 18 liquid crystal display 19 and photocatalysis 20 23 in order to solve the biggest challenge of energy and environmental issues semiconductor nanocomposites based on graphene have been largely used because the synergistic effect of the semiconductor and graphene can overcome their individual demerits chemical synthesis of graphene can pose a problem of graphene sheets restacking it becomes onerous to maintain its surface area to be large among various methods available decoration of graphene sheets with metals metal oxides nanoparticles has been used as a very interesting approach to approach this problem 24 25 due to unique electronic structures comprising completely filled valence band vb and an empty partially filled conduction band cb the semiconducting metal oxides can act as a photocatalyst when they interact with the radiation of higher energy than their band gap energy electrons are excited to the conduction band from valence band thereby creating a hole in the valence band these photogenerated electron hole pairs play a major role in further generating active species that would degrade the organic dyes however efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst is highly depending on the speed of recombination of the photo generated electrons from cb to vb and gets reduced if the recombination is fast presence of graphene component along with the semiconductor has proved to be beneficial in a number of ways like i improved charge separation of photogenerated charges thereby reducing their recombination ii increased surface area to provide support to photocatalysts preventing their aggregation and iii better absorption of the dye molecules through π π interaction of graphene with molecules 20 26 27 in addition to these when graphene based semiconductors are considered as photocatalysts the semiconductor acts as a photocatalyst whereas graphene helps to promote migration of the photogenerated electrons carriers to inhibit electron hole recombination 28 because of high surface area and electron conduction graphene can very efficiently transfer these electons therefore in this nanocomposite presence of each material helps each other to overcome their individual demerits i e graphene reduces the charge recombination in semiconductor whereas the semiconductor material solves the problem of restacking of graphene sheets thus creating a symbiotic situation variety of semiconductor metal oxides like tio2 21 zno 27 sno2 29 cu2o 25 etc have been made composite with graphene and studied for photocatalytic applications amongst all because of non toxicity strong oxidizing power easy synthesis and low cost zno has been very much used as photocatalyst graphene zno nanocomposites have been extensively studied to show an enhanced performance in various applications in comparison to pure zno despite vast research that had been reported two basic problems that limit these materials for a large scale industrial applications are their active responsive range that is narrow and restricted in the uv region this limits the use of entire solar spectrum and high rate of charge recombination 30 presence of graphene in the nanocomposite graphene zno has the ability up to certain extent to reduce impede the recombination of charges but still due to larger band gap the zno is mostly active in the uv region therefore many efforts such as non metal metal ion doping 31 33 noble metal loading 34 surface modification 35 heterojunction formation 36 38 etc have been made to increase the light absorption by extending the absorption range and increase the lifetime of the photoexcited electrons doping has been adopted as the most suitable method to preserve favorable properties of semiconductors as a photocatalyst and also endow them a visible light activity when the zno lattice is introduced with the dopant ions there expects intermediate energy levels i e allowed states generated within the forbidden bandgap thereby reducing the absorption energy compared to the band band transition of the semiconductor 20 39 40 copper out of various elements used for doping has been considered as a suitable dopant to achieve photo activity in zno under visible light irradiation 41 especially when ii vi semiconductor such as zno is used the element cu can act as luminescence activator and therefore it is also expected to modify optical electrical physical magnetic properties gas sensitivity and photocatalytic activity 42 since cu has similar chemical physical and electronic structure like zn cu can substitutionally enter the zno lattice use of copper as a doping element can lead to a development of low cost photocatalytic material 42 44 with improved optical properties thus high performance photocatalytic materials with low cost as well as active in the visible light region are always in high demand this paper presents the preparation of cu doped zno graphene nanocomposites by hydrothermal method with varied concentrations of cu in zno and their characterization further their photocatalytic performance has been investigated on the degradation of methyl orange dye and the complete results are reported 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of cu doped zno graphene photocatalyst graphite flakes zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o copper acetate monohydrate cuch3cooh h2o and sulfuric acid h2so4 from himedia chemicals india ammonia sodium hydroxide isopropanol and terepthalic acid from merck india potassium permanganate kmno4 and hydrogen peroxide from nice chemicals india sodium nitrate nano3 fischer scientific and sodium oxalate loba were used all of them were used as received and double distilled water was used prior to the preparation of graphene zno nanocomposite hummer s method was used and graphene oxide go was prepared 45 46 then by using hydrothermal method relatively at low temperature cu ion doped zno graphene gzcu was synthesized by first preparing two different solutions in the first solution solution a a 0 45 g of go was taken in water 50 ml and agitated using ultrasonication for 30 min then its ph value was raised from 2 to 4 by adding naoh simultaneously solution b was prepared separately in 50 ml of water by adding 0 15 m zinc nitrate hexahydrate then homogenously mixed for 15 min and later cuch3cooh h2o was added then by adding ammonium hydroxide ph value of solution b was raised to 11 in order to increase the conversion rate of zn oh 2 to obtain a precipitate later solution b was added to solution a the final graphene cu zno composites prepared with 0 5 1 3 5 8 and 10 wt of copper acetate were coded as gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively and gzcu is used for the common reference the combined solution was stirred for another 30 min to get homogeneity and then it was kept in a sealed hydrothermal reactor and heated at 90 c for 10 h in an oven once the reaction was finished the solution was centrifuged and dried at 70 c in vacuum later in order to remove the hydroxides it was tempered at 350 c as a control sample pure zno graphene nanocomposite was also prepared and this was the optimized sample from our previous work 47 studies on pristine zno and cu doped zno have also been reported by us in our earlier work and that results can be compared wherever required 48 2 2 characterization x ray diffraction ultima iv rigaku analysis was carried out on powder samples by using cu kα1 radiation raman spectra were acquired in a micro raman spectrometer in via renishaw microstructure was analyzed by tem microscope tecnai g2 f30stwin fei and sem microscope zeiss crossbeam 340 equipped with field emission source x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was done by recording xps spectra under ultrahigh vacuum in omicron esca by using al kα radiation to acquire the survey and high resolution scans 50 and 20 ev were the respective pass energies used shimadzu uv3600 plus the optical absorption spectrometer was used to acquire uv vis absorption spectra steady state photoluminescence measurements were done in a fluromax 4 horiba scientific spectrophotometer using xenon lamp time resolved photoluminescence trpl decay profiles were measured in a flurolog fl3 111 spectrofluorometer using emission and excitation wavelengths of 390 and 290 nm respectively intensity of the light used in photocatalytic experiment was measured by a digital lux meter lt luxtron lx 1102 2 3 photocatalytic activity experiment photodegradation of methyl orange mo in the presence of gzcu as photocatalysts under the uv light irradiation was studied to understand the photocatalytic strength of these photocatalysts initially 0 05 mm of mo was prepared in 100 ml water and homogeneously mixed overnight then 50 mg of gzcu was added and to attain adsorption desorption equilibrium it was stirred for 1 h in dark then the whole solution was irradiated separately under two different light sources 8w uv lamp and direct sun light every 30 min a 3 ml of the irradiated solution was collected and their uv vis absorption spectra were measured the normalized maximum absorbance a a 0 is proportional to the degraded concentration c c0 of the dye with irradiation time and the latter was obtained from the former 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd analysis structural phase of the gzcu was analyzed through xrd see fig 1 for their xrd patterns and the obtained xrd peaks confirm the hexagonal wurtzite phase of zno and the bragg reflections observed at 2θ values of 31 7 34 4 36 2 47 5 56 6 62 7 67 7 and 68 9 are respectively attributed to the planes 100 002 101 102 110 103 200 and 112 of the wurtzite phase in comparison with the standard icdd data card 98 000 9340 when the alien cu ion is introduced into the lattice of zno up to 5 wt of doping the reflections corresponding to hexagonal zno phase alone were obtained with further increase in doping content additional peaks corresponding to a monoclinic phase of cuo icdd card no 98 005 998 are evolved the magnified image in fig 1 shows the presence of graphene and the secondary phase cuo it should be also noted that there is no sharp peak observed at 11 corresponding to 002 planes of graphene oxide go this implies that go has been completely reduced to graphene shown as zoomed in image in fig 1 during the process of synthesis although there is no noticeable peak shift observed a significant peak broadening orginating from the change in crystallite size is observed this is because the ionic radii of cu2 0 073 nm ion lies closer to that of zn2 0 074 nm ion when the doping concentration is lower than 5 wt cu ion substitutes the zn ions whereas increasing the dopant beyond 5 wt substitution of the dopant ion reaches its saturation limit and thereby the excess cu ions have formed the secondary phase which is apparently the monoclinic strucutred cuo that is the cu ion has solubility in zno lattice only up to 5 wt in this case therefore beyond 5 wt a mixed phase of zno and cuo is formed similar results for cu ion doping in zno were reported previously in the literature 49 51 3 2 raman analysis raman spectroscopy is the sensitive probe for providing information about disorder present in sp2 hybridized carbon materials and crystal structure of the samples 48 in particular for doped samples the raman analysis helps much to identify the possible secondary phases fig 2 presents the raman spectra of gzno and gzcu nanocomposites the raman spectra clearly show two peaks one is at 1592 cm 1 and the other one is at 1316 cm 1 they can be respectively attributed to the characteristic g and d bands of graphene the g band arising from the vibration of sp2 hybridized bonded carbon atom is a graphitic band whereas the d band attributed to the structural disorder mostly occurring at the edges of graphene sheets is the defect band 40 47 the ratio of integrated intensity of the d to g bands i e id ig is usually taken as a measure of sp2 domain size and degree of disorder in addition the ratio can also hint about the graphitic structures quality because this ratio approaches to zero for a highly pyrolitic graphite 27 therefore higher intensity ratio denotes more defects and disorder formed at the edges of carbon platelets the id ig ratio for the present nanocomposites is obtained to be 1 44 1 56 1 58 1 59 1 68 1 69 and 1 74 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively that are much greater than the same for graphene oxide i e 0 90 this higher id ig values imply a significant introduction of defect sites and degree of disorder in the graphene sheets and also gives a clear indication that go has been reduced to graphene 52 inset of the fig 2 presents the 2d band which is a fingerprint confirming the formation and the number of layers in graphene sheets 53 3 3 microstructure analysis by fesem the fesem micrographs in fig 3 present the morphological features of gzcu nanocomposites typically for two compositions of cu the gzcu nanocomposites exhibit a sheet like structure that corresponds to graphene sheets marked by arrows in fig 3 whereas the rod and particle like morphologies are corresponding to cu doped zno rods particles the latter is densely packed into the sheets of the former showing a formation of cu zno graphene nanocomposites 3 4 microstructure analysis by tem the microstructure of gzcu nanocomposite was further investigated through transmission electron microscopy fig 4 a and b present the typical bright field images of the nanocomposite which clearly show two well distinguished regions the one with the darker contrast is attributed to the cu doped zno nanorods whereas the lighter region surrounding it corresponds to the graphene sheets this contrast is related to the mass difference between graphene sheets and zno the latter has higher average atomic number and scatters more to appear dark whereas the reverse is true for graphene sheets interplanar spacing was calculated from the lattice fringes seen in the hrtem image fig 4c and was obtained to be 0 282 nm that very well resolves the 010 plane of hexagonal zno confirming the crystal phase of zno in addition the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 4d for the samples are also indexed with the corresponding crystal planes of zno with hexagonal wurtzite structure 3 5 xps analysis the chemical oxidation states of the elements present in gzcu were identified using xps analysis and the corresponding results for the gzcu0 5 are presented in fig 5 presence of three dominative elements c o and zn is seen from the survey spectrum in fig 5a the high resolution xps spectrum for the element zn in fig 5b shows a doublet at 1023 12 and 1046 36 ev that can be ascribed to zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p3 2 states respectively and the spin orbit energy split between them is 23 24 ev the peak positions and the difference in the binding energy between them correspond to the zn2 state in the sample 54 the high resolution spectrum for c1 s in fig 5c is further deconvoluted to obtain peaks at 284 86 ev from non oxygenated cc 286 09 ev c o and 288 82 oc o in a similar way the asymmetric o1s xps profile see fig 5d is deconvoluted and fitted with two symmetrical peaks one at 531 41 ev is attributed to the o2 ion in the zn o bond of wurtzite zno and the other one at 532 52 ev appeared as a shoulder peak is because of the surface adsorbed oh group and from c o and c o zn bonds 55 57 as found in the literature the cu 2p xps peak is found to contain two peaks with their maxima at 952 1 and 932 4 ev that are correlated respectively to cu 2p1 2 and cu 2p3 2 states finding cu in this sample is not that easy as for other elements because of lower content of cu in this particular case 0 5 cu doped sample however the high resolution spectrum of cu element in fig 5e shows two small humps present at 933 ev and 951 ev that are being originated from cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 states respectively confirming the presence of cu in the nanocomposite it is to be noted that the noisy nature of xps of cu in fig 5e is due to the lower concentration of cu and also the raw data is presented 3 6 optical properties variation of band gap energy in gzno as an effect of cu doping was studied by uv vis absorption spectroscopy the corresponding absorption spectra for gzno and gzcu nanocomposites are compared in fig 6 a in the uv region a strong absorption is observed which is generally due to the electronic transitions from vb to cb o2p zn3d and referred to the characteristic band gap absorption of zno 58 this absorption is otherwise called as band edge absorption it is crucial to note that there is a red shift observed in the band edge absorption with respect to increasing cu content the band gap values of these samples were estimated from tauc plots fig s1 of the supplementary file and are obtained to be 3 12 3 04 3 02 2 89 2 92 3 00 and 2 94 ev for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively variation of the band gap energies may be connected to two primary reasons the first one is the size induced quantum confinement effect that depends on the size of the nanoparticles and the second one is the modification of the electronic structure the former effect is dependent on the size which when below the excitonic bohr radius influences a lot on the band gap the value of excitonic bohr radius for zno usually lies in the range from 0 9 to 2 4 nm as found in the literature which implies that the zno shows a high band gap tuning within this particle size range whereas in this work the particle size of zno is obtained to vary from 15 to 20 nm which is way away from the excitonic bohr radius of zno and therefore lowering of band gap in the present case cannot be directly attributed to size induced quantum confinement effect therefore the band gap decrease with cu doping content may be attributed to band edge bending induced by doping where because of the coupling of localized cu2 impurity spins with band electrons there occurs a strong shift in the valence and conduction bands 43 it is known when impurity atoms are doped the dopant atoms can introduce shallow levels within the forbidden band gap this is initiated through the s d or p d exchange interaction between host and dopant atoms with the substitution of zn2 by cu2 the cu ions provide electrons from its 3d shell so that the valence band o 2p of zno is shifted via hybridization of cu 3d shell thus resulting in a strong cu 3d o 2p interaction which narrows the bandgap 59 thus uniform substitution of cu ions in the zno lattice is confirmed by this red shift in the band gap 51 moreover additional pathways for electronic transition are made feasible via these new electronic states whereby the absorption edge is red shifted towards visible region 41 60 because of this introduction of new intermediate states the nanocomposites can now be excited by light energy lower than their real band gap energy thereby generating extra charge carriers which can enhance its photo conversion efficiency as well as photocatalytic efficiency the cb and vb potentials can be also determined from the classical formula presented in eq 1 and eq 2 below 61 1 e c b x e c 1 2 e g 2 e v b e c b e g where ecb is the conduction band edge at point zero charge phzpc evb is the valence band edge x is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor and is expressed as the geometric mean of the atomic electro affinity i e the arithmetic mean of the atomic electronic affinity and first ionization energy ec represents the energy of free electron on hydrogen scale 4 5 ev and eg is the band gap of the semiconductor applying the obtained band gap from tauc plot into the eq 1 the values of e vb and e cb for gzcu0 5 and gzcu1 are obtained to be 0 089 ev 2 9513 ev and 0 0387 ev 2 9013 ev respectively further luminescence characteristics and nature of electron transfer between zno and graphene sheets were studied through steady state pl spectra for gzcu obtained at the laser excitation of 325 nm and compared with gzno in fig 6b the pl emission maximum observed at 380 nm is connected either to near band edge nbe emission or free exciton emission 47 in addition the gzcu has shown a decreasing emission intensity compared to that of gzno since recombination of the excited electrons with holes in the valence band gives out the nbe emission decreasing intensity of this emission signifies the lowering of charge recombination already there has been a number of works in the literature reporting that in case of graphene zno nanocomposite introduction of graphene effectively impedes the recombination of the photoelectrons thereby quenches the fluorescence 62 63 because zno being a good donor of electrons and comparatively graphene being a good acceptor an efficient charge transfer at their zno and graphene interface would reduce the charge recombination this present study investigates in addition to the graphene zno nanocomposite the effect of cu ion that is doped into zno doping of copper ion introduces new intermediate states within the forbidden band gap this was also concluded from the uv results discussed above providing additional pathways for the transfer of electrons from cb of zno decrease in the nbe emission would have also resulted from the non radiative centers that are formed in the samples with cu doping therefore transfer of electrons into the intermediate states reduces the recombination process whereby more electrons and holes are available to form radical species in the case of photocatalysis that assists to enhance their photocatalytic activity also cu ion introduction into the zno graphene system has affected the charge transfer in the host system and the variation was explored by conducting the trpl pl measurements fig 7 compares the pl lifetime decay profiles of gzcu with gzno recorded with an excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 390 nm respectively it is visualized that the electronic interaction between host and the dopant ions is strongly influenced by cu ion doping thereby resulting in a difference in lifetimes generally the decay curves for zno follows a multi exponential processes consisting of many long and short lifetime components therefore these decay curves which follow triexponential behavior are fitted well to the triexponential model explained by the expression 47 48 given in eq 1 of supplementary information and the average pl lifetime τ is estimated from the formula given in eq 2 of supplementary information the fast and slow lifetime components are due the excitonic recombination and recombination through surface defects that lead to non radiative and radiative trapping processes respectively 64 the average lifetime is obtained to be 15 05 15 63 15 01 17 65 18 39 16 42 and 16 61 ns for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzc5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively table 1 provides the average lifetime values and their decay components the average pl lifetime is found to increase up to 5 wt cu in zno and then decreases beyond 5 wt of cu the initial increase in the lifetime is due to the introduction of intermediate states on cu doping also confirmed from uv vis absorption and pl emission results that provides an additional pathway to impede the recombination of the excited electrons and thus elongating their lifetime the decrease in the lifetime value after 5 wt of cu doping can be attributed to the secondary phase cuo that can provide an additional non radiative pathway for the charge transfer thus decreasing the lifetime 3 7 photocatalytic performance of gzcu photocatalytic behavior of the gzcu nanocomposites was analyzed through the photodegradation of methyl orange dye under the irradiation of uv light before performing real photocatalytic experiments the photocatalysts gzcu were added to an aqueous solution of mo dye and homogenously mixed in dark without exposing to any irradiation light and that had slightly decreased the dye concentration during this process the dye molecules are adsorbed on the catalyst s surface so that the concentration is reduced in this particular case because of a very high surface area of graphene it has resulted in a maximum adsorption of 50 within a stirring time of 60 min in dark condition as reported in the literature 27 57 adsorption of dye onto the catalyst is a common phenomenon in this kind of graphitic materials fig 8 presents the photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposites to photodegrade mo when irradiated with uv light the ratio of instantaneous concentration of the dye to the initial concentration varying with respect to time would be estimated from the value of a a0 obtained from the absorption spectra where a0 is the absorption maxima without light irradiation and a is the instantaneous absorption maxima this quantification is possible because change in a a0 is directly proportional to the degraded quantity of the dye usually langmuir hinshelwood model is used to explain the photodegradation of organic dyes that are adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts by this model pseudo first order kinetic reaction is occurring during photocatalytic reaction and therefore the reaction time t and the ln ct c0 are linearly related the first order kinetic equation is given as ln c0 ct kt 65 and the efficiency of degradation η expressed in is estimated through the expression given as 3 η c 0 c t c t 100 a 0 a t a t 100 where c0 and ct are the initial and instantaneous dye concentrations respectively and the their corresponding absorbance values are a 0 and at the degradation efficiency in estimated by using the eq 3 is obtained to be 73 2 81 7 85 6 45 1 15 3 13 2 and 9 6 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively the corresponding reaction rate constant k is obtained from the slope of the linear fitted curve of the plot of ln c0 ct versus time fig 8b the rate constant for photocatalytic reactions in the presence of gzcu are obtained to be 0 0025 0 0036 0 0032 0 0014 0 0004 0 0003 and 0 0002 min 1 for gzno gzcu0 5 gzcu1 gzcu3 gzcu5 gzcu8 and gzcu10 respectively see fig 8c the reaction kinetics is found to be increased with the initial doping of cu i e 0 5 wt which is reflected in the increased rate constant k from 0 0025 min 1 for the undoped gzno to 0 0036 min 1 for gzcu0 5 increasing the doping concentration beyond 0 5 wt cu has lowered the photocatalytic performance which can also be observed from the decreasing k value from 0 0032 min 1 for gzcu1 to 0 0002 min 1 for gzcu10 thus the highest photocatalytic activity is achieved in gzcu by having 0 5 wt of cu doped in zno which is obtained to be an optimum content in this case to further extend the use of these photocatalysts the same set of photocatalytic studies were conducted under direct sunlight irradiation in addition to the uv light irradiation this particular experiment was done to understand the efficiency of these photocatalysts under sunlight irradiation because of the natural abundance of sun light the location for carrying out the sun light experiment was 11 9139 n latitude and 79 8145 e longitude in the south east coast of india keeping all the experimental procedures parameters the same as in the case laboratory uv light experiment the results obtained for sunlight experiments are summarized in fig 9 the corresponding efficiency of degradation and reaction rate constants are listed in table 2 the degradation efficiency is found to vary from 11 0 to 89 1 for the irradiation time of 3 h what was achieved in the uv irradiation 81 7 in 6 h is achieved better in 3 h 89 2 under sun light irradiation this faster and enhanced activity could be attributed firstly to doping induced additional pathways that impede the recombination process and secondly to the lowering of band gap energy that makes these materials active in the near visible region apart from contributions from the changes in the material properties high intensity of the sun light would also have added on to the enhanced dye degradation in comparison to the same under uv light irradiation at a very high light intensity the rate at which e h separation happening just surpasses the rate of recombination of the excited electrons with the holes thereby increasing the availability of more electrons and holes to generate free radicals that enhanced the degradation activity 66 67 because environmental conditions vary with the geographical location the photocatalytic experiments were conducted under both uv as well as sunlight to confirm the consistency in the results thus the results conclude that doping of cu at lower percentages 0 5 1 can better degrade the dye under uv irradiation and much better under direct sunlight than the undoped zno table 2 presents a comparative statement of degradation of methyl orange under uv and sunlight radiations photocatalytic experiment for pure zno and cu doped zno were also carried out a complete study on the change in the material properties and their effect on the photocatalytic activity was reported in our earlier work 48 photocatalytic experiments were performed under uv as well under direct sunlight and the results showed that cu doped samples did not show any enhancement in the activity under uv light irradiation when compared with pure zno at the same time catalytic experiment under sunlight showed that 1 cu doped zno showed a minimal enhancement in the degradation of mo where the degradation rate had increased from 0 0279 min 1 pure zno to 0 0326 min 1 1 cu doped zno in the present work gzcu nanocomposites i e cu doped zno graphene nanocomposite shows a significant enhancement 11 12 in the catalytic activity as compared to its base materials gzno graphene zno nanocomposite both under uv and sunlight irradiation degradation of the organic dye mo through photocatalysis occurs due to the formation presence of various reactive species such as e h o2 and oh it is therefore to identify the particular species involved in the reaction controlled experiments containing individual radical scavengers were conducted sodium oxalate benzoquinine and isopropanol were added as scavenger molecules for trapping h o2 and oh species respectively presence of individual scavenger molecules traps that particular radical species generated thereby lowering the availability of the active radicals to effectively photodegrade the organic dye present in the reaction mixture therefore by calculating the degradation efficiency in one can easily identify the contribution of individual radicals towards the degradation of the dyes when the degradation is less it implies more contribution from that particular species towards degradation in a typical experiment 50 ml of aqueous dye solution was used with scavenger molecules and 25 mg of the appropriate photocatalyst then it was irradiated with uv light for 2 h and the results are presented in fig 10 a presence of scavenger molecule has influenced the degradation performance that is the degradation efficiency had decreased with their presence the solution containing isopropanol had shown the least degradation of the dye thus confirming that oh radicals are the most contributing radicals towards dye degradation in the real photocatalytic reactions fig s2 in the supplementary information presents the uv vis absorption spectra of these experiments further another experiment was carried out to check the amount of oh radical generation during the photocatalytic process by using a probe molecule terepthalic acid and pl technique in this procedure firstly a stock solution of 1 4 m concentrations of terepthalic acid and sodium hydroxide was prepared for every experiment 20 mg of photocatalyst was taken with the stock solution 50 ml then it was irradiated with uv light aliquots of 3 ml solution were collected every 15 min and their pl emission spectra were recorded by exciting them at 315 nm this would result in a formation of a highly fluorescent product 2 hydroxyterepthalic acid 68 which is formed by the interaction of terepthalic acid with oh radicals and its pl emission peak is observed at 425 nm it is known that the concentration of oh radicals generated during the reaction is proportional to the pl intensity of the 2 hydroxyterepthalic acid intensity of the pl emission at 425 nm for gzcu varies with time and the relevant pl graphs of three different samples gzno gzcu0 5 and gzcu1 are presented in supplementary information fig s3 for a given photocatalyst the pl intensity gradually increases with time of uv light irradiation however negligible pl intensity was recorded without light irradiation which implies that the formation of the fluorescent product occurs only after the chemical reaction between terepthalic acid and oh radicals generated upon illumination it is also observed that at particular interval of time the amount of oh generation is different for different photocatalysts amongst all the photocatalyst gzcu 0 5 have shown the highest generation of oh radicals followed by gzcu1 and then gzno this highest generation of oh had resulted in the highest degradation rate of the mo dye in that subsequent order since real industrial effluents can exist in a range of ph and dependence of photodegradation on initial ph value of the solution is vital and considered in this study the degradation activity is estimated from the surface charge and size of the aggregates of the photocatalysts in acidic medium the functional groups are protonated and the net surface charge of photocatalyst would increase similarly the catalyst possesses a negative surface charge in basic medium and it increases the adsorption affinity towards cationic dyes therefore type of the charge on the photocatalyst s surface influences its capability to adsorb the dye molecules and therefore its photodegradation performance regarding the role of active species in the reaction positive holes and hydroxyl radicals have participated in the effective oxidation at lower and higher ph conditions respectively therefore the degradation experiments on mb and mo dyes were done at three various ph conditions i e basic neutral and acidic with the ph values of 10 7 and 1 respectively different ph values were maintained by adding an appropriate amount of 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh solution fig 10c presents the influence of ph on the photodegradation performance of gzcu on mo and mb it is seen that the mo was most degraded at lower ph value i e in acidic medium and that of mb was the highest in higher ph value i e in basic medium this change in the catalytic activity can be explained as follows acidic medium protonates the photocatalyst s surface and facilitates the anionic dye molecules to be absorbed more and more on the contrary the surface become negatively charged in the basic medium because of the hydroxide anions that promote more adsorption of the cationic dye increased adsorption can facilitate better transfer of the generated radicals and had increased the degradation of the organic dyes 69 70 hence it is concluded that gzcu works better for cationic dyes in basic medium and anionic dye in acidic medium reusability test of these photocatalysts was also performed to check their efficiency over repeated cycles use to do this a regular photocatalysis experiment was done called as one cycle and after each cycle of this experiment used photocatalyst from the preceding cycle was collected through centrifuge dried and was again used in the next consecutive cycle of photocatalytic reaction as a fresh catalyst photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst gzcu0 5 during each cycle for the total of five cycles is presented in fig 11 a the result shows the high stability of the photocatalyst for the five consecutive cycles of the reaction with more or less similar degradation performance in each cycle structural stability of the photocatalyst is a crucial parameter for the photocatalysts for sustainable use and therefore it was checked by using raman analysis of the fresh and used photocatalysts after five consecutive cycles of photocatalysis fig 11b compares the raman spectra typically for gzcu0 5 recorded when it was fresh and used in five cycles it can be seen that the spectral features remain intact implying that these photocatalysts are structurally stable 4 conclusion to summarize the cu doped zno graphene ternary nanocomposites have been prepared by low temperature hydrothermal method their structure and optical characteristics have been thoroughly studied they were used as photocatalysts for the degradation mo when treated with uv light and sunlight irradiation methyl orange was maximum degraded up to 85 7 under uv irradiation in 6 h and 89 1 under sunlight irradiation in 3 h which were the enhanced activities shown by the cu doped zno graphene nanocomposites compared to their undoped counterpart gzno the optimum cu doping concentration was found to be 0 5 wt which also showed the highest photocatalytic reaction rate this enhanced catalytic activity was correlated to the significantly modified optical and structural properties of the gzno photocatalyst when doped with cu ions the cu ion doping in the zno lattice had led to a decrease in the bandgap which was due to the hike in the free carriers causing the fermi level shift downward decreasing band gap have stimulated the photocatalyst to be active with lower excitation energy again doping introduced intermediate levels within the forbidden region that retarded the recombination process confirmed from the decreased nbe emission in pl and increased pl lifetime photodegradation of mo under sunlight was found to be much higher than that under uv light implying the superiority of the natural light source for the present photocatalysts to perform better in photocatalytic reactions examining the role of various radical species showed that the oh radicals have been the major player in the degradation process and the photocatalyst with the highest generation of oh radicals have degraded the maximum amount of dye therefore the photocatalyst gzcu showed the enhanced photoactivity the decreased band gap in gzcu enables the material to be active in the near visible range that makes them lower band gap photocatalyst material with superior photocatalytic performance in addition they are found to be structurally very stable and therefore can be used for many continuous cycles a complete understanding of the structural optical properties of gzcu and their application towards photocatalytic degradation of the model organic dye has been achieved that could provide a better insight for an effective removal of pollutants that are present in the

14277,in an effort to improve the predictive capability of artificial neural networks for the coagulation process in a water treatment plant extreme learning machine elm coupled with radial basis function rbf neural networks were employed the elm rbf was selected to exploit the computational robustness of elm and accuracy of rbf for sufficiently large number of data that were available from the plant the coagulation data were divided into two categories based on low and high turbidity the optimum number of input parameters for modeling the coagulation of low turbidity water was found to be 3 whereas the optimum number of input parameters for modeling the coagulation of high turbidity water was found to be 4 re selection of the number of input parameters was necessary considering that raw water alkalinity was a significant factor in improving the high turbidity model performance the low turbidity model was capable of predicting the coagulant dosage with correlation coefficient exceeding 0 97 the high turbidity model was capable of predicting the coagulation dosage with reasonably acceptable correlation coefficient of at least 0 80 keywords coagulation big data analysis extreme leaning machine radial basis function artificial network 1 introduction coagulation is a process of destabilizing particles in water by neutralizing the negative charge on the particle surface and then agglomeration of the neutralized micro flocs to form settleable and filterable macro flocculants 1 2 coagulation process is primarily used for turbidity removal in a water treatment plant in which alum is among the most commonly used coagulants 3 alum is also the coagulant used by the segama water treatment plant whose data were used to conduct the current study determination of the optimal coagulant dosage in the coagulation process of a water treatment plant is extremely important to produce an acceptable level of the treated water quality and achieve sustainable plant operation by reducing manpower and expensive chemical costs 4 traditionally the required dosage of coagulant is determined by a laboratory jar test this method consumes time and chemicals the test is also costly to run and it cannot be used effectively to respond to rapid changes of turbidity especially for industrial scale application to allay this concern predictive models that can approximate the required dosages of coagulant with adequate accuracy without the need to run jar tests are being developed 5 and the water quality is monitored by the trend analysis 6 although the model prediction by artificial neural networks ann and fuzzy logic 7 for predicting real time coagulant dosage in water treatment 8 9 is on the rise big data of the historical coagulant dosage and other factors such as ph turbidity alkalinity etc which are known to affect the water treatment are necessary in the process of model development linear regression multi parameter regression non parametric regression and non linear data analyses have been employed for the development of the predictive models for coagulation since coagulation is a non linear process involving complex removal mechanisms influenced by a multiplicity of factors such as coagulant types properties origin of the source water and seasonal parameters 10 12 linear regression model is not an appropriate tool for the approximation of the process 11 13 thus data driven approaches such as ann that are more capable of capturing non linear relationships are selected to study the process 14 15 majority of studies in the past adopted multilayer perceptron mlp architecture in their ann models for coagulation process others developed models that employed general regression neural network grnn and radial basis function rbf but the former was found to perform better when there was limited amount of data 16 when comparison of the model performances were made using data of a full scale water treatment plant 17 19 mlp was found to outperform grnn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and rbf models in term of accuracy of the prediction in a real time coagulant dosage in an effort to improve the predictive capability of the ann models for the coagulation process further recently introduced extreme learning machine elm neural networks were employed 20 21 and their performances were compared with that of mlp s 22 the performance of the elm models was reported to be similar to that of mlp s nevertheless the computational effort required by the elm models was significantly less than that of mlp s 23 the training of elm neural networks also does not require an iterative algorithm such as the back propagation algorithm thus elm method was selected in the current work because of the reduced computational load for the training the objective of this research is to introduce for the first time the exploitation of the computational robustness of elm and the accuracy of rbf in an elm rbf neural network for a sufficiently large dataset derived from the coagulation process the model is developed to improve the predictive capability of the artificial neural network for coagulation process in segama water treatment plant located in sabah malaysia the parameters that affect the raw water turbidity and optimum input parameters are also identified and investigated 2 methodology the segama water treatment plant treats water from the segama river flowing through the lahad datu district of the state of sabah in malaysia the plant is located at a geographical coordinate of 5 003938 118 289200 the treated water is distributed to a population of 130 000 on a 24 h basis it has an operating capacity of 27 million liters 25 the data used for neural network model development in this study were collected over a year in 2005 2 1 input parameter selection input parameters were selected using the global search algorithm shown in fig 1 the model used was elm rbf ann due to the computational advantages of elm and the accuracy of rbf for sufficiently big dataset in the coagulation prior to deploying the algorithm the relevant input parameters such as a historical alum dosage and raw water rw turbidity were excluded from the pool of the considered variables to negate any systemic bias during the training process selection of alum t 1 alum t 2 alum t 3 tw turbidity t 1 tw turbidity t 2 tw turbidity t 3 tw color t 1 tw color t 2 and tw color t 3 using the global exhaustive search algorithm was attempted and found that the difference between the prediction accuracy of the developed model was insignificant therefore al t 1 which refers to the historical value of the alum dosage used an hour before time t was used for the model development data were analyzed using the normal distribution curve and dimensionality reduction was executed by the principal component analysis the reduced variables were standardized using eq 1 1 x x μ σ where x variable μ mean σ standard deviation eq 2 was employed to generate the normal distribution curve if one significant principal component sufficiently represented the input variable space 24 2 f x 1 2 π σ 2 e x μ 2 2 σ 2 eq 3 was employed if the number of principal components sufficiently represented the input variable space exceeded one 24 3 f x 1 2 π p 0 5 e x μ 1 x μ 2 where x variable μ mean covariance matrix p number of variables data from coagulation process under a nonlinear system are highly non gaussian such as presented in fig 2 the data enclosed by the red circle were further analyzed to identify errors validity beyond the range of the majority this analysis was carried out as follows i visual inspection of data vectors ii visualizing the variation of selected raw water parameters and alum dosage to see if they varied proportionately by plotting graphs iii finding a common factor that might cause the division of data for example water quality data could be categorized to low turbidity and high turbidity data the distribution of low and high turbidity would be plotted to see if they corresponded to the data located in the bell curve and the tail if they did then it would support the hypothesis and two sets of models would be developed for the two divisions of data if they did not other factors that might cause the division would be explored and investigated iv re standardizing the data in the tail of the normal distribution shown in fig 2 and plotting a normal distribution curve to identify other anomalies 2 2 data division data was divided for training and testing data division was carried out by dividing the normal distribution curve generated in section 2 1 into vertical sections of width 0 15 and continuously distributing two thirds of each section for training and one third for testing the number of data points in each data set is given under results and discussion section the training data set was used to estimate model weights of elm rbf in predicting the coagulant dosage the testing data set was used for testing the generalization ability of the coagulant dosage model 2 3 model development the mathematical model of a rbf is given by eq 4 4 i 1 n β i φ i x t j where φ i x e x p x μ i 2 σ i μ i ith radial basis center σ i ith smoothing parameter if all n training vectors are used as rbf kernels eq 4 could be represented by the matrix form given by eq

the solution was performed by using eq 6 6 h β t m i n h β t eq 7 was used to solve eq 6 7 β ˆ h t h moore penrose inverse a step by step algorithm used for the development of elm rbf is given as follows 1 record cpu time 2 set parameters number of hidden neurons number of variables and generate random input weights and biases 3 generate the hessian matrix according to eq 5 4 calculate the output weight matrix according to eq 7 5 simulate training data 6 calculate mean squared error and correlation coefficient 7 if performance is not satisfactory return to step 2 else record cpu time and calculate total time the only parameter that requires optimization is the number of radial basis center for the radial basis layer which was carried out by means of iteration starting from the initial number of radial basis center of 10 the effect of increasing the number of radial basis centers on the training and test mean squared errors mse were analyzed from a plot of mse versus number of radial basis centers improving the training performance was observed at increasing number of radial basis center neurons but at the expense of decreasing testing performance this shall be discussed in a greater detail in the results and discussion section 2 4 performance measurement model performance was measured using the correlation coefficient cc or r and the mean squared error mse the formulas for r and mse are given by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 r n y i a c t u a l y i e s t m a t e d y i a c t u a l y i e s t m a t e d n y i a c t u a l 2 y i a c t u a l n y i e s t m a t e d 2 y

water from segama water treatment facility 25 for the development of the elm rbf model in this work is given in table 1 the total data set consisted of 8263 data points excluding incomplete data vectors tds mentioned in the table refers to total dissolved solids the left side of the table consists of water qualities of the untreated raw water the right side of the table consists of water qualities of the treated water the table shows that the raw water turbidity in particular fluctuates between 11 and 3405 ntu which is considered to be considerably large the high turbidity value in the raw water ntu 3405 caused the treated water quality ntu 5 24 to increase beyond the drinkable standard of 4 0 established by the world health organization 26 the large deviation was presumably due to the variety of rainfall following the seasonal changes in the location these factors also presumably affect the color changes in the raw water supply 3 1 selection of input parameters results of the global search algorithm illustrated in fig 1 are shown in table 2 the most efficient model is expected to be the least complex with the highest prediction accuracy the accuracy is gauged by the highest correlation coefficient cc of 1 and smallest mean squared error mse least complexity in the context of selecting input variables would mean a minimal number of variables or factors therefore the minimum combination of the three factors i e rw turbidity rw color alum t 1 was selected for predicting the coagulant dosage there was no treated water variable in the chosen combination therefore the coagulant dosage was determined proactively to improve the efficiency of the model further although ph value is considered an important factor affecting the coagulation 18 it was excluded from the current work because the charge neutralization was reportedly dominant only for ph of less than 6 5 12 the ph of the raw water turbidity of the current work of higher 6 6 suggests that ph factor is insignificant 3 2 data analysis results of principal component analysis to minimize the number of input variables are tabulated in table 3 the variables considered significant in the study are reduced to rw color rw turbidity and alum t 1 the first principal component that sufficiently represents the input variable space as the cumulative variance exceeded 80 29 30 the variable space was condensed into one dimension using the coefficient of the first principal component eq 2 was then used to plot the normal distribution curve the plot obtained is depicted in fig 3 data vectors between 2 and 2 were considered as set a data vectors greater than 2 were considered as set b the maximum and minimum values of each variable in each data set a and b are tabulated in table 4 in the normalized form it is evident from the table that set b consists of high turbidity and high color values therefore it is logical to assume that the treatment of water qualities represented by set b would require higher alum dosage a test was needed to ensure that dataset b contained no outliers despite the notion that they might appear to be so the validity and usefulness of dataset b for model development could be verified by observing the response of alum dosage to raw water turbidity the response of alum dosage to rw turbidity as seen from fig 4 gives evidence that there was no fault in sensors or errors during the operation that might have resulted in the occurrence of outliers the figure suggests that set b requires higher alum dosages owing to high turbidity in the raw water supply thus the set b data cannot be treated as outliers the values of alum dosages and rw turbidity shown in the vertical axis of the figure are normalized the horizontal axis essentially refers to the indices of data points collected since the beginning of the year fig 5 demonstrates rw turbidity values of set a and b with respect to the timeline rw turbidity values of set b are seen to be concentrated between 0 2 and 1 whereas rw turbidity values of set a are observed between 0 and 0 2 therefore the division of set a and b based on low and high turbidity values is valid and justified fig 6 shows the distribution of rw color from set a and b to identify any reasonable difference in the data divide the distribution of data in set b appears to be constricted within the 0 0 2 rw color boundary defined by the majority of set a low turbidity data throughout the timeline therefore no apparent division of set a and b based on rw color could be made fig 7 demonstrates alum dosages of data in set a and b alum dosage values of set a are concentrated between 0 and 0 3 whereas alum dosage values of set b are concentrated between 0 3 and 1 the distribution pattern of set a and b shown for alum dosage is almost similar to that of rw turbidity discussed earlier likewise it can be concluded that the division of set a and b based on low and high alum dosage values are valid and justified these graphs demonstrate that turbidity and coagulant dosage are a significant factor and response respectively for the segama water treatment facility if separate models based on the two data sets were developed it would be advisable to perform the classification using raw water variables set a would be referred to as low turbidity data whereas set b would be referred to as high turbidity data high turbidity data were analyzed further to identify for other anomalies the dimensionally reduced high turbidity data were then normalized and a normal distribution curve was plotted using eq 3 the resulting normal distribution curve is shown in fig 8 the data points less than 1 were taken as high turbidity data and values greater than 1 were omitted from the model development majority of the data vectors omitted consisted of extremely high turbidity data that were close to the upper limit in summary the data analysis resulted in the following data sets 1 low turbidity data 7947 data points 2 high turbidity data 275 data points 3 extremely high turbidity data 41 data points the first two data sets were utilized for the model development 3 3 development of neural network models to predict optimum coagulant dosage 3 3 1 low turbidity model the low turbidity data set consisted of 7947 data points development of an elm rbf model did not require a validation data set therefore data was divided into training and test data sets only the training data set consisted of 74 of the low turbidity data set 5881 the test data set consisted of 26 of the low turbidity data set 2066 the mean and standard deviation of each data set is given in table 5 the mean and standard deviation of all input parameters of each data set are similar to one another therefore the training and test data sets could be used to represent the total low turbidity data 31 the elm rbf model consisted of 20 hidden neurons radial basis function radbas e x 2 was used for the kernel performance of the developed model based on the mean squared error and correlation coefficient to predict coagulant dosage for low turbidity data is given in table 6 both of the training and testing performances demonstrate good predictability with correlation coefficient exceeding 0 97 therefore the models are suited for predicting coagulant dosage for the given data range the regression plot of the actual coagulant dosage versus predicted coagulant dosage of the test data set is depicted in fig 9 the figure demonstrates that the data points are in line with and closely clustered around the y x line at the coagulant dosage of lower than 70 mg l the vertical distribution of predicted coagulant dosages with respect to the actual coagulant dosages observed in the figure suggests that the plant operators continued to utilize the same coagulant dosage for a period of time despite the changes in raw water parameters it is also likely that the plant operators used set values of coagulant dosage for perceived levels of rw turbidity therefore the actual coagulant dosage cannot be referred to as optimum values for coagulant dosage it could be noted that the coagulant dosage over 70 mg l are not in line with the y x line which could be due to an inefficiency caused by the use of a linear technique for segregating the data into low and high turbidity data i e the normal distribution curve despite of the simplicity of the technique the linear and subjective nature of this data segregation technique may have caused some of the high turbidity data that cannot be predicted by a model trained by the low turbidity data set to be included in the test data set of the low turbidity data set the high values of alum dosage which generally correspond to high values of turbidity 38 as depicted by fig 9 support this hypothesis 3 3 2 high turbidity model high turbidity data set consisted of 275 data points maximum and minimum values of input parameters are given in table 7 similar to the low turbidity data model the development of an elm rbf model did not require a validation dataset therefore data was divided into training and testing data sets the training data set consisted of 69 189 data points of the high turbidity data set the test data consisted of 21 of high turbidity data 86 data points statistical properties of the data sets are given by table 8 the table shows that the mean and standard deviation of all input parameters of each data set are reasonably similar to one another therefore training and testing data sets could be used to represent the high turbidity data set the performance of the model developed for high turbidity data is given in table 9 both of the training and testing performances show low predictability of the model with correlation coefficient of less than 0 80 therefore the models are not suited for predicting coagulant dosage for the given data range the regression plot of the actual coagulant dosage versus predicted coagulant dosage of the test data set is depicted in fig 10 the lack of fit for the predicted data to the y x line is apparent from the figure which confirms the results of table 9 thus the performance prediction of high turbidity models was lower than that demonstrated by the low turbidity model the effect of changing the number of radial basis centers of the high turbidity model is illustrated in fig 11 the figure suggests that the test mean squared error increases almost exponentially with increasing number of the radial basis center while the training performance improves gradually therefore increasing the number of radial basis centers over fitted the training data and deteriorated the test performance efforts to vary the smoothing parameters or the input weights did not improve the model performance correlation coefficient therefore input parameters were re selected for high turbidity data by following the algorithm shown in fig 1 the performances of the model developed using re selected input parameters are tabulated in table 10 the model consisting of four variables demonstrates the lowest mse and highest r values the additional input variable to the inputs of the low turbidity model is rw alkalinity alkalinity refers to the concentration of ions available in water rw alkalinity reportedly promoted the naturally occurring nucleating agents that could stimulate the coagulation 3 ions already present in water such as ca2 could act as nucleating agents to facilitate the coagulation process 27 the high turbidity model developed with four input parameters rw turbidity rw color rw alkalinity and alum dosage t 1 was observed to perform the best with 35 radial basis centers and larger values for smoothing parameters the expression rand n 1 2 was used in matlab for generating values for smoothing parameters 28 the performance of the neural network model developed for estimating coagulant dosage for high turbidity water is given in table 11 the newly developed model demonstrated improved performance with r value greater than 0 8 however the network is prone to over fitting as seen in fig 11 an attempt to increase the training performance such as by increasing the number of neurons input parameters only exacerbated the model s generalization ability the regression plot of test data after the model s improvement is depicted in fig 12 the distribution of the data is better approximated along the y x line and less dispersed than the three factor model depicted earlier in fig 10 therefore the performance of the current model is acceptable thus it is evident that predictability of the coagulant dosages for high turbidity water is highly reliant on the selection of suitable input parameters input parameters selected for the total data set is highly influenced by the sub set that constitutes the majority i e the low turbidity data set use of the inputs suitable for the low turbidity model for the total data set not only decreases the predictability of high turbidity of the model but also deteriorates the predictability of low turbidity values 19 4 conclusion extreme learning machine coupled with radial basis function neural networks were employed to model the coagulation process neural network is one of the most advanced optimization techniques that can describe a complex phenomenon in chemical engineering processes 32 35 however proper selection of input parameters is extremely important in this work the coagulation data were divided into two categories based on low and high turbidity water the optimum number of input parameters for modeling coagulation of low turbidity water was 3 namely rw color rw turbidity and al t 1 the use of the same set of input parameters was ineffective for modeling coagulation of high turbidity water re selection of the number of input parameters showed that rw alkalinity was a significant factor in improving the high turbidity model performance the low turbidity model was capable of predicting coagulant dosage with correlation coefficient exceeding 0 97 the high turbidity model predicted the data with a reasonable correlation coefficient of 0 8721 after the re selection process although the correlation coefficient of the high turbidity model is lower than that of the low turbidity model in the present work the former demonstrates its prediction superiority over the previously reported correlation coefficient of 0 8374 36 and 0 7839 37 which employed anfis and elman network respectively acknowledgement the cooperation of sabah water supply department and ldws for supplying segama

the developed model was insignificant therefore al t 1 which refers to the historical value of the alum dosage used an hour before time t was used for the model development data were analyzed using the normal distribution curve and dimensionality reduction was executed by the principal component analysis the reduced variables were standardized using eq 1 1 x x μ σ where x variable μ mean σ standard deviation eq 2 was employed to generate the normal distribution curve if one significant principal component sufficiently represented the input variable space 24 2 f x 1 2 π σ 2 e x μ 2 2 σ 2 eq 3 was employed if the number of principal components sufficiently represented the input variable space exceeded one 24 3 f x 1 2 π p 0 5 e x μ 1 x μ 2 where x variable μ mean covariance matrix p number of variables data from coagulation process under a nonlinear system are highly non gaussian such as presented in fig 2 the data enclosed by the red circle were further analyzed to identify errors validity beyond the range of the majority this analysis was carried out as follows i visual inspection of data vectors ii visualizing the variation of selected raw water parameters and alum dosage to see if they varied proportionately by plotting graphs iii finding a common factor that might cause the division of data for example water quality data could be categorized to low turbidity and high turbidity data the distribution of low and high turbidity would be plotted to see if they corresponded to the data located in the bell curve and the tail if they did then it would support the hypothesis and two sets of models would be developed for the two divisions of data if they did not other factors that might cause the division would be explored and investigated iv re standardizing the data in the tail of the normal distribution shown in fig 2 and plotting a normal distribution curve to identify other anomalies 2 2 data division data was divided for training and testing data division was carried out by dividing the normal distribution curve generated in section 2 1 into vertical sections of width 0 15 and continuously distributing two thirds of each section for training and one third for testing the number of data points in each data set is given under results and discussion section the training data set was used to estimate model weights of elm rbf in predicting the coagulant dosage the testing data set was used for testing the generalization ability of the coagulant dosage model 2 3 model development the mathematical model of a rbf is given by eq 4 4 i 1 n β i φ i x t j where φ i x e x p x μ i 2 σ i μ i ith radial basis center σ i ith smoothing parameter if all n training vectors are used as rbf kernels eq 4 could be represented by the matrix form given by eq

the solution was performed by using eq 6 6 h β t m i n h β t eq 7 was used to solve eq 6 7 β ˆ h t h moore penrose inverse a step by step algorithm used for the development of elm rbf is given as follows 1 record cpu time 2 set parameters number of hidden neurons number of variables and generate random input weights and biases 3 generate the hessian matrix according to eq 5 4 calculate the output weight matrix according to eq 7 5 simulate training data 6 calculate mean squared error and correlation coefficient 7 if performance is not satisfactory return to step 2 else record cpu time and calculate total time the only parameter that requires optimization is the number of radial basis center for the radial basis layer which was carried out by means of iteration starting from the initial number of radial basis center of 10 the effect of increasing the number of radial basis centers on the training and test mean squared errors mse were analyzed from a plot of mse versus number of radial basis centers improving the training performance was observed at increasing number of radial basis center neurons but at the expense of decreasing testing performance this shall be discussed in a greater detail in the results and discussion section 2 4 performance measurement model performance was measured using the correlation coefficient cc or r and the mean squared error mse the formulas for r and mse are given by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 r n y i a c t u a l y i e s t m a t e d y i a c t u a l y i e s t m a t e d n y i a c t u a l 2 y i a c t u a l n y i e s t m a t e d 2 y

water from segama water treatment facility 25 for the development of the elm rbf model in this work is given in table 1 the total data set consisted of 8263 data points excluding incomplete data vectors tds mentioned in the table refers to total dissolved solids the left side of the table consists of water qualities of the untreated raw water the right side of the table consists of water qualities of the treated water the table shows that the raw water turbidity in particular fluctuates between 11 and 3405 ntu which is considered to be considerably large the high turbidity value in the raw water ntu 3405 caused the treated water quality ntu 5 24 to increase beyond the drinkable standard of 4 0 established by the world health organization 26 the large deviation was presumably due to the variety of rainfall following the seasonal changes in the location these factors also presumably affect the color changes in the raw water supply 3 1 selection of input parameters results of the global search algorithm illustrated in fig 1 are shown in table 2 the most efficient model is expected to be the least complex with the highest prediction accuracy the accuracy is gauged by the highest correlation coefficient cc of 1 and smallest mean squared error mse least complexity in the context of selecting input variables would mean a minimal number of variables or factors therefore the minimum combination of the three factors i e rw turbidity rw color alum t 1 was selected for predicting the coagulant dosage there was no treated water variable in the chosen combination therefore the coagulant dosage was determined proactively to improve the efficiency of the model further although ph value is considered an important factor affecting the coagulation 18 it was excluded from the current work because the charge neutralization was reportedly dominant only for ph of less than 6 5 12 the ph of the raw water turbidity of the current work of higher 6 6 suggests that ph factor is insignificant 3 2 data analysis results of principal component analysis to minimize the number of input variables are tabulated in table 3 the variables considered significant in the study are reduced to rw color rw turbidity and alum t 1 the first principal component that sufficiently represents the input variable space as the cumulative variance exceeded 80 29 30 the variable space was condensed into one dimension using the coefficient of the first principal component eq 2 was then used to plot the normal distribution curve the plot obtained is depicted in fig 3 data vectors between 2 and 2 were considered as set a data vectors greater than 2 were considered as set b the maximum and minimum values of each variable in each data set a and b are tabulated in table 4 in the normalized form it is evident from the table that set b consists of high turbidity and high color values therefore it is logical to assume that the treatment of water qualities represented by set b would require higher alum dosage a test was needed to ensure that dataset b contained no outliers despite the notion that they might appear to be so the validity and usefulness of dataset b for model development could be verified by observing the response of alum dosage to raw water turbidity the response of alum dosage to rw turbidity as seen from fig 4 gives evidence that there was no fault in sensors or errors during the operation that might have resulted in the occurrence of outliers the figure suggests that set b requires higher alum dosages owing to high turbidity in the raw water supply thus the set b data cannot be treated as outliers the values of alum dosages and rw turbidity shown in the vertical axis of the figure are normalized the horizontal axis essentially refers to the indices of data points collected since the beginning of the year fig 5 demonstrates rw turbidity values of set a and b with respect to the timeline rw turbidity values of set b are seen to be concentrated between 0 2 and 1 whereas rw turbidity values of set a are observed between 0 and 0 2 therefore the division of set a and b based on low and high turbidity values is valid and justified fig 6 shows the distribution of rw color from set a and b to identify any reasonable difference in the data divide the distribution of data in set b appears to be constricted within the 0 0 2 rw color boundary defined by the majority of set a low turbidity data throughout the timeline therefore no apparent division of set a and b based on rw color could be made fig 7 demonstrates alum dosages of data in set a and b alum dosage values of set a are concentrated between 0 and 0 3 whereas alum dosage values of set b are concentrated between 0 3 and 1 the distribution pattern of set a and b shown for alum dosage is almost similar to that of rw turbidity discussed earlier likewise it can be concluded that the division of set a and b based on low and high alum dosage values are valid and justified these graphs demonstrate that turbidity and coagulant dosage are a significant factor and response respectively for the segama water treatment facility if separate models based on the two data sets were developed it would be advisable to perform the classification using raw water variables set a would be referred to as low turbidity data whereas set b would be referred to as high turbidity data high turbidity data were analyzed further to identify for other anomalies the dimensionally reduced high turbidity data were then normalized and a normal distribution curve was plotted using eq 3 the resulting normal distribution curve is shown in fig 8 the data points less than 1 were taken as high turbidity data and values greater than 1 were omitted from the model development majority of the data vectors omitted consisted of extremely high turbidity data that were close to the upper limit in summary the data analysis resulted in the following data sets 1 low turbidity data 7947 data points 2 high turbidity data 275 data points 3 extremely high turbidity data 41 data points the first two data sets were utilized for the model development 3 3 development of neural network models to predict optimum coagulant dosage 3 3 1 low turbidity model the low turbidity data set consisted of 7947 data points development of an elm rbf model did not require a validation data set therefore data was divided into training and test data sets only the training data set consisted of 74 of the low turbidity data set 5881 the test data set consisted of 26 of the low turbidity data set 2066 the mean and standard deviation of each data set is given in table 5 the mean and standard deviation of all input parameters of each data set are similar to one another therefore the training and test data sets could be used to represent the total low turbidity data 31 the elm rbf model consisted of 20 hidden neurons radial basis function radbas e x 2 was used for the kernel performance of the developed model based on the mean squared error and correlation coefficient to predict coagulant dosage for low turbidity data is given in table 6 both of the training and testing performances demonstrate good predictability with correlation coefficient exceeding 0 97 therefore the models are suited for predicting coagulant dosage for the given data range the regression plot of the actual coagulant dosage versus predicted coagulant dosage of the test data set is depicted in fig 9 the figure demonstrates that the data points are in line with and closely clustered around the y x line at the coagulant dosage of lower than 70 mg l the vertical distribution of predicted coagulant dosages with respect to the actual coagulant dosages observed in the figure suggests that the plant operators continued to utilize the same coagulant dosage for a period of time despite the changes in raw water parameters it is also likely that the plant operators used set values of coagulant dosage for perceived levels of rw turbidity therefore the actual coagulant dosage cannot be referred to as optimum values for coagulant dosage it could be noted that the coagulant dosage over 70 mg l are not in line with the y x line which could be due to an inefficiency caused by the use of a linear technique for segregating the data into low and high turbidity data i e the normal distribution curve despite of the simplicity of the technique the linear and subjective nature of this data segregation technique may have caused some of the high turbidity data that cannot be predicted by a model trained by the low turbidity data set to be included in the test data set of the low turbidity data set the high values of alum dosage which generally correspond to high values of turbidity 38 as depicted by fig 9 support this hypothesis 3 3 2 high turbidity model high turbidity data set consisted of 275 data points maximum and minimum values of input parameters are given in table 7 similar to the low turbidity data model the development of an elm rbf model did not require a validation dataset therefore data was divided into training and testing data sets the training data set consisted of 69 189 data points of the high turbidity data set the test data consisted of 21 of high turbidity data 86 data points statistical properties of the data sets are given by table 8 the table shows that the mean and standard deviation of all input parameters of each data set are reasonably similar to one another therefore training and testing data sets could be used to represent the high turbidity data set the performance of the model developed for high turbidity data is given in table 9 both of the training and testing performances show low predictability of the model with correlation coefficient of less than 0 80 therefore the models are not suited for predicting coagulant dosage for the given data range the regression plot of the actual coagulant dosage versus predicted coagulant dosage of the test data set is depicted in fig 10 the lack of fit for the predicted data to the y x line is apparent from the figure which confirms the results of table 9 thus the performance prediction of high turbidity models was lower than that demonstrated by the low turbidity model the effect of changing the number of radial basis centers of the high turbidity model is illustrated in fig 11 the figure suggests that the test mean squared error increases almost exponentially with increasing number of the radial basis center while the training performance improves gradually therefore increasing the number of radial basis centers over fitted the training data and deteriorated the test performance efforts to vary the smoothing parameters or the input weights did not improve the model performance correlation coefficient therefore input parameters were re selected for high turbidity data by following the algorithm shown in fig 1 the performances of the model developed using re selected input parameters are tabulated in table 10 the model consisting of four variables demonstrates the lowest mse and highest r values the additional input variable to the inputs of the low turbidity model is rw alkalinity alkalinity refers to the concentration of ions available in water rw alkalinity reportedly promoted the naturally occurring nucleating agents that could stimulate the coagulation 3 ions already present in water such as ca2 could act as nucleating agents to facilitate the coagulation process 27 the high turbidity model developed with four input parameters rw turbidity rw color rw alkalinity and alum dosage t 1 was observed to perform the best with 35 radial basis centers and larger values for smoothing parameters the expression rand n 1 2 was used in matlab for generating values for smoothing parameters 28 the performance of the neural network model developed for estimating coagulant dosage for high turbidity water is given in table 11 the newly developed model demonstrated improved performance with r value greater than 0 8 however the network is prone to over fitting as seen in fig 11 an attempt to increase the training performance such as by increasing the number of neurons input parameters only exacerbated the model s generalization ability the regression plot of test data after the model s improvement is depicted in fig 12 the distribution of the data is better approximated along the y x line and less dispersed than the three factor model depicted earlier in fig 10 therefore the performance of the current model is acceptable thus it is evident that predictability of the coagulant dosages for high turbidity water is highly reliant on the selection of suitable input parameters input parameters selected for the total data set is highly influenced by the sub set that constitutes the majority i e the low turbidity data set use of the inputs suitable for the low turbidity model for the total data set not only decreases the predictability of high turbidity of the model but also deteriorates the predictability of low turbidity values 19 4 conclusion extreme learning machine coupled with radial basis function neural networks were employed to model the coagulation process neural network is one of the most advanced optimization techniques that can describe a complex phenomenon in chemical engineering processes 32 35 however proper selection of input parameters is extremely important in this work the coagulation data were divided into two categories based on low and high turbidity water the optimum number of input parameters for modeling coagulation of low turbidity water was 3 namely rw color rw turbidity and al t 1 the use of the same set of input parameters was ineffective for modeling coagulation of high turbidity water re selection of the number of input parameters showed that rw alkalinity was a significant factor in improving the high turbidity model performance the low turbidity model was capable of predicting coagulant dosage with correlation coefficient exceeding 0 97 the high turbidity model predicted the data with a reasonable correlation coefficient of 0 8721 after the re selection process although the correlation coefficient of the high turbidity model is lower than that of the low turbidity model in the present work the former demonstrates its prediction superiority over the previously reported correlation coefficient of 0 8374 36 and 0 7839 37 which employed anfis and elman network respectively acknowledgement the cooperation of sabah water supply department and ldws for supplying segama

the total organic carbon toc measurements showed 87 3 mineralization of 15 mg l 1 drug at 7 h the gas chromatography gc linked to a mass spectrometry ms was used to recognize the generated intermediates through the nalidixic acid degradation keywords electro fenton emerging pollutants three dimensional graphene advanced oxidation processes nalidixic acid 1 introduction the role of bioactive chemical pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in the environment has received increasing attention in the last two decades 1 the accumulation of these pollutants in aquatic environments has been contemplated as an important public health challenge 2 to keep away from the hazardous environmental accumulation of the pharmaceuticals it is necessary to expand powerful treatment processes to remove such emerging organic pollutants different treatment methods have been recently studied and developed to remove organic contaminants from aqueous solutions 3 7 however advanced oxidation processes aops as strong green and environmentally friendly methods have been noticed 8 aops are based on an extremely reactive non selective species such as hydroxyl radicals oh that oxidize organic pollutants 9 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are very attractive among aops for wastewater decontamination because of their ability to remove persistent organic pollutants pops even in low concentrations 10 in these methods h2o2 is regularly provided to an acidic solution by the o2 gas reduction of normally at cathodes such as carbon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe o2 diffusion 11

fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the cathodes fabricated by carbon based materials have been broadly utilized to the electrogeneration of h2o2 because of non toxicity great h2 evolution overpotential low catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition high stability conductivity and chemical resistance of them 8 several carbonaceous cathodes such as gas diffusion electrode gde 16 17 graphite felt 18 carbon felt 19 graphene 20 activated carbon fiber 21 carbon sponge 22 and c60 carbon nanotubes composite 12 have been studied for h2o2 electrogeneration three dimensional graphene 3dg aerogel is a novel encouraging

naftiridine 3 carboxylic acid is a pharmaceutical antibacterial agent used as an antibacterial agent to manage chicken infection and improve the productivity of fish farming by enhancing water quality and preventing infection 25 27 the presence of nalidixic acid has been reported in environmental waters wastewater treatment plants effluents hospital effluents and soils 28 30 so the concerns about its environmental and human health effects have increased at low concentrations it acts as bacteriostatic and inhibits bacterial growth while it exhibits bacterial effects at high concentrations 31 extensive manufacture of pharmaceutical by plants big quantities of elapsed drugs unchanged pharmaceutical products excretion by animals their metabolites and human cause to occurrence of drugs in the aquatic environment 32 34 thus existence of these compounds has serious effects on human and animal health 35 literatures study shows that various methods for removing nalidixic acid from aqueous solutions were used including an embedded mbr ozonation scheme 36 powdered activated carbon 37 adsorption onto anion exchange and neutral polymers 38 and uv and uv h2o2 processes 39 but the previous studies have not still considered the toxicity evolvement of the aqueous solutions of nalidixic acid during the time of electrolysis in fact it is worth emphasizing that treating poisonous organic contaminants aquatic solutions through sophisticated oxidation procedures is not needfully followed through a reduction in toxicity as the oxidation reaction could create intermediates more dangerous than the original contaminant thus nalidixic acid degradation by the electro fenton method via nanostructured 3dg modified electrode as the cathode was investigated at the second part of our work gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis was used to investigation of degradation intermediates response surface methodology rsm has been also used to investigation the influence of operational

experimental design in this research as the most common one in rsm the central composite design ccd with five levels was used to the optimization of the electro fenton method so as to investigate the

characterization of the synthesized 3dg fig 1 a shows fesem image of synthesized 3dg as can be seen in this figure an interconnected porous network has been created in the 3dg structure the creation of this network can be related to ignition and reaction of the glycine with oxidants such as oxygen or carboxyl hydroxyl groups on the go surface after the combustion this lead to generation of a lot of bubbles composed of n2 co2 and h2o in the go suspension and between go sheets so the formed pores have random sizes and the product has a foam like structure with many pores and expanded volume in comparison to the go 41 the xrd patterns of graphene oxide and the synthesized 3d structured graphene have been shown in fig 1b as indicated in this figure a sharp peak at 2θ near 10 was observed for the go 41 46 furthermore disappearance of go diffraction peak 2θ 10 and appearance a new broad diffraction peak at 2θ 25 can be related to the exfoliation of the multilayer go after the combustion and the conversion to graphene 2d sheets with removal of surface functional groups 41 47 fig 1c presents the as prepared 3d graphene ftir spectrum this figure shows characteristic oh at 3400 cm 1 that is related to the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the synthesized 3dg the characteristic peaks due to cc 1620 cm 1 and carbonyl 1730 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 also appeared in the ftir spectrum of the 3dg which indicates continues range of original graphene structure in some ranges to assess the variation in the specific surface area of the synthesized go and 3dg the bet analysis was carried out 3dg structure displayed a higher surface area 132 m2 g 1 than that of go 23 5 m2 g 1 therefore the prepared 3dg with a large specific surface area is an advantage for creating electrode materials in the electrochemical systems 3 2 modified gde cathode characterization 3 2 1 physical properties characterization fig 2 a d represents the carbon paper s fesem images before fig 2a and after bonding of go ptfe fig 2b and 3dg ptfe fig 2c and d layer on it as can be seen in fesem images the surface of the electrode modified with 3dg fig 2c and d was much uneven than that of the go fig 2b such a porous 3dg ptfe electrode surface could enable rapid o2 diffusion to achieve high mass transfer rate and highly efficient h2o2 production fig 3 a and b represent the morphology results 3d graphs of go ptfe and 3dg ptfe electrodes were verified by afm analysis it can be seen in the images that the roughness over the prepared electrode with 3dg compared to go was induced for better comparisons table 3 shows surface roughness parameters including root mean square sq roughness average sa and peak valley height sy it obviously display that 3dg ptfe has more active sites for generation of h2o2 than go ptfe and modifying with 3dg led to an increase in the average roughness these results are coherent with the results of the fesem images fig 2b d 3 2 2 electrochemical behavior of modified electrodes the cv measurements were registered on the bare carbon paper before modification go ptfe and 3dg ptfe electrodes in the aqueous solution of 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 at ph 3 5 saturated by o2 with scan rate of 10 mv s 1 fig 4 a pt sheet was used as the anode and the saturated calomel electrode sce was performed as the reference electrode the cathodic peaks corresponding to the reduction of oxygen and generation of h2o2 in the potential ranges of 0 3 to 0 5 v vs sce well defined in the both of the two electrodes go and 3dg 20 as can be seen in this figure the bare gde bare carbon paper displayed very poor oxygen reduction activity on the other hand the onset potential for go graphene carbon paper and 3dg 3dg carbon paper were observed around 0 30 v vs sce it could be seen that under the same condition greater peak current density is seen in 3dg modified electrode s cv curve for the purpose of determining the amount of h2o2 produced by the bare gde and 3dg ptfe electrodes electrolysis was executed at a steady current of 300 ma with 250 ml solution a pt sheet area of 1 0 cm2 was used as anode in this electrolysis fig 5 shows the results on the bare gde and 3dg gde for the generation of h2o2 as it can be viewed in this figure the concentration of h2o2 obtained via bare gde and 3dg ptfe electrodes was 10 and 40 mmol l 1 respectively at the end of 180 min electrolysis the amount of h2o2 obtained with 3dg ptfe electrode was almost four times greater than that of bare gde electrode the 3dg ptfe cathode used in this work showed higher h2o2 generation rate 28 19 mg h 1 cm 2 compared with the other literatures table 4 it can be concluded that 3dg could be a useful cathode material for h2o2 electrogeneration according to these outcomes 3 3 central composite design model response surface modeling of the process was done by a five level ccd with sixteen factorial point eight axial point and seven replications resulting in a total of 31 experiments table 5 presents the resulting ccd matrix with 4 factor and experimental outcomes the polynomial response equation of the second order eq 5 was used to correlate the dependent and autonomous variables the graph for the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadratic model and model terms is shown in fig 6 quadratic model and model terms applied current ph initial nalidixic acid concentration and ph ph are significant fig 6 based on these outcomes the following second order polynomial equation developed between the response and independent variables subjected to 2 xi 2 6 y 75 1178 4 3227 x 1 7 3774 x 2 7 5009 x 3 3 0178 x 4 0 1657 x 1 x 2 1 5128 x 1 x 3 2 8461 x 1 x 4 1 9379 x 2 x 3 0 1657 x 2 x 4 1 4163 x 3 x 4 0 4072 x 1 2 8 3696 x 2 2 1 2072 x 3 2 0 5515 x 4 2 the forecasted degradation efficiencies de by eq 6 have been shown in table 5 these findings suggested excellent degradation effectiveness contracts between the experimental and forecasted amounts the correlation between the experimental information and the expected reactions was assessed quantitatively by the correlation coefficient r2 a comparison between the experimental results and the forecasted values obtained from the model eq 6 discovered that the expected values corresponded fairly well with r2 0 896 to the experimental values this implies that the independent variables explain 89 6 percent of the differences for color removal and does not describe just about 10 4 percent of the variation adjusted r2 adj r2 is more acceptable for comparing models with dissimilar numbers of independent variables it is also an evaluation of goodness of a fit adj r2 improves r2 value by using the degrees of liberty on its computations for the sample size and amount of phrases in the model it can be smaller than r2 if there are many phrases in a model and the sample size is not very large 48 49 here adj r2 value 0 804 and the corresponding r2 value are too close table 6 an appropriate fit of the model has to be acquired to guarantee the acceptability of the model used in optimizing a response surface from a statistical point of view the evaluation of the acceptability of the model requires three tests the fisher test the student s t test and r square test the variance test of fisher known as the f test used to test the reliability of the forecasted model if the experimental outcomes well predicted by the model f value for a certain amount of degrees of liberty in the model at a meaning level of α has to be higher than the critical value of f distribution table 6 shows the outcomes of the anticipated quadratic response surface model for the electro fenton method in the form of analysis of variance anova of the regression parameters the resulted f value 84 94 at the confidence level of 95 is clearly higher than the f critical value 2 352 at the significance level of 95 it means that the quadratic model forecast was statistically significant and the regression equation can explain most of the variations in the response as the anova results present the predicted model showed a great value of determination coefficient r2 0 896 and adj r2 0 804 every time you add a variable to a model the r2 value increases but the adj r2 increases only if the new term improves the model so the adj r2 that takes the number of variables into account is commonly selected 50 52 the relatively high r squared value 0 896 displays good accordance between the calculated and experimental results the model s proportionality also is assessed by the residuals the difference between expected and experimental amounts the observed residuals plotted against expected values are shown in fig 7 all points on the normal probability plot have to be approximately on a straight line if the residuals have a normal distribution therefore it could be concluded that the estimated effects are the real and differ from noise 50 fig 7 shows a normal distribution and randomly scattering of the residuals the pareto analysis provides further meaningful data for interpreting the outcomes in fact according to the following relationship the percentage impact of each factor was calculated by this assessment 53 54 7 p i b i 2 b i 2 100 i 0 it can be seen in the pareto graphic analysis fig 8 among the varying factors ph ph b22 30 90 applied current b3 24 82 ph b2 24 01 and initial nalidixic acid concentration b1 8 24 have the major impact on degradation efficiency 3 4 variables effects as response plots geometric depictions significantly enhance the interpretation of the scheme with various inputs and outputs and in particular by using the contour and surface plots contour plots averse to pairs of significant explanatory variables demonstrate in what way these two factors are related to the reaction variable at a moment 3d plots of the response surface also display the side response surface fig 9 created the surface and contour plots on the basis of applied current and electrolysis time whilst the initial ph and concentration of the nalidixic acid were held constant at 6 and 30 mol l 1 respectively the applied current is one of the effective variables in electrochemical process the rate of electrochemical reactions and the performance of electrodes is highly dependent on applied current 8 as could be viewed in fig 9 increasing the applied current until about 500 ma causes to increase degradation efficiency this degradation efficiency enhancing can be related to a greater generation of h2o2 with reaction 1 it should be noted that a further rise in the applied current led to a slight improvement in degradation efficiency the utilization of higher currents not only increases energy loss but also enhances h2o electrolysis and produces oxygen instead of hydroxyl radical 9 hence the electro generation of oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radical increases when of course current rises by the optimum amount fig 10 demonstrates the degradation efficiency s response surface and contour plots as a function of reaction time and initial concentration of nalidixic acid it can be viewed in fig 10 drug degradation efficiency reduced with the increasing initial concentration of the drug this conduct is one of the features of advanced oxidation methods while the pharmaceutical concentration is increased certain amount of hydroxyl radicals are generated in the constant status of the electrolysis system e g ph constant current etc thus this certain amount of hydroxyl radicals is not adequate to degrade the high concentrations of the pharmaceutical and degradation efficiency declines 1 fig 11 displays the degradation efficiency s response surface and contour plots based on the initial ph and nalidixic acid concentration of the 300 ma applied current and 180 min electrolysis time fig 11 showed the highest degradation efficiencies occurred when initial ph was kept at acidic phs 3 0 6 0 under all electrolysis time conditions 3 5 optimization of nalidixic acid degradation determining the optimum values of variables in the electro fenton process is the major purpose of the optimization the required objective was described as maximizing in terms of degradation effectiveness to obtain the greatest performance of therapy the results of optimization displayed that pharmaceutical removal efficiency presented the maximal result 90 in the optimal condition of initial nalidixic acid concentration 15 mg l 1 initial ph 3 5 applied current 350 ma and electrolysis time 300 min another experiment was done at the forecasted optimum conditions for verifying the optimization results this test result 88 98 was in close agreement with the model s predicted value and validated the results of the optimization of the response surface the efficiency of the process using fabricated 3dg modified carbon paper cathode to mineralize nalidixic acid solutions was evaluated by the toc decay the experiment was done with initial nalidixic acid concentration 15 mg l 1 initial ph 3 5 applied current 350 ma and electrolysis time 7 h the result showed 87 3 mineralization of the drug after 7 h of process 3 6 determination of nalidixic acid degradation products samples were evaluated using gc ms to define reaction by products that accompany nalidixic acid degradation the examined constituents were recognized by combining their spectra with those registered in the ms library wiley 7n four compounds were satisfactorily identified namely benzoic acid 1 alanine 2 phenethylamine 3 and 2 furanone 4 table 7 it should be noted that several other chromatographic peaks were also discovered other than the compounds effectively detected but it was not possible to recognize favorably i e the mass spectrum s match factor was lower than 90 it is evident that a broad variety of cleavage compounds are anticipated as quickly as the aromatic ring opens unfortunately such by products have not been identified due to the employed analytical technique limitations or they were not considerably accumulated in the medium on the other side some of the intermediates were not recognized likely because they are rapidly oxidized to their derivatives in the event of their generation the findings of the product distribution indicate that the method of degradation is initialized to form intermediates 1 4 by oxidation of nalidixic acid these intermediates can be converted to the short chain carboxylic acids by further oxidation and then are converted directly into co2 and h2o 3 7 stability of the fabricated electrode in order to examine the stability of the prepared 3dg ptfe gas diffusion cathode electrode repeated batch operations were performed as can be seen in fig 12 a during seven repeated runs the as prepared 3dg ptfe electrode showed almost the same degradation efficiency de that obtained from the first run the results indicated that the 3dg ptfe electrode possessed reasonable reusability in repetitive degradation operations and had an acceptable stability fig 12b also represents fesem image of the used 3dg ptfe electrode after repeated runs as can be seen in this image the surface of the electrode has saved the same porous surface 4 conclusions a 3dg ptfe gas diffusion cathode electrode was supplied and compared with bare carbon paper and go ptfe electrodes in this work sem xrd afm ftir cv and bet analyses were used to examine the resulting electrodes the results displayed that the concentration of h2o2 obtained via bare carbon paper and 3dg ptfe electrodes was 10 and 40 mmol l 1 respectively at the end of the 180 min electrolysis the value of obtained h2o2 with 3dg ptfe electrode was almost four times greater than that of bare carbon paper electrode in addition the 3dg ptfe electrode electro fenton enables 81 mineralization after 6 h of electrolysis these results allowed concluding that 3dg ptfe electrode can be used to electrogeneration of h2o2 and degradation of nalidixic acid as a good material the comparison between sem and afm images of fabricated electrodes showed that 3dg ptfe electrode has large surface area than other electrodes causing high efficient production of h2o2 on the basis of experimental outcomes the second order polynomial equation achieved and expressed an empirical connection between the response and autonomous variables the response surface and contour plots established the effect of trial parameters on the removal efficiency of nalidixic acid anova test demonstrated high r2 and adj r2 values 0 896 and 0 804 respectively gc ms was used to analyze degraded samples and four compounds were effectively detected in order to identify nalidixic acid degradation by products declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors

method for degradation of nalidixic acid from aqueous solutions and as an anode electrode graphite was used the physic chemical properties of 3dg powder and modified carbon paper were studied by the sem xrd afm ftir cv and bet analyses the ability of the resultant 3dg modified carbon paper cathode for hydrogen peroxide production was investigated in solution fed with air results showed that the value of hydrogen peroxide that was electrogenerated by using 3dg electrode is 4 times more than bare carbon paper and graphene oxide modified electrode the consequence of running parameters including current intensity ma initial solution ph initial concentration of nalidixic acid mg l 1 and process time were investigated comprehensively in a series of batch experiments which were optimized by response surface method rsm and the optimized amounts of each parameter were respectively 300 ma 3 5 15 mg l 1 and 300 min the pharmaceutical removal efficiency was 90 under these optimum conditions the total organic carbon toc measurements showed 87 3 mineralization of 15 mg l 1 drug at 7 h the gas chromatography gc linked to a mass spectrometry ms was used to recognize the generated intermediates through the nalidixic acid degradation keywords electro fenton emerging pollutants three dimensional graphene advanced oxidation processes nalidixic acid 1 introduction the role of bioactive chemical pollutants such as pharmaceuticals in the environment has received increasing attention in the last two decades 1 the accumulation of these pollutants in aquatic environments has been contemplated as an important public health challenge 2 to keep away from the hazardous environmental accumulation of the pharmaceuticals it is necessary to expand powerful treatment processes to remove such emerging organic pollutants different treatment methods have been recently studied and developed to remove organic contaminants from aqueous solutions 3 7 however advanced oxidation processes aops as strong green and environmentally friendly methods have been noticed 8 aops are based on an extremely reactive non selective species such as hydroxyl radicals oh that oxidize organic pollutants 9 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are very attractive among aops for wastewater decontamination because of their ability to remove persistent organic pollutants pops even in low concentrations 10 in these methods h2o2 is regularly provided to an acidic solution by the o2 gas reduction of normally at cathodes such as carbon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe o2 diffusion 11 12 and carbon felt 13 by reaction 1 14 1 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 adding a small amount of fe2 as catalyzer leads to extremely enhancement of the oxidizing power of h2o2 according to the fenton reaction 2 15 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the cathodes fabricated by carbon based materials have been broadly utilized to the electrogeneration of h2o2 because of non toxicity great h2 evolution overpotential low catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition high stability conductivity and chemical resistance of them 8 several carbonaceous cathodes such as gas diffusion electrode gde 16 17 graphite felt 18 carbon felt 19 graphene 20 activated carbon fiber 21 carbon sponge 22 and c60 carbon nanotubes composite 12 have been studied for h2o2 electrogeneration three dimensional graphene 3dg aerogel is a novel encouraging candidate as cathode martial because of its elevated particular region elevated porosity and low density martial 23 24 this research therefore included two primary components for the first moment 3dg ptfe gde was manufactured as a cathode electrode and its effectiveness was compared with bare carbon paper and graphene oxide go ptfe electrodes the structure and electrochemical behavior of the so prepared electrodes were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem atomic force microscopy afm and cyclic voltammetry cv nalidixic acid 1 ethyl 1 4 dihydro 7 methyl 4 oxo 1 8 naftiridine 3 carboxylic acid is a pharmaceutical antibacterial agent used as an antibacterial agent to manage chicken infection and improve the productivity of fish farming by enhancing water quality and preventing infection 25 27 the presence of nalidixic acid has been reported in environmental waters wastewater treatment plants effluents hospital effluents and soils 28 30 so the concerns about its environmental and human health effects have increased at low concentrations it acts as bacteriostatic and inhibits bacterial growth while it exhibits bacterial effects at high concentrations 31 extensive manufacture of pharmaceutical by plants big quantities of elapsed drugs unchanged pharmaceutical products excretion by animals their metabolites and human cause to occurrence of drugs in the aquatic environment 32 34 thus existence of these compounds has serious effects on human and animal health 35 literatures study shows that various methods for removing nalidixic acid from aqueous solutions were used including an embedded mbr ozonation scheme 36 powdered activated carbon 37 adsorption onto anion exchange and neutral polymers 38 and uv and uv h2o2 processes 39 but the previous studies have not still considered the toxicity evolvement of the aqueous solutions of nalidixic acid during the time of electrolysis in fact it is worth emphasizing that treating poisonous organic contaminants aquatic solutions through sophisticated oxidation procedures is not needfully followed through a reduction in toxicity as the oxidation reaction could create intermediates more dangerous than the original contaminant thus nalidixic acid degradation by the electro fenton method via nanostructured 3dg modified electrode as the cathode was investigated at the second part of our work gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis was used to investigation of degradation intermediates response surface methodology rsm has been also used to investigation the influence of operational parameters on the degradation efficiency of nalidixic acid 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals in this work nalidixic acid a synthetic antibiotic quinolone with purity 98 5 was selected as the model compound

magnetically stirred in all studies air at a flow rate of 140 ml min 1 was injected to the diffusion cathode for the generation of h2o2 by reaction 1 in the aqueous medium comprising 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 as electrolyte nalidixic acid samples 250 ml at initial ph 3 0 with drug concentration between 10 and 50 mg l 1 were removed relatively the ph 3 0 value was chosen as the optimal value for fenton s reaction 2 42 at the end of the reaction the residual concentration of the nalidixic acid was determined spectrophotometrically at λmax 251 nm the degradation efficiency de is calculated by the following equation 3 de 1 a a o 100 ao and a in this equation are the nalidixic acid absorbance at time 0 and t respectively 2 6 method of analysis at well ordered time intervals samples were taken out from the reactor and the elimination of nalidixic acid was assessed by measuring the solution absorbance at λmax equals 251 nm the iodide method was used to determine hydrogen peroxide concentration spectrophotometrically detection limit of approximately 10 6 mol l 1 as follows 43 iodide reagent 0 06 mol l 1 naoh 10 4 mol l 1 ammonium molybdate 0 4 mol l 1 potassium iodide 3 ml and

experimental design in this research as the most common one in rsm the central composite design ccd with five levels was used to the optimization of the electro fenton method so as to investigate the effect of the operational parameters on the degradation efficiency of nalidixic acid four main factors were chosen initial nalidixic acid concentration x1 ph x2 applied current x3 and electrolysis time x4 in this research a total of 31 studies were used including 24 16 cube points 7 central point replications and 8 axial points in order to statistical computations the variables xi were coded as xi in accordance with the next connection 4 x i x i x o δx in this equation xo refers to represent the xi value at the central point and δx exhibits the step change 45 these factors coded levels and their natural values for nalidixic acid degradation are demonstrated in table 2 2 8 analysis of data in order to evaluate the relationship between the response and independent variables a second order polynomial equation was used eq 5 5 y b 0 b i x i b ii x i 2 b ij x i x j ε in this equation y is the computed response b0 is the constant bi bii and bij are the linear quadratic and interaction

was utilized analysis of variance anova was used to test the goodness of fit of the obtained regression model and the significance of each term in the equation counter plots two dimensional and curves of the response surface three dimensional were evolved too the numerical optimization procedure was applied to achieve the best degradation of nalidixic acid 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized 3dg fig 1 a shows fesem image of synthesized 3dg as can be seen in this figure an interconnected porous network has been created in the 3dg structure the creation of this network can be related to ignition and reaction of the glycine with oxidants such as oxygen or carboxyl hydroxyl groups on the go surface after the combustion this lead to generation of a lot of bubbles composed of n2 co2 and h2o in the go suspension and between go sheets so the formed pores have random sizes and the product has a foam like structure with many pores and expanded volume in comparison to the go 41 the xrd patterns of graphene oxide and the synthesized 3d structured graphene have been shown in fig 1b as indicated in this figure a sharp peak at 2θ near 10 was observed for the go 41 46 furthermore disappearance of go diffraction peak 2θ 10 and appearance a new broad diffraction peak at 2θ 25 can be related to the exfoliation of the multilayer go after the combustion and the conversion to graphene 2d sheets with removal of surface functional groups 41 47 fig 1c presents the as prepared 3d graphene ftir spectrum this figure shows characteristic oh at 3400 cm 1 that is related to the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the synthesized 3dg the characteristic peaks due to cc 1620 cm 1 and carbonyl 1730 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1060 cm 1 also appeared in the ftir spectrum of the 3dg which indicates continues range of original graphene structure in some ranges to assess the variation in the specific surface area of the synthesized go and 3dg the bet analysis was carried out 3dg structure displayed a higher surface area 132 m2 g 1 than that of go 23 5 m2 g 1 therefore the prepared 3dg with a large specific surface area is an advantage for creating electrode materials in the electrochemical systems 3 2 modified gde cathode characterization 3 2 1 physical properties characterization fig 2 a d represents the carbon paper s fesem images before fig 2a and after bonding of go ptfe fig 2b and 3dg ptfe fig 2c and d layer on it as can be seen in fesem images the surface of the electrode modified with 3dg fig 2c and d was much uneven than that of the go fig 2b such a porous 3dg ptfe electrode surface could enable rapid o2 diffusion to achieve high mass transfer rate and highly efficient h2o2 production fig 3 a and b represent the morphology results 3d graphs of go ptfe and 3dg ptfe electrodes were verified by afm analysis it can be seen in the images that the roughness over the prepared electrode with 3dg compared to go was induced for better comparisons table 3 shows surface roughness parameters including root mean square sq roughness average sa and peak valley height sy it obviously display that 3dg ptfe has more active sites for generation of h2o2 than go ptfe and modifying with 3dg led to an increase in the average roughness these results are coherent with the results of the fesem images fig 2b d 3 2 2 electrochemical behavior of modified electrodes the cv measurements were registered on the bare carbon paper before modification go ptfe and 3dg ptfe electrodes in the aqueous solution of 0 05 mol l 1 na2so4 at ph 3 5 saturated by o2 with scan rate of 10 mv s 1 fig 4 a pt sheet was used as the anode and the saturated calomel electrode sce was performed as the reference electrode the cathodic peaks corresponding to the reduction of oxygen and generation of h2o2 in the potential ranges of 0 3 to 0 5 v vs sce well defined in the both of the two electrodes go and 3dg 20 as can be seen in this figure the bare gde bare carbon paper displayed very poor oxygen reduction activity on the other hand the onset potential for go graphene carbon paper and 3dg 3dg carbon paper were observed around 0 30 v vs sce it could be seen that under the same condition greater peak current density is seen in 3dg modified electrode s cv curve for the purpose of determining the amount of h2o2 produced by the bare gde and 3dg ptfe electrodes electrolysis was executed at a steady current of 300 ma with 250 ml solution a pt sheet area of 1 0 cm2 was used as anode in this electrolysis fig 5 shows the results on the bare gde and 3dg gde for the generation of h2o2 as it can be viewed in this figure the concentration of h2o2 obtained via bare gde and 3dg ptfe electrodes was 10 and 40 mmol l 1 respectively at the end of 180 min electrolysis the amount of h2o2 obtained with 3dg ptfe electrode was almost four times greater than that of bare gde electrode the 3dg ptfe cathode used in this work showed higher h2o2 generation rate 28 19 mg h 1 cm 2 compared with the other literatures table 4 it can be concluded that 3dg could be a useful cathode material for h2o2 electrogeneration according to these outcomes 3 3 central composite design model response surface modeling of the process was done by a five level ccd with sixteen factorial point eight axial point and seven replications resulting in a total of 31 experiments table 5 presents the resulting ccd matrix with 4 factor and experimental outcomes the polynomial response equation of the second order eq 5 was used to correlate the dependent and autonomous variables the graph for the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadratic model and model terms is shown in fig 6 quadratic model and model terms applied current ph initial nalidixic acid concentration and ph ph are significant fig 6 based on these outcomes the following second order polynomial equation developed between the response and independent variables subjected to 2 xi 2 6 y 75 1178 4 3227 x 1 7 3774 x 2 7 5009 x 3 3 0178 x 4 0 1657 x 1 x 2 1 5128 x 1 x 3 2 8461 x 1 x 4 1 9379 x 2 x 3 0 1657 x 2 x 4 1 4163 x 3 x 4 0 4072 x 1 2 8 3696 x 2 2 1 2072 x 3 2 0 5515 x 4 2 the forecasted degradation efficiencies de by eq 6 have been shown in table 5 these findings suggested excellent degradation effectiveness contracts between the experimental and forecasted amounts the correlation between the experimental information and the expected reactions was assessed quantitatively by the correlation coefficient r2 a comparison between the experimental results and the forecasted values obtained from the model eq 6 discovered that the expected values corresponded fairly well with r2 0 896 to the experimental values this implies that the independent variables explain 89 6 percent of the differences for color removal and does not describe just about 10 4 percent of the variation adjusted r2 adj r2 is more acceptable for comparing models with dissimilar numbers of independent variables it is also an evaluation of goodness of a fit adj r2 improves r2 value by using the degrees of liberty on its computations for the sample size and amount of phrases in the model it can be smaller than r2 if there are many phrases in a model and the sample size is not very large 48 49 here adj r2 value 0 804 and the corresponding r2 value are too close table 6 an appropriate fit of the model has to be acquired to guarantee the acceptability of the model used in optimizing a response surface from a statistical point of view the evaluation of the acceptability of the model requires three tests the fisher test the student s t test and r square test the variance test of fisher known as the f test used to test the reliability of the forecasted model if the experimental outcomes well predicted by the model f value for a certain amount of degrees of liberty in the model at a meaning level of α has to be higher than the critical value of f distribution table 6 shows the outcomes of the anticipated quadratic response surface model for the electro fenton method in the form of analysis of variance anova of the regression parameters the resulted f value 84 94 at the confidence level of 95 is clearly higher than the f critical value 2 352 at the significance level of 95 it means that the quadratic model forecast was statistically significant and the regression equation can explain most of the variations in the response as the anova results present the predicted model showed a great value of determination coefficient r2 0 896 and adj r2 0 804 every time you add a variable to a model the r2 value increases but the adj r2 increases only if the new term improves the model so the adj r2 that takes the number of variables into account is commonly selected 50 52 the relatively high r squared value 0 896 displays good accordance between the calculated and experimental results the model s proportionality also is assessed by the residuals the difference between expected and experimental amounts the observed residuals plotted against expected values are shown in fig 7 all points on the normal probability plot have to be approximately on a straight line if the residuals have a normal distribution therefore it could be concluded that the estimated effects are the real and differ from noise 50 fig 7 shows a normal distribution and randomly scattering of the residuals the pareto analysis provides further meaningful data for interpreting the outcomes in fact according to the following relationship the percentage impact of each factor was calculated by this assessment 53 54 7 p i b i 2 b i 2 100 i 0 it can be seen in the pareto graphic analysis fig 8 among the varying factors ph ph b22 30 90 applied current b3 24 82 ph b2 24 01 and initial nalidixic acid concentration b1 8 24 have the major impact on degradation efficiency 3 4 variables effects as response plots geometric depictions significantly enhance the interpretation of the scheme with various inputs and outputs and in particular by using the contour and surface plots contour plots averse to pairs of significant explanatory variables demonstrate in what way these two factors are related to the reaction variable at a moment 3d plots of the response surface also display the side response surface fig 9 created the surface and contour plots on the basis of applied current and electrolysis time whilst the initial ph and concentration of the nalidixic acid were held constant at 6 and 30 mol l 1 respectively the applied current is one of the effective variables in electrochemical process the rate of electrochemical reactions and the performance of electrodes is highly dependent on applied current 8 as could be viewed in fig 9 increasing the applied current until about 500 ma causes to increase degradation efficiency this degradation efficiency enhancing can be related to a greater generation of h2o2 with reaction 1 it should be noted that a further rise in the applied current led to a slight improvement in degradation efficiency the utilization of higher currents not only increases energy loss but also enhances h2o electrolysis and produces oxygen instead of hydroxyl radical 9 hence the electro generation of oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radical increases when of course current rises by the optimum amount fig 10 demonstrates the degradation efficiency s response surface and contour plots as a function of reaction time and initial concentration of nalidixic acid it can be viewed in fig 10 drug degradation efficiency reduced with the increasing initial concentration of the drug this conduct is one of the features of advanced oxidation methods while the pharmaceutical concentration is increased certain amount of hydroxyl radicals are generated in the constant status of the electrolysis system e g ph constant current etc thus this certain amount of hydroxyl radicals is not adequate to degrade the high concentrations of the pharmaceutical and degradation efficiency declines 1 fig 11 displays the degradation efficiency s response surface and contour plots based on the initial ph and nalidixic acid concentration of the 300 ma applied current and 180 min electrolysis time fig 11 showed the highest degradation efficiencies occurred when initial ph was kept at acidic phs 3 0 6 0 under all electrolysis time conditions 3 5 optimization of nalidixic acid degradation determining the optimum values of variables in the electro fenton process is the major purpose of the optimization the required objective was described as maximizing in terms of degradation effectiveness to obtain the greatest performance of therapy the results of optimization displayed that pharmaceutical removal efficiency presented the maximal result 90 in the optimal condition of initial nalidixic acid concentration 15 mg l 1 initial ph 3 5 applied current 350 ma and electrolysis time 300 min another experiment was done at the forecasted optimum conditions for verifying the optimization results this test result 88 98 was in close agreement with the model s predicted value and validated the results of the optimization of the response surface the efficiency of the process using fabricated 3dg modified carbon paper cathode to mineralize nalidixic acid solutions was evaluated by the toc decay the experiment was done with initial nalidixic acid concentration 15 mg l 1 initial ph 3 5 applied current 350 ma and electrolysis time 7 h the result showed 87 3 mineralization of the drug after 7 h of process 3 6 determination of nalidixic acid degradation products samples were evaluated using gc ms to define reaction by products that accompany nalidixic acid degradation the examined constituents were recognized by combining their spectra with those registered in the ms library wiley 7n four compounds were satisfactorily identified namely benzoic acid 1 alanine 2 phenethylamine 3 and 2 furanone 4 table 7 it should be noted that several other chromatographic peaks were also discovered other than the compounds effectively detected but it was not possible to recognize favorably i e the mass spectrum s match factor was lower than 90 it is evident that a broad variety of cleavage compounds are anticipated as quickly as the aromatic ring opens unfortunately such by products have not been identified due to the employed analytical technique limitations or they were not considerably accumulated in the medium on the other side some of the intermediates were not recognized likely because they are rapidly oxidized to their derivatives in the event of their generation the findings of the product distribution indicate that the method of degradation is initialized to form intermediates 1 4 by oxidation of nalidixic acid these intermediates can be converted to the short chain carboxylic acids by further oxidation and then are converted directly into co2 and h2o 3 7 stability of the fabricated electrode in order to examine the stability of the prepared 3dg ptfe gas diffusion cathode electrode repeated batch operations were performed as can be seen in fig 12 a during seven repeated runs the as prepared 3dg ptfe electrode showed almost the same degradation efficiency de that obtained from the first run the results indicated that the 3dg ptfe electrode possessed reasonable reusability in repetitive degradation operations and had an acceptable stability fig 12b also represents fesem image of the used 3dg ptfe electrode after repeated runs as can be seen in this image the surface of the electrode has saved the same porous surface 4 conclusions a 3dg ptfe gas diffusion cathode electrode was supplied and compared with bare carbon paper and go ptfe electrodes in this work sem xrd afm ftir cv and bet analyses were used to examine the resulting electrodes the results displayed that the concentration of h2o2 obtained via bare carbon paper and 3dg ptfe electrodes was 10 and 40 mmol l 1 respectively at the end of the 180 min electrolysis the value of obtained h2o2 with 3dg ptfe electrode was almost four times greater than that of bare carbon paper electrode in addition the 3dg ptfe electrode electro fenton enables 81 mineralization after 6 h of electrolysis these results allowed concluding that 3dg ptfe electrode can be used to electrogeneration of h2o2 and degradation of nalidixic acid as a good material the comparison between sem and afm images of fabricated electrodes showed that 3dg ptfe electrode has large surface area than other electrodes causing high efficient production of h2o2 on the basis of experimental outcomes the second order polynomial equation achieved and expressed an empirical connection between the response and autonomous variables the response surface and contour plots established the effect of trial parameters on the removal efficiency of nalidixic acid anova test demonstrated high r2 and adj r2 values 0 896 and 0 804 respectively gc ms was used to analyze degraded samples and four compounds were effectively detected in order to identify nalidixic acid degradation by products declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors

14279,in this study novel magnetic yolk shell structures fe3o4 sio2 and fe3o4 sio2 cu were used as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the degradation of acetaminophen actm under different experimental conditions important factors that affected their catalytic performance were investigated including catalysts dosage oxidant concentrations ph ionic strength is and natural organic matter nom in addition the nom was isolated into different molecular size fractions and their characterization and influence on actm degradation were examined to provide insight into nom behavior in the system the results showed that the degradation of actm was promoted with increases of the investigated fe3o4 dosages the degradation efficiencies were also enhanced as the h2o2 concentration increased from 5 0 to 15 0 mm but they were decreased at a higher dosage of h2o2 25 mm the degradation was inhibited as the ph increased but it was an insignificant difference when the ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the case of fe3o4 sio2 cu as the catalyst electrochemical analysis indicated that nom at a certain concentration could enhance the electron transfer reactions however nom was observed to have different effects on the two catalysts fe3o4 sio 2 cu catalytic activity was accelerated when the nom concentration was below 30 0 mg l and it was retarded at higher nom concentrations while the catalytic activity of fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all ranges of the investigated nom concentrations the presence of different nom size fractions in the systems resulted in various behaviors of the catalysts in the degradation of actm keywords magnetic yolk shell structures acetaminophen degradation fenton like system natural organic matter 1 introduction acetaminophen actm commonly known as paracetamol is a widely used drug worldwide for analgesic and antipyretic medication 1 actm is one of the most detected pharmaceuticals in surface waters ground waters wastewaters and drinking waters 2 4 the existence of such pharmaceutical in aquatic systems has been associated to various environmental effects and it has lately considered as an emerging organic contaminant 5 6 efforts to remove actm in aquatic systems have been considered as an argent need because it is not readily removed by conventional treatment processes 7 8 in this respect heterogeneous fenton systems catalyzed by iron containing materials have shown great potential to be effectively removal numerous pharmaceuticals from aquatic environments 9 12 generally the systems often face several practical limitations such as the generation of secondary pollutants catalyst aggregation high operational cost and or requirement of separation unit for catalyst recovery recently a special nano scale yolk shell structure which consists of a reactive core yolk mesoporous shell and void between them has been proposed as a state of the art catalyst with which the above limitations can be addressed in our previous studies 8 13 14 magnetite based yolk shell structures have been proven to be efficient heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the oxidative removal of actm from aquatic environments in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the materials also exhibited outstanding structural stability good magnetic properties and easy separation from solution by an external magnet however there are important aspects of the heterogeneous catalytic system that still remain unclear and may significantly affect the actm removal efficiency such as the catalyst and oxidant dosages initial solution ph ionic strength and co existent pollutants research has shown that the effects of catalyst and oxidant dosages on the degradation rate of organic compounds are not always positive and they depend on the specific catalytic system 15 18 the solution ph has a decisive effect on the performance of fenton like systems in the removal of organic contaminants due to its role in controlling the catalytic activity of catalysts the reactive species and the stability of h2o2 17 19 20 however the influence of the initial solution ph and ionic strength on the degradation of actm in the heterogeneous fenton like system catalyzed by the magnetic yolk shell structures and metals leaching from these catalysts has not been surveyed in detail therefore a study on the effects of these factors in the system will be crucial to obtain the appropriate operating conditions in order to achieve the highest removal efficiency and to provide insight into the reaction mechanism of the heterogeneous fenton like reaction aquatic natural organic matter nom is a ubiquitous component that is present in most natural water sources and consists of a wide range of different materials including a major percentage of humic substances polysaccharides lipids proteins and other organic materials 21 24 the presence of nom in water might cause difficulties by interfering with the oxidant species or reacting with chemicals used in the treatment process or changing adsorption behavior of the materials in the systems 25 27 it has been found that dissolved organic matter dom is a redox active natural organic compound that can mediate biogeochemical redox reactions including the transfer of electrons from microorganisms to iron based materials and from abiotic reductants to organic pollutants 28 30 moreover dom can also act as a redox buffer agent which can accept electrons from anaerobic microbial respiration and donate electrons to oxygen to be re oxidized during aeration 28 there is evidence that the molecular weight distribution of nom differs from source to source and it can be affected by seasonal conversion 31 34 nom can be further isolated and fractionated into more homogeneous components based on different physicochemical properties such as molecular size or hydrophobicity 31 35 37 the molecular size of different nom fractions can be separated using a series of ultrafiltration membranes with specific molecular weight cut off mwco it is necessary to further fractionate and characterize nom sub fractions because the different quantity and chemistry of various nom fractions may have different reactivity and therefore understanding their behaviors in the system would help in designing a better treatment process in this study novel catalysts of a magnetic yolk shell structure fe3o4 sio2 and that decorated with copper nanoparticles fe3o4 sio2 cu were prepared via a modified sol gel process and their catalytic activities were investigated for the degradation of actm in a heterogeneous fenton like system the effects of h2o2 dosages catalysts dosages ph and ionic strength is were studied for a comprehensive understanding of the oxidative degradation of actm in the systems the interference of suwannee river nom on the catalytic activities of the prepared yolk shell structures was also investigated furthermore the nom was fractionated into different molecular sizes and their characterization and influence on the actm degradation were examined to provide insight into nom behavior in the systems 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials preparation 2 1 1 chemicals and materials

experiments for actm removal were carried out using a batch reactor equipped with a temperature controllable heating mantle ms dm 604 misung scientific co korea with a magnetic stirrer six hundred ml

the systems were maintained at a temperature of 25 c for 120 min adsorption experiments were also conducted under otherwise identical conditions without the addition of hydrogen peroxide a similar experimental setup can also be seen in our previous studies 8 13 14 2 3 sampling and analysis samples were collected at particular time intervals of the reaction and then instantly filtered through a

spectrophotometer uvmini 1240 shimadzu japan and a fluorescent spectrophotometer rf 5301 shimadzu japan adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in series batch reactors to determine the adsorption capacities of the prepared materials for each fraction of the nom 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fe3o4 dosages the effects of the fe3o4 dosages on the actm degradation were investigated by varying its concentration from 0 10 to 0 80 g l for fe3o4 sio2 and from 0 02 to 0 20 g l for fe3o4 sio2 cu as shown in fig 1 the removal of actm was enhanced when the fe3o4 dosages increased in the investigated ranges the results suggested that the participation of the catalysts could accelerate the degradation of actm the increase in the fe3o4 dosage led to an increase in the number of active sites which favored hydrogen peroxide decomposition and generated more reactive hydroxyl radical oh 17 18 40 41 consequently the higher degradation efficiency obtained at higher fe3o4 dosages could be primarily attributed to the higher production of reactive radical in the systems in addition the better actm removal efficiency catalyzed by fe3o4 sio2 cu compared to that of its precursor was primarily due to the difference in their structure and the synergistic effects between iron and copper redox couples fe2 fe3 and cu cu2 in the systems which has been reported in detail in our previous study 13 3 2 effects of h2o2 dosages the effects of h2o2 concentration on the removal of actm using the two catalysts were also investigated fig 2 for both of the catalysts it was observed that actm degradation was enhanced with an increase in the h2o2 concentration from 5 0 to 15 0 mm this positive correlation could be attributed to the accelerated generation of reactive species when higher amounts of h2o2 were added 40 41 leading to a higher actm removal efficiency however the degradation efficiency decrease with a higher dosage of h2o2 25 mm which could be due to the scavenger effect of h2o2 when using it with an excessive dosage 42 44 the oh could react with excess h2o2 in the system according to reactions 1 and 2 to generate other radicals ho2 o2 18 41 45 which have significantly lower oxidative ability 13 therefore an appropriate initial h2o2 concentration 15 0 mm can be selected as the optimum oxidant concentration for the removal of actm in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction catalyzed by the prepared yolk shell structures 1 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 2 ho2 h o2 3 3 effects of ph the influence of the initial solution ph on catalytic oxidation of actm using the magnetic yolk shell structures are presented in fig 3 apparently the initial solution ph can significantly affect the degradation of actm both of the catalysts exhibited better catalytic activities at a ph of 3 0 but the metal leaching in the effluents made the catalysts less stable under these reaction conditions table 1 this is a major drawback for regeneration of the catalysts especially for the fe3o4 sio2 cu therefore the initial ph should be carefully considered before employing the materials in practical applications the actm removal efficiency decreased as a ph increase was observed for both of the catalysts which could be explained by the formation of a weaker oxidant i e feo2 and less generation of oh at higher ph values 17 18 another reason could be attributed to the reduction of the electrostatically attractive interaction between the catalysts and actm at higher solution ph values which was reflected in the adsorption data fig a1 however the degradation was insignificantly different when the ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the case of fe3o4 sio2 cu as the catalyst and complete actm removal could be achieved after 120 min of operation suggesting that the fe3o4 sio2 cu still exhibited excellent catalytic activity even at a high ph value the fact that fe3o4 sio2 cu could retain good catalytic activity in a wide range of ph values was partly due to the synergistic effect between iron and copper in its structure which favored the redox cycles of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu enhancing the catalytic reaction rate 8 46 47 in addition the low ph dependence property of copper nanoparticles could have allowed the catalyst to maintain its stability in a higher ph environment 48 50 3 4 effects of ionic strength figs 4 and a2 presents the removal of actm with different ionic strengths using nacl solution with an initial solution ph of 5 0 the actm removal efficiency was highly dependent on the ionic strength which was decreased as the ionic strength from increased from 0 0 to 100 0 mm chloride ions in the system could compete with h2o2 for complexation with iron ions reduce the h2o2 decomposition rate and inhibit the fenton like reaction by scavenging of the oh radical 51 53 the results of this experiment also confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the system which was verified in our previous work 13 an inhibitory effect of chloride ions on the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants in fenton like systems has also been reported in the literature 52 58 nitrate ions do not complex with fe2 or fe3 measurably nor do they react with hydroxyl radicals 51 therefore sodium nitrate and calcium nitrate were used to evaluate the effects of ionic strength on the removal of actm and the results in the presence of h2o2 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively these data in the absence of h2o2 were also provided in figs a3 and a4 respectively no significant change in the degradation of actm was observed for the two catalysts therefore it might be concluded that without the existence of reactive species scavengers and agents competing with h2o2 the removal of actm in the system was almost independent of the ionic strength 3 5 effects of natural organic matter the presence of nom in fenton like systems could affect the degradation of organic contaminants in different ways which could inhibit enhance or have no significant effect on the oxidation efficiency 59 64 in this study the variation of actm removal efficiencies with different nom concentrations is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that actm degradation by fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all of the investigated ranges of the nom concentration and the removal efficiency decreased with an increase in the nom concentration fig 7a meanwhile the nom exhibited markedly different responses when fe3o4 sio2 cu was used in the system fig 8 a low concentrations of nom 30 0 mg l could accelerate actm degradation while at higher levels it had an opposite effect on the degradation by reducing the activity of the catalyst cyclic voltammograms data indicated that the electron transfer capacities of the magnetic yolk shell structures after exposure to nom were higher compared to those of the catalysts in the systems without the addition of nom table 2 and fig a5 suggesting that nom at a certain concentration was able to mediate electron transfer in the system thereby improving the degradation efficiency however in the system catalyzed by the fe3o4 sio2 structures the decrease in the actm removal efficiency might have been due to the competitive adsorption of nom molecules on the silica shell or the scavenged reactive hydroxyl radicals 59 the adsorbed nom molecules could block the shell layer pores in the catalyst structure 65 66 and therefore the actm molecules could not penetrate through the silica shell to reach the inner active cores resulting in its complete degradation although the electron transfer capacity increased in the presence of nom table 2 its effects on the actm degradation were insufficient to overcome the influences of the competitive adsorption phenomenon and radical scavenging effects this was also partly reflected in the doc removal efficiency which decreased with an increase in the nom concentrations fig 7b in the system catalyzed by the fe3o4 sio2 cu structures as can be seen in fig 8a the degradation of actm was improved at low concentrations of nom 30 0 mg l the speeding up of the actm degradation rate could have been due to copper leaching in the system which could form complexes with nom and these complexes could accelerate the electron transfer in comparison to the fe3o4 sio2 59 64 the electron transfer capacity of the fe3o4 sio2 cu nom complexes was significantly higher than that of the original fe3o4 sio2 cu table 2 therefore nom at certain concentrations could accelerate the actm degradation in the system in addition it has also been reported previously 8 13 that the copper nanoparticles decorated on the surface of yolk shell structures brought great improvement in the catalytic activity so that they could also promote the decomposition of nom molecules to a certain level fig 8b however when an excess amount of nom was added the incomplete decomposition of adsorbed nom molecules on the material s surface could deactivate the active sites and lead to a decrease in the actm removal efficiency this was also reflected in the doc removal which decreased when the nom reached the concentration of 100 0 mg l fig 8b 3 6 effects of different nom sizes 3 6 1 nom characterization the properties of different nom types including nom 1 mwco 0 1 kda nom 2 mwco 1 2 kda nom 3 mwco 2 3 kda and nom 4 mwco 3 30 kda are presented in table 3 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 values and uv absorbance ratios a254 a204 a250 a365 was analyzed to confirm the success of the nom fractionation a higher value of suva254 suggested a high content of hydrophobic aromatic and high mw of the nom fraction 37 67 the uv absorbance ratio at a254 a204 was positively correlated with the hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio 68 69 and the ratio at a250 a365 was negatively correlated with the nom size 68 70 therefore the hydrophobic content increased as the nom molecular size increased the actm partition coefficient k increased with an increase in the nom size suggesting that actm had a higher sorption affinity to larger sized nom adsorption experiments indicated that fe3o4 sio2 showed better adsorption capacity for larger nom sizes while fe3o4 sio2 cu had a higher adsorption capacity for small nom molecules this result might have been due to the difference in surface characteristics of the two catalysts the decoration of copper nanoparticles on the surface of the silica shell might have led to an increase in the hydrophilic properties of the material which should be verified by further studies 3 6 2 effects of different nom fractions the effects of different nom size fractions on actm and doc removal of fe3o4 sio2 are presented in figs 9 and a6 it can be seen that nom inhibited the decomposition of actm in all of the investigated sizes fig 9a and the smaller nom molecules were more resistant to actm removal after 120 min of reaction the actm removal efficiencies decreased from 67 88 to 42 59 with a decrease in the investigated nom sizes the inhibition of actm removal was probably due to the competitive adsorption of nom molecules onto the surface which interfered with the movement of actm molecules into the hollow void spaces of the yolk shell structures 65 66 thereby slowing down the reaction rate the inhibition diminished with an increase in the nom size which was possibly due to the greater actm sorption affinity of larger nom sizes as discussed above consequently the removal of actm in the presence of nom in addition to the oxidative cause might have also been due to the adsorption process where the adsorption of larger nom molecules onto the material could result in partial removal of actm this was also verified by control experiments in the absence of h2o2 fig a6a in which actm was removed more as the nom size increased the doc of the samples was analyzed to support the discussion noted above figs 9b and a6b and fe3o4 sio2 exhibited better doc removal for larger nom molecules in both cases with the presence and absence of h2o2 this result again demonstrated that fe3o4 sio2 had a better ability to adsorb large nom molecules under the investigated conditions the effects of different nom size fractions on the actm and doc removal of fe3o4 sio2 cu are presented in figs 10 and a7 similar to fe3o4 sio2 all of the investigated nom fractions were observed to have their own impact on the decomposition of actm fig 10a however the larger nom molecules nom 3 and nom 4 were more resistant to actm removal while it was negligible with smaller nom molecules nom 1 and nom 2 despite the occurrence of competitive adsorption between nom and actm molecules the fe3o4 sio2 cu structures were demonstrated to have a very strong catalytic reactivity compared to that of the fe3o4 sio2 structures 13 so that the small nom molecules adsorbed on their surface could also be easily degraded fig 10b consequently the inhibition of small adsorbed nom molecules nom 1 and nom 2 on the degradation of actm was negligible with the larger nom sizes the inhibition of actm removal could have been due to the incomplete decomposition of adsorbed nom molecules which reduced the active sites and led to a decrease in the actm removal efficiency in addition the greater sorption affinity of actm for larger nom molecules non adsorbed fractions may have also contributed to the reduction of actm exposed to fe3o4 sio2 cu structures reducing the actm degradation rate the control experiments in the absence of h2o2 further confirmed the higher sorption affinity of actm toward larger nom molecules fig a7a it can be seen that actm was removed more with the presence of larger nom molecules the doc of the samples was also analyzed to support the discussion noted above figs 10b and a7b that fe3o4 sio2 cu exhibited better doc removal for smaller nom molecules in both of the cases with the presence and absence of h2o2 this result demonstrated again that fe3o4 sio2 cu had a better ability to adsorb smaller nom molecules under the investigated conditions 4 conclusions the results of this study suggested that the degradation of actm was primarily attributed to the catalytic oxidation reaction and it had a remarkable dependence on the fe3o4 and h2o2 dosages chloride ions and initial solution ph the actm degradation efficiency was quite independent on the ionic strength caused by nitrate ions the nom was observed to have different effects on the two catalysts fe3o4 sio2 cu catalytic activity was accelerated when the nom concentration was below 30 0 mg l and it was retarded at a higher level of nom while the catalytic activity of fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all of the ranges of investigated nom concentrations the hydrophobic content increased as the nom molecular size increased and the actm had a higher sorption affinity to larger sizes of nom fe3o4 sio2 showed better adsorption capacity for larger nom sizes while fe3o4 sio2 cu had a higher adsorption capacity for small nom sizes the smaller nom molecules were more resistant to actm removal of the yolk shell structures while they had an opposite influence on the system catalyzed by the copper decorated yolk shell

system the results showed that the degradation of actm was promoted with increases of the investigated fe3o4 dosages the degradation efficiencies were also enhanced as the h2o2 concentration increased from 5 0 to 15 0 mm but they were decreased at a higher dosage of h2o2 25 mm the degradation was inhibited as the ph increased but it was an insignificant difference when the ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the case of fe3o4 sio2 cu as the catalyst electrochemical analysis indicated that nom at a certain concentration could enhance the electron transfer reactions however nom was observed to have different effects on the two catalysts fe3o4 sio 2 cu catalytic activity was accelerated when the nom concentration was below 30 0 mg l and it was retarded at higher nom concentrations while the catalytic activity of fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all ranges of the investigated nom concentrations the presence of different nom size fractions in the systems resulted in various behaviors of the catalysts in the degradation of actm keywords magnetic yolk shell structures acetaminophen degradation fenton like system natural organic matter 1 introduction acetaminophen actm commonly known as paracetamol is a widely used drug worldwide for analgesic and antipyretic medication 1 actm is one of the most detected pharmaceuticals in surface waters ground waters wastewaters and drinking waters 2 4 the existence of such pharmaceutical in aquatic systems has been associated to various environmental effects and it has lately considered as an emerging organic contaminant 5 6 efforts to remove actm in aquatic systems have been considered as an argent need because it is not readily removed by conventional treatment processes 7 8 in this respect heterogeneous fenton systems catalyzed by iron containing materials have shown great potential to be effectively removal numerous pharmaceuticals from aquatic environments 9 12 generally the systems often face several practical limitations such as the generation of secondary pollutants catalyst aggregation high operational cost and or requirement of separation unit for catalyst recovery recently a special nano scale yolk shell structure which consists of a reactive core yolk mesoporous shell and void between them has been proposed as a state of the art catalyst with which the above limitations can be addressed in our previous studies 8 13 14 magnetite based yolk shell structures have been proven to be efficient heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the oxidative removal of actm from aquatic environments in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the materials also exhibited outstanding structural stability good magnetic properties and easy separation from solution by an external magnet however there are important aspects of the heterogeneous catalytic system that still remain unclear and may significantly affect the actm removal efficiency such as the catalyst and oxidant dosages initial solution ph ionic strength and co existent pollutants research has shown that the effects of catalyst and oxidant dosages on the degradation rate of organic compounds are not always positive and they depend on the specific catalytic system 15 18 the solution ph has a decisive effect on the performance of fenton like systems in the removal of organic contaminants due to its role in controlling the catalytic activity of catalysts the reactive species and the stability of h2o2 17 19 20 however the influence of the initial solution ph and ionic strength on the degradation of actm in the heterogeneous fenton like system catalyzed by the magnetic yolk shell structures and metals leaching from these catalysts has not been surveyed in detail therefore a study on the effects of these factors in the system will be crucial to obtain the appropriate operating conditions in order to achieve the highest removal efficiency and to provide insight into the reaction mechanism of the heterogeneous fenton like reaction aquatic natural organic matter nom is a ubiquitous component that is present in most natural water sources and consists of a wide range of different materials including a major percentage of humic substances polysaccharides lipids proteins and other organic materials 21 24 the presence of nom in water might cause difficulties by interfering with the oxidant species or reacting with chemicals used in the treatment process or changing adsorption behavior of the materials in the systems 25 27 it has been found that dissolved organic matter dom is a redox active natural organic compound that can mediate biogeochemical redox reactions including the transfer of electrons from microorganisms to iron based materials and from abiotic reductants to organic pollutants 28 30 moreover dom can also act as a redox buffer agent which can accept electrons from anaerobic microbial respiration and donate electrons to oxygen to be re oxidized during aeration 28 there is evidence that the molecular weight distribution of nom differs from source to source and it can be affected by seasonal conversion 31 34 nom can be further isolated and fractionated into more homogeneous components based on different physicochemical properties such as molecular size or hydrophobicity 31 35 37 the molecular size of different nom fractions can be separated using a series of ultrafiltration membranes with specific molecular weight cut off mwco it is necessary to further fractionate and characterize nom sub fractions because the different quantity and chemistry of various nom fractions may have different reactivity and therefore understanding their behaviors in the system would help in designing a better treatment process in this study novel catalysts of a magnetic yolk shell structure fe3o4 sio2 and that decorated with copper nanoparticles fe3o4 sio2 cu were prepared via a modified sol gel process and their catalytic activities were investigated for the degradation of actm in a heterogeneous fenton like system the effects of h2o2 dosages catalysts dosages ph and ionic strength is were studied for a comprehensive understanding of the oxidative degradation of actm in the systems the interference of suwannee river nom on the catalytic activities of the prepared yolk shell structures was also investigated furthermore the nom was fractionated into different molecular sizes and their characterization and influence on the actm degradation were examined to provide insight into nom behavior in the systems 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials preparation 2 1 1 chemicals and materials

experimental setup can also be seen in our previous studies 8 13 14 2 3 sampling and analysis samples were collected at particular time intervals of the reaction and then instantly filtered through a

spectrophotometer uvmini 1240 shimadzu japan and a fluorescent spectrophotometer rf 5301 shimadzu japan adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in series batch reactors to determine the adsorption capacities of the prepared materials for each fraction of the nom 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of fe3o4 dosages the effects of the fe3o4 dosages on the actm degradation were investigated by varying its concentration from 0 10 to 0 80 g l for fe3o4 sio2 and from 0 02 to 0 20 g l for fe3o4 sio2 cu as shown in fig 1 the removal of actm was enhanced when the fe3o4 dosages increased in the investigated ranges the results suggested that the participation of the catalysts could accelerate the degradation of actm the increase in the fe3o4 dosage led to an increase in the number of active sites which favored hydrogen peroxide decomposition and generated more reactive hydroxyl radical oh 17 18 40 41 consequently the higher degradation efficiency obtained at higher fe3o4 dosages could be primarily attributed to the higher production of reactive radical in the systems in addition the better actm removal efficiency catalyzed by fe3o4 sio2 cu compared to that of its precursor was primarily due to the difference in their structure and the synergistic effects between iron and copper redox couples fe2 fe3 and cu cu2 in the systems which has been reported in detail in our previous study 13 3 2 effects of h2o2 dosages the effects of h2o2 concentration on the removal of actm using the two catalysts were also investigated fig 2 for both of the catalysts it was observed that actm degradation was enhanced with an increase in the h2o2 concentration from 5 0 to 15 0 mm this positive correlation could be attributed to the accelerated generation of reactive species when higher amounts of h2o2 were added 40 41 leading to a higher actm removal efficiency however the degradation efficiency decrease with a higher dosage of h2o2 25 mm which could be due to the scavenger effect of h2o2 when using it with an excessive dosage 42 44 the oh could react with excess h2o2 in the system according to reactions 1 and 2 to generate other radicals ho2 o2 18 41 45 which have significantly lower oxidative ability 13 therefore an appropriate initial h2o2 concentration 15 0 mm can be selected as the optimum oxidant concentration for the removal of actm in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction catalyzed by the prepared yolk shell structures 1 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 2 ho2 h o2 3 3 effects of ph the influence of the initial solution ph on catalytic oxidation of actm using the magnetic yolk shell structures are presented in fig 3 apparently the initial solution ph can significantly affect the degradation of actm both of the catalysts exhibited better catalytic activities at a ph of 3 0 but the metal leaching in the effluents made the catalysts less stable under these reaction conditions table 1 this is a major drawback for regeneration of the catalysts especially for the fe3o4 sio2 cu therefore the initial ph should be carefully considered before employing the materials in practical applications the actm removal efficiency decreased as a ph increase was observed for both of the catalysts which could be explained by the formation of a weaker oxidant i e feo2 and less generation of oh at higher ph values 17 18 another reason could be attributed to the reduction of the electrostatically attractive interaction between the catalysts and actm at higher solution ph values which was reflected in the adsorption data fig a1 however the degradation was insignificantly different when the ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the case of fe3o4 sio2 cu as the catalyst and complete actm removal could be achieved after 120 min of operation suggesting that the fe3o4 sio2 cu still exhibited excellent catalytic activity even at a high ph value the fact that fe3o4 sio2 cu could retain good catalytic activity in a wide range of ph values was partly due to the synergistic effect between iron and copper in its structure which favored the redox cycles of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu enhancing the catalytic reaction rate 8 46 47 in addition the low ph dependence property of copper nanoparticles could have allowed the catalyst to maintain its stability in a higher ph environment 48 50 3 4 effects of ionic strength figs 4 and a2 presents the removal of actm with different ionic strengths using nacl solution with an initial solution ph of 5 0 the actm removal efficiency was highly dependent on the ionic strength which was decreased as the ionic strength from increased from 0 0 to 100 0 mm chloride ions in the system could compete with h2o2 for complexation with iron ions reduce the h2o2 decomposition rate and inhibit the fenton like reaction by scavenging of the oh radical 51 53 the results of this experiment also confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the system which was verified in our previous work 13 an inhibitory effect of chloride ions on the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants in fenton like systems has also been reported in the literature 52 58 nitrate ions do not complex with fe2 or fe3 measurably nor do they react with hydroxyl radicals 51 therefore sodium nitrate and calcium nitrate were used to evaluate the effects of ionic strength on the removal of actm and the results in the presence of h2o2 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively these data in the absence of h2o2 were also provided in figs a3 and a4 respectively no significant change in the degradation of actm was observed for the two catalysts therefore it might be concluded that without the existence of reactive species scavengers and agents competing with h2o2 the removal of actm in the system was almost independent of the ionic strength 3 5 effects of natural organic matter the presence of nom in fenton like systems could affect the degradation of organic contaminants in different ways which could inhibit enhance or have no significant effect on the oxidation efficiency 59 64 in this study the variation of actm removal efficiencies with different nom concentrations is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that actm degradation by fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all of the investigated ranges of the nom concentration and the removal efficiency decreased with an increase in the nom concentration fig 7a meanwhile the nom exhibited markedly different responses when fe3o4 sio2 cu was used in the system fig 8 a low concentrations of nom 30 0 mg l could accelerate actm degradation while at higher levels it had an opposite effect on the degradation by reducing the activity of the catalyst cyclic voltammograms data indicated that the electron transfer capacities of the magnetic yolk shell structures after exposure to nom were higher compared to those of the catalysts in the systems without the addition of nom table 2 and fig a5 suggesting that nom at a certain concentration was able to mediate electron transfer in the system thereby improving the degradation efficiency however in the system catalyzed by the fe3o4 sio2 structures the decrease in the actm removal efficiency might have been due to the competitive adsorption of nom molecules on the silica shell or the scavenged reactive hydroxyl radicals 59 the adsorbed nom molecules could block the shell layer pores in the catalyst structure 65 66 and therefore the actm molecules could not penetrate through the silica shell to reach the inner active cores resulting in its complete degradation although the electron transfer capacity increased in the presence of nom table 2 its effects on the actm degradation were insufficient to overcome the influences of the competitive adsorption phenomenon and radical scavenging effects this was also partly reflected in the doc removal efficiency which decreased with an increase in the nom concentrations fig 7b in the system catalyzed by the fe3o4 sio2 cu structures as can be seen in fig 8a the degradation of actm was improved at low concentrations of nom 30 0 mg l the speeding up of the actm degradation rate could have been due to copper leaching in the system which could form complexes with nom and these complexes could accelerate the electron transfer in comparison to the fe3o4 sio2 59 64 the electron transfer capacity of the fe3o4 sio2 cu nom complexes was significantly higher than that of the original fe3o4 sio2 cu table 2 therefore nom at certain concentrations could accelerate the actm degradation in the system in addition it has also been reported previously 8 13 that the copper nanoparticles decorated on the surface of yolk shell structures brought great improvement in the catalytic activity so that they could also promote the decomposition of nom molecules to a certain level fig 8b however when an excess amount of nom was added the incomplete decomposition of adsorbed nom molecules on the material s surface could deactivate the active sites and lead to a decrease in the actm removal efficiency this was also reflected in the doc removal which decreased when the nom reached the concentration of 100 0 mg l fig 8b 3 6 effects of different nom sizes 3 6 1 nom characterization the properties of different nom types including nom 1 mwco 0 1 kda nom 2 mwco 1 2 kda nom 3 mwco 2 3 kda and nom 4 mwco 3 30 kda are presented in table 3 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 values and uv absorbance ratios a254 a204 a250 a365 was analyzed to confirm the success of the nom fractionation a higher value of suva254 suggested a high content of hydrophobic aromatic and high mw of the nom fraction 37 67 the uv absorbance ratio at a254 a204 was positively correlated with the hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio 68 69 and the ratio at a250 a365 was negatively correlated with the nom size 68 70 therefore the hydrophobic content increased as the nom molecular size increased the actm partition coefficient k increased with an increase in the nom size suggesting that actm had a higher sorption affinity to larger sized nom adsorption experiments indicated that fe3o4 sio2 showed better adsorption capacity for larger nom sizes while fe3o4 sio2 cu had a higher adsorption capacity for small nom molecules this result might have been due to the difference in surface characteristics of the two catalysts the decoration of copper nanoparticles on the surface of the silica shell might have led to an increase in the hydrophilic properties of the material which should be verified by further studies 3 6 2 effects of different nom fractions the effects of different nom size fractions on actm and doc removal of fe3o4 sio2 are presented in figs 9 and a6 it can be seen that nom inhibited the decomposition of actm in all of the investigated sizes fig 9a and the smaller nom molecules were more resistant to actm removal after 120 min of reaction the actm removal efficiencies decreased from 67 88 to 42 59 with a decrease in the investigated nom sizes the inhibition of actm removal was probably due to the competitive adsorption of nom molecules onto the surface which interfered with the movement of actm molecules into the hollow void spaces of the yolk shell structures 65 66 thereby slowing down the reaction rate the inhibition diminished with an increase in the nom size which was possibly due to the greater actm sorption affinity of larger nom sizes as discussed above consequently the removal of actm in the presence of nom in addition to the oxidative cause might have also been due to the adsorption process where the adsorption of larger nom molecules onto the material could result in partial removal of actm this was also verified by control experiments in the absence of h2o2 fig a6a in which actm was removed more as the nom size increased the doc of the samples was analyzed to support the discussion noted above figs 9b and a6b and fe3o4 sio2 exhibited better doc removal for larger nom molecules in both cases with the presence and absence of h2o2 this result again demonstrated that fe3o4 sio2 had a better ability to adsorb large nom molecules under the investigated conditions the effects of different nom size fractions on the actm and doc removal of fe3o4 sio2 cu are presented in figs 10 and a7 similar to fe3o4 sio2 all of the investigated nom fractions were observed to have their own impact on the decomposition of actm fig 10a however the larger nom molecules nom 3 and nom 4 were more resistant to actm removal while it was negligible with smaller nom molecules nom 1 and nom 2 despite the occurrence of competitive adsorption between nom and actm molecules the fe3o4 sio2 cu structures were demonstrated to have a very strong catalytic reactivity compared to that of the fe3o4 sio2 structures 13 so that the small nom molecules adsorbed on their surface could also be easily degraded fig 10b consequently the inhibition of small adsorbed nom molecules nom 1 and nom 2 on the degradation of actm was negligible with the larger nom sizes the inhibition of actm removal could have been due to the incomplete decomposition of adsorbed nom molecules which reduced the active sites and led to a decrease in the actm removal efficiency in addition the greater sorption affinity of actm for larger nom molecules non adsorbed fractions may have also contributed to the reduction of actm exposed to fe3o4 sio2 cu structures reducing the actm degradation rate the control experiments in the absence of h2o2 further confirmed the higher sorption affinity of actm toward larger nom molecules fig a7a it can be seen that actm was removed more with the presence of larger nom molecules the doc of the samples was also analyzed to support the discussion noted above figs 10b and a7b that fe3o4 sio2 cu exhibited better doc removal for smaller nom molecules in both of the cases with the presence and absence of h2o2 this result demonstrated again that fe3o4 sio2 cu had a better ability to adsorb smaller nom molecules under the investigated conditions 4 conclusions the results of this study suggested that the degradation of actm was primarily attributed to the catalytic oxidation reaction and it had a remarkable dependence on the fe3o4 and h2o2 dosages chloride ions and initial solution ph the actm degradation efficiency was quite independent on the ionic strength caused by nitrate ions the nom was observed to have different effects on the two catalysts fe3o4 sio2 cu catalytic activity was accelerated when the nom concentration was below 30 0 mg l and it was retarded at a higher level of nom while the catalytic activity of fe3o4 sio2 was inhibited at all of the ranges of investigated nom concentrations the hydrophobic content increased as the nom molecular size increased and the actm had a higher sorption affinity to larger sizes of nom fe3o4 sio2 showed better adsorption capacity for larger nom sizes while fe3o4 sio2 cu had a higher adsorption capacity for small nom sizes the smaller nom molecules were more resistant to actm removal of the yolk shell structures while they had an opposite influence on the system catalyzed by the copper decorated yolk shell
