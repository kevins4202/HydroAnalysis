membrane low cost efficiency enhancement harsh applications 1 introduction the rapid growth of industrialization and subsequent urbanization as well as population growth has led to water resource shortages becoming a serious global threat for sustainable development over the past decades it is well known that around 1 2 billion people have no or little access to safe and clean water and that millions of people die from severe waterborne diseases annually including 3 900 children every day dong et al 2006a malato et al 2009 therefore to meet rapidly increasing demands for clean water advanced water treatment technologies are highly desired featuring low cost and high efficiency membrane technology zoubeik et al 2018 as a highly efficient separation technology is increasingly applied for water treatment applications because of its unique advantages such as high separation efficiency facile operation minimized phase change low energy consumption small footprint and reduced chemical additive addition according to material composition classification separation membranes can be generally divided into organic and inorganic membranes the latter include not only ceramic and metal but zeolite and nano carbon membranes such as carbon nanotube cnts ang et al 2019 dong et al 2018 graphene oxide go gogoi et al 2018 and graphene gr liu et al 2015 which are commonly used as additives or coating layer as a kind of highly efficient and promising separation membrane fundamental research of ceramic membrane is rapidly developing fig 1 which is reflected by the exponential increase of the number of publications especially during the last decade fig 1a and 1b besides gas separation ceramic membranes are increasingly employed in water treatment applications such as oil water separation saline water refractory organic and emerging contaminant wastewaters fig 1c and 1d inorganic ceramic membranes composed of pure or composite oxides and non oxides generally perform much better than polymeric membranes fard et al 2018 besides some common applications the outstanding mechanically thermally and chemically robust characteristics make ceramic membranes more feasible and suitable especially when considered for use in harsh separation applications with extreme operating conditions abdullayev et al 2019 malzbender 2016 such as high temperature zhu et al 2019a highly corrosive environment lechner et al 2019 high salinity kurath et al 1997 and high pressure choudhury et al 2018 ceramic membrane one of the most promising membrane types dominates the inorganic membrane market and is rapidly expanding its applications for industrial use in china the scale of the membrane industry has been growing rapidly it is estimated that by 2024 the output value of china s membrane industry will reach 363 billion chinese yuan which is more than double that in 2017 http www cir cn according to a conservative estimate the gross sales of commercial ceramic membranes have accounted for 10 20 of the global whole membrane market which is annually growing at a rate as high as 35 worldwide cao et al 2013 in spite of increasing interest in fundamental research and industrial applications for ceramic membranes broader and larger scale applications of current ceramic membrane are greatly restricted due to their high capital cost compared to polymeric membranes and similar efficiency cost and efficiency are two important factors for ceramic membrane applications which pose significant challenges when being extensively used in wider range applications chen et al 2020a li et al 2017 wu et al 2022 zhu et al 2016a considering these two technical challenges for ceramic membrane application various strategies of decreasing cost and enhancing efficiency have been being increasingly the focus within academic communities such as the development of low cost membranes novel processing production techniques and various promising performance enhanced coupling techniques apart from gas separation hashim et al 2011 smart et al 2010 and energy applications thursfield et al 2012 some interesting reviews of ceramic membranes for water treatment applications have been also recently published samaei et al samaei et al 2018 presented laboratory analysis case studies and applications of pressure driven ceramic membrane technology for treatment of various industrial wastewaters such as mining food pulp and paper textile petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals for treatment of reclaimed water zoubeik et al zoubeik et al 2018 focused on the novel advances of both polymeric and ceramic membrane technologies to achieve membrane fouling mitigation and performance optimization such as permeate flux especially for oily water systems very recently several review papers with topics related to low cost ceramic membranes have been published due to increased research concerns hubadillah et al hubadillah et al 2018b introduced a comprehensive review focused on low cost ceramic membranes exclusively made from abundant mineral kaolin a traditional raw material for domestic and building ceramics discussing its mineral characteristics membrane fabrication techniques and membrane applications such as oily wastewater and membrane supports mestre et al mestre et al 2019 focused on classification of raw materials various manufacturing processes property characteristics and potential industrial applications of low cost ceramic membranes similarly issaoui and limousy issaoui and limousy 2019 gave a more comprehensive review mainly discussing preparation techniques and critical industrial and environmental applications of low cost ceramic membranes from economic and environmental perspectives despite these existing reviews mostly discussing classifications of low cost membranes and related applications this review places emphasize on cost and efficiency aspects of ceramic membranes focusing on an overview and sufficient discussion on various advanced strategies and mechanistic insights to lower cost and enhance efficiency this provides different and new insights of two key application oriented challenges in cost and efficiency in order to deeply understand their fundamental relationship after summarizing common challenges for current ceramic membranes this review begins with an up to date brief overview of recent developments of ceramic membranes as a necessary background for readers then after giving an analysis of cost factors for ceramic membranes different promising strategies for decreasing cost are discussed through employment of low cost membrane materials novel processing forming and sintering and modification techniques to fully address the issue of improved water treatment efficiency considerable insight is provided into recent major progress and mechanistic understanding of promising coupling techniques with membrane separation to significantly enhance treatment efficiency such as advanced oxidation and electrochemistry processes which are different from conventional strategies such as pretreatment membrane cleaning and membrane modification subsequently a review of recent progress of harsh water treatment applications in extreme environments using ceramic membrane is presented such as oil water separation saline water refractory organic and emerging contaminant wastewater treatment finally engineering applications conclusions and future perspectives of water treatment ceramic membranes are critically discussed from a new and different insight by deeply understanding two key issues of cost and treatment efficiency 2 recent development of ceramic membranes fig 2 presents a brief overview of key development milestones of ceramic membranes with a particular emphasis on novel ceramic membranes and important membrane applications the research of ceramic membranes originated in 1940s which was exclusively used in the nuclear industry for isotope separation of uranium where only ceramic ultrafiltration membranes were employed kurath et al 1997 at that time the potential for industrial separation applications of ceramic membrane had not been fully recognized and was slowly developing until early 1980s ceramic membranes were increasingly applied for water or gas based separations shoji et al 1988 since then tremendous advances have been made in scientific and technological aspects to improve ceramic membrane processes from research at laboratory scale to industrial implementation for various water treatment applications such as drinking water and industrial municipal wastewater treatment global research has demonstrated impressive developments in new membrane types more membrane processes such microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and separation applications leenaars et al 1984 ceramic membranes which can filter heavy metals oils and suspended solids were first used in the petrochemical manufacturing industry lahiere and goodboy 1993 then cicek et al cicek et al 1999 for the first time performed a pilot scale ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr system for the treatment of simulated municipal wastewater confirming that the formation of inorganic crystals could decrease operating cost and prolong the service lifespan due to mitigation of membrane fouling however high capital cost and insufficient treatment efficiency such as flux rejection and fouling still limit the large scale applications for economic water treatment in the last two decades emerging advances of various strategies have being witnessed to not only decrease cost but enhance efficiency of ceramic membranes fig 2 beyond conventional high purity ceramic membranes new types of ceramic membranes with lower cost have been developed using cheaper materials and new low cost processing techniques to address the issue of single separation function with moderate efficiency some novel coupling strategies are proposed to enhance treatment efficiency by developing ceramic membrane bioreactors catalytically or electrically active ceramic membranes that are advances over traditional cleaning and modification protocols with nano materials and nanotechnologies becoming ubiquitous advances in rational design and application of novel nano enhanced ceramic membranes with precise separation and excellent performance have been being emerging since 2010s ceramic membranes are promising and consequently increasingly employed in some harsh water treatment applications i e various refractory wastewaters where polymeric membranes cannot perform well during long term operation li et al 2021 wang et al 2022a yuan et al 2020 greater full scale ceramic membrane plants are successfully established and operated for various water treatment applications all over the world 3 low cost strategies of ceramic membranes currently commercially available ceramic membranes have limited materials mainly including ceramic oxides alumina al2o3 zirconia zro2 titanium oxide tio2 silicon oxide sio2 and their composites and non oxide ceramics silicon carbide sic and silicon nitride si3n4 generally ceramic membranes are much more costly than organic polymeric counterparts mainly due to expensive membrane materials and complicated fabrication and manufacturing processes in forming and sintering therefore it s highly necessary to develop new cost effective ceramic membranes with acceptable or even excellent performance suitable for broader applications there has been great interest over the last decade in decreasing costs of membrane materials forming and sintering to consequently lower the cost of ceramic membranes hubadillah et al 2018b issaoui and limousy 2019 mestre et al 2019 3 1 cost factor analysis of ceramic membranes in practical industrial applications cost calculation of separation membrane is a complicated process depending many factors which is quite different from laboratory scale outcomes nevertheless our review here gives a cost estimation of ceramic membrane which are simplified at an ideal case by comprehensively considering membrane cost including material cost processing cost and maintenance cost including cleaning cost during whole service lifespan monash and pugazhenthi 2011 herein the concept of membrane life cycle cost is proposed which is shown in eq 1 1 cos t life cycle cos t mem cos t maint t lifespan where cost mem and cost maint are the membrane cost and maintenance cost respectively and t lifespan a means the whole service lifespan of ceramic membrane particularly cost mem consists of material cost and processing cost that in most cases directly reflects membrane price life cycle cost includes both membrane cost and maintenance cost over the entire predicted service life indeed compared with polymeric membranes 20 200 m 2 bhide and stern 1991 monash and pugazhenthi 2011 vasanth et al 2011 commercial al2o3 and zro2 based ceramic membranes have much higher costs which are in the range of 500 3 000 m 2 or higher mestre et al 2019 nandi et al 2011 which significantly limits their extensive applications in more industrial processes some increasing efforts have been made using inorganic wastewater sludges chen et al 2020a mukherjee et al 2019 solid wastes dong et al 2010 natural minerals das et al 2016 or other cheap materials as starting materials for membrane fabrication this not only achieves high valued recycling of these waste materials along with significant reduction of waste for disposal but also more importantly to significantly decrease membrane cost interestingly the cost of mineral or waste based membrane materials only ranges from 2 m 2 to 130 m 2 abdullayev et al 2019 only accounting for 1 500 1 4 of commercial ceramic membranes materials which can be expected to significantly decrease membrane price when scalable manufacture can be realized unlike polymeric membranes that are produced without sintering high processing cost dominates ceramic membrane cost with the energy cost associated with high sintering temperatures being a major cost compared with more expensive pure oxide or non oxide ceramic membranes lower membrane cost can be realized due to not only much cheaper raw materials but also lower sintering processing cost arising from the presence of minor oxide impurities that act as sintering aids 1 100 1 3 of pure ceramic membrane hubadillah et al 2018b mestre et al 2019 in addition to low cost membrane materials some novel forming and sintering techniques have also been being rapidly developed to decrease processing costs such as centrifugal casting kim et al 2000 kim et al 2002 phase inversion dong et al 2008a he et al 2014 co sintering feng et al 2007a zou et al 2019 and low temperature sintering monash and pugazhenthi 2011 wang et al 2019b these techniques are quite promising from the viewpoint of reducing processing cost by decreasing both forming and sintering cycles or decreasing final sintering dwell temperature ceramic membranes are commonly considered as being more expensive i e higher membrane cost for commercial application than polymeric membranes but this opinion usually neglects the advantage of lower maintenance cost due reduced cleaning frequency no breakage and longer service lifespan due to their more robust characteristics maintenance cost should be considered for the entire service life of the membranes which largely depends on membrane cleaning and service life monash and pugazhenthi 2011 additionally while the cost of ceramic membranes per m2 is high significantly higher flux e g above 200 l m 2 h 1 can often be achieved due to their unique structure and property consequently lowering the capital cost difference between polymeric and ceramic membranes on a cost per m3 of treated water basis dow et al 2015 furthermore robust ceramic membranes show a more excellent structural stability without performance degradation associated with breakage or increased pore size as a result of backwashing cran et al 2022 and can even be cleaned with strongly acidic or alkaline chemical agents or under high pressure back flushing blanpain avet et al 2009 in summary since mineral or waste based ceramic membranes are prepared using cheap materials by novel fabrication techniques with lower processing cost they have lower membrane cost than pure ceramic membranes and lower maintenance cost with longer service lifespan than polymeric membranes they have been made in laboratories but need further demonstration in industry 3 2 key cost issues for current ceramic membranes although they are increasingly used in various industrial separation processes current porous ceramic membranes have very limited membrane materials types and configuration high purity macro porous alumina α al2o3 and silicon carbide sic are usually used as membrane support which can be steadily produced or manufactured by some well developed forming techniques such as powder pressing chakradhar et al 2006 dong et al 2011b paste extrusion process jedidi et al 2009 khider et al 2004 or advanced colloidal process monash et al 2013 followed by high temperature sintering finer ceramic powders such as zirconia zro2 titanium oxide tio2 silicon oxide sio2 and their composites or their precursors are deposited as interlayer or final function separation layer by dip coating or spray coating techniques cuo et al 2019 jamaludin et al 2016 followed by sintering or calcination flat sheet ceramic membranes were initially used in laboratory scale studies elgamouz and tijani 2018 but have recently been increasingly employed for industrial wastewater treatment umezawa et al 2003 by comparison single channel or multi channel tubular membranes are more popular due to their higher membrane area per unit volume i e higher packing density consequently featuring higher treatment capacity or process efficiency zhu et al 2015c for commercial porous ceramic membranes multi channel configuration is usually adopted for large scale industrial application due to the additional outstanding mechanical stability in order to meet various separation requirements porous ceramic membranes with different microstructures are rationally designed and fabricated featuring highly controllable pore size porosity thickness permeability and mechanical properties jiang et al 2013 3 2 1 high membrane materials cost selection or synthesis of ceramic membrane materials is considered as a primary factor for both fundamental laboratory study and engineering applications however high purity oxide or non oxide ceramic powders 500 1000 m 2 or chemically pure precursors more expensive available in the market are not only expensive but have limited types furthermore high sintering temperature is also required especially for ceramic supports which can be as high as 1500 1700 c consequently greatly increasing the whole ceramic membrane cost monash et al 2013 usually the cost of conventional ceramic membrane materials is in the range of 500 1000 m 2 while the cost would be as low as 2 130 m 2 when wastes or minerals are used as membrane materials abdullayev et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to develop locally available abundant low cost membrane materials as alternatives for current commercial ceramic membrane materials 3 2 2 high forming and sintering cost current fabrication techniques such as powder pressing paste and colloidal processes α al2o3 and sic for support zro2 tio2 sio2 and their composites or their precursors for interlayer or final layers are quite effective and facile for ceramic membrane fabrication monash et al 2013 there are still some existing challenging issues such as complicated forming and sintering processes evolving repeated multi steps especially for fabrication of multi layered membrane for both ceramic support and membrane layers inevitably prolonging the whole fabrication duration and consequently increasing the processing cost chakradhar et al 2006 luyten et al 1997 for instance during colloidal processing for ceramic support fabrication it usually requires quite complicated steps including powder synthesis and purification colloidal suspension preparation consolidation solvent phase removal drying and final high temperature sintering monash et al 2013 coating of one or more layers on ceramic supports is needed to form an asymmetrical membrane structure which is usually a more popular membrane structure for practical applications and required for smaller pore size membranes development of alternative low cost forming and sintering techniques is highly desirable to further decrease processing cost in one word besides expensive raw materials complicated forming processes and high sintering cost push more researchers to focus on the exploration of alternate forming and sintering techniques for current ceramic membrane to significantly decrease membrane processing cost some promising strategies for decreasing cost of ceramic membranes will be presented and discussed regarding the development of mineral or waste based membrane and employment of novel lower cost processing techniques for water treatment applications where acceptable or better membrane performance and lower cost are highly required 3 3 development of low cost ceramic membranes compared with expensive commercial ceramic powders much lower cost inorganic materials such as silicate wastes or minerals can be potentially considered as promising alternatives for fabrication of low cost ceramic membranes table 1 significantly decreasing membrane material cost moreover some other low cost materials such as portland cement and geopolymer cement could also be used to decrease the costs of ceramic membranes due to their novel sintering free fabrication routes abdullayev et al 2019 3 3 1 mineral based ceramic membranes there are numerous available low cost natural minerals containing naturally occurring silicates aluminosilicates and phosphates which are composed of silica alumina as main components as well as other metal oxides as minor components even without being processed by any industrial refinements these much cheaper minerals could be suitably recognized as potential alterative materials for fabrication of ceramic membranes for water treatment applications after forming and sintering low cost ceramic membrane were developed using various minerals such as kaolin clay bouzerara et al 2006 elgamouz and tijani 2018 rekik et al 2017 natural zeolite aloulou et al 2017 dong et al 2006a englert and rubio 2005 apatite dong et al 2009c li et al 2016b quartz sand foughali et al 2016 kouras et al 2017 and natural pozzolan beqqour et al 2019 table 1 significantly decreasing membrane material cost 2 130 m 2 compared with some conventional commercial ceramic membrane materials 500 1000 m 2 abdullayev et al 2019 the first concern is design of target phases of ceramic membranes for special application requirements based on phase diagram principle via sintering minerals with or without other minor components the phases are usually composed of multi metal oxides such as mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 2al2o3 sio2 dong et al 2009c zhu et al 2019a cordierite 2mgo 2al2o3 5sio2 dong et al 2007b dong et al 2009a and anorthite cao al2o3 2sio2 shen et al 2016 deep understanding on phase formation mechanisms during ceramic membrane sintering is an important fundamental issue quantification or semi quantification of various crystalline phases at different sintering conditions can be realized via some powerful advanced tools such as rietveld refinement and rir method of xrd patterns tang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a for potential filtration separation applications characterization of membrane structures are focused on porosity pore size distribution and gas or water permeation performance rational tailoring of ceramic membrane structures can also be used to achieve high water flux and favorable mechanical and surface properties various material properties are also of interest such as mechanical strength hydrophilicity acidic or alkaline corrosion resistance and even thermal expansion co efficient furthermore the presence of other minor metal oxide impurities with low melting point in most minerals is beneficial for decreasing the sintering temperature because they decrease the melting point of the composite material enabling liquid phase formation at lower temperature that plays a key role in sintering i e liquid phase sintering this is different from the sintering process for current commercial ceramic membranes where additional sintering aids are required fukushima et al 2009 heras juaristi et al 2016 yao et al 2014 since high purity alumina such as α alumina γ alumina and β alumina or aluminum hydroxide are industrially manufactured from bauxite mineral considering its cheaper and abundant features some studies have recently focused on the employment of kaolin or bauxite as a low cost alternative for pure alumina for mullite ceramic membrane fabrication dong et al 2018 li et al 2015b lu et al 2014 zhu et al 2016b zeolite minerals which are composed of aluminosilicates with a three dimensional framework structure bearing alo4 and sio4 tetrahedra englert and rubio 2005 could also be an excellent candidates for fabrication of microfiltration membranes low cost ceramic membranes prepared from these materials exhibit similar or even higher performance compared to conventional ceramic membranes identifying a promising approach to reducing ceramic membrane fabrication costs nevertheless compared with pure commercial ceramic powders the element and phase compositions of most mineral powders are complicated and vary between their source locations even for the same bulk mineral there is greater uncertainty with regards to material performance for natural mineral or waste products due to the diversity of minor components within their structures such as mullite and spinel cordierite table 1 moreover since the particle size of mineral or waste powders varies sieving or size classification is required for large scalable application which needs to be solved to fabricate highly porous ceramic membranes with better permeation performance 3 3 2 waste based ceramic membranes besides natural minerals using similar methodologies inorganic industrial solid state wastes have been attracting increased interests in development of low cost ceramic membranes via a sustainable green chemistry protocol due to their promising advantages such as abundantly available resource much lower cost and greater environmental benefits shen et al 2016 table 1 the cost of waste based ceramic membranes is tremendously decreased which material prices ranging from 2 to 130 m 2 more importantly the feasible recycling of these wastes could solve problems of environmental pollution which is of great significance from both economic and environmental perspectives liu et al 2016 as an abundant by product massively produced from coal combustion in thermal power plants coal fly ash poses serious global environmental safety issues related to its stacking or filling utilization of coal fly ash as a cement additive is one of the traditional recycling methods however high value added waste recycling is a more promising way not only to address its environmental issue but to develop low cost functional membrane materials for environmental applications since the main chemical components of coal fly ash silica alumina are similar to those of clays and kaolin it is highly suitable for the fabrication of low cost ceramic membranes such as mullite fu et al 2019a lu et al 2014 zhu et al 2015b cordierite dong et al 2006b shen et al 2016 and anorthite wei et al 2016 in order to improve membrane performance such as strength and permeation a highly porous whisker constructed membrane structure was proposed to develop better mullite ceramic membranes via a waste to resource strategy which are different from conventional particulate packing membrane structures such an inter locking structure consisting of mullite whiskers can be realized by using single or mixed additives such as alf3 li et al 2012b peng and sorrell 2004 v2o5 li et al 2009 mgo dong et al 2011a tio2 dong et al 2010 moo3 fu et al 2019a wo3 chen et al 2016 kong et al 2003 moo3 alf3 zhu et al 2015a and v2o5 alf3 cao et al 2014 via vapor solid or vapor solid liquid reaction mechanisms significantly promoting the formation of elongated mullite whiskers or nanowires wastewater sludges generated from industrial wastewater treatment often contain elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as copper nickel zinc chromium and manganese which are detrimental to the environment and human health swierk et al 2007 they could also provide rich active element resource for synthesis of spinel ab2o4 a mg2 fe2 zn2 mn2 co2 ni2 cd2 b al3 cr3 fe3 co3 ceramics in spite of increased complexity for control of membrane formation similar to natural minerals the use of inorganic industrial solid state wastes also shows challenging issues related to complicated element and phase compositions and pretreatment this results in uncertainty with regard to final membrane properties and may require the diversity of processing conditions during ceramic membrane preparation during ceramic membrane sintering process not only major metal ions but trace amounts of other heavy metal ions are efficiently stabilized into ceramic crystalline lattice via solid dissolution mechanism nevertheless considering the presence of minor heavy metal ions in mineral or waste materials possible environmental risk of mineral based or waste based ceramic membranes such as the leaching of metal ions should be carefully considered especially when being used in water treatment applications in highly acidic or alkaline conditions under long term operation it is feasible to fabricate or produce high quality mf and uf ceramic membranes from cheap mineral or waste materials but it is much more challenging to fabricate high quality nf ceramic membranes since not only the quality of membrane support but synthesis conditions need to be very high for nf membranes 3 4 development of low cost processing techniques besides decreasing material costs the development of low cost fabrication techniques is considered such as novel forming centrifugal casting and phase inversion and sintering techniques low temperature sintering and co sintering table 2 these techniques are quite promising to reduce processing cost through decreasing both forming and sintering cycles or decreasing final sintering temperature 3 4 1 low cost forming techniques one of the bottlenecks for current commercial ceramic membranes is their higher cost than polymeric counterparts due to complicated fabrication technique in particularly in forming process falamaki and veysizadeh 2006 considering that conventional processing techniques need multiple forming cycles extensive research efforts have been dedicated to developing more simplified forming techniques to minimize the forming steps which could effectively decrease the cost of membrane fabrication bouzerara et al 2015 zhu et al 2016a as an alternative solution centrifugal casting technique is promising in creation of an asymmetrical gradient membrane structure in one step during tubular membrane fabrication kim et al 2000 unlike conventional multi layered ceramic membranes fabricated via multi step coating sintering cycles fig 3 a the asymmetrical uniform gradient microstructure does not have interface bonding issues fig 3b centrifugal casting is a promising technique to fabricate tubular ceramic membranes or supports for further deposition of membrane layers such a one step forming process not only leads to lower processing cost but significantly avoids defects falamaki and veysizadeh 2008 nevertheless it can be only employed in fabrication of single channel structured membranes which is not suitable for multi channel membranes different from centrifugal casting technique phase inversion based processes such as dry wet spinning tape casting and gel casting could usually be used in fabricating ceramic membranes with various configurations such as hollow fiber tubular and flat membranes after sintering the membrane often shows an asymmetric two layered or multi layered structure thick and porous layer acting as support and thin layer providing separation function fig 3c and 3d he et al 2014 smid et al 1996 one of key advantages of this process is that the formation and sintering of asymmetric membrane structures can be realized in only one step consequently reducing forming and sintering cost wei et al 2008 generally phase inversion based dry wet spinning technique is used to fabricate hollow fiber membranes while various other phase inversion based casting techniques are used to fabricate tubular or flat membranes li et al 2015a zhang et al 2020 although hollow fiber ceramic membranes can offer outstanding thermal mechanical and chemical stabilities in harsh gas and water treatment applications their brittleness and poor processability limit their practical applications in contrast metal based membranes such as stainless steel and copper are mechanically stronger and more ductile which makes them ideal candidates to fully address these mechanical issues shi et al 2022 si et al 2020 wang et al 2016a 3 4 2 low cost sintering techniques high sintering cost is a challenging issue for scalable production and application of commercial ceramic membranes which usually need high sintering temperature especially for membrane supports 1500 1700 c and repeated multi cycle sintering procedures for multi layered membranes resulting in high energy consumption monash et al 2013 to overcome this key issue various low cost sintering techniques such as low temperature sintering with addition of sintering additives shen et al 2016 and multi layer co sintering liu et al 2012 have been proposed recently table 2 during sintering the formation of a low melting point liquid phase with additional sintering additives deng et al 2003 or inherent components han et al 2003 was very beneficial to not only decrease sintering temperature but also to improve the final performance of ceramic membranes such as mechanical properties without water permeation degradation low cost mineral or waste based materials contain not only al and si oxides but also other minor oxide elements such as na ca k and mg that can significantly reduce sintering temperature due to their low melting point rekik et al 2017 in addition sintering additive mixtures were also confirmed to be effective in lowering phase formation temperatures for mullite ceramic membranes dong et al 2011a dong et al 2010 low temperature sintering mechanisms with these additives are proposed via various micro structural characterizations which is a challenging task for applied fundamental research when other new additives are applied alternatively multi layer co sintering is another promising approach table 2 for conventional ceramic membranes sintering process evolves repeated multi steps especially for fabrication of multi layered membranes inevitably prolonging the whole fabrication duration and increasing processing cost given similar sintering kinetic characteristics of different powders two or more layers can be co fired in one step after multi step formation co sintering is quite promising to reduce processing cost and sintering duration through decreasing the number of sintering cycles into a single step greatly decreasing energy cost zou et al 2019 for this promising technique a comprehensive consideration of key parameters such as powder size and sintering activity zou et al 2018 membrane thickness feng et al 2007b and co sintering temperature dong et al 2007a is highly desired for fabrication of high quality multi layer membranes 4 water treatment efficiency of ceramic membranes besides high cost improving treatment efficiency is another key challenging issue for current ceramic membrane processes such as micro filtration ultra filtration and nano filtration where trans membrane pressure difference as driving force is dominant always showing single separation function there are still some challenges existing in these membrane processes such as membrane fouling secondary pollution of treated concentrates performance degradation in water permeability and selectivity i e rejection under long term operation to compensate for these issues various promising methods have been being employed to significantly enhance treatment efficiency via traditional membrane fouling control strategies or some advanced coupling techniques such as advanced oxidation and electrochemical protocols 4 1 key issues of treatment efficiency ceramic membranes have gained great interest for use in various water treatment applications over the past few decades owing to its excellent chemical thermal and mechanical stability low fouling property and long service lifespan however an ubiquitous trade off issue between permeability and selectivity always exists in synthetic membranes including ceramic membranes meaning that highly permeable membranes are lack of selectivity and vice versa park et al 2017 except for homogeneous nonporous polymeric membranes for gas separations the upper bound behavior also could be observed in both dense and porous membranes therefore there is a pressing need for the balance between membrane permeability and selectivity for ceramic membranes various approaches such as structure design and thickness regulation have been employed to break the permeability selectivity trade off of ceramic membrane on one hand controllably tailoring pore size and distribution and morphologies is quite effective to potentially achieve a satisfactory high selectivity with narrow pore size distribution park et al 2017 on the other hand rational design of defect free ultra thin membrane sometimes featuring a multi layer asymmetrical structure could also improve water permeation flux generally ceramic membranes are often prone to lower fouling than polymer membranes due to their better surface hydrophilicity wang et al 2017b however during practical separation processes membrane fouling is still a challenging technical bottleneck which greatly restricts its further large scale industrial application in high efficiency membrane filtration system it would directly lead to continuous attenuation and deterioration of membrane permeation flux increasing the operating cost of the whole system jiang et al 2013 to restore membrane performance especially flux frequent cleaning operations are always needed increasing operating costs in spite of selectivity improvement although membrane cleaning can partially recover flux i e reversible fouling it is still difficult to completely remove some foulants i e irreversible foulants therefore it is necessary to efficiently control and mitigate ceramic membrane fouling to achieve high separation efficiency in the membrane filtration process generally membrane fouling results from physical and chemical adsorption and deposition of various foulants on the membrane surface and pores as well as mechanical interception between foulants and membrane surface blocking filtration laws were first studied and proposed by hermans and brédee in 1935 iritani and katagiri 2016 then hermans made a critical study of all four possible fouling models including complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking cake filtration and standard pore blocking fig 4 hermia 1982 for reversible fouling foulants can be completely removed by physical cleaning while for irreversible fouling all foulants can only be removed by using strong chemical agents fig 5 4 2 traditional and novel strategies for enhancing efficiency 4 2 1 traditional fouling control strategies for wastewaters their components are always very complicated long term filtration operation causes membrane fouling increasing transmembrane pressure and or decreasing permeate flux yin et al 2013 the complicated interactions between membrane surface and foulants is the most important factor dominating membrane fouling during filtration process where gradual accumulation of foulants seriously degrade the filtration performance of ceramic membranes thus reducing membrane service lifespan and increasing operation cost chan and chen 2004 therefore effective strategies to control membrane fouling should be taken to improve separation efficiency such as pretreatment arndt et al 2016 membrane cleaning tomaszewska and bialonczyk 2012 and membrane surface modification li et al 2012a 4 2 1 1 pretreatment to reduce the burden of membrane operation unit it is highly desired and feasible to develop advanced pretreatment methods before membrane separation via employing various physical or chemical technologies such as adsorption chung et al 2019a zhang et al 2014b coagulation flocculation hoeg et al 2015 zielinska and galik 2017 coarse filtration charfi et al 2018 dickhout et al 2017 and advanced oxidation hamid et al 2017 liu et al 2019 natural organic matter nom widely existing in various wastewaters is considered to be a major foulant for ceramic membrane fouling as a well developed technique adsorption is usually employed to effectively remove these large sized substances to avoid subsequent membrane fouling using various promising water stable adsorbents other typical organic compounds such as humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa molecular weight 600 3000 da can diffuse and be adsorbed in most carbon based adsorbents via effective interactions between adsorbent site and adsorbate functional groups making adsorption an effective pretreatment strategy to reduce organic fouling chin et al 1994 however the key issues still have to be carefully addressed such as efficiency recovery and regeneration of adsorbents moreover other pretreatment methods such as coagulation one of the most prevalent methods for the removal of aqueous particulate and colloidal foulants can also mitigate ceramic membrane fouling go et al 2016 where in line coagulation could enhance permeate flux and decrease transport resistance caused by internal pore blocking during ceramic membrane ultrafiltration process however coagulation flocculation often fails to completely remove suspended impurities some remaining impurities can be further removed by coarse filtration techniques such as coarse strainer and granular media filtration gmf anis et al 2019 in particular gmf has become one of the most popular conventional pretreatment processes used for large scale seawater desalination plants darwish et al 2016 jeong et al 2016 since ozone o3 has strong oxidation ability the feasible coupling of catalytic and direct ozonation with ceramic membrane separation could also address membrane fouling issues especially for refractory organic foulants such as nitrobenzene and tetrachloroethylene via an oxidation degradation mechanism involving the formation of hydroxyl radicals or other radicals at the membrane surface li et al 2017 zhao et al 2009 application of economic o3 as pretreatment protocol significantly mitigated membrane fouling because of the reaction between o3 and nom species effectively recovering permeate flux karnik et al 2005 this pretreatment not only improved water permeability but simultaneously decreased both reversible and irreversible fouling even showing much better performance than biological activated carbon bac pretreatment or ozone and bac o3 bac pretreatment at an appropriate ozonation dosage hamid et al 2017 4 2 1 2 membrane cleaning in comparison with pretreatment methods membrane cleaning is the most commonly used approach to maintain or recover the permeability of ceramic membranes which can be generally divided into physical cleaning kumar et al 2007 oligny et al 2016 and chemical cleaning blanpain avet et al 2009 tomaszewska and bialonczyk 2012 usually physical cleaning is evaluated using three key parameters percentage flux recovery irreversible fouling percent and hydraulic cleanliness criterion which represents the ratio of residual fouling resistance to initial membrane resistance chemical cleaning may also be evaluated by measuring residual protein amount retained on the membrane surface after cleaning blanpain avet et al 2009 in general initial ceramic membrane fouling i e reversible fouling was characterized by a pore blocking mechanism which then converted into a cake filtration mechanism and was usually removable by physical cleaning such as rinsing and backwashing in contrast internal reversible foulants and irreversible foulants could only be removed by more harsh chemical cleaning lee et al 2013 for physical cleaning applying external mechanical force plays a key role in removing foulants from ceramic membrane surface or pores via various washing techniques lamminen et al 2004 such as low pressure high velocity cleaning back pressure washing other enhanced cleaning strategies such as ultrasonic pulse and nano bubble and their combined techniques ultrasonic cleaning technology has been extensively employed as one of the most efficient methods for ceramic membrane cleaning given the inherent robust characteristic of ceramic membranes one of the key advantages of this method is no destruction or damage of the ceramic membrane structure chen et al 2006 recently some researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of an ultrasound protocol for effectively cleaning membrane surfaces maintaining high permeate flux kobayashi et al 1999 in general cleaning efficiency was increased with an increase of ultrasonic cleaning power or combination with chemical agents however decreasing energy consumption while maintaining excellent cleaning efficiency is still a challenging task for practical industrial applications pulse assisted backwashing is also commonly used for fouling mitigation for large size ceramic membrane modules due to its merits such as cost effectiveness high cleaning efficiency rapid flux recovery and simple operation in practice it is difficult to completely restore permeate flux via only physical cleaning especially for seriously fouled ceramic membranes in which membrane pores are heavily adsorbed or plugged by natural organic matters or other substances consequently chemical cleaning must be considered as an alternative when water flux decreases to 40 50 of the initial flux blanpain avet et al 2009 by considering the inherent properties and interactions of foulants and ceramic membrane it is significant to choose an effective cheap and non toxic cleaning agent to ensure efficient foulant removal for performance recovery while also not degrading the membrane structure commonly acidic agents are used to remove inorganic foulants while alkaline agents are more suitable for organic foulants removal li et al 2020 sodium hypochlorite naclo and sodium hydroxide naoh are commonly used alkali agents which can remove foulants via the process mechanisms such as oxidation hydrolysis and solubilization regula et al 2014 this cleaning strategy weakens the adhesion between foulants and membrane surface consequently recovering flux very efficiently in practice chemically enhanced backwashing is sometimes used but less frequently to regularly clean the membrane during backwashing to effectively maintain efficient operating performance li et al 2018b in recent years more environmentally sustainable alternative cleaning methods have been also proposed such as green o3 assisted cleaning ozonated water is always used to replace clean water in the surface flushing process for more highly efficient cleaning of ceramic membranes moreover besides green and harmless features the use of o3 could effectively remove biopolymers and humic substances for reducing organic fouling and thus improving flux hamid et al 2017 moreover increased performance of ceramic membranes with high flux was demonstrated with continuous dosing of ozone dow et al 2015 in addition on line chemical cleaning with o3 is often considered a eco friendly and safer strategy for ceramic membrane bioreactor sun et al 2018a unlike naclo the exposure of ozone in ceramic mbr triggered much less release of dom where high concentration ozone was found to effectively reduce the generation of biopolymers via degradation of larger biopolymers into low molecular weight substances for assuring long term process sustainability in ceramic mbr sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b 4 2 1 3 membrane modification generally hydrophilic membranes could show lower membrane fouling propensity than hydrophobic membranes for treatment of most wastewaters zhang et al 2011 in addition to excellent mechanical thermal and chemical stability and longer life time robust ceramic membranes are generally preferred particularly due to their excellent hydrophilicity and surface charge characteristics inherently ceramic membranes are hydrophilic in nature due to the existence of surface metal hydroxyl groups lu et al 2016 tian et al 2018 however hydrophilicity degrades more or less after high temperature sintering which is a required step during membrane production improving membrane surface hydrophilicity is always a promising strategy to mitigate membrane fouling santos and judd 2010 considering that the complicated interactions between ceramic membrane surface and foulants dominate membrane fouling during filtration surface modification with better surface engineering characteristics such as hydrophilicity surface potential and surface micro nano structure e g surface patterning is another promising strategy to effectively mitigate membrane fouling usman et al 2021 this method is very promising from the viewpoint of first improving membrane properties without subsequent additional operations consequently saving more operation cost promising surface modification strategies include hydrophilic monomer grafting kujawa 2019 nanoparticle modification guo et al 2016 and surface patterning lyu et al 2020 for example surface patterning of alumina ceramic membrane via three dimension printing was confirm to be a novel strategy to notably increase steady flux and antifouling ability lyu et al 2020 the key aim of these methods is to effectively improve membrane surface engineering characteristics such as hydrophilicity and roughness at a nano or molecular level while not significantly altering pore size rejection and permeation performance surface grafting usually involves the formation of strong chemical bonds between modifier molecules and membrane surface grafting hydrophilic substances onto the alumina anoporetm membrane surface could cause mitigation of significant membrane fouling and flux improvement when compared with the unmodified membranes yeu et al 2009 this protocol presents a promising alternative approach for rationally designing ceramic membranes with alterable organic surface layers which are different from the original ceramic surface furthermore some other antifouling grafting protocols such as phosphonic acid grafting have also been developed lee et al 2016 mustafa et al 2014 despite enhanced anti fouling abilities however grafting of hydrophilic molecules sometimes suffers from issues such as the weak bonding between hydrophilic organic molecules and membrane surfaces resulting in degradation of hydrophilicity and the introduction of potentially toxic substances especially during long term operation recently metal oxide nanoparticles such as tio2 have been increasingly used for surface modification of ceramic membranes achieving great breakthroughs in water and wastewater treatment kim and van der bruggen 2010 usually via formation of a coating surface modification with nano tio2 can increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces enabling highly efficient treatment of wastewaters with enhanced anti fouling ability however possible release or leaching of nanoparticles is a key issue during practical operation especially under harsh conditions such as high pressure and cross flow mode leading inevitably to decreased antifouling ability with time in addition design of top ceramic active layer with a gradient profile was confirm to a promising strategy to not only enable good mechanical stability but enhance filtration performance during operation where membrane fouling decreased with increasing gradient profile ng et al 2020 besides membrane modification the diminishing of membrane foulant interactions such as polar electrostatic and π π interactions was conformed to play a more important role in mitigating fouling of ceramic membrane mustafa et al 2016a b 4 2 2 advanced oxidation enhanced membrane separation advanced oxidation processes aops are able to efficiently degrade and mineralize recalcitrant organic pollutants in various wastewaters li et al 2017 tian et al 2012 generally robust ceramic membranes are more preferred over their polymeric counterparts for combining with advanced oxidation processes due to their much better structural and chemical stability particularly anti oxidation ability song et al 2017 in addition ceramic membranes also offer outstanding mechanical and thermal stability anti swelling ability and long life time dong et al 2018 to effectively mitigate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality ceramic membranes can be used as separation medium coupled with various advanced oxidation technologies table 3 as a dominant promising technology hydroxyl radical oh based aops hr aops such as ozonation oxidation liu et al 2019 and photocatalytic oxidation yang et al 2019 can generate highly active radicals to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling and achieve remarkable improvement in water treatment efficiency while keeping membrane structure undamaged zhang et al 2015 fig 6 shows the production mechanisms of oh and so4 active free radicals in typical advanced oxidation processes direct and catalytic ozonation can be efficiently coupled with ceramic membrane separation via generating highly active free radicals oh to in situ degrade organic foulants li et al 2017 for membrane separation coupled with direct ozonation pretreatment or in situ treatment with o3 could greatly reduce membrane fouling because ozone induced coagulation and an oxidized surface for the aggregates hamid et al 2017 however due to an unfavorable self decomposition of o3 at ambient conditions low utilization rate of o3 with low free radicals yield further limits its wider range applications different from direct ozonation catalytic ozonation is more beneficial to obtain an improved production efficiency of oh since o3 can be highly efficiently locally catalyzed by active catalysts featuring an enhanced oxidation zhao et al 2015a therefore it is more effective to mitigate membrane fouling which highly relies on the reaction between o3 and active catalysts such as noble metals and metal oxides mansas et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 6a the reaction between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts would generate oh to effectively degrade mineralize organic foulants r into harmless inorganics such as co2 h2o and other minerals zhao et al 2016 furthermore novel magnéli phase tino2n 1 4 n 10 has also been demonstrated to be more promising in advanced oxidation process due to its unique advantages such as environmental friendliness excellent robustness and stability and superior catalytic ozonation capability with low metal leaching 0 15 mg l 1 especially for degradation and mineralization of refractory organic foulants esfahani et al 2017 mao et al 2018 if coated on ceramic membrane surface it would achieve a dual function of separation and catalytic degradation however it is sometimes hard to precisely control the proper or optimized dosage of ozone in practical wastewater treatment plants where in most cases an over consumption inevitably increases operation cost yang et al 2019 photocatalysis is a promising degradation technology one of its major limitations is the removal and recovery of photocatalyst power from water after photocatalytic reaction in contrast membrane separation coupled with photocatalytic oxidation is increasingly applied as a promising environmentally sustainable way to eliminate ceramic membrane fouling without the use of any chemical reagents table 3 to overcome the challenging issues of catalyst recovery it is highly feasible to stably immobilize functional photo catalysts onto porous membranes to achieve simultaneous separation and catalytic degradation of refractory contaminants szymanski et al 2017 this catalysis separation coupling strategy can also in situ mitigate ceramic membrane fouling during filtration semiconductor photo catalysts such as tio2 zno wo3 and fe2o3 have been effectively immobilized into robust ceramic membranes fresno et al 2014 among them cost effective tio2 based photo catalysts have received numerous attentions in recent years yang et al 2019 once catalyst such as tio2 is illuminated by uv or visible light i e sunlight the generated oh would mitigate membrane fouling via a photocatalytic oxidation degradation mechanism thus improving the efficiency in membrane filtration process song et al 2017 in principle electron hole pairs e h are generated in this illumination process fig 6b where positive holes h vb can effectively induce oxidization and degradation of organic compounds while negative electrons e cb typically reduce molecular oxygen into active superoxide radical anion hassan et al 2016 compared with pristine tio2 the wider band gaps facilitate the absorption of visible light making magnéli phases more effective for photocatalytic degradation hao et al 2018 for example ti4o7 g c3n4 photocatalysts with heterojunction structure significantly enhanced the efficiency of hypophosphite oxidation due to the generation of charge carrier e h under broader light absorption guan et al 2018 ag tio2 coated kaolin based ceramic membrane exhibited a high removal rate of bpa 88 in 270 min under visible light making it more potential to be used in more water treatment applications shareef et al 2020 how to induce light onto membrane surface remains a big challenge interestingly an sunlight transmitting photocatalytic glass based tio2 membrane was proposed to address this issue nyamutswa et al 2021 recently besides conventional hr aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have also being employed as an emerging alternative which gains increasing popularity for wastewater treatment qin et al 2016 yang et al 2014 table 3 most commonly so4 could be effectively generated by activation of persulfate ps s2o8 2 or peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 via some facile protocols such as photolysis thermolysis antoniou et al 2010 catalysis rastogi et al 2009 and ultrasound cai et al 2015 fig 6c more specially so4 has some outstanding merits such as higher standard redox potential e0 2 5 3 1v olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 wider range of ph values ph 2 8 guan et al 2013 longer half life 30 40 μs hu and long 2016 higher selectivity antoniou et al 2010 than oh e0 1 8 2 7 v ph 7 1 μs consequently it is more suitable for the treatment of highly refractory organic wastewaters such as conventional and emerging pollutants oh et al 2016 however in spite of increasing interests and application potential there are still some key challenging issues such as the possible leaching of immobilized nano catalysts and the possible formation and potential toxicity of produced oxyanions for instance sulfate ions harmful intermediate byproducts and residual pms or ps safety risk and harmful side effect of these unfavorable substances is indeed an important issue for producing better water quality which need to be carefully considered and well addressed for more extended water treatment applications in the future 4 2 3 electrochemistry enhanced membrane separation it is quite challenging to find an alternative efficient and durable way to improve water treatment efficiency without using any chemicals compared with advanced oxidation enhanced membrane separation novel electrochemical protocols have been becoming more promising when coupled with membrane separation since they indeed do not need the addition of hazardous chemicals fu et al 2019b zheng et al 2019 table 4 unlike the process without electric field fig 7 a membrane separation efficiency such as anti fouling flux rejection and foulant degradation can be effectively in situ enhanced in the presence of different electric fields via various mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion between membrane surface and foulants with the same charge fig 7b wang et al 2017a electrophoresis i e migration of charged foulants under electric field away from membrane surface fig 7c yu et al 2012 and electrochemical oxidation i e electro catalysis degradation of foulants on membrane surface fig 7d trellu et al 2018 inherently foulants such as natural organic matters colloids mineral ions and bacteria are always easily adsorbed on membrane surface under such mechanisms various foulants with different charged characteristics can be physically electrostatically repulsed or electrophoretically migrated outward from the membrane surface or even electrochemically eliminated via oxidization or reduction reactions feng et al 2016 this coupling technique not only effectively mitigates membrane fouling but sometimes mineralize hazardous organic matters which is especially suitable for treatment of refractory organic wastewaters therefore the coupling of electrochemistry with membrane separation is increasingly considered as a promising method to improve treatment efficiency due to its potential to relieve most foulants li et al 2018a since ceramic membrane is inherently non conductive i e electrically insulated a key strategy of realizing its electrochemically enhanced separation is to design an electrochemical membrane reactor or system for such a reactor electrochemically modified ceramic membrane is usually used as working electrode i e cathode or anode while highly active metals such as ti or pt mesh act as a counter electrode li et al 2018a application of a micro electric field can effectively mitigate fouling and improve membrane performances at low voltage direct current dc via various modification approaches a first key processing step is to rationally design and develop electro conductive ceramic membranes by coupling insulated ceramic membranes with highly electro conductive materials such as metals ti novel semiconductors and carbon based nano materials development of ceramic metallic composite membranes is a relatively simple and cost effective protocol via rational design of membrane electrodes deposition of highly conductive nano materials such as carbon nanotubes cnts onto into ceramic membrane is a more promising method to obtain ceramic based membrane electrode via vacuum filtration fan et al 2015 oulton et al 2015 or chemical vapor deposition chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015b table 4 the use of modified ceramic membranes as electrodes is an effective way to improve separation performance and antifouling ability under an electrical field both electrochemical reactions and electrophoresis contribute to effective membrane self cleaning considering its excellent conductivity stability and oxygen evolution potential magnéli phase titanium suboxides tino2n 1 4 n 10 have being increasingly used for modification of ceramic membranes to allow more electro chemically enhanced separation applications via enhanced charge transfer reactions smith et al 1998 walsh and wills 2010 as the most common component of magnéli phase ti4o7 phase exhibits a theoretical conductivity of 1000 s cm 1 due to a synergistic effect of electrophoresis and electro catalysis reactions such membranes were also very suitable for treatment of ha wastewater as both separation media and electrode obtaining an enhanced rejection and antifouling performance geng and chen 2017 but their performance and structural stability with time needs to be further studied under long term operation although some promising progress has been successfully made at laboratory and pilot scale tests for this electro chemical separation coupling technique total process energy consumption needs to be carefully considered to verify the sustainability of employing the additional electric field besides additional material and processing cost precise estimation and calculation of energy consumption must be done especially for future practical large scale industrial applications a trade off between treatment efficiency and energy consumption should be considered a critical performance indicator treatment efficiency such as water production and fouling mitigation ratio per unit energy input is suggested for such a comprehensive estimation with and without electrical field applied in addition more reliable and cost effective electrochemical protocols are highly desired to further improve treatment efficiency such as use of high performance materials and rational process or system design optimization 5 harsh water treatment applications of ceramic membranes beyond common separation functions considering its unique advantages especially such as better chemical mechanical and thermal stabilities as well as outstanding anti fouling properties ceramic membranes should or must be more promisingly used in some harsh water treatment applications where polymeric membranes cannot perform well during long term operation due to their inherent unfavorable properties for these harsh applications membrane performance but not cost is the most important concern in recent decades some emerging applications of treating various refractory wastewaters have been being increasingly considered such as oily wastewater high salinity or hyper salinity wastewater conventional emerging organic wastewater and domestic wastewaters 5 1 oil water separation oily wastewater is generated in various domestic and industrial processes such as oil and gas production food beverage processing and mechanical manufacturing which poses significant threats to our ecological environment when discharged into soil and water bodies different from suspended or dispersed oil emulsified oil in wastewater stably exists in a colloidal state with droplet size ranging from nano meter to micro meter consequently efficient separation of emulsified oily wastewater is a major issue for conventional treatment techniques such as gravity settling coagulation adsorption and flotation kajitvichyanukul et al 2011 pitakpoolsil and hunsom 2013 ramaswamy et al 2007 yu et al 2017 in contrast without any chemical addition emerging membrane separation technology is considered a promising sustainable method to highly efficiently treat oil in water o w emulsion wastewater tanudjaja et al 2019 besides separation capability sufficient hydrophilicity is at the core of such membrane processes in which most polymeric membranes with low or moderate hydrophilicity often suffer from unsatisfying anti fouling performance one of unique merits for ceramic membranes is enhanced hydrophilicity i e underwater oleophobicity or even superoleophobicity due to their inherently abundant surface metal hydroxyl groups imparting an excellent anti oil fouling ability for o w emulsion separation wu et al 2022 moreover since ceramic membranes can also show high stability in various oily wastewaters with complicating characteristics such as high temperature strong acidic or alkaline and organic solvent they are expected to be increasingly applied in a larger market capacity goh and ismail 2018 encouragingly increasing progress has been being made for application of ceramic microfiltration mf or ultra filtration uf membranes for oil in water separation for microsized emulsion treatment low cost mullite titania ceramic membranes exhibit a promising water permeance 150 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 outperforming some polymeric membranes 5 76 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 such as polyamide polystyrene and polysulfone membrane zhu et al 2016a mf process is generally capable of removing most oily droplets while ceramic uf membranes with finer pores can be sometimes employed for complete removal compared with conventional and commercial ceramic membranes zirconia uf membrane is the first reported in literature that can effectively reject nano sized oil droplets 18 nm with over 99 rejection wang et al 2022b moreover it has also been challenged with real degreasing wastewater with very high oil content 4284 mg l 1 and ph 12 4 and delivered consistently stable separation performance e g a steady state flux of 65 80 l m 2 h 1 over many operation cycles like other separation applications ceramic membranes for oily water treatment also suffer from a trade off between permeability and selectivity i e oil rejection so it is highly desirable to improve water permeability while maintaining high oil rejection to assure a safe and environment risk free discharge with oil concentration lower than discharge limits zhong et al 2021 in particular understanding membrane fouling mechanism is still a practical challenge and requires understanding of interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface structure and hydrodynamics as fouling exacerbates water flux wang et al 2022b to this end filtration models such as hermia model are suitable for evaluating fouling phenomena nandi et al 2010 even though ceramic membranes have inherently good hydrophilicity and have reasonable anti fouling outcomes their surface hydrophilicity could still be improved with this aim tailoring surface wettability is an effective approach the deposition of metal oxides such as tio2 fe2o3 mno2 cuo and ceo2 on ceramic ultrafiltration membrane surface with surface charge opposite to that of emulsion could effectively reduce irreversible membrane fouling lu et al 2016 a new strategy of coating graphene oxide onto β sialon ceramic membrane was proposed to impart a super hydrophilic property and consequently enhanced antifouling performance for separation of oil in water emulsion kang et al 2019 silicon carbide ceramic membrane from liqtech denmark was demonstrated to be highly efficient for oily wastewater treatment however the unfavorable interactions between foulants and membrane surfaces resulted in irreversible fouling caused by oil droplets locked inside membrane pores and adhered on membrane surface via strong interaction such irreversible fouling weakens membrane performance especially during long term operation further effort is still needed to rationally design novel materials and structure of ceramic membranes as well as to employ more efficient cleaning regimes to improve the treatment performance especially such as permeability and anti oil fouling ability 5 2 saline water desalination due to low energy consumption polymeric reverse osmosis ro membranes are widely used for desalination treatment of seawater and industrial saline wastewaters lee et al 2011 li and wang 2010 to mitigate ro membrane fouling more robust ceramic membranes can be used as promising pre treatment protocol to remove large sized matters such as organic inorganic or microbial particles due to their highly stable advantages especially such as chemical cleaning feasibility salinity resistance mechanical toughness and long operating lifetime fard et al 2018 however current ro membranes are unsuitable for the efficient treatment of high salinity wastewaters i e brines that usually generate ultra high osmotic pressure which consequently makes them infeasible in practical applications current ro membranes also suffer from unsatisfactory chlorine resistance generally due to technical complexity it is hard or quite challenging to scale up fabrication of pure ceramic membranes with nano meter or sub nano meter pores suitable for efficiently sieving of salt ions via pressure driving membrane process in contrast hybrid thermal membrane processes such as ceramic membrane distillation md provide ideal alternatives for effectively desalinating hypersaline feeds even at harsh conditions due to their excellent robustness high separation efficiency and ultrahigh salt enrichment ability fig 8 a and 8c inherently ceramic membranes are hydrophilic and consequently unsuitable for md applications to address this issue hydrophobic or superhydrophobic modification is proposed where surface hydrophobicity is effectively imparted and constructed into ceramic membranes to increase anti wetting properties to water for high performance md via surface grafting of low surface energy organic materials such as fluoroalkylsilane fas and 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane pfts deshmukh et al 2018 by rationally tailoring membrane surface chemistry and morphology design of superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes has been increasingly reported in recent years lin et al 2014 qtaishat et al 2008 introducing both low surface energy coatings such as fas and re entrant structures is considered as a common route to significantly enhance membrane wetting resistance krajewski et al 2006 lin et al 2014 tao et al tao et al 2018 and mouiya et al mouiya et al 2018 prepared ceramic planar membranes showing salt rejection rate over 99 99 and 99 62 respectively even at high salt concentration 12 wt nevertheless these hydrophobically modified ceramic membranes using fas usually suffer from insufficient long term stability leading to undesirable issues such as wetting fouling and loss of flux and rejection under harsh operating environments lu et al 2009 to address such a challenging issue of md long term stability highly stable hydrophobic modification protocols are proposed to modify ceramic membranes using more robust inorganic nano materials such as nano sinco and cnts dong et al 2018 wang et al 2017c beyond stability further improving treatment efficiency such as water flux would be another concerned issue via some strategies such as design of highly porous structure unlike md without wetting issues pervaporation pv is an alternative thermal membrane process enabling efficient separations for treatment of more challenging highly saline waters with low energy substances such as oil surfactants and organic solvents during pv process liquid water molecules transport across a dense polymeric or nanoporous inorganic membrane selective layer via a dissolution diffusion or adsorption diffusion mechanistic process following by evaporation condensation at permeate side while salt ions are rejected fig 8b and 8d although it is experimentally challenging for growth of stable zeolite or mof defect free selective layers on ceramic membranes to form advanced pv desalination membranes they have also been receiving substantial interests in recent years cho et al 2011 dahanayaka et al 2020 wan et al 2017 one of challenging issues is to minimize the intra crystalline defects to achieve sufficient salt rejection in mof or zeolite selective layers li et al 2021 wang et al 2022a also since low flux could be achieved even under high pressure minimizing membrane thickness while maintaining integrity is another challenging issue since both md and pv are a thermally driven membrane processes energy consumption is also a critical challenge which needs the utilization of more cheaper thermal sources such as low grade industrial residual or waste heat or emerging sources such as solar and joule heating 5 3 organic and emerging contaminant wastewater treatment it is a critical environmental challenge to efficiently treat conventional industrial organic wastewaters which are discharged from various process such as petroleum chemical and textile industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 qin et al 2018 in recent years emerging contaminants ecs have been frequently detected at different concentration levels from trace to high concentrations in various water sources such as drinking water natural water bodies domestic and industrial wastewaters they typically include perfluorinated compounds pfos pfoa endocrine disruptors compounds edcs pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs brominated flame retardants and other toxic substances gani and kazmi 2017 since they pose a potential threat to environmental and human health the development of advanced removal techniques is highly desired besides general separation functions ceramic membranes offer promise for treatment of refractory organic or ecs wastewaters in harsh environments due to their excellent chemical thermal anti oxidation robustness wang et al 2020 based on size sieving pressure driven ceramic based nanofiltration nf or ultrafiltration uf membranes provide viable solutions to physically reject organic pollutants e g 96 8 0 7 for diclofenac sodium 98 9 0 6 for oxytetracycline and 99 7 0 2 for tetracycline to produce clean water yuan et al 2020 to further improve rejection some emerging protocols such as atomic layer deposition are proposed to finely tailor the pore structure and surface properties of ceramic membranes while still maintaining sufficient water permeance 11 3 16 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 shang et al 2017 besides pressure driven membrane processes thermal membrane hybrid processes such as md and pv have also inspired great interests as promising technologies especially for efficient removal of organic water mixtures kujawski et al 2016 for md treatment of organic wastewaters thermally stable hydrophobic or superhydrophobic ceramic membranes are highly desired similar to desalination applications creating a three phase interface i e water vapor membrane to allow water vapor transport across ceramic membranes via knudsen diffusion or viscous flow mechanism while efficiently rejecting contaminants the rejection of 29 trace organic compounds was enhanced to 95 when md combined with thermophilic mbr wijekoon et al 2014 while the rejection of trace organic compounds was as high as 99 5 when combined with forward osmosis process xie et al 2013 generally md is applied in terms of different configurations such as direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd sweep gas membrane distillation sgmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd however md fouling or wetting behavior during long term operation poses a significant challenge which highly depends on the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of contaminants fouling or wetting usually results in the performance degradation in flux and rejection which needs to be carefully addressed li et al 2016a different from md pv process involves a preferential dissolution diffusion or adsorption diffusion mechanism of water molecules across pv membranes while organic pollutants not only non volatile but volatile organic compounds are rejected at feed side kujawa et al 2015 since membrane fouling during pv operation is also an obstacle for practical applications it is crucial to not only understand complicated interactions between membrane surface and contaminants but employ advanced antifouling strategies besides membrane fouling further treatment of concentrate byproducts is still a critical environmental challenge after pressure driven nf uf or thermal membrane hybrid md pv processes to address these issues coupling ceramic membrane separation with advanced oxidation or bioreaction provides a promising way to not only mitigate membrane fouling but partially or completely catalytically or biologically degrade contaminants into harmless substances some well developed or emerging advanced oxidation techniques such as electrocatalysis photocatalysis and ozonation catalysis have been being introduced into membrane separation system to further improve treatment efficiency and anti fouling ability ahmad et al 2017 stoitsas et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 rational incorporation of various nano catalysts into porous ceramic membranes is a crucial step to generate highly active radicals such as reactive oxygen and chlorine species achieving dual function of physical separation and chemical oxidation degradation via additional protocols such as electric field lights uv or visible light and o3 input fan et al 2014 guo et al 2016 wang et al 2008 these coupling processes involved complicated mechanisms for instance for electrocoagulation electrofiltration process multi step mechanisms occurred for removing target ecs ⅰ size exclusion ⅱ electrostatic repulsion ⅲ adsorption ⅳ electrocoagulation and ⅴ electrofiltration yang et al 2016 however in spite of the promising application the release of nano catalysts into permeated effluents can cause environment risk which needs to be avoided by employing strategies such as optimization of operating parameters and binding enhancement between membrane and nano catalysts large amounts of municipal sewage are discharged causing a great threat on ecological environment due to robust structure and long service lifespan ceramic membrane bioreactors cmbrs are developed to simultaneously achieve membrane separation with aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation via microorganisms fig 9 which is more suitable for treatment of domestic wastewaters with high concentration organic matters wang et al 2019a cmbrs have the potential to resist various corrosive chemicals such as cleaning reagents e g sodium hypochlorite solution and harsh environmental conditions e g high temperature and salinity stable flux and high sludge retention time are achieved without microbial inactivity under long term operation for decentralized sewage treatment shin and kang 2003 among cmbrs anaerobic cmbrs ancmbrs are a more promising potential solution to achieve energy neutrality for wastewater treatment plants in the future yue et al 2015 since ceramic membranes can reject a high concentration of biomass due to mitigated membrane damage ancmbrs often have higher organic removal rates than conventional polymeric based anmbrs aslam et al 2018 to mitigate fouling and improve treatment efficiency some pretreatment techniques such as coagulation flocculation and sedimentation are applied to combine with cmbrs for treatment of domestic wastewaters with high turbidity total suspended solid and phosphorus concentration charfi et al 2018 im et al 2019 labanda and llorens 2008 however the chemical types dosage and operation parameters need to be optimized to obtain the best performance one of the key obstacles for full scale cmbrs applications is still the high capital cost of commercial ceramic membranes in spite of much longer service lifespan employment of low cost mineral or waste based ceramic membranes is expected to provide a sustainable solution in addition to above mentioned typical wastewaters oily saline and organic emerging contaminant wastewaters efficient treatment of more challenging industrial wastewaters is highly desired for ceramic membranes they always exhibit strongly acidic alkaline high temperature or highly corrosive resistant features for which conventional treatment techniques such as polymeric membrane separation cannot perform well heavy metal wastewater is highly acidic which is one of harsh wastewaters discharged from various industrial processes such as electroplating mining metallurgy and paper or steel industry mukherjee et al 2018 nedzarek et al 2015 unlike

treatment efficiency are the future development directions of ceramic membranes for a wide range large scale water treatment applications it s still needed to commercially develop new ceramic membrane types with acceptable or even better performance but lower cost 7 conclusions and prospects although robust ceramic membranes are increasingly used in various water treatment applications decreasing capital cost and enhancing efficiency are still two key challenging application oriented issues to address these issues over the past decades great efforts have been being devoted via employing various strategies such as the development of low cost membranes novel forming sintering techniques operation at high flux efficiency enhanced coupling techniques and novel membrane housings beyond conventional ceramic membranes new types of ceramic membranes with lower cost are being developed as alternatives using cheaper materials such as natural minerals and solid state wastes these low cost ceramic membranes exhibit comparable or even higher performance at laboratory scale compared to conventional ceramic membranes nevertheless the element and phase compositions of most mineral and waste powders are complicated which highly depend on the location from where they are sourced moreover particle size classification is still a problem for large scalable application there are more uncertainties and risks to be fully addressed for the fabrication and large scale production of low cost ceramic membranes with acceptable or better property and performance another challenge for current commercial ceramic membranes is their higher cost due to complicated or high energy consumption fabrication techniques particularly in forming and sintering process in addition to low cost membrane materials some promising strategies have also been being rapidly developed to decrease processing cost by employing techniques such as centrifugal casting phase inversion co sintering and low temperature sintering these techniques are quite promising for reducing ceramic membrane processing cost beyond traditional membrane fouling control strategies various promising methods have been being employed to significantly enhance treatment efficiency by coupling membrane separation with some advanced techniques such as advanced oxidation and electrochemical processes robust ceramic membranes with strong anti oxidation performance can be used as the separation medium coupled with various advanced oxidation technologies during separation highly active radicals are generated to in situ to degrade organic foulants to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling and to achieve improvement in water treatment efficiency while keeping membrane structure undamaged however safety risk and side effects of harmful intermediate byproducts is indeed an important issue for producing better water quality which needs to be carefully considered and well addressed compared with advanced oxidation electrochemical protocols are more promising when coupled with ceramic membrane separation without the addition of any chemicals in the presence of different electric fields membrane separation efficiency especially fouling mitigation and flux improvement can be effectively in situ enhanced via various mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion electrophoresis and electrochemical oxidation reduction i e electro catalysis a key strategy of realizing its electrochemically enhanced separation is to design an electrochemical membrane reactor with optimized system and process nevertheless energy consumption needs to be carefully considered from the viewpoint of process sustainability due to the employment of the additional electric field ceramic membranes are more promisingly used in some harsh water treatment applications such as oily wastewater high salinity wastewater conventional emerging organic wastewater and domestic wastewaters as well as more challenging heavy metal or radioactive nuclide wastewaters besides these applications future work needs also focus on more challenging applications such as ion or molecule precise separations for high value resource recovery by rationally designing next generation ceramic based membranes with nano or subnano pores which are not widely availably currently although ceramic membrane based water treatment technique would be competitive in some challenging harsh separation applications its price or capital cost is an important factor limiting their larger scale water treatment applications ceramic membranes can be applied as pretreatment for reverse osmosis seawater desalination where the capital cost can be offset by the reduced cost of the short intake structure similarly some engineering design strategies such as large membrane housing could also further decrease capital cost further reducing cost and improving treatment efficiency are the future development directions of ceramic membranes for more water treatment applications it s still needed to develop not only new lower cost ceramic membrane types with acceptable or even better performance but more efficiency enhanced process strategies to promote

15800,more robust ceramic membranes with tailorable structures and functions are increasingly employed for water treatment particularly in some harsh applications for their ultra long service lifespan

membrane low cost efficiency enhancement harsh applications 1 introduction the rapid growth of industrialization and subsequent urbanization as well as population growth has led to water resource shortages becoming a serious global threat for sustainable development over the past decades it is well known that around 1 2 billion people have no or little access to safe and clean water and that millions of people die from severe waterborne diseases annually including 3 900 children every day dong et al 2006a malato et al 2009 therefore to meet rapidly increasing demands for clean water advanced water treatment technologies are highly desired featuring low cost and high efficiency membrane technology zoubeik et al 2018 as a highly efficient separation technology is increasingly applied for water treatment applications because of its unique advantages such as high separation efficiency facile operation minimized phase change low energy consumption small footprint and reduced chemical additive addition according to material composition classification separation membranes can be generally divided into organic and inorganic membranes the latter include not only ceramic and metal but zeolite and nano carbon membranes such as carbon nanotube cnts ang et al 2019 dong et al 2018 graphene oxide go gogoi et al 2018 and graphene gr liu et al 2015 which are commonly used as additives or coating layer as a kind of highly efficient and promising separation membrane fundamental research of ceramic membrane is rapidly developing fig 1 which is reflected by the exponential increase of the number of publications especially during the last decade fig 1a and 1b besides gas separation ceramic membranes are increasingly employed in water treatment applications such as oil water separation saline water refractory organic and emerging contaminant wastewaters fig 1c and 1d inorganic ceramic membranes composed of pure or composite oxides and non oxides generally perform much better than polymeric membranes fard et al 2018 besides some common applications the outstanding mechanically thermally and chemically robust characteristics make ceramic membranes more feasible and suitable especially when considered for use in harsh separation applications with extreme operating conditions abdullayev et al 2019 malzbender 2016 such as high temperature zhu et al 2019a highly corrosive environment lechner et al 2019 high salinity kurath et al 1997 and high pressure choudhury et al 2018 ceramic membrane one of the most promising membrane types dominates the inorganic membrane market and is rapidly expanding its applications for industrial use in china the scale of the membrane industry has been growing rapidly it is estimated that by 2024 the output value of china s membrane industry will reach 363 billion chinese yuan which is more than double that in 2017 http www cir cn according to a conservative estimate the gross sales of commercial ceramic membranes have accounted for 10 20 of the global whole membrane market which is annually growing at a rate as high as 35 worldwide cao et al 2013 in spite of increasing interest in fundamental research and industrial applications for ceramic membranes broader and larger scale applications of current ceramic membrane are greatly restricted due to their high capital cost compared to polymeric membranes and similar efficiency cost and efficiency are two important factors for ceramic membrane applications which pose significant challenges when being extensively used in wider range applications chen et al 2020a li et al 2017 wu et al 2022 zhu et al 2016a considering these two technical challenges for ceramic membrane application various strategies of decreasing cost and enhancing efficiency have been being increasingly the focus within academic communities such as the development of low cost membranes novel processing production techniques and various promising performance enhanced coupling techniques apart from gas separation hashim et al 2011 smart et al 2010 and energy applications thursfield et al 2012 some interesting reviews of ceramic membranes for water treatment applications have been also recently published samaei et al samaei et al 2018 presented laboratory analysis case studies and applications of pressure driven ceramic membrane technology for treatment of various industrial wastewaters such as mining food pulp and paper textile petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals for treatment of reclaimed water zoubeik et al zoubeik et al 2018 focused on the novel advances of both polymeric and ceramic membrane technologies to achieve membrane fouling mitigation and performance optimization such as permeate flux especially for oily water systems very recently several review papers with topics related to low cost ceramic membranes have been published due to increased research concerns hubadillah et al hubadillah et al 2018b introduced a comprehensive review focused on low cost ceramic membranes exclusively made from abundant mineral kaolin a traditional raw material for domestic and building ceramics discussing its mineral characteristics membrane fabrication techniques and membrane applications such as oily wastewater and membrane supports mestre et al mestre et al 2019 focused on classification of raw materials various manufacturing processes property characteristics and potential industrial applications of low cost ceramic membranes similarly issaoui and limousy issaoui and limousy 2019 gave a more comprehensive review mainly discussing preparation techniques and critical industrial and environmental applications of low cost ceramic membranes from economic and environmental perspectives despite these existing reviews mostly discussing classifications of low cost membranes and related applications this review places emphasize on cost and efficiency aspects of ceramic membranes focusing on an overview and sufficient discussion on various advanced strategies and mechanistic insights to lower cost and enhance efficiency this provides different and new insights of two key application oriented challenges in cost and efficiency in order to deeply understand their fundamental relationship after summarizing common challenges for current ceramic membranes this review begins with an up to date brief overview of recent developments of ceramic membranes as a necessary background for readers then after giving an analysis of cost factors for ceramic membranes different promising strategies for decreasing cost are discussed through employment of low cost membrane materials novel processing forming and sintering and modification techniques to fully address the issue of improved water treatment efficiency considerable insight is provided into recent major progress and mechanistic understanding of promising coupling techniques with membrane separation to significantly enhance treatment efficiency such as advanced oxidation and electrochemistry processes which are different from conventional strategies such as pretreatment membrane cleaning and membrane modification subsequently a review of recent progress of harsh water treatment applications in extreme environments using ceramic membrane is presented such as oil water separation saline water refractory organic and emerging contaminant wastewater treatment finally engineering applications conclusions and future perspectives of water treatment ceramic membranes are critically discussed from a new and different insight by deeply understanding two key issues of cost and treatment efficiency 2 recent development of ceramic membranes fig 2 presents a brief overview of key development milestones of ceramic membranes with a particular emphasis on novel ceramic membranes and important membrane applications the research of ceramic membranes originated in 1940s which was exclusively used in the nuclear industry for isotope separation of uranium where only ceramic ultrafiltration membranes were employed kurath et al 1997 at that time the potential for industrial separation applications of ceramic membrane had not been fully recognized and was slowly developing until early 1980s ceramic membranes were increasingly applied for water or gas based separations shoji et al 1988 since then tremendous advances have been made in scientific and technological aspects to improve ceramic membrane processes from research at laboratory scale to industrial implementation for various water treatment applications such as drinking water and industrial municipal wastewater treatment global research has demonstrated impressive developments in new membrane types more membrane processes such microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and separation applications leenaars et al 1984 ceramic membranes which can filter heavy metals oils and suspended solids were first used in the petrochemical manufacturing industry lahiere and goodboy 1993 then cicek et al cicek et al 1999 for the first time performed a pilot scale ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr system for the treatment of simulated municipal wastewater confirming that the formation of inorganic crystals could decrease operating cost and prolong the service lifespan due to mitigation of membrane fouling however high capital cost and insufficient treatment efficiency such as flux rejection and fouling still limit the large scale applications for economic water treatment in the last two decades emerging advances of various strategies have being witnessed to not only decrease cost but enhance efficiency of ceramic membranes fig 2 beyond conventional high purity ceramic membranes new types of ceramic membranes with lower cost have been developed using cheaper materials and new low cost processing techniques to address the issue of single separation function with moderate efficiency some novel coupling strategies are proposed to enhance treatment efficiency by developing ceramic membrane bioreactors catalytically or electrically active ceramic membranes that are advances over traditional cleaning and modification protocols with nano materials and nanotechnologies becoming ubiquitous advances in rational design and application of novel nano enhanced ceramic membranes with precise separation and excellent performance have been being emerging since 2010s ceramic membranes are promising and consequently increasingly employed in some harsh water treatment applications i e various refractory wastewaters where polymeric membranes cannot perform well during long term operation li et al 2021 wang et al 2022a yuan et al 2020 greater full scale ceramic membrane plants are successfully established and operated for various water treatment applications all over the world 3 low cost strategies of ceramic membranes currently commercially available ceramic membranes have limited materials mainly including ceramic oxides alumina al2o3 zirconia zro2 titanium oxide tio2 silicon oxide sio2 and their composites and non oxide ceramics silicon carbide sic and silicon nitride si3n4 generally ceramic membranes are much more costly than organic polymeric counterparts mainly due to expensive membrane materials and complicated fabrication and manufacturing processes in forming and sintering therefore it s highly necessary to develop new cost effective ceramic membranes with acceptable or even excellent performance suitable for broader applications there has been great interest over the last decade in decreasing costs of membrane materials forming and sintering to consequently lower the cost of ceramic membranes hubadillah et al 2018b issaoui and limousy 2019 mestre et al 2019 3 1 cost factor analysis of ceramic membranes in practical industrial applications cost calculation of separation membrane is a complicated process depending many factors which is quite different from laboratory scale outcomes nevertheless our review here gives a cost estimation of ceramic membrane which are simplified at an ideal case by comprehensively considering membrane cost including material cost processing cost and maintenance cost including cleaning cost during whole service lifespan monash and pugazhenthi 2011 herein the concept of membrane life cycle cost is proposed which is shown in eq 1 1 cos t life cycle cos t mem cos t maint t lifespan where cost mem and cost maint are the membrane cost and maintenance cost respectively and t lifespan a means the whole service lifespan of ceramic membrane particularly cost mem consists of material cost and processing cost that in most cases directly reflects membrane price life cycle cost includes both membrane cost and maintenance cost over the entire predicted service life indeed compared with polymeric membranes 20 200 m 2 bhide and stern 1991 monash and pugazhenthi 2011 vasanth et al 2011 commercial al2o3 and zro2 based ceramic membranes have much higher costs which are in the range of 500 3 000 m 2 or higher mestre et al 2019 nandi et al 2011 which significantly limits their extensive applications in more industrial processes some increasing efforts have been made using inorganic wastewater sludges chen et al 2020a mukherjee et al 2019 solid wastes dong et al 2010 natural minerals das et al 2016 or other cheap materials as starting materials for membrane fabrication this not only achieves high valued recycling of these waste materials along with significant reduction of waste for disposal but also more importantly to significantly decrease membrane cost interestingly the cost of mineral or waste based membrane materials only ranges from 2 m 2 to 130 m 2 abdullayev et al 2019 only accounting for 1 500 1 4 of commercial ceramic membranes materials which can be expected to significantly decrease membrane price when scalable manufacture can be realized unlike polymeric membranes that are produced without sintering high processing cost dominates ceramic membrane cost with the energy cost associated with high sintering temperatures being a major cost compared with more expensive pure oxide or non oxide ceramic membranes lower membrane cost can be realized due to not only much cheaper raw materials but also lower sintering processing cost arising from the presence of minor oxide impurities that act as sintering aids 1 100 1 3 of pure ceramic membrane hubadillah et al 2018b mestre et al 2019 in addition to low cost membrane materials some novel forming and sintering techniques have also been being rapidly developed to decrease processing costs such as centrifugal casting kim et al 2000 kim et al 2002 phase inversion dong et al 2008a he et al 2014 co sintering feng et al 2007a zou et al 2019 and low temperature sintering monash and pugazhenthi 2011 wang et al 2019b these techniques are quite promising from the viewpoint of reducing processing cost by decreasing both forming and sintering cycles or decreasing final sintering dwell temperature ceramic membranes are commonly considered as being more expensive i e higher membrane cost for commercial application than polymeric membranes but this opinion usually neglects the advantage of lower maintenance cost due reduced cleaning frequency no breakage and longer service lifespan due to their more robust characteristics maintenance cost should be considered for the entire service life of the membranes which largely depends on membrane cleaning and service life monash and pugazhenthi 2011 additionally while the cost of ceramic membranes per m2 is high significantly higher flux e g above 200 l m 2 h 1 can often be achieved due to their unique structure and property consequently lowering the capital cost difference between polymeric and ceramic membranes on a cost per m3 of treated water basis dow et al 2015 furthermore robust ceramic membranes show a more excellent structural stability without performance degradation associated with breakage or increased pore size as a result of backwashing cran et al 2022 and can even be cleaned with strongly acidic or alkaline chemical agents or under high pressure back flushing blanpain avet et al 2009 in summary since mineral or waste based ceramic membranes are prepared using cheap materials by novel fabrication techniques with lower processing cost they have lower membrane cost than pure ceramic membranes and lower maintenance cost with longer service lifespan than polymeric membranes they have been made in laboratories but need further demonstration in industry 3 2 key cost issues for current ceramic membranes although they are increasingly used in various industrial separation processes current porous ceramic membranes have very limited membrane materials types and configuration high purity macro porous alumina α al2o3 and silicon carbide sic are usually used as membrane support which can be steadily produced or manufactured by some well developed forming techniques such as powder pressing chakradhar et al 2006 dong et al 2011b paste extrusion process jedidi et al 2009 khider et al 2004 or advanced colloidal process monash et al 2013 followed by high temperature sintering finer ceramic powders such as zirconia zro2 titanium oxide tio2 silicon oxide sio2 and their composites or their precursors are deposited as interlayer or final function separation layer by dip coating or spray coating techniques cuo et al 2019 jamaludin et al 2016 followed by sintering or calcination flat sheet ceramic membranes were initially used in laboratory scale studies elgamouz and tijani 2018 but have recently been increasingly employed for industrial wastewater treatment umezawa et al 2003 by comparison single channel or multi channel tubular membranes are more popular due to their higher membrane area per unit volume i e higher packing density consequently featuring higher treatment capacity or process efficiency zhu et al 2015c for commercial porous ceramic membranes multi channel configuration is usually adopted for large scale industrial application due to the additional outstanding mechanical stability in order to meet various separation requirements porous ceramic membranes with different microstructures are rationally designed and fabricated featuring highly controllable pore size porosity thickness permeability and mechanical properties jiang et al 2013 3 2 1 high membrane materials cost selection or synthesis of ceramic membrane materials is considered as a primary factor for both fundamental laboratory study and engineering applications however high purity oxide or non oxide ceramic powders 500 1000 m 2 or chemically pure precursors more expensive available in the market are not only expensive but have limited types furthermore high sintering temperature is also required especially for ceramic supports which can be as high as 1500 1700 c consequently greatly increasing the whole ceramic membrane cost monash et al 2013 usually the cost of conventional ceramic membrane materials is in the range of 500 1000 m 2 while the cost would be as low as 2 130 m 2 when wastes or minerals are used as membrane materials abdullayev et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to develop locally available abundant low cost membrane materials as alternatives for current commercial ceramic membrane materials 3 2 2 high forming and sintering cost current fabrication techniques such as powder pressing paste and colloidal processes α al2o3 and sic for support zro2 tio2 sio2 and their composites or their precursors for interlayer or final layers are quite effective and facile for ceramic membrane fabrication monash et al 2013 there are still some existing challenging issues such as complicated forming and sintering processes evolving repeated multi steps especially for fabrication of multi layered membrane for both ceramic support and membrane layers inevitably prolonging the whole fabrication duration and consequently increasing the processing cost chakradhar et al 2006 luyten et al 1997 for instance during colloidal processing for ceramic support fabrication it usually requires quite complicated steps including powder synthesis and purification colloidal suspension preparation consolidation solvent phase removal drying and final high temperature sintering monash et al 2013 coating of one or more layers on ceramic supports is needed to form an asymmetrical membrane structure which is usually a more popular membrane structure for practical applications and required for smaller pore size membranes development of alternative low cost forming and sintering techniques is highly desirable to further decrease processing cost in one word besides expensive raw materials complicated forming processes and high sintering cost push more researchers to focus on the exploration of alternate forming and sintering techniques for current ceramic membrane to significantly decrease membrane processing cost some promising strategies for decreasing cost of ceramic membranes will be presented and discussed regarding the development of mineral or waste based membrane and employment of novel lower cost processing techniques for water treatment applications where acceptable or better membrane performance and lower cost are highly required 3 3 development of low cost ceramic membranes compared with expensive commercial ceramic powders much lower cost inorganic materials such as silicate wastes or minerals can be potentially considered as promising alternatives for fabrication of low cost ceramic membranes table 1 significantly decreasing membrane material cost moreover some other low cost materials such as portland cement and geopolymer cement could also be used to decrease the costs of ceramic membranes due to their novel sintering free fabrication routes abdullayev et al 2019 3 3 1 mineral based ceramic membranes there are numerous available low cost natural minerals containing naturally occurring silicates aluminosilicates and phosphates which are composed of silica alumina as main components as well as other metal oxides as minor components even without being processed by any industrial refinements these much cheaper minerals could be suitably recognized as potential alterative materials for fabrication of ceramic membranes for water treatment applications after forming and sintering low cost ceramic membrane were developed using various minerals such as kaolin clay bouzerara et al 2006 elgamouz and tijani 2018 rekik et al 2017 natural zeolite aloulou et al 2017 dong et al 2006a englert and rubio 2005 apatite dong et al 2009c li et al 2016b quartz sand foughali et al 2016 kouras et al 2017 and natural pozzolan beqqour et al 2019 table 1 significantly decreasing membrane material cost 2 130 m 2 compared with some conventional commercial ceramic membrane materials 500 1000 m 2 abdullayev et al 2019 the first concern is design of target phases of ceramic membranes for special application requirements based on phase diagram principle via sintering minerals with or without other minor components the phases are usually composed of multi metal oxides such as mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 2al2o3 sio2 dong et al 2009c zhu et al 2019a cordierite 2mgo 2al2o3 5sio2 dong et al 2007b dong et al 2009a and anorthite cao al2o3 2sio2 shen et al 2016 deep understanding on phase formation mechanisms during ceramic membrane sintering is an important fundamental issue quantification or semi quantification of various crystalline phases at different sintering conditions can be realized via some powerful advanced tools such as rietveld refinement and rir method of xrd patterns tang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a for potential filtration separation applications characterization of membrane structures are focused on porosity pore size distribution and gas or water permeation performance rational tailoring of ceramic membrane structures can also be used to achieve high water flux and favorable mechanical and surface properties various material properties are also of interest such as mechanical strength hydrophilicity acidic or alkaline corrosion resistance and even thermal expansion co efficient furthermore the presence of other minor metal oxide impurities with low melting point in most minerals is beneficial for decreasing the sintering temperature because they decrease the melting point of the composite material enabling liquid phase formation at lower temperature that plays a key role in sintering i e liquid phase sintering this is different from the sintering process for current commercial ceramic membranes where additional sintering aids are required fukushima et al 2009 heras juaristi et al 2016 yao et al 2014 since high purity alumina such as α alumina γ alumina and β alumina or aluminum hydroxide are industrially manufactured from bauxite mineral considering its cheaper and abundant features some studies have recently focused on the employment of kaolin or bauxite as a low cost alternative for pure alumina for mullite ceramic membrane fabrication dong et al 2018 li et al 2015b lu et al 2014 zhu et al 2016b zeolite minerals which are composed of aluminosilicates with a three dimensional framework structure bearing alo4 and sio4 tetrahedra englert and rubio 2005 could also be an excellent candidates for fabrication of microfiltration membranes low cost ceramic membranes prepared from these materials exhibit similar or even higher performance compared to conventional ceramic membranes identifying a promising approach to reducing ceramic membrane fabrication costs nevertheless compared with pure commercial ceramic powders the element and phase compositions of most mineral powders are complicated and vary between their source locations even for the same bulk mineral there is greater uncertainty with regards to material performance for natural mineral or waste products due to the diversity of minor components within their structures such as mullite and spinel cordierite table 1 moreover since the particle size of mineral or waste powders varies sieving or size classification is required for large scalable application which needs to be solved to fabricate highly porous ceramic membranes with better permeation performance 3 3 2 waste based ceramic membranes besides natural minerals using similar methodologies inorganic industrial solid state wastes have been attracting increased interests in development of low cost ceramic membranes via a sustainable green chemistry protocol due to their promising advantages such as abundantly available resource much lower cost and greater environmental benefits shen et al 2016 table 1 the cost of waste based ceramic membranes is tremendously decreased which material prices ranging from 2 to 130 m 2 more importantly the feasible recycling of these wastes could solve problems of environmental pollution which is of great significance from both economic and environmental perspectives liu et al 2016 as an abundant by product massively produced from coal combustion in thermal power plants coal fly ash poses serious global environmental safety issues related to its stacking or filling utilization of coal fly ash as a cement additive is one of the traditional recycling methods however high value added waste recycling is a more promising way not only to address its environmental issue but to develop low cost functional membrane materials for environmental applications since the main chemical components of coal fly ash silica alumina are similar to those of clays and kaolin it is highly suitable for the fabrication of low cost ceramic membranes such as mullite fu et al 2019a lu et al 2014 zhu et al 2015b cordierite dong et al 2006b shen et al 2016 and anorthite wei et al 2016 in order to improve membrane performance such as strength and permeation a highly porous whisker constructed membrane structure was proposed to develop better mullite ceramic membranes via a waste to resource strategy which are different from conventional particulate packing membrane structures such an inter locking structure consisting of mullite whiskers can be realized by using single or mixed additives such as alf3 li et al 2012b peng and sorrell 2004 v2o5 li et al 2009 mgo dong et al 2011a tio2 dong et al 2010 moo3 fu et al 2019a wo3 chen et al 2016 kong et al 2003 moo3 alf3 zhu et al 2015a and v2o5 alf3 cao et al 2014 via vapor solid or vapor solid liquid reaction mechanisms significantly promoting the formation of elongated mullite whiskers or nanowires wastewater sludges generated from industrial wastewater treatment often contain elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as copper nickel zinc chromium and manganese which are detrimental to the environment and human health swierk et al 2007 they could also provide rich active element resource for synthesis of spinel ab2o4 a mg2 fe2 zn2 mn2 co2 ni2 cd2 b al3 cr3 fe3 co3 ceramics in spite of increased complexity for control of membrane formation similar to natural minerals the use of inorganic industrial solid state wastes also shows challenging issues related to complicated element and phase compositions and pretreatment this results in uncertainty with regard to final membrane properties and may require the diversity of processing conditions during ceramic membrane preparation during ceramic membrane sintering process not only major metal ions but trace amounts of other heavy metal ions are efficiently stabilized into ceramic crystalline lattice via solid dissolution mechanism nevertheless considering the presence of minor heavy metal ions in mineral or waste materials possible environmental risk of mineral based or waste based ceramic membranes such as the leaching of metal ions should be carefully considered especially when being used in water treatment applications in highly acidic or alkaline conditions under long term operation it is feasible to fabricate or produce high quality mf and uf ceramic membranes from cheap mineral or waste materials but it is much more challenging to fabricate high quality nf ceramic membranes since not only the quality of membrane support but synthesis conditions need to be very high for nf membranes 3 4 development of low cost processing techniques besides decreasing material costs the development of low cost fabrication techniques is considered such as novel forming centrifugal casting and phase inversion and sintering techniques low temperature sintering and co sintering table 2 these techniques are quite promising to reduce processing cost through decreasing both forming and sintering cycles or decreasing final sintering temperature 3 4 1 low cost forming techniques one of the bottlenecks for current commercial ceramic membranes is their higher cost than polymeric counterparts due to complicated fabrication technique in particularly in forming process falamaki and veysizadeh 2006 considering that conventional processing techniques need multiple forming cycles extensive research efforts have been dedicated to developing more simplified forming techniques to minimize the forming steps which could effectively decrease the cost of membrane fabrication bouzerara et al 2015 zhu et al 2016a as an alternative solution centrifugal casting technique is promising in creation of an asymmetrical gradient membrane structure in one step during tubular membrane fabrication kim et al 2000 unlike conventional multi layered ceramic membranes fabricated via multi step coating sintering cycles fig 3 a the asymmetrical uniform gradient microstructure does not have interface bonding issues fig 3b centrifugal casting is a promising technique to fabricate tubular ceramic membranes or supports for further deposition of membrane layers such a one step forming process not only leads to lower processing cost but significantly avoids defects falamaki and veysizadeh 2008 nevertheless it can be only employed in fabrication of single channel structured membranes which is not suitable for multi channel membranes different from centrifugal casting technique phase inversion based processes such as dry wet spinning tape casting and gel casting could usually be used in fabricating ceramic membranes with various configurations such as hollow fiber tubular and flat membranes after sintering the membrane often shows an asymmetric two layered or multi layered structure thick and porous layer acting as support and thin layer providing separation function fig 3c and 3d he et al 2014 smid et al 1996 one of key advantages of this process is that the formation and sintering of asymmetric membrane structures can be realized in only one step consequently reducing forming and sintering cost wei et al 2008 generally phase inversion based dry wet spinning technique is used to fabricate hollow fiber membranes while various other phase inversion based casting techniques are used to fabricate tubular or flat membranes li et al 2015a zhang et al 2020 although hollow fiber ceramic membranes can offer outstanding thermal mechanical and chemical stabilities in harsh gas and water treatment applications their brittleness and poor processability limit their practical applications in contrast metal based membranes such as stainless steel and copper are mechanically stronger and more ductile which makes them ideal candidates to fully address these mechanical issues shi et al 2022 si et al 2020 wang et al 2016a 3 4 2 low cost sintering techniques high sintering cost is a challenging issue for scalable production and application of commercial ceramic membranes which usually need high sintering temperature especially for membrane supports 1500 1700 c and repeated multi cycle sintering procedures for multi layered membranes resulting in high energy consumption monash et al 2013 to overcome this key issue various low cost sintering techniques such as low temperature sintering with addition of sintering additives shen et al 2016 and multi layer co sintering liu et al 2012 have been proposed recently table 2 during sintering the formation of a low melting point liquid phase with additional sintering additives deng et al 2003 or inherent components han et al 2003 was very beneficial to not only decrease sintering temperature but also to improve the final performance of ceramic membranes such as mechanical properties without water permeation degradation low cost mineral or waste based materials contain not only al and si oxides but also other minor oxide elements such as na ca k and mg that can significantly reduce sintering temperature due to their low melting point rekik et al 2017 in addition sintering additive mixtures were also confirmed to be effective in lowering phase formation temperatures for mullite ceramic membranes dong et al 2011a dong et al 2010 low temperature sintering mechanisms with these additives are proposed via various micro structural characterizations which is a challenging task for applied fundamental research when other new additives are applied alternatively multi layer co sintering is another promising approach table 2 for conventional ceramic membranes sintering process evolves repeated multi steps especially for fabrication of multi layered membranes inevitably prolonging the whole fabrication duration and increasing processing cost given similar sintering kinetic characteristics of different powders two or more layers can be co fired in one step after multi step formation co sintering is quite promising to reduce processing cost and sintering duration through decreasing the number of sintering cycles into a single step greatly decreasing energy cost zou et al 2019 for this promising technique a comprehensive consideration of key parameters such as powder size and sintering activity zou et al 2018 membrane thickness feng et al 2007b and co sintering temperature dong et al 2007a is highly desired for fabrication of high quality multi layer membranes 4 water treatment efficiency of ceramic membranes besides high cost improving treatment efficiency is another key challenging issue for current ceramic membrane processes such as micro filtration ultra filtration and nano filtration where trans membrane pressure difference as driving force is dominant always showing single separation function there are still some challenges existing in these membrane processes such as membrane fouling secondary pollution of treated concentrates performance degradation in water permeability and selectivity i e rejection under long term operation to compensate for these issues various promising methods have been being employed to significantly enhance treatment efficiency via traditional membrane fouling control strategies or some advanced coupling techniques such as advanced oxidation and electrochemical protocols 4 1 key issues of treatment efficiency ceramic membranes have gained great interest for use in various water treatment applications over the past few decades owing to its excellent chemical thermal and mechanical stability low fouling property and long service lifespan however an ubiquitous trade off issue between permeability and selectivity always exists in synthetic membranes including ceramic membranes meaning that highly permeable membranes are lack of selectivity and vice versa park et al 2017 except for homogeneous nonporous polymeric membranes for gas separations the upper bound behavior also could be observed in both dense and porous membranes therefore there is a pressing need for the balance between membrane permeability and selectivity for ceramic membranes various approaches such as structure design and thickness regulation have been employed to break the permeability selectivity trade off of ceramic membrane on one hand controllably tailoring pore size and distribution and morphologies is quite effective to potentially achieve a satisfactory high selectivity with narrow pore size distribution park et al 2017 on the other hand rational design of defect free ultra thin membrane sometimes featuring a multi layer asymmetrical structure could also improve water permeation flux generally ceramic membranes are often prone to lower fouling than polymer membranes due to their better surface hydrophilicity wang et al 2017b however during practical separation processes membrane fouling is still a challenging technical bottleneck which greatly restricts its further large scale industrial application in high efficiency membrane filtration system it would directly lead to continuous attenuation and deterioration of membrane permeation flux increasing the operating cost of the whole system jiang et al 2013 to restore membrane performance especially flux frequent cleaning operations are always needed increasing operating costs in spite of selectivity improvement although membrane cleaning can partially recover flux i e reversible fouling it is still difficult to completely remove some foulants i e irreversible foulants therefore it is necessary to efficiently control and mitigate ceramic membrane fouling to achieve high separation efficiency in the membrane filtration process generally membrane fouling results from physical and chemical adsorption and deposition of various foulants on the membrane surface and pores as well as mechanical interception between foulants and membrane surface blocking filtration laws were first studied and proposed by hermans and brédee in 1935 iritani and katagiri 2016 then hermans made a critical study of all four possible fouling models including complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking cake filtration and standard pore blocking fig 4 hermia 1982 for reversible fouling foulants can be completely removed by physical cleaning while for irreversible fouling all foulants can only be removed by using strong chemical agents fig 5 4 2 traditional and novel strategies for enhancing efficiency 4 2 1 traditional fouling control strategies for wastewaters their components are always very complicated long term filtration operation causes membrane fouling increasing transmembrane pressure and or decreasing permeate flux yin et al 2013 the complicated interactions between membrane surface and foulants is the most important factor dominating membrane fouling during filtration process where gradual accumulation of foulants seriously degrade the filtration performance of ceramic membranes thus reducing membrane service lifespan and increasing operation cost chan and chen 2004 therefore effective strategies to control membrane fouling should be taken to improve separation efficiency such as pretreatment arndt et al 2016 membrane cleaning tomaszewska and bialonczyk 2012 and membrane surface modification li et al 2012a 4 2 1 1 pretreatment to reduce the burden of membrane operation unit it is highly desired and feasible to develop advanced pretreatment methods before membrane separation via employing various physical or chemical technologies such as adsorption chung et al 2019a zhang et al 2014b coagulation flocculation hoeg et al 2015 zielinska and galik 2017 coarse filtration charfi et al 2018 dickhout et al 2017 and advanced oxidation hamid et al 2017 liu et al 2019 natural organic matter nom widely existing in various wastewaters is considered to be a major foulant for ceramic membrane fouling as a well developed technique adsorption is usually employed to effectively remove these large sized substances to avoid subsequent membrane fouling using various promising water stable adsorbents other typical organic compounds such as humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa molecular weight 600 3000 da can diffuse and be adsorbed in most carbon based adsorbents via effective interactions between adsorbent site and adsorbate functional groups making adsorption an effective pretreatment strategy to reduce organic fouling chin et al 1994 however the key issues still have to be carefully addressed such as efficiency recovery and regeneration of adsorbents moreover other pretreatment methods such as coagulation one of the most prevalent methods for the removal of aqueous particulate and colloidal foulants can also mitigate ceramic membrane fouling go et al 2016 where in line coagulation could enhance permeate flux and decrease transport resistance caused by internal pore blocking during ceramic membrane ultrafiltration process however coagulation flocculation often fails to completely remove suspended impurities some remaining impurities can be further removed by coarse filtration techniques such as coarse strainer and granular media filtration gmf anis et al 2019 in particular gmf has become one of the most popular conventional pretreatment processes used for large scale seawater desalination plants darwish et al 2016 jeong et al 2016 since ozone o3 has strong oxidation ability the feasible coupling of catalytic and direct ozonation with ceramic membrane separation could also address membrane fouling issues especially for refractory organic foulants such as nitrobenzene and tetrachloroethylene via an oxidation degradation mechanism involving the formation of hydroxyl radicals or other radicals at the membrane surface li et al 2017 zhao et al 2009 application of economic o3 as pretreatment protocol significantly mitigated membrane fouling because of the reaction between o3 and nom species effectively recovering permeate flux karnik et al 2005 this pretreatment not only improved water permeability but simultaneously decreased both reversible and irreversible fouling even showing much better performance than biological activated carbon bac pretreatment or ozone and bac o3 bac pretreatment at an appropriate ozonation dosage hamid et al 2017 4 2 1 2 membrane cleaning in comparison with pretreatment methods membrane cleaning is the most commonly used approach to maintain or recover the permeability of ceramic membranes which can be generally divided into physical cleaning kumar et al 2007 oligny et al 2016 and chemical cleaning blanpain avet et al 2009 tomaszewska and bialonczyk 2012 usually physical cleaning is evaluated using three key parameters percentage flux recovery irreversible fouling percent and hydraulic cleanliness criterion which represents the ratio of residual fouling resistance to initial membrane resistance chemical cleaning may also be evaluated by measuring residual protein amount retained on the membrane surface after cleaning blanpain avet et al 2009 in general initial ceramic membrane fouling i e reversible fouling was characterized by a pore blocking mechanism which then converted into a cake filtration mechanism and was usually removable by physical cleaning such as rinsing and backwashing in contrast internal reversible foulants and irreversible foulants could only be removed by more harsh chemical cleaning lee et al 2013 for physical cleaning applying external mechanical force plays a key role in removing foulants from ceramic membrane surface or pores via various washing techniques lamminen et al 2004 such as low pressure high velocity cleaning back pressure washing other enhanced cleaning strategies such as ultrasonic pulse and nano bubble and their combined techniques ultrasonic cleaning technology has been extensively employed as one of the most efficient methods for ceramic membrane cleaning given the inherent robust characteristic of ceramic membranes one of the key advantages of this method is no destruction or damage of the ceramic membrane structure chen et al 2006 recently some researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of an ultrasound protocol for effectively cleaning membrane surfaces maintaining high permeate flux kobayashi et al 1999 in general cleaning efficiency was increased with an increase of ultrasonic cleaning power or combination with chemical agents however decreasing energy consumption while maintaining excellent cleaning efficiency is still a challenging task for practical industrial applications pulse assisted backwashing is also commonly used for fouling mitigation for large size ceramic membrane modules due to its merits such as cost effectiveness high cleaning efficiency rapid flux recovery and simple operation in practice it is difficult to completely restore permeate flux via only physical cleaning especially for seriously fouled ceramic membranes in which membrane pores are heavily adsorbed or plugged by natural organic matters or other substances consequently chemical cleaning must be considered as an alternative when water flux decreases to 40 50 of the initial flux blanpain avet et al 2009 by considering the inherent properties and interactions of foulants and ceramic membrane it is significant to choose an effective cheap and non toxic cleaning agent to ensure efficient foulant removal for performance recovery while also not degrading the membrane structure commonly acidic agents are used to remove inorganic foulants while alkaline agents are more suitable for organic foulants removal li et al 2020 sodium hypochlorite naclo and sodium hydroxide naoh are commonly used alkali agents which can remove foulants via the process mechanisms such as oxidation hydrolysis and solubilization regula et al 2014 this cleaning strategy weakens the adhesion between foulants and membrane surface consequently recovering flux very efficiently in practice chemically enhanced backwashing is sometimes used but less frequently to regularly clean the membrane during backwashing to effectively maintain efficient operating performance li et al 2018b in recent years more environmentally sustainable alternative cleaning methods have been also proposed such as green o3 assisted cleaning ozonated water is always used to replace clean water in the surface flushing process for more highly efficient cleaning of ceramic membranes moreover besides green and harmless features the use of o3 could effectively remove biopolymers and humic substances for reducing organic fouling and thus improving flux hamid et al 2017 moreover increased performance of ceramic membranes with high flux was demonstrated with continuous dosing of ozone dow et al 2015 in addition on line chemical cleaning with o3 is often considered a eco friendly and safer strategy for ceramic membrane bioreactor sun et al 2018a unlike naclo the exposure of ozone in ceramic mbr triggered much less release of dom where high concentration ozone was found to effectively reduce the generation of biopolymers via degradation of larger biopolymers into low molecular weight substances for assuring long term process sustainability in ceramic mbr sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b 4 2 1 3 membrane modification generally hydrophilic membranes could show lower membrane fouling propensity than hydrophobic membranes for treatment of most wastewaters zhang et al 2011 in addition to excellent mechanical thermal and chemical stability and longer life time robust ceramic membranes are generally preferred particularly due to their excellent hydrophilicity and surface charge characteristics inherently ceramic membranes are hydrophilic in nature due to the existence of surface metal hydroxyl groups lu et al 2016 tian et al 2018 however hydrophilicity degrades more or less after high temperature sintering which is a required step during membrane production improving membrane surface hydrophilicity is always a promising strategy to mitigate membrane fouling santos and judd 2010 considering that the complicated interactions between ceramic membrane surface and foulants dominate membrane fouling during filtration surface modification with better surface engineering characteristics such as hydrophilicity surface potential and surface micro nano structure e g surface patterning is another promising strategy to effectively mitigate membrane fouling usman et al 2021 this method is very promising from the viewpoint of first improving membrane properties without subsequent additional operations consequently saving more operation cost promising surface modification strategies include hydrophilic monomer grafting kujawa 2019 nanoparticle modification guo et al 2016 and surface patterning lyu et al 2020 for example surface patterning of alumina ceramic membrane via three dimension printing was confirm to be a novel strategy to notably increase steady flux and antifouling ability lyu et al 2020 the key aim of these methods is to effectively improve membrane surface engineering characteristics such as hydrophilicity and roughness at a nano or molecular level while not significantly altering pore size rejection and permeation performance surface grafting usually involves the formation of strong chemical bonds between modifier molecules and membrane surface grafting hydrophilic substances onto the alumina anoporetm membrane surface could cause mitigation of significant membrane fouling and flux improvement when compared with the unmodified membranes yeu et al 2009 this protocol presents a promising alternative approach for rationally designing ceramic membranes with alterable organic surface layers which are different from the original ceramic surface furthermore some other antifouling grafting protocols such as phosphonic acid grafting have also been developed lee et al 2016 mustafa et al 2014 despite enhanced anti fouling abilities however grafting of hydrophilic molecules sometimes suffers from issues such as the weak bonding between hydrophilic organic molecules and membrane surfaces resulting in degradation of hydrophilicity and the introduction of potentially toxic substances especially during long term operation recently metal oxide nanoparticles such as tio2 have been increasingly used for surface modification of ceramic membranes achieving great breakthroughs in water and wastewater treatment kim and van der bruggen 2010 usually via formation of a coating surface modification with nano tio2 can increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces enabling highly efficient treatment of wastewaters with enhanced anti fouling ability however possible release or leaching of nanoparticles is a key issue during practical operation especially under harsh conditions such as high pressure and cross flow mode leading inevitably to decreased antifouling ability with time in addition design of top ceramic active layer with a gradient profile was confirm to a promising strategy to not only enable good mechanical stability but enhance filtration performance during operation where membrane fouling decreased with increasing gradient profile ng et al 2020 besides membrane modification the diminishing of membrane foulant interactions such as polar electrostatic and π π interactions was conformed to play a more important role in mitigating fouling of ceramic membrane mustafa et al 2016a b 4 2 2 advanced oxidation enhanced membrane separation advanced oxidation processes aops are able to efficiently degrade and mineralize recalcitrant organic pollutants in various wastewaters li et al 2017 tian et al 2012 generally robust ceramic membranes are more preferred over their polymeric counterparts for combining with advanced oxidation processes due to their much better structural and chemical stability particularly anti oxidation ability song et al 2017 in addition ceramic membranes also offer outstanding mechanical and thermal stability anti swelling ability and long life time dong et al 2018 to effectively mitigate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality ceramic membranes can be used as separation medium coupled with various advanced oxidation technologies table 3 as a dominant promising technology hydroxyl radical oh based aops hr aops such as ozonation oxidation liu et al 2019 and photocatalytic oxidation yang et al 2019 can generate highly active radicals to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling and achieve remarkable improvement in water treatment efficiency while keeping membrane structure undamaged zhang et al 2015 fig 6 shows the production mechanisms of oh and so4 active free radicals in typical advanced oxidation processes direct and catalytic ozonation can be efficiently coupled with ceramic membrane separation via generating highly active free radicals oh to in situ degrade organic foulants li et al 2017 for membrane separation coupled with direct ozonation pretreatment or in situ treatment with o3 could greatly reduce membrane fouling because ozone induced coagulation and an oxidized surface for the aggregates hamid et al 2017 however due to an unfavorable self decomposition of o3 at ambient conditions low utilization rate of o3 with low free radicals yield further limits its wider range applications different from direct ozonation catalytic ozonation is more beneficial to obtain an improved production efficiency of oh since o3 can be highly efficiently locally catalyzed by active catalysts featuring an enhanced oxidation zhao et al 2015a therefore it is more effective to mitigate membrane fouling which highly relies on the reaction between o3 and active catalysts such as noble metals and metal oxides mansas et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 6a the reaction between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts would generate oh to effectively degrade mineralize organic foulants r into harmless inorganics such as co2 h2o and other minerals zhao et al 2016 furthermore novel magnéli phase tino2n 1 4 n 10 has also been demonstrated to be more promising in advanced oxidation process due to its unique advantages such as environmental friendliness excellent robustness and stability and superior catalytic ozonation capability with low metal leaching 0 15 mg l 1 especially for degradation and mineralization of refractory organic foulants esfahani et al 2017 mao et al 2018 if coated on ceramic membrane surface it would achieve a dual function of separation and catalytic degradation however it is sometimes hard to precisely control the proper or optimized dosage of ozone in practical wastewater treatment plants where in most cases an over consumption inevitably increases operation cost yang et al 2019 photocatalysis is a promising degradation technology one of its major limitations is the removal and recovery of photocatalyst power from water after photocatalytic reaction in contrast membrane separation coupled with photocatalytic oxidation is increasingly applied as a promising environmentally sustainable way to eliminate ceramic membrane fouling without the use of any chemical reagents table 3 to overcome the challenging issues of catalyst recovery it is highly feasible to stably immobilize functional photo catalysts onto porous membranes to achieve simultaneous separation and catalytic degradation of refractory contaminants szymanski et al 2017 this catalysis separation coupling strategy can also in situ mitigate ceramic membrane fouling during filtration semiconductor photo catalysts such as tio2 zno wo3 and fe2o3 have been effectively immobilized into robust ceramic membranes fresno et al 2014 among them cost effective tio2 based photo catalysts have received numerous attentions in recent years yang et al 2019 once catalyst such as tio2 is illuminated by uv or visible light i e sunlight the generated oh would mitigate membrane fouling via a photocatalytic oxidation degradation mechanism thus improving the efficiency in membrane filtration process song et al 2017 in principle electron hole pairs e h are generated in this illumination process fig 6b where positive holes h vb can effectively induce oxidization and degradation of organic compounds while negative electrons e cb typically reduce molecular oxygen into active superoxide radical anion hassan et al 2016 compared with pristine tio2 the wider band gaps facilitate the absorption of visible light making magnéli phases more effective for photocatalytic degradation hao et al 2018 for example ti4o7 g c3n4 photocatalysts with heterojunction structure significantly enhanced the efficiency of hypophosphite oxidation due to the generation of charge carrier e h under broader light absorption guan et al 2018 ag tio2 coated kaolin based ceramic membrane exhibited a high removal rate of bpa 88 in 270 min under visible light making it more potential to be used in more water treatment applications shareef et al 2020 how to induce light onto membrane surface remains a big challenge interestingly an sunlight transmitting photocatalytic glass based tio2 membrane was proposed to address this issue nyamutswa et al 2021 recently besides conventional hr aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have also being employed as an emerging alternative which gains increasing popularity for wastewater treatment qin et al 2016 yang et al 2014 table 3 most commonly so4 could be effectively generated by activation of persulfate ps s2o8 2 or peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 via some facile protocols such as photolysis thermolysis antoniou et al 2010 catalysis rastogi et al 2009 and ultrasound cai et al 2015 fig 6c more specially so4 has some outstanding merits such as higher standard redox potential e0 2 5 3 1v olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 wider range of ph values ph 2 8 guan et al 2013 longer half life 30 40 μs hu and long 2016 higher selectivity antoniou et al 2010 than oh e0 1 8 2 7 v ph 7 1 μs consequently it is more suitable for the treatment of highly refractory organic wastewaters such as conventional and emerging pollutants oh et al 2016 however in spite of increasing interests and application potential there are still some key challenging issues such as the possible leaching of immobilized nano catalysts and the possible formation and potential toxicity of produced oxyanions for instance sulfate ions harmful intermediate byproducts and residual pms or ps safety risk and harmful side effect of these unfavorable substances is indeed an important issue for producing better water quality which need to be carefully considered and well addressed for more extended water treatment applications in the future 4 2 3 electrochemistry enhanced membrane separation it is quite challenging to find an alternative efficient and durable way to improve water treatment efficiency without using any chemicals compared with advanced oxidation enhanced membrane separation novel electrochemical protocols have been becoming more promising when coupled with membrane separation since they indeed do not need the addition of hazardous chemicals fu et al 2019b zheng et al 2019 table 4 unlike the process without electric field fig 7 a membrane separation efficiency such as anti fouling flux rejection and foulant degradation can be effectively in situ enhanced in the presence of different electric fields via various mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion between membrane surface and foulants with the same charge fig 7b wang et al 2017a electrophoresis i e migration of charged foulants under electric field away from membrane surface fig 7c yu et al 2012 and electrochemical oxidation i e electro catalysis degradation of foulants on membrane surface fig 7d trellu et al 2018 inherently foulants such as natural organic matters colloids mineral ions and bacteria are always easily adsorbed on membrane surface under such mechanisms various foulants with different charged characteristics can be physically electrostatically repulsed or electrophoretically migrated outward from the membrane surface or even electrochemically eliminated via oxidization or reduction reactions feng et al 2016 this coupling technique not only effectively mitigates membrane fouling but sometimes mineralize hazardous organic matters which is especially suitable for treatment of refractory organic wastewaters therefore the coupling of electrochemistry with membrane separation is increasingly considered as a promising method to improve treatment efficiency due to its potential to relieve most foulants li et al 2018a since ceramic membrane is inherently non conductive i e electrically insulated a key strategy of realizing its electrochemically enhanced separation is to design an electrochemical membrane reactor or system for such a reactor electrochemically modified ceramic membrane is usually used as working electrode i e cathode or anode while highly active metals such as ti or pt mesh act as a counter electrode li et al 2018a application of a micro electric field can effectively mitigate fouling and improve membrane performances at low voltage direct current dc via various modification approaches a first key processing step is to rationally design and develop electro conductive ceramic membranes by coupling insulated ceramic membranes with highly electro conductive materials such as metals ti novel semiconductors and carbon based nano materials development of ceramic metallic composite membranes is a relatively simple and cost effective protocol via rational design of membrane electrodes deposition of highly conductive nano materials such as carbon nanotubes cnts onto into ceramic membrane is a more promising method to obtain ceramic based membrane electrode via vacuum filtration fan et al 2015 oulton et al 2015 or chemical vapor deposition chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015b table 4 the use of modified ceramic membranes as electrodes is an effective way to improve separation performance and antifouling ability under an electrical field both electrochemical reactions and electrophoresis contribute to effective membrane self cleaning considering its excellent conductivity stability and oxygen evolution potential magnéli phase titanium suboxides tino2n 1 4 n 10 have being increasingly used for modification of ceramic membranes to allow more electro chemically enhanced separation applications via enhanced charge transfer reactions smith et al 1998 walsh and wills 2010 as the most common component of magnéli phase ti4o7 phase exhibits a theoretical conductivity of 1000 s cm 1 due to a synergistic effect of electrophoresis and electro catalysis reactions such membranes were also very suitable for treatment of ha wastewater as both separation media and electrode obtaining an enhanced rejection and antifouling performance geng and chen 2017 but their performance and structural stability with time needs to be further studied under long term operation although some promising progress has been successfully made at laboratory and pilot scale tests for this electro chemical separation coupling technique total process energy consumption needs to be carefully considered to verify the sustainability of employing the additional electric field besides additional material and processing cost precise estimation and calculation of energy consumption must be done especially for future practical large scale industrial applications a trade off between treatment efficiency and energy consumption should be considered a critical performance indicator treatment efficiency such as water production and fouling mitigation ratio per unit energy input is suggested for such a comprehensive estimation with and without electrical field applied in addition more reliable and cost effective electrochemical protocols are highly desired to further improve treatment efficiency such as use of high performance materials and rational process or system design optimization 5 harsh water treatment applications of ceramic membranes beyond common separation functions considering its unique advantages especially such as better chemical mechanical and thermal stabilities as well as outstanding anti fouling properties ceramic membranes should or must be more promisingly used in some harsh water treatment applications where polymeric membranes cannot perform well during long term operation due to their inherent unfavorable properties for these harsh applications membrane performance but not cost is the most important concern in recent decades some emerging applications of treating various refractory wastewaters have been being increasingly considered such as oily wastewater high salinity or hyper salinity wastewater conventional emerging organic wastewater and domestic wastewaters 5 1 oil water separation oily wastewater is generated in various domestic and industrial processes such as oil and gas production food beverage processing and mechanical manufacturing which poses significant threats to our ecological environment when discharged into soil and water bodies different from suspended or dispersed oil emulsified oil in wastewater stably exists in a colloidal state with droplet size ranging from nano meter to micro meter consequently efficient separation of emulsified oily wastewater is a major issue for conventional treatment techniques such as gravity settling coagulation adsorption and flotation kajitvichyanukul et al 2011 pitakpoolsil and hunsom 2013 ramaswamy et al 2007 yu et al 2017 in contrast without any chemical addition emerging membrane separation technology is considered a promising sustainable method to highly efficiently treat oil in water o w emulsion wastewater tanudjaja et al 2019 besides separation capability sufficient hydrophilicity is at the core of such membrane processes in which most polymeric membranes with low or moderate hydrophilicity often suffer from unsatisfying anti fouling performance one of unique merits for ceramic membranes is enhanced hydrophilicity i e underwater oleophobicity or even superoleophobicity due to their inherently abundant surface metal hydroxyl groups imparting an excellent anti oil fouling ability for o w emulsion separation wu et al 2022 moreover since ceramic membranes can also show high stability in various oily wastewaters with complicating characteristics such as high temperature strong acidic or alkaline and organic solvent they are expected to be increasingly applied in a larger market capacity goh and ismail 2018 encouragingly increasing progress has been being made for application of ceramic microfiltration mf or ultra filtration uf membranes for oil in water separation for microsized emulsion treatment low cost mullite titania ceramic membranes exhibit a promising water permeance 150 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 outperforming some polymeric membranes 5 76 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 such as polyamide polystyrene and polysulfone membrane zhu et al 2016a mf process is generally capable of removing most oily droplets while ceramic uf membranes with finer pores can be sometimes employed for complete removal compared with conventional and commercial ceramic membranes zirconia uf membrane is the first reported in literature that can effectively reject nano sized oil droplets 18 nm with over 99 rejection wang et al 2022b moreover it has also been challenged with real degreasing wastewater with very high oil content 4284 mg l 1 and ph 12 4 and delivered consistently stable separation performance e g a steady state flux of 65 80 l m 2 h 1 over many operation cycles like other separation applications ceramic membranes for oily water treatment also suffer from a trade off between permeability and selectivity i e oil rejection so it is highly desirable to improve water permeability while maintaining high oil rejection to assure a safe and environment risk free discharge with oil concentration lower than discharge limits zhong et al 2021 in particular understanding membrane fouling mechanism is still a practical challenge and requires understanding of interactions between oil droplets and membrane surface structure and hydrodynamics as fouling exacerbates water flux wang et al 2022b to this end filtration models such as hermia model are suitable for evaluating fouling phenomena nandi et al 2010 even though ceramic membranes have inherently good hydrophilicity and have reasonable anti fouling outcomes their surface hydrophilicity could still be improved with this aim tailoring surface wettability is an effective approach the deposition of metal oxides such as tio2 fe2o3 mno2 cuo and ceo2 on ceramic ultrafiltration membrane surface with surface charge opposite to that of emulsion could effectively reduce irreversible membrane fouling lu et al 2016 a new strategy of coating graphene oxide onto β sialon ceramic membrane was proposed to impart a super hydrophilic property and consequently enhanced antifouling performance for separation of oil in water emulsion kang et al 2019 silicon carbide ceramic membrane from liqtech denmark was demonstrated to be highly efficient for oily wastewater treatment however the unfavorable interactions between foulants and membrane surfaces resulted in irreversible fouling caused by oil droplets locked inside membrane pores and adhered on membrane surface via strong interaction such irreversible fouling weakens membrane performance especially during long term operation further effort is still needed to rationally design novel materials and structure of ceramic membranes as well as to employ more efficient cleaning regimes to improve the treatment performance especially such as permeability and anti oil fouling ability 5 2 saline water desalination due to low energy consumption polymeric reverse osmosis ro membranes are widely used for desalination treatment of seawater and industrial saline wastewaters lee et al 2011 li and wang 2010 to mitigate ro membrane fouling more robust ceramic membranes can be used as promising pre treatment protocol to remove large sized matters such as organic inorganic or microbial particles due to their highly stable advantages especially such as chemical cleaning feasibility salinity resistance mechanical toughness and long operating lifetime fard et al 2018 however current ro membranes are unsuitable for the efficient treatment of high salinity wastewaters i e brines that usually generate ultra high osmotic pressure which consequently makes them infeasible in practical applications current ro membranes also suffer from unsatisfactory chlorine resistance generally due to technical complexity it is hard or quite challenging to scale up fabrication of pure ceramic membranes with nano meter or sub nano meter pores suitable for efficiently sieving of salt ions via pressure driving membrane process in contrast hybrid thermal membrane processes such as ceramic membrane distillation md provide ideal alternatives for effectively desalinating hypersaline feeds even at harsh conditions due to their excellent robustness high separation efficiency and ultrahigh salt enrichment ability fig 8 a and 8c inherently ceramic membranes are hydrophilic and consequently unsuitable for md applications to address this issue hydrophobic or superhydrophobic modification is proposed where surface hydrophobicity is effectively imparted and constructed into ceramic membranes to increase anti wetting properties to water for high performance md via surface grafting of low surface energy organic materials such as fluoroalkylsilane fas and 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane pfts deshmukh et al 2018 by rationally tailoring membrane surface chemistry and morphology design of superhydrophobic or omniphobic membranes has been increasingly reported in recent years lin et al 2014 qtaishat et al 2008 introducing both low surface energy coatings such as fas and re entrant structures is considered as a common route to significantly enhance membrane wetting resistance krajewski et al 2006 lin et al 2014 tao et al tao et al 2018 and mouiya et al mouiya et al 2018 prepared ceramic planar membranes showing salt rejection rate over 99 99 and 99 62 respectively even at high salt concentration 12 wt nevertheless these hydrophobically modified ceramic membranes using fas usually suffer from insufficient long term stability leading to undesirable issues such as wetting fouling and loss of flux and rejection under harsh operating environments lu et al 2009 to address such a challenging issue of md long term stability highly stable hydrophobic modification protocols are proposed to modify ceramic membranes using more robust inorganic nano materials such as nano sinco and cnts dong et al 2018 wang et al 2017c beyond stability further improving treatment efficiency such as water flux would be another concerned issue via some strategies such as design of highly porous structure unlike md without wetting issues pervaporation pv is an alternative thermal membrane process enabling efficient separations for treatment of more challenging highly saline waters with low energy substances such as oil surfactants and organic solvents during pv process liquid water molecules transport across a dense polymeric or nanoporous inorganic membrane selective layer via a dissolution diffusion or adsorption diffusion mechanistic process following by evaporation condensation at permeate side while salt ions are rejected fig 8b and 8d although it is experimentally challenging for growth of stable zeolite or mof defect free selective layers on ceramic membranes to form advanced pv desalination membranes they have also been receiving substantial interests in recent years cho et al 2011 dahanayaka et al 2020 wan et al 2017 one of challenging issues is to minimize the intra crystalline defects to achieve sufficient salt rejection in mof or zeolite selective layers li et al 2021 wang et al 2022a also since low flux could be achieved even under high pressure minimizing membrane thickness while maintaining integrity is another challenging issue since both md and pv are a thermally driven membrane processes energy consumption is also a critical challenge which needs the utilization of more cheaper thermal sources such as low grade industrial residual or waste heat or emerging sources such as solar and joule heating 5 3 organic and emerging contaminant wastewater treatment it is a critical environmental challenge to efficiently treat conventional industrial organic wastewaters which are discharged from various process such as petroleum chemical and textile industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 qin et al 2018 in recent years emerging contaminants ecs have been frequently detected at different concentration levels from trace to high concentrations in various water sources such as drinking water natural water bodies domestic and industrial wastewaters they typically include perfluorinated compounds pfos pfoa endocrine disruptors compounds edcs pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs brominated flame retardants and other toxic substances gani and kazmi 2017 since they pose a potential threat to environmental and human health the development of advanced removal techniques is highly desired besides general separation functions ceramic membranes offer promise for treatment of refractory organic or ecs wastewaters in harsh environments due to their excellent chemical thermal anti oxidation robustness wang et al 2020 based on size sieving pressure driven ceramic based nanofiltration nf or ultrafiltration uf membranes provide viable solutions to physically reject organic pollutants e g 96 8 0 7 for diclofenac sodium 98 9 0 6 for oxytetracycline and 99 7 0 2 for tetracycline to produce clean water yuan et al 2020 to further improve rejection some emerging protocols such as atomic layer deposition are proposed to finely tailor the pore structure and surface properties of ceramic membranes while still maintaining sufficient water permeance 11 3 16 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 shang et al 2017 besides pressure driven membrane processes thermal membrane hybrid processes such as md and pv have also inspired great interests as promising technologies especially for efficient removal of organic water mixtures kujawski et al 2016 for md treatment of organic wastewaters thermally stable hydrophobic or superhydrophobic ceramic membranes are highly desired similar to desalination applications creating a three phase interface i e water vapor membrane to allow water vapor transport across ceramic membranes via knudsen diffusion or viscous flow mechanism while efficiently rejecting contaminants the rejection of 29 trace organic compounds was enhanced to 95 when md combined with thermophilic mbr wijekoon et al 2014 while the rejection of trace organic compounds was as high as 99 5 when combined with forward osmosis process xie et al 2013 generally md is applied in terms of different configurations such as direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd sweep gas membrane distillation sgmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd however md fouling or wetting behavior during long term operation poses a significant challenge which highly depends on the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of contaminants fouling or wetting usually results in the performance degradation in flux and rejection which needs to be carefully addressed li et al 2016a different from md pv process involves a preferential dissolution diffusion or adsorption diffusion mechanism of water molecules across pv membranes while organic pollutants not only non volatile but volatile organic compounds are rejected at feed side kujawa et al 2015 since membrane fouling during pv operation is also an obstacle for practical applications it is crucial to not only understand complicated interactions between membrane surface and contaminants but employ advanced antifouling strategies besides membrane fouling further treatment of concentrate byproducts is still a critical environmental challenge after pressure driven nf uf or thermal membrane hybrid md pv processes to address these issues coupling ceramic membrane separation with advanced oxidation or bioreaction provides a promising way to not only mitigate membrane fouling but partially or completely catalytically or biologically degrade contaminants into harmless substances some well developed or emerging advanced oxidation techniques such as electrocatalysis photocatalysis and ozonation catalysis have been being introduced into membrane separation system to further improve treatment efficiency and anti fouling ability ahmad et al 2017 stoitsas et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 rational incorporation of various nano catalysts into porous ceramic membranes is a crucial step to generate highly active radicals such as reactive oxygen and chlorine species achieving dual function of physical separation and chemical oxidation degradation via additional protocols such as electric field lights uv or visible light and o3 input fan et al 2014 guo et al 2016 wang et al 2008 these coupling processes involved complicated mechanisms for instance for electrocoagulation electrofiltration process multi step mechanisms occurred for removing target ecs ⅰ size exclusion ⅱ electrostatic repulsion ⅲ adsorption ⅳ electrocoagulation and ⅴ electrofiltration yang et al 2016 however in spite of the promising application the release of nano catalysts into permeated effluents can cause environment risk which needs to be avoided by employing strategies such as optimization of operating parameters and binding enhancement between membrane and nano catalysts large amounts of municipal sewage are discharged causing a great threat on ecological environment due to robust structure and long service lifespan ceramic membrane bioreactors cmbrs are developed to simultaneously achieve membrane separation with aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation via microorganisms fig 9 which is more suitable for treatment of domestic wastewaters with high concentration organic matters wang et al 2019a cmbrs have the potential to resist various corrosive chemicals such as cleaning reagents e g sodium hypochlorite solution and harsh environmental conditions e g high temperature and salinity stable flux and high sludge retention time are achieved without microbial inactivity under long term operation for decentralized sewage treatment shin and kang 2003 among cmbrs anaerobic cmbrs ancmbrs are a more promising potential solution to achieve energy neutrality for wastewater treatment plants in the future yue et al 2015 since ceramic membranes can reject a high concentration of biomass due to mitigated membrane damage ancmbrs often have higher organic removal rates than conventional polymeric based anmbrs aslam et al 2018 to mitigate fouling and improve treatment efficiency some pretreatment techniques such as coagulation flocculation and sedimentation are applied to combine with cmbrs for treatment of domestic wastewaters with high turbidity total suspended solid and phosphorus concentration charfi et al 2018 im et al 2019 labanda and llorens 2008 however the chemical types dosage and operation parameters need to be optimized to obtain the best performance one of the key obstacles for full scale cmbrs applications is still the high capital cost of commercial ceramic membranes in spite of much longer service lifespan employment of low cost mineral or waste based ceramic membranes is expected to provide a sustainable solution in addition to above mentioned typical wastewaters oily saline and organic emerging contaminant wastewaters efficient treatment of more challenging industrial wastewaters is highly desired for ceramic membranes they always exhibit strongly acidic alkaline high temperature or highly corrosive resistant features for which conventional treatment techniques such as polymeric membrane separation cannot perform well heavy metal wastewater is highly acidic which is one of harsh wastewaters discharged from various industrial processes such as electroplating mining metallurgy and paper or steel industry mukherjee et al 2018 nedzarek et al 2015 unlike commercial polymeric membranes requiring complexing agents or macromolecules added more robust ceramic ultrafiltration membranes i e metal oxides free of any additives not only show better long term operation stability but exhibit better separation performance 98 rejection even for smaller sized iron iii via adsorption and size sieving in extreme chemical environments ph 2 bernat et al 2009 arsenic lead ii and chromium vi and other heavy metal ions could also be efficiently removed and then recovered by ceramic ultrafiltration membrane processes choudhury et al 2018 sabbatini et al 2010 furthermore highly stable ceramic nf membranes are demonstrated to be feasible for removal of radioactive species i e uranium from nuclide wastewaters discharged from nuclear power stations even under harsh conditions e g high energy radiation where polymeric membranes would be easily damaged chung et al 2019b 6 engineering applications of ceramic membranes due to their superior separation

progresses in the past decade as a more competitive separation technique different configurations and sizes of ceramic membranes have also been well developed such as tubular flat sheet hollow fiber

demonstrated to have good separation performance for oily brine zoubeik and henni 2017 more importantly full scale ceramic membranes based water treatment plants are also rapidly increasingly

limiting their larger scale applications in water treatment large housing that fits many ceramic membrane elements ceramac pwnt the netherlands effectively lowers the overall capital cost consequently having more engineering opportunities fig 10h table 5 a large stainless steel housing is usually used to resist high pressure backwash with less frequent management and maintenance robust and reliable ceramic membranes are used in some small scale potable water recycling plants in a remote location davis station antarctica zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a further reducing cost and improving treatment efficiency are the future development directions of ceramic membranes for a wide range large scale water treatment applications it s still needed to commercially develop new ceramic membrane types with acceptable or even better performance but lower cost 7 conclusions and prospects although robust ceramic membranes are increasingly used in various water treatment applications decreasing capital cost and enhancing efficiency are still two key challenging application oriented issues to address these issues over the past decades great efforts have been being devoted via employing various strategies such as the development of low cost membranes novel forming sintering techniques operation at high flux efficiency enhanced coupling techniques and novel membrane housings beyond conventional ceramic membranes new types of ceramic membranes with lower cost are being developed as alternatives using cheaper materials such as natural minerals and solid state wastes these low cost ceramic membranes exhibit comparable or even higher performance at laboratory scale compared to conventional ceramic membranes nevertheless the element and phase compositions of most mineral and waste powders are complicated which highly depend on the location from where they are sourced moreover particle size classification is still a problem for large scalable application there are more uncertainties and risks to be fully addressed for the fabrication and large scale production of low cost ceramic membranes with acceptable or better property and performance another challenge for current commercial ceramic membranes is their higher cost due to complicated or high energy consumption fabrication techniques particularly in forming and sintering process in addition to low cost membrane materials some promising strategies have also been being rapidly developed to decrease processing cost by employing techniques such as centrifugal casting phase inversion co sintering and low temperature sintering these techniques are quite promising for reducing ceramic membrane processing cost beyond traditional membrane fouling control strategies various promising methods have been being employed to significantly enhance treatment efficiency by coupling membrane separation with some advanced techniques such as advanced oxidation and electrochemical processes robust ceramic membranes with strong anti oxidation performance can be used as the separation medium coupled with various advanced oxidation technologies during separation highly active radicals are generated to in situ to degrade organic foulants to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling and to achieve improvement in water treatment efficiency while keeping membrane structure undamaged however safety risk and side effects of harmful intermediate byproducts is indeed an important issue for producing better water quality which needs to be carefully considered and well addressed compared with advanced oxidation electrochemical protocols are more promising when coupled with ceramic membrane separation without the addition of any chemicals in the presence of different electric fields membrane separation efficiency especially fouling mitigation and flux improvement can be effectively in situ enhanced via various mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion electrophoresis and electrochemical oxidation reduction i e electro catalysis a key strategy of realizing its electrochemically enhanced separation is to design an electrochemical membrane reactor with optimized system and process nevertheless energy consumption needs to be carefully considered from the viewpoint of process sustainability due to the employment of the additional electric field ceramic membranes are more promisingly used in some harsh water treatment applications such as oily wastewater high salinity wastewater conventional emerging organic wastewater and domestic wastewaters as well as more challenging heavy metal or radioactive nuclide wastewaters besides these applications future work needs also focus on more challenging applications such as ion or molecule precise separations for high value resource recovery by rationally designing next generation ceramic based membranes with nano or subnano pores which are not widely availably currently although ceramic membrane based water treatment technique would be competitive in some challenging harsh separation applications its price or capital cost is an important factor limiting their larger scale water treatment applications ceramic membranes can be applied as pretreatment for reverse osmosis seawater desalination where the capital cost can be offset by the reduced cost of the short intake structure similarly some engineering design strategies such as large membrane housing could also further decrease capital cost further reducing cost and improving treatment efficiency are the future development directions of ceramic membranes for more water treatment applications it s still needed to develop not only new lower cost ceramic membrane types with acceptable or even better performance but more efficiency enhanced process strategies to promote

during this period of elevated turbidity hereafter described as the pre cleanup phase the well is flushed for 1 2 hours on average with groundwater discharged to waste until turbidity is less than 3 0

of the 61 wells typically operated on cycles 2 1 3 treatment of groundwater the produced groundwater is either discharged to a reservoir 23 of the 61 wells or discharged directly to distribution 38 of the 61 wells the wells that discharge directly to distribution have on site chlorination at the wellhead where chlorine is applied as liquid sodium hypochlorite to produce a 1 mg l as cl2 residual

thereafter started only to waste for required compliance sampling or studies due to this operational status the direct to distribution wells are described as direct to waste wells to clarify that the

evaluating the use of chlorine injected upstream of a static mixer was performed at a groundwater well that had persistently detectable concentrations of legionella the well was operated with a flow rate of 955 gpm 0 060 m3 s free chlorine was added in line through a static mixer immediately upon startup at varying doses 0 5 to 2 5 mg l as cl2 legionella total atp turbidity free chlorine and other water quality parameters were monitored in samples collected with immediate chlorine quenching over the first 90 minutes of well startup samples were collected from four different taps along the discharge piping to produce four chlorine contact times before chlorine addition 2 minutes 4 minutes and 6 minutes sample collection was staggered to collect approximately the same plug of water in addition to analyses with legiolert l pneumophila and membrane filtration legionella spp select samples were sent to rtl genomics lubbock tx usa for quantification of the 16s rrna gene i e estimate of total bacterial concentration and 16s rrna gene sequencing i e characterization of microbial community structure these included non chlorinated samples collected at 5 64 and 84 minutes of well operation and chlorinated samples from each subsequent tap corresponding to the raw water sample collected at 5 minutes 2 3 2 in situ well chlorination a full scale study on the effect of in situ wellbore chlorination on legionella occurrence in produced groundwater was also conducted a well with frequent detections of legionella during continuous operation was chosen for the study this well had a column pipe volume of 14 900 gallons 56 m3 and bore hole volume of 33 507 gallons 217 m3 well disinfection was conducted in accordance and ansi awwa c654 13 awwa standard disinfection of wells 2013 liquid sodium hypochlorite 10 16 or 100 160 g l was fed between the column pipe casing and in the interior of the column pipe 8 gallons and 17 gallons 0 03 m3 and 0 06 m3 respectively to provide a chlorine residual of approximately 75 120 mg l throughout the bore hole volume the area between the casing and the column pipe as well as the interior of the column pipe were flushed with groundwater 500 gallons and 2000 gallons 1 9 m3 and 7 6 m3 respectively immediately after chlorine was added to ensure all chlorine reached water level and to provide some agitation the well was left stagnant for approximately 24 hours before the chlorinated water was pumped out legiolert samples were collected before shutdown prior to chlorination 1 hour after well startup daily for 7 days and at least once monthly until the well was shut down 2 4 data analysis for map creation and evaluating spatial distribution patterns esri arcmap 10 7 1 software was used with arctoolbox spatial analysis interpolation tools multiple interpolation methods were evaluated results from natural neighbor interpolation analysis are presented and discussed sigmaplot for windows 14 0 3 192 was used to make the majority of the figures throughout the manuscript microbiological concentration data e g l pneumophila concentration is displayed on the y axis usually in log scale unless otherwise specified box and whisker plots were constructed with uncensored data however data above and below detection limits are not displayed on box and whisker plots the boundaries of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentile of data the line inside the box marks the median 50th percentile whiskers represent the 10th to 25th lower and 75th to 90th upper percentile of data and symbols represent data below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile for the majority of statistical analysis results from both parametric and non parametric tests are presented with both α 0 05 and α 0 10 considered parametric tests are most appropriate for non censored data i e when the majority of samples are within quantification limits and not above or below a detection limit and or have exact values e g counts and assume normal distribution of data non parametric tests are more conservative and most appropriate when a substantial portion of data is censored i e reported as at above or at below quantification limits correlation coefficients e g pearson s r and spearman s rho are presented to indicate the strength of a correlation for the purpose of interpretation a correlation was considered moderately strong when the coefficient was 0 5 moderate when 0 5 coefficient 0 3 weak when the coefficient was 0 3 and very weak when the coefficient was 0 1 both the statistical significance i e p value and the strength of the correlation are important to consider in interpreting results parametric tests using both non transformed and common log transformed l pneumophila concentrations were performed an assumption of parametric tests is that the data are normally distributed microbiological concentration data are usually log normally distributed and thus log transformation of the l pneumophila concentration is a more conservative approach and more likely to meet the normality assumption for parametric tests substitution for censored data was avoided however when necessary values below the lower detection limit were imputed as 1 10th of the quantification limit and values at or above the upper quantification limit were substituted as the quantification limit as appropriate parametric test results for censored data are presented degree of censorship indicated and results compared to those from non parametric tests when appropriate simple linear regression analysis was performed and pearson s r is presented for parametric correlation analysis of uncensored data for non parametric correlation analysis the spearman s rho parameter was determined for statistical comparison of two sample sets e g legionella concentration at wells with pump type a vs pump type b two sample two tailed student s t test assuming equal variances as confirmed by statistical variance tests was used for parametric analysis and mann whitney rank sum test was used for non parametric analysis for statistical comparison of three or more data sets anova was used for parametric analysis and kruskal wallis test used for non parametric analysis guidance on test selection and methods used to perform the statistical analyses is described elsewhere helsel 2012 the water quality parameters evaluated in the statistical tests are likely dependent upon each other to varying degrees multicollinearity between the predictor variables i e water quality parameters except l pneumophila was evaluated using parametric tests i e regression and anova as appropriate and results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 legionella occurrence in raw finished and distributed water throughout 2010 2011 raw surface water samples n 46 were collected from pumping stations feeding water from lake mead to two water treatment facilities wtfs additional samples n 7 were collected from a newly constructed water intake in 2018 the membrane filtration method was used to analyze 2010 2011 samples because this was prior to idexx legiolert availability the 2018 samples were analyzed using the legiolert method all 53 raw surface water samples tested negative for either legionella spp membrane filtered samples or l pneumophila legiolert samples finished water samples from the two wtfs were also collected on the same dates as raw surface water samples n 28 in 2010 2011 n 14 in 2018 the principal unit processes at both plants include ozonation pre chlorination coagulation granular media filtration and final chlorination consistent with the raw surface water these 42 finished water samples were also negative for either legionella spp 2010 2011 membrane filtered or l pneumophila 2018 legiolert results confirmed that the water entering the distribution system from the two wtfs was free of detectable legionella concentrations these results are consistent with those of lechevallier lechevallier 2020 2019a 2019b l pneumophila was monitored in the distribution system n 101 at 66 unique sampling locations throughout spring fall 2018 from spring summer 2018 5 5 months there was no l pneumophila detected in 70 samples collected across 55 distribution system sampling sites in fall 2018 low levels of l pneumophila were detected at two different locations at concentrations of 1 and 5 mpn 100 ml and confirmed with qpcr at which point regulators at ndep bsdw were notified the two locations were resampled a week after the initial samples were collected due to legiolert 7 day incubation and results for l pneumophila were below detection after further investigation it was determined that these sites were located near a single groundwater well w097 in fig s1 that tested positive for l pneumophila and discharged directly into the distribution system after wellhead chlorination 1 mg l as cl2 subsequently all groundwater wells discharging directly to the distribution system were shut down and have remained out of operation since the initial detection of l pneumophila from this point forward in the text direct to distribution wells are described as direct to waste wells to clarify that the water from these wells was not discharged to distribution but rather waste l pneumophila monitoring in the distribution system continued in 2018 n 101 across 66 sites 2019 n 158 across 75 sites and 2020 n 428 across 73 sites since the initial l pneumophila detections in 2018 and shutdown of groundwater wells discharging directly to distribution l pneumophila has not been detected in the distribution system at any potable water sampling location including where the two previous positive samples were collected however low levels of l pneumophila were detected at a fire riser non potable water in 2019 at 5 mpn 100 ml on first draw and at 4 mpn 100 ml after a 10 minute flush the collocated upstream and downstream potable water locations in the distribution system were also tested on the same date with no l pneumophila detected the same fire riser was sampled several times over the following 5 months with no further detection of l pneumophila these results are consistent with what has been demonstrated in building water studies that dead ends and pipes containing stagnant water are susceptible to microbial growth and contamination the implementation of building water management plans which address dead ends and water stagnation is essential in limiting risks to building occupants 3 2 legionella occurrence in nontreated groundwater the groundwater system was extensively evaluated and monitored following establishment of the link between the l pneumophila detection in the distribution system and a groundwater production well w097 in fig s1 the direct to waste wells represent 80 020 gpm 116 mgd 5 1 m3 s of groundwater well production capacity 63 of total groundwater system start up and sampling of these wells was initiated only for research studies and required routine compliance monitoring with all groundwater chlorinated and discharged to waste the other 46 455 gpm 66 mgd 2 9 m3 s of groundwater capacity 37 of total groundwater system capacity comes from wells that discharge to reservoirs where extended chlorine ct is maintained average ct 40 164 mg min l the reservoirs and groundwater wells that remained in operation were sampled on a weekly basis results of l pneumophila monitoring for both well discharge schemes given in fig 1 show that l pneumophila has been detected at least once in non treated groundwater from all wells across the system with an overall positivity rate of 38 343 908 the proportion of positive 1 mpn 100 ml l pneumophila samples collected from direct to waste wells with intermittent operation were substantially greater 64 132 205 samples than those wells discharging to reservoirs with continuous operation 30 211 703 samples additionally the concentration range was larger and trended higher for direct to waste wells than wells discharging to reservoirs time of sample collection in relation to well startup is likely responsible for these trends and is discussed in further detail in subsequent sections the spatial distribution patterns of l pneumophila were also evaluated to identify potential sources hotspots or plumes fig 2 shows that wells with high concentrations of l pneumophila are clustered clustering indicates that point sources or characteristics specific to these areas of the aquifer could potentially be identified and inform control strategies though this type of investigation is beyond the scope of this manuscript fig 2 also demonstrates the importance in separating data before pre cleanup and after post cleanup the well is flushed with hotspots or clustering appearing slightly different when data are separated turbidity and flushing are discussed further in subsequent sections 3 3 design and operational considerations 3 3 1 well start up and flushing fig 3 shows a temporal occurrence pattern in samples from a well w097 in fig s1 with frequent l pneumophila detections at startup after a period of 322 days during which the well was not operated for 2 hours at a time l pneumophila concentration was statistically correlated with sample collection time in relation to startup time parametric p 0 03 r 0 3 and non parametric analysis p 0 00001 ρ 0 92 fig 3 demonstrates that the elapsed time between startup and time of sample collection is important to consider stagnation time is also likely an important factor contributing to l pneumophila proliferation and is currently being explored biofilm growth during periods of stagnation or inactivity and or the absence of disinfectant residual in pipes is thought to be largely responsible for proliferation of legionella and their host cells amoebae or protists within building water systems dupuy et al 2011 lechevallier 2019a omoregie et al 2022 wang et al 2012 this logic may also apply to groundwater systems where inactivity may lead to biofilm growth and enhanced conditions for the proliferation of l pneumophila and their hosts during the initial period of well startup much of the biofilm in the well and surroundings may slough off and thus the presence and concentration of l pneumophila detected in the groundwater is at their highest levels while there are typically fewer or no detections of l pneumophila after the initial startup period there are some wells that continue to produce water with detectable levels of l pneumophila throughout operation due to potential risks associated with l pneumophila and following recommendations from state regulators ndep bdsw the wells discharging direct to waste remain out of operation until the circumstances are better understood and a treatment strategy has been demonstrated to effectively control l pneumophila turbidity measurements are considered in groundwater operations during startup to indicate when a well should be returned to service when to collect microbiological samples for demonstrating well disinfection and potentially other purposes turbidity thresholds may vary by utility lvvwd has a turbidity threshold of 3 0 ntu with pre cleanup turbidity at 3 0 ntu and post cleanup turbidity at 3 0 ntu fig 4 shows that achieving this turbidity target results in a substantial reduction in l pneumophila the difference in l pneumophila concentration in the samples collected during the pre cleanup phase versus the post cleanup phase was statistically significant p 0 001 whether raw data or log transformed data was analyzed using both a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variances parametric and a mann whitney rank sum test non parametric on average pre cleanup l pneumophila concentrations are more than two orders of magnitude higher than post cleanup samples mean 2 792 353 mpn 100 ml vs 24 3 mpn 100 ml median 105 mpn 100 ml vs 1 mpn 100 ml respectively only 23 of pre cleanup samples had l pneumophila concentrations below detection 1 mpn 100 ml while 78 of post cleanup samples were below detection figs 2 4 demonstrate that l pneumophila concentrations appear to be effectively reduced by flushing until turbidity is 3 0 ntu for most wells e g 76 72 5a 18a 103 115 while some wells e g 22a 23a 85 97 101 continuously produce water with detectable levels of l pneumophila in the post cleanup phase 3 3 2 in line chlorination for wells discharging direct to waste chlorine ct all groundwater at direct to waste wells is chlorinated at the wellhead to a free chlorine target residual of 1 0 mg l as cl2 given estimated travel time between chlorine application point and the point where groundwater could be discharged into the distribution system the average chlorine ct is 1 4 mg min l and ranges from 0 1 to 10 9 mg min l for direct to waste wells fig 5 shows l pneumophila concentrations measured in non treated no chlorine added versus chlorinated groundwater from direct to waste wells the l pneumophila concentration in post chlorinated samples was substantially lower demonstrating that chlorination provided l pneumophila inactivation the difference in l pneumophila concentration in the samples collected with no chlorine exposure versus post chlorination was statistically significant when log transformed data was analyzed using a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variances parametric p 0 02 and when both raw and log transformed data were analyzed using a mann whitney rank sum test non parametric p 0 03 the l pneumophila concentration was not statistically different p 0 24 in non treated versus post chlorinated samples when raw data not log transformed was analyzed using a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variance however analysis of the log transformed data is more conservative and the non log transformed data sets did not pass the normality test meaning the assumptions of this statistical test were not met despite the inactivation achieved by chlorination a considerable portion of post chlorination samples 48 still had detectable levels of l pneumophila therefore further evaluation of chlorination efficacy for l pneumophila inactivation was needed in response to this finding a full scale evaluation of chlorine disinfection kinetics and efficacy of chlorination was performed and results are discussed in section 3 5 3 3 3 wells discharging to reservoirs chlorine ct lvvwd has 9 reservoirs that are at least in part fed by groundwater wells chlorine residual is continuously monitored and ct maintained average ct 40 164 mg min l in 2019 april september 139 samples were collected from these reservoirs and in 2020 june december 308 samples were collected out of the combined 447 samples there were two cases of presumptive false positive detections where legiolert gave a result of 1 mpn 100 ml but no genetic material associated with l pneumophila was detected by qpcr in the legiolert sample post incubation in the summer of 2020 two reservoirs had confirmed l pneumophila detections 42 mpn 100 ml and 5 mpn 100 ml triggering the shutdown of the wells w028 w029a w033 w086 in fig s1 that serve these reservoirs these detections were approximately two weeks after groundwater started to be discharged to these reservoirs reservoir 1 gowan was drained cleaned and monitored prior to and following return to routine operation during draining and cleaning biofilm was observed after a brief shutdown of the well w086 in fig s1 serving reservoir 2 rice the chlorine injected at the well head was temporarily boosted and once the reservoir was confirmed negative for l pneumophila the well and reservoir were returned to routine operation overall well managed chlorine monitoring and dosing was shown to effectively control l pneumophila in reservoirs however frequent legionella sample collection and reservoir maintenance was also demonstrated as essential particularly at the time of groundwater well startups 3 4 correlation between legionella well characteristics and water quality correlations between well characteristics and water quality data were evaluated to 1 potentially identify sources or factors contributing to the levels of l pneumophila in groundwater and 2 evaluate indicators that may suggest l pneumophila presence earlier than legiolert mf analyses 7 days the positive correlations between l pneumophila concentration and atp and turbidity were statistically significant at α 0 05 with moderate to moderately strong correlations table 1 fig 6 and regardless of whether raw water only or raw chlorinated sample results table s1 were used and whether parametric log transformed non transformed or non parametric analysis was performed the correlations were strongest for non parametric analysis which is the most appropriate correlation analysis for moderately censored data atp is an indicator of biological activity and higher turbidity has been associated with poor bacteriological water quality and thus the strong positive correlation between l pneumophila and these two parameters is logical l pneumophila atp and turbidity were generally highest at well startup this may indicate the presence of l pneumophila due to stagnant water or the sloughing of l pneumophila containing biofilm from the well or aquifer whereas a decrease in atp and turbidity may indicate when stagnant water and sloughed biofilm have been flushed out of the column pipe and area of influence monitoring both atp and turbidity could reduce the likelihood of discharging l pneumophila from a groundwater well work is currently being pursued to determine threshold atp and or turbidity values to use as operational tools e g how long to run wells to waste when it is appropriate to sample for l pneumophila and if when it is appropriate to return a well to service hpc is another general measure of bacteriological water quality and l pneumophila was statistically correlated with hpc at α 0 05 when non parametric analysis and parametric analysis with non transformed data was performed and statistically significant at α 0 10 when log transformed l pneumophila data were used the slight discrepancy in significance testing may be an artifact of the low sample number n 14 and though the degree of censorship of l pneumophila data was low 7 the degree of censorship of hpc data was high 64 the correlation between l pneumophila and hpc was moderate to moderately strong with all correlation analyses indicating hpc may be a decent indicator of l pneumophila however when chlorinated sample data were removed and only non treated samples were included in the analysis the correlation was no longer significant whether non or log transformed data were used table s1 this result suggests that hpc may be a better indicator of chlorination efficacy rather than an indicator of l pneumophila occurrence hpc is also a less ideal indicator than atp or turbidity because hpc requires a multi day incubation whereas atp and turbidity can be measured in near real time and allow for an immediate response the dataset in which both hpc and l pneumophila were quantified was small and more research may better inform this relationship but due to the required incubation time it is of lower priority than other parameters as an indicator of l pneumophila nutrients including nitrate and orthophosphate are necessary for microbiological growth and proliferation l pneumophila was statistically correlated with orthophosphate at α 0 05 when non parametric analysis was performed and statistically correlated at α 0 10 when parametric analysis with both non and log transformed data was performed table 1 the discrepancy in significance again may be an artifact of the low sample number n 13 the correlation between l pneumophila and orthophosphate was moderately strong with all analyses indicating orthophosphate as a potentially important indicator and influencing parameter for l pneumophila the correlation between l pneumophila and nitrate was substantially weaker the correlation between l pneumophila and nitrate was significant at α 0 05 when non transformed combined data raw chlorinated was used and significant at α 0 10 when parametric analysis with log transformed data was used table 1 given the weak correlation and the fact that non parametric analysis and parametric analysis with log transformed data are more conservative and likely most appropriate for this dataset nitrate was considered a lower priority water quality parameter to consider these results suggest that l pneumophila proliferation may be phosphorous limited and that elevated nutrient levels could potentially drive the growth of l pneumophila in groundwater wells though further research is needed to make definitive conclusions if further research does indicate a strong correlation between l pneumophila and nutrient levels this could indicate that a comprehensive l pneumophila control strategy should include management of nutrient sources e g septic influence irrigation with recycled water agriculture etc for future well development decisions nutrient analysis of groundwater and identification of potential point sources could also indicate suitability the positive correlation between l pneumophila and ph was statistically significant with all analyses at α 0 05 but the correlation coefficients were weak to moderate at best table 1 this weak but statistically significant correlation may be an artifact of the high number of samples n 970 included in the analyses when chlorinated sample data were removed the correlation between l pneumophila and ph remained significant but weak furthermore when data from the pre cleanup samples turbidity 3 0 ntu were removed the correlation with ph was no longer statistically significant with both non and log transformed l pneumophila concentrations it was also found that ph was statistically correlated with multiple other water quality parameters including turbidity temperature and presence of a chlorine residual due to correlation with other parameters and the weakness of the correlation ph is less relevant as a meaningful parameter or potential indicator of l pneumophila occurrence in previous studies lechevallier 2019a national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2019 temperature was indicated as a potentially important factor in l pneumophila occurrence in distribution and building water systems with 25 30 c as the optimal proliferation range and 18 c as a threshold above which l pneumophila had been detected in distribution systems all water temperatures measured in this study were above 18 c ranging from 18 7 to 27 8 c fig s2 log transformed l pneumophila concentration was statistically positively correlated with groundwater temperature at α 0 05 but the correlation was very weak r 0 11 also no other analyses indicated statistical significance or a stronger correlation this weak but statistically significant correlation may again be an artifact of the high number of samples n 970 included in the analyses these results suggest that temperature may not be an important parameter influencing l pneumophila concentrations in warmer groundwater e g t 18 c more research is needed in other regions and water temperature ranges to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between temperature and l pneumophila proliferation in groundwater and whether warmer groundwaters are at higher risk for l pneumophila occurrence l pneumophila concentration was only statistically correlated at α 0 05 with one evaluated well characteristic pump depth and the strength of the positive correlation was moderate fig s3 this correlation may indicate that the deeper the pump intake the higher the l pneumophila concentration was likely to be and thus l pneumophila may be deeper in groundwater wells and or the aquifer this correlation however was weak and not statistically significant when non transformed data or non parametric analysis was used l pneumophila was not statistically correlated with well depth which indicates the depth of the bore hole and well materials whereas pump depth indicates where the water is being pulled from and the area of influence well age pump type and screen type were statistically correlated at α 0 10 with only one of the three statistical analyses each the l pneumophila correlation with pump type was statistically significant only when non transformed data were used making this relationship questionable the strength of the l pneumophila correlation with well age was weak also indicating it as potentially irrelevant the l pneumophila correlation with screen type was statistically relevant at α 0 10 when a kruskal wallis test was performed non parametric analysis but there is no correlation coefficient indicated to assess the strength of this relationship fig s3 shows no apparent pattern or difference in distribution of l pneumophila concentrations amongst the screen types so significance could potentially be an artifact of there being only a single well with copper bearing steel screens overall these results suggest that atp turbidity and orthophosphate are the strongest and most relevant indicators of l pneumophila occurrence in groundwater and further investigation of these water quality parameters is warranted previous studies indicate temperature as a potentially important parameter but this was not apparent in the warm las vegas valley groundwater these results suggest that l pneumophila is likely dependent on the native well environment and groundwater quality additionally l pneumophila was not linked to specific well materials nor well age and was not directly influenced by the rate at which a well produces water i e design capacity during routine operation however the results indicate that l pneumophila presence may be more likely with deeper pump depths 3 5 legionella disinfection kinetics with chlorine a full scale study at a contaminated well was performed where free chlorine was added in line at a static mixer at varying doses 0 4 2 0 mg l and samples collected at several contact times t 0 2 1 3 9 5 7 mins legiolert results produced unexpectedly low l pneumophila concentrations 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml and 1 to 12 mpn 100 ml in non treated and chlorinated samples respectively previous legiolert results showed l pneumophila concentrations consistently higher at well startup in non treated samples at 66 to 10 176 mpn 100 ml during the pre cleanup phase and 4 to 36 mpn 100 ml in the post cleanup phase 90 min of well run time membrane filtration results during the study also showed two orders of magnitude higher concentrations than legiolert and non treated concentrations from membrane filtration were consistent with qpcr results therefore membrane filtration results legionella spp are presented it was later found that legiolert samples in this chlorination study were inadvertently overdosed with chlorine quenching agent sodium thiosulfate which may have hindered legionella growth and or interfere with the legiolert method according to idexx westbrook me usa fig s4 shows the legionella spp concentration measured in samples prior to chlorine addition and after chlorine addition at the different contact times and doses legionella spp concentrations were highest in non treated groundwater with a maximum of 221 cfu 100 ml after 20 minutes of well run time the legionella spp concentration in raw water decreased over time to reach a steady state of 45 50 cfu 100 ml after 1 hour of well run time fig 7 shows the legionella spp log inactivation as a function of chlorine ct the data were fitted using a base 10 chick watson model log inactivation 0 28 ct with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 87 according to the results and chick watson model 4 log 3 log 2 log and 1 log inactivation would require ct s of 15 11 8 and 4 mg min l respectively these results are consistent with the ct results for inactivation of free not amoeba internalized l pneumophila in bench scale studies in the literature cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 kuchta et al 1983 although amoeba internalization has been shown to substantially increase ct requirements relative to equivalent free l pneumophila inactivation cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 park 2019 thus our results may be explained by a few possible scenarios a the legionella spp observed and inactivated in the groundwater in this study were free legionella spp b the legionella spp hosts in this study were more susceptible to chlorine than in the other studies or c the amoeba internalized legionella spp did not slough off in appreciable and consistent quantities to affect the required chlorine ct chlorination resulted in substantial reduction of legionella spp down to 1 10 cfu 100 ml but consistent non detects did not occur under the conditions studied a second chick watson model log inactivation 0 19 ct fig 7 establishes the most conservative relationship between log inactivation and ct based on the current dataset specifically the lowest slope established by two points thereby incorporating a safety factor when establishing ct targets whether chlorination at the wellhead will be sufficient at other groundwater wells depends on three factors a the treatment goal b the initial concentration of legionella spp in non treated water and c the chlorine ct the chick watson model discussed above and shown in fig 7 can be used to determine to what extent a given chlorine ct can meet treatment goals based on historical data for direct to distribution wells average ct 1 4 mg min l achieving non detect conditions for legionella spp at the point of entry into the distribution system would require initial concentrations in non treated groundwater to remain 2 cfu 100 ml moreover at the lowest cts e g 0 1 mg min l chlorination would be wholly ineffective for inactivating legionella spp therefore chlorination alone would be insufficient to maintain non detect 1 mpn 100 ml legionella spp post chlorination at the majority of lvvwd wells that discharge directly to the distribution system eight of 38 wells that currently operate as direct to waste have cts above the aforementioned lvvwd average even so l pneumophila occurrence at each of those wells e g average median max and the post cleanup average concentration for all wells 24 mpn 100 ml suggest that only two direct to waste wells achieve sufficient cts without operational changes w105 with a ct of 9 7 mg min l and w074 with a ct of 10 9 mg min l chlorination at the wellhead is sufficient to maintain non detect legionella spp with the caveat that initial legionella spp concentrations remain below 510 and 1 160 cfu 100 ml respectively this condition is expected based on current occurrence data if the more conservative chick watson model were used legionella spp would need to be maintained below 69 and 120 cfu 100 ml respectively if non detect is the treatment goal additional control measures or optimization of chlorine concentration and or contact time would be required at the majority of wells recent guidance from the cdc and other experts suggests a legionella spp threshold of 100 cfu 100 ml above which additional treatment or other remediation is suggested centers for disease control and prevention 2021 lechevallier 2020 less than 3 of post cleanup samples had l pneumophila 100 cfu 100 ml and these levels have been exclusively observed at well startup based on the average chlorine ct of 1 4 mg min l for direct to waste wells chlorine would be sufficient to maintain legionella spp 100 cfu 100 ml as long as initial legionella spp concentrations remain below 247 cfu 100 ml and 185 cfu 100 ml for the fitted and conservative chick watson models respectively at wells with higher than average chlorine cts 1 4 to 10 9 mg min l the cdc treatment goals could be met with even higher legionella spp concentrations in non treated groundwater fitted model 250 to 116 000 cfu 100 ml conservative model 186 to 12 000 cfu 100 ml for wells with the lowest cts e g 0 1 mg min l legionella spp would need to remain below 104 to 106 cfu 100 ml in non treated groundwater to meet the cdc guidelines overall legionella is rarely seen in non treated groundwater above the cdc suggested threshold and thus chlorination would be more of an added safety factor rather than a method to control legionella spp analyses were also performed to understand changes in the microbial community and legionella spp indicators during well startup and with chlorination similar to legionella spp total bacteria as measured by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna gene hpc turbidity and atp all decreased with well run time and with chlorination fig s5 proposed indicators namely turbidity and atp followed the same pattern as legionella spp with a maximum occurring several minutes after startup but slightly earlier than for legionella spp which peaked at 10 minutes although total bacterial and legionella spp concentrations decreased with ct chlorination also induced shifts in microbial community structure i e based on 16s rrna gene sequencing alpha diversity increased significantly as a function of chlorine exposure with the shannon index log base 2 increasing from 6 68 0 34 in the non chlorinated sample to 7 85 0 07 p 0 030 and 8 23 0 25 p 0 045 for cts of 3 6 mg min l and 7 2 mg min l respectively the shannon index then decreased to 7 35 0 30 p 0 20 for the chlorine ct of 10 4 mg min l changes in beta diversity as a function of chlorine ct were also observed as illustrated by distinct clustering in the principal coordinate analyses pcoas in fig s6 and visual differences in the phylum level taxa bar plot in fig s7 interestingly shifts in microbial community structure were also evident for legionellaceae legionella spp and l pneumophila with these taxa exhibiting increased relative abundance at higher chlorine cts figs s8 and s9 therefore legionella spp and l pneumophila may either be more chlorine resistant than the broader microbial community or perhaps they are mobilized under high chlorine exposure conditions due to biofilm dynamics further investigation is required to definitively understand the relationship between relative abundance of legionella and chlorine exposure 3 6 in situ legionella disinfection with chlorine in situ disinfection with chlorine was performed at one well w085 in fig s1 to assess whether chlorination of the well column and bore hole could be used to control legionella without need for additional treatment beyond chlorine residual needed for distribution as shown in fig s10 l pneumophila in the groundwater was 37 mpn 100 ml prior to treatment after chlorine was added to achieve 75 120 mg l residual the well was left stagnant for 25 5 hours in situ disinfection the well was flushed for 1 5 hours to bring residual chlorine to below detection 0 04 mg l the first sample was collected after 1 75 hours of flushing where the l pneumophila concentration was below detection levels in the produced groundwater in subsequent samples l pneumophila remained below detection up to 50 hrs after treatment however l pneumophila was detectable 74 hrs 98 hrs 122 hrs and longer after treatment there was a single sample beyond 122 hrs post treatment that was below detection 145 hr after treatment that may be due to a normal variation in l pneumophila concentration l pneumophila concentration appeared to increase steadily from 72 to 122 hours when the concentration plateaued around the pre treatment concentration or higher 4 implications following the detection of legionella in las vegas valley groundwater the utility lvvwd snwa and the state regulators ndep bsdw collaborated to determine the appropriate operational response ultimately the decision was made to take the direct to distribution wells out of service until a suitable treatment barrier was installed and validated guidance from ndep bsdw recommended monitoring of wells and reservoirs weekly and monitoring 50 distribution system locations on a monthly basis lang 2022 both legiolert and the mf method referred to as the cdc method in the correspondence were named as acceptable legionella quantification methods with a requirement to serotype positive samples the guidance includes maintaining chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l and legionella concentration 5 mpn 100 ml in reservoirs and the distribution system lang 2022 also wells associated with a reservoir or distribution system location will be taken out of service under any of the following conditions legionella is detected at 5 mpn 100 ml in a reservoir distribution system location l pneumophila sg1 is detected 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml in a reservoir distribution system location or if l pneumophila sg2 14 is detected 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml in both the well and reservoir distribution system location lang 2022 the existing requirement for reservoirs per the gwr remains as maintaining a chlorine ct to achieve 4 log virus inactivation this guidance represents the first approach toward creating guidelines on the topic this framework can be used to promote broader discussions as more occurrence and health risk data are generated these decisions illustrate how proactive utility research and communication with the local regulatory agency resulted in greater public health protection in the absence of a federal regulation however the decision also resulted in a temporary loss of water resources for the las vegas community 116 mgd 5 1 m3 s fortunately surface water supplies and direct to reservoir groundwater supplies were available to meet water demands while pursuing additional treatment options for the direct to distribution wells the occurrence results from this study indicate that more widespread monitoring is needed to examine the ubiquity of legionella in groundwater supplies guidance for utility monitoring of legionella in distributions systems was recently published centers for disease control and prevention 2021 lechevallier 2020 planning should also involve the local regulatory agency and consider potential outcomes of a positive legionella detection including alternative water supplies diversification and or augmentation and temporary permanent treatment barriers legionella spp and l pneumophila quantification require specialized equipment experience or expensive analysis from commercial labs the culture based analyses also require 7 day incubation time which is a major limitation for follow up monitoring and being able to rapidly respond to a positive detection additional monitoring can help support the development of different threshold water quality indicators e g temperature atp turbidity and operating parameters e g stagnation time flushing time seasonal use that could place individual groundwater supplies into different risk categories for potential legionella occurrence for example groundwater supplies with temperature 18 c may be at greater risk than supplies with temperature 18 c this type of framework could help to guide a mandated monitoring program of groundwater supplies additional site specific considerations may impact the monitoring and potential treatment response based on system size large small and disinfectant usage none chlorine chloramine our chlorine treatment results demonstrated that meeting the 4 log virus inactivation requirements may not ensure non detect legionella in groundwater prior to distribution increasing the chlorine dose up to a maximum of 4 mg l and contact time may allow groundwater systems to achieve higher exposure ct conditions for inactivation but these changes would have to be balanced with potential disinfection byproduct concerns e g trihalomethanes site footprint restrictions may prompt the use of alternative treatment strategies e g ultraviolet uv disinfection to achieve legionella inactivation cost benefit analyses and validation studies of different legionella control and treatment options are needed to justify implementation costs and confirm the efficacy of strategies at both municipal well and point of entry point of use scales 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated legionella occurrence in the las vegas valley drinking water sources surface water and groundwater finished water after treatment at wtfs treated water chlorinated reservoirs and in the distribution system we further evaluated occurrence and operational or engineered treatment options including a full scale assessment of chlorination to control legionella in groundwater our major findings included the following legionella did not occur or was well controlled in surface water water treatment facilities reservoirs with extended chlorine ct 39 to 164 mg min l and in the distribution system all lvvwd wells had at least one non treated groundwater sample that tested positive for l pneumophila and there was an overall positivity rate of 38 343 908 legionella concentration was negatively statistically correlated with time from well startup p 0 05 atp and turbidity were also highest at startup of wells and decreased significantly with well run time flushing wells to turbidity 3 0 ntu successfully reduced legionella but did not fully eliminate contamination in some wells atp and turbidity are good indicators for legionella contamination and can potentially be used as operational tools during startup atp turbidity orthophosphate and pump depth were found to be the most relevant indicators of l pneumophila concentration in the las vegas valley groundwater as indicated by the strength of correlations and their statistical significance this indicates that the native well environment influences l pneumophila and that contamination may increase with depth chlorination resulted in substantial reduction of legionella spp up to 2 5 logs but complete inactivation did not occur in the full scale study chlorine ct is insufficient to fully inactivate legionella spp at most las vegas valley groundwater production wells that historically discharged direct to distribution primarily due to short contact times between chlorine application and connection points within the distribution system chlorine cts must be 15 11 and 8 mg min l to achieve 4 3 and 2 log inactivation respectively chlorine ct increased relative abundance of legionella potentially indicating greater resistance to chlorine than the general bacterial community in situ well disinfection reduced l pneumophila in produced groundwater for the first 48 hours after treatment but l pneumophila concentrations increased after 72 hours to stabilize at pretreatment concentrations author contributions the manuscript was written

treated water and in the distribution system although method detection and sample processing improvements have allowed for more focused and persistent monitoring of groundwater since 2018 the main objective of this manuscript is to summarize this historical dataset which includes 61 groundwater wells from across the las vegas valley and provide a preliminary evaluation of chlorination for

adenosine triphosphate atp and 4 assess chlorination for the inactivation of legionella in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of las vegas valley water system 2 1 1 spatial distribution and influence of groundwater wells lvvwd currently operates 61 wells for production or dual use production and aquifer recharge there are also recharge wells monitoring wells and an estimated 3 400 domestic and 1 167 quasi municipal wells in the las vegas valley the spatial distribution of lvvwd wells is given in fig s1 the depth to water below ground surface bgs varies depending on location and conditions at time of measurement within the las vegas valley groundwater system the static depth to water at production wells currently ranges between 50 to 525 ft bgs 15 to 160 m bgs and during pumping this level drops an additional 50 ft bgs 15 m bgs locally well depths range from 890 to 1590 ft bgs 271 to 485 m bgs with 1125 ft bgs 343 m bgs on average and pump depths from 103 to 854 ft bgs 31 to 260 m bgs with 562 ft bgs 171 m bgs on average casing materials are steel and screen materials are mild steel stainless steel high strength low alloy steel or copper bearing steel wells are equipped with either submersible or vertical line shaft vls pumps a number of these wells are dual use wells and can be used for aquifer recharge depending on location the influences on groundwater wells vary and may include natural infiltration septic fields golf course irrigation and artificial recharge production rates across the 61 wells range from 700 to 4 300 gpm 0 044 to 0 27 m3 s with an average of 2 073 gpm 0 13 m3 s 2 1 2 seasonal well operation start up and flushing typically production wells are operated only during summer months april may june to september october to alleviate peak demand or for brief periods during water treatment facility outages due to seasonal use production wells are often stagnant for a period of 5 to 7 months upon startup the groundwater has elevated turbidity 20 ntu comprised of stagnation products including background particulate matter biological growth in the aquifer and inorganic corrosion products from the well shaft materials during this period of elevated turbidity hereafter described as the pre cleanup phase the well is flushed for 1 2 hours on average with groundwater discharged to waste until turbidity is less than 3 0 ntu there is no in situ disinfection e g chlorination of the wellbore or column pipe included in the regular start up procedure well chlorination is performed when new equipment e g pump is installed or sanitary seal is broken awwa standard disinfection of wells 2013 once placed into service wells are operated either continuously 24 hr d 7d wk or in 12 hour cycles during the summer months with 29 of the 61 wells typically operated on cycles 2 1 3 treatment of groundwater the produced groundwater is either discharged to a reservoir 23 of the 61 wells or discharged directly to distribution 38 of the 61 wells the wells that discharge directly to distribution have on site chlorination at the wellhead where chlorine is applied as liquid sodium hypochlorite to produce a 1 mg l as cl2 residual immediately after dosing chlorine is added to maintain disinfectant levels 0 5 mg l in areas of the distribution system served by groundwater and groundwater blended with treated surface water no other chemicals e g corrosion inhibitors are added to the groundwater due to positive l pneumophila detections in groundwater all direct to distribution wells were taken out of operation in 2018 and thereafter started only to waste for required compliance sampling or studies due to this operational status the direct to distribution wells are described as direct to waste wells to clarify that the water is not being discharged to the distribution system the reservoirs are chlorinated to 1 mg l and the residual is monitored on line with minimum and maximum setpoints of 0 7 and 1 3 mg l respectively the nine reservoirs receive a blend of treated surface water and chlorinated groundwater and have average chlorine ct concentration mg l x time min ranging from 39 to 164 mg min l and minimum ct of 4 8 to 14 1 mg min l sufficient to achieve the 4 log virus inactivation specified in the ground water rule us epa 2006 2 2 water quality measurements and sampling protocols best

evaluating the use of chlorine injected upstream of a static mixer was performed at a groundwater well that had persistently detectable concentrations of legionella the well was operated with a flow rate of 955 gpm 0 060 m3 s free chlorine was added in line through a static mixer immediately upon startup at varying doses 0 5 to 2 5 mg l as cl2 legionella total atp turbidity free chlorine and other water quality parameters were monitored in samples collected with immediate chlorine quenching over the first 90 minutes of well startup samples were collected from four different taps along the discharge piping to produce four chlorine contact times before chlorine addition 2 minutes 4 minutes and 6 minutes sample collection was staggered to collect approximately the same plug of water in addition to analyses with legiolert l pneumophila and membrane filtration legionella spp select samples were sent to rtl genomics lubbock tx usa for quantification of the 16s rrna gene i e estimate of total bacterial concentration and 16s rrna gene sequencing i e characterization of microbial community structure these included non chlorinated samples collected at 5 64 and 84 minutes of well operation and chlorinated samples from each subsequent tap corresponding to the raw water sample collected at 5 minutes 2 3 2 in situ well chlorination a full scale study on the effect of in situ wellbore chlorination on legionella occurrence in produced groundwater was also conducted a well with frequent detections of legionella during continuous operation was chosen for the study this well had a column pipe volume of 14 900 gallons 56 m3 and bore hole volume of 33 507 gallons 217 m3 well disinfection was conducted in accordance and ansi awwa c654 13 awwa standard disinfection of wells 2013 liquid sodium hypochlorite 10 16 or 100 160 g l was fed between the column pipe casing and in the interior of the column pipe 8 gallons and 17 gallons 0 03 m3 and 0 06 m3 respectively to provide a chlorine residual of approximately 75 120 mg l throughout the bore hole volume the area between the casing and the column pipe as well as the interior of the column pipe were flushed with groundwater 500 gallons and 2000 gallons 1 9 m3 and 7 6 m3 respectively immediately after chlorine was added to ensure all chlorine reached water level and to provide some agitation the well was left stagnant for approximately 24 hours before the chlorinated water was pumped out legiolert samples were collected before shutdown prior to chlorination 1 hour after well startup daily for 7 days and at least once monthly until the well was shut down 2 4 data analysis for map creation and evaluating spatial distribution patterns esri arcmap 10 7 1 software was used with arctoolbox spatial analysis interpolation tools multiple interpolation methods were evaluated results from natural neighbor interpolation analysis are presented and discussed sigmaplot for windows 14 0 3 192 was used to make the majority of the figures throughout the manuscript microbiological concentration data e g l pneumophila concentration is displayed on the y axis usually in log scale unless otherwise specified box and whisker plots were constructed with uncensored data however data above and below detection limits are not displayed on box and whisker plots the boundaries of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentile of data the line inside the box marks the median 50th percentile whiskers represent the 10th to 25th lower and 75th to 90th upper percentile of data and symbols represent data below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile for the majority of statistical analysis results from both parametric and non parametric tests are presented with both α 0 05 and α 0 10 considered parametric tests are most appropriate for non censored data i e when the majority of samples are within quantification limits and not above or below a detection limit and or have exact values e g counts and assume normal distribution of data non parametric tests are more conservative and most appropriate when a substantial portion of data is censored i e reported as at above or at below quantification limits correlation coefficients e g pearson s r and spearman s rho are presented to indicate the strength of a correlation for the purpose of interpretation a correlation was considered moderately strong when the coefficient was 0 5 moderate when 0 5 coefficient 0 3 weak when the coefficient was 0 3 and very weak when the coefficient was 0 1 both the statistical significance i e p value and the strength of the correlation are important to consider in interpreting results parametric tests using both non transformed and common log transformed l pneumophila concentrations were performed an assumption of parametric tests is that the data are normally distributed microbiological concentration data are usually log normally distributed and thus log transformation of the l pneumophila concentration is a more conservative approach and more likely to meet the normality assumption for parametric tests substitution for censored data was avoided however when necessary values below the lower detection limit were imputed as 1 10th of the quantification limit and values at or above the upper quantification limit were substituted as the quantification limit as appropriate parametric test results for censored data are presented degree of censorship indicated and results compared to those from non parametric tests when appropriate simple linear regression analysis was

comparison of two sample sets e g legionella concentration at wells with pump type a vs pump type b two sample two tailed student s t test assuming equal variances as confirmed by statistical variance tests was used for parametric analysis and mann whitney rank sum test was used for non parametric analysis for statistical comparison of three or more data sets anova was used for parametric analysis and kruskal wallis test used for non parametric analysis guidance on test selection and methods used to perform the statistical analyses is described elsewhere helsel 2012 the water quality parameters evaluated in the statistical tests are likely dependent upon each other to varying degrees multicollinearity between the predictor variables i e water quality parameters except l pneumophila was evaluated using parametric tests i e regression and anova as appropriate and results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 legionella occurrence in raw finished and distributed water throughout 2010 2011 raw surface water samples n 46 were collected from pumping stations feeding water from lake mead to two water treatment facilities wtfs additional samples n 7 were collected from a newly constructed water intake in 2018 the membrane filtration method was used to analyze 2010 2011 samples because this was prior to idexx legiolert availability the 2018 samples were analyzed using the legiolert method all 53 raw surface water samples tested negative for either legionella spp membrane filtered samples or l pneumophila legiolert samples finished water samples from the two wtfs were also collected on the same dates as raw surface water samples n 28 in 2010 2011 n 14 in 2018 the principal unit processes at both plants include ozonation pre chlorination coagulation granular media filtration and final chlorination consistent with the raw surface water these 42 finished water samples were also negative for either legionella spp 2010 2011 membrane filtered or l pneumophila 2018 legiolert results confirmed that the water entering the distribution system from the two wtfs was free of detectable legionella concentrations these results are consistent with those of lechevallier lechevallier 2020 2019a 2019b l pneumophila was monitored in the distribution system n 101 at 66 unique sampling locations throughout spring fall 2018 from spring summer 2018 5 5 months there was no l pneumophila detected in 70 samples collected across 55 distribution system sampling sites in fall 2018 low levels of l pneumophila were detected at two different locations at concentrations of 1 and 5 mpn 100 ml and confirmed with qpcr at which point regulators at ndep bsdw were notified the two locations were resampled a week after the initial samples were collected due to legiolert 7 day incubation and results for l pneumophila were below detection after further investigation it was determined that these sites were located near a single groundwater well w097 in fig s1 that tested positive for l pneumophila and discharged directly into the distribution system after wellhead chlorination 1 mg l as cl2 subsequently all groundwater wells discharging directly to the distribution system were shut down and have remained out of operation since the initial detection of l pneumophila from this point forward in the text direct to distribution wells are described as direct to waste wells to clarify that the water from these wells was not discharged to distribution but rather waste l pneumophila monitoring in the distribution system continued in 2018 n 101 across 66 sites 2019 n 158 across 75 sites and 2020 n 428 across 73 sites since the initial l pneumophila detections in 2018 and shutdown of groundwater wells discharging directly to distribution l pneumophila has not been detected in the distribution system at any potable water sampling location including where the two previous positive samples were collected however low levels of l pneumophila were detected at a fire riser non potable water in 2019 at 5 mpn 100 ml on first draw and at 4 mpn 100 ml after a 10 minute flush the collocated upstream and downstream potable water locations in the distribution system were also tested on the same date with no l pneumophila detected the same fire riser was sampled several times over the following 5 months with no further detection of l pneumophila these results are consistent with what has been demonstrated in building water studies that dead ends and pipes containing stagnant water are susceptible to microbial growth and contamination the implementation of building water management plans which address dead ends and water stagnation is essential in limiting risks to building occupants 3 2 legionella occurrence in nontreated groundwater the groundwater system was extensively evaluated and monitored following establishment of the link between the l pneumophila detection in the distribution system and a groundwater production well w097 in fig s1 the direct to waste wells represent 80 020 gpm 116 mgd 5 1 m3 s of groundwater well production capacity 63 of total groundwater system start up and sampling of these wells was initiated only for research studies and required routine compliance monitoring with all groundwater chlorinated and discharged to waste the other 46 455 gpm 66 mgd 2 9 m3 s of groundwater capacity 37 of total groundwater system capacity comes from wells that discharge to reservoirs where extended chlorine ct is maintained average ct 40 164 mg min l the reservoirs and groundwater wells that remained in operation were sampled on a weekly basis results of l pneumophila monitoring for both well discharge schemes given in fig 1 show that l pneumophila has been detected at least once in non treated groundwater from all wells across the system with an overall positivity rate of 38 343 908 the proportion of positive 1 mpn 100 ml l pneumophila samples collected from direct to waste wells with intermittent operation were substantially greater 64 132 205 samples than those wells discharging to reservoirs with continuous operation 30 211 703 samples additionally the concentration range was larger and trended higher for direct to waste wells than wells discharging to reservoirs time of sample collection in relation to well startup is likely responsible for these trends and is discussed in further detail in subsequent sections the spatial distribution patterns of l pneumophila were also evaluated to identify potential sources hotspots or plumes fig 2 shows that wells with high concentrations of l pneumophila are clustered clustering indicates that point sources or characteristics specific to these areas of the aquifer could potentially be identified and inform control strategies though this type of investigation is beyond the scope of this manuscript fig 2 also demonstrates the importance in separating data before pre cleanup and after post cleanup the well is flushed with hotspots or clustering appearing slightly different when data are separated turbidity and flushing are discussed further in subsequent sections 3 3 design and operational considerations 3 3 1 well start up and flushing fig 3 shows a temporal occurrence pattern in samples from a well w097 in fig s1 with frequent l pneumophila detections at startup after a period of 322 days during which the well was not operated for 2 hours at a time l pneumophila concentration was statistically correlated with sample collection time in relation to startup time parametric p 0 03 r 0 3 and non parametric analysis p 0 00001 ρ 0 92 fig 3 demonstrates that the elapsed time between startup and time of sample collection is important to consider stagnation time is also likely an important factor contributing to l pneumophila proliferation and is currently being explored biofilm growth during periods of stagnation or inactivity and or the absence of disinfectant residual in pipes is thought to be largely responsible for proliferation of legionella and their host cells amoebae or protists within building water systems dupuy et al 2011 lechevallier 2019a omoregie et al 2022 wang et al 2012 this logic may also apply to groundwater systems where inactivity may lead to biofilm growth and enhanced conditions for the proliferation of l pneumophila and their hosts during the initial period of well startup much of the biofilm in the well and surroundings may slough off and thus the presence and concentration of l pneumophila detected in the groundwater is at their highest levels while there are typically fewer or no detections of l pneumophila after the initial startup period there are some wells that continue to produce water with detectable levels of l pneumophila throughout operation due to potential risks associated with l pneumophila and following recommendations from state regulators ndep bdsw the wells discharging direct to waste remain out of operation until the circumstances are better understood and a treatment strategy has been demonstrated to effectively control l pneumophila turbidity measurements are considered in groundwater operations during startup to indicate when a well should be returned to service when to collect microbiological samples for demonstrating well disinfection and potentially other purposes turbidity thresholds may vary by utility lvvwd has a turbidity threshold of 3 0 ntu with pre cleanup turbidity at 3 0 ntu and post cleanup turbidity at 3 0 ntu fig 4 shows that achieving this turbidity target results in a substantial reduction in l pneumophila the difference in l pneumophila concentration in the samples collected during the pre cleanup phase versus the post cleanup phase was statistically significant p 0 001 whether raw data or log transformed data was analyzed using both a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variances parametric and a mann whitney rank sum test non parametric on average pre cleanup l pneumophila concentrations are more than two orders of magnitude higher than post cleanup samples mean 2 792 353 mpn 100 ml vs 24 3 mpn 100 ml median 105 mpn 100 ml vs 1 mpn 100 ml respectively only 23 of pre cleanup samples had l pneumophila concentrations below detection 1 mpn 100 ml while 78 of post cleanup samples were below detection figs 2 4 demonstrate that l pneumophila concentrations appear to be effectively reduced by flushing until turbidity is 3 0 ntu for most wells e g 76 72 5a 18a 103 115 while some wells e g 22a 23a 85 97 101 continuously produce water with detectable levels of l pneumophila in the post cleanup phase 3 3 2 in line chlorination for wells discharging direct to waste chlorine ct all groundwater at direct to waste wells is chlorinated at the wellhead to a free chlorine target residual of 1 0 mg l as cl2 given estimated travel time between chlorine application point and the point where groundwater could be discharged into the distribution system the average chlorine ct is 1 4 mg min l and ranges from 0 1 to 10 9 mg min l for direct to waste wells fig 5 shows l pneumophila concentrations measured in non treated no chlorine added versus chlorinated groundwater from direct to waste wells the l pneumophila concentration in post chlorinated samples was substantially lower demonstrating that chlorination provided l pneumophila inactivation the difference in l pneumophila concentration in the samples collected with no chlorine exposure versus post chlorination was statistically significant when log transformed data was analyzed using a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variances parametric p 0 02 and when both raw and log transformed data were analyzed using a mann whitney rank sum test non parametric p 0 03 the l pneumophila concentration was not statistically different p 0 24 in non treated versus post chlorinated samples when raw data not log transformed was analyzed using a two tail two sample t test assuming equal variance however analysis of the log transformed data is more conservative and the non log transformed data sets did not pass the normality test meaning the assumptions of this statistical test were not met despite the inactivation achieved by chlorination a considerable portion of post chlorination samples 48 still had detectable levels of l pneumophila therefore further evaluation of chlorination efficacy for l pneumophila inactivation was needed in response to this finding a full scale evaluation of chlorine disinfection kinetics and efficacy of chlorination was performed and results are discussed in section 3 5 3 3 3 wells discharging to reservoirs chlorine ct lvvwd has 9 reservoirs that are at least in part fed by groundwater wells chlorine residual is continuously monitored and ct maintained average ct 40 164 mg min l in 2019 april september 139 samples were collected from these reservoirs and in 2020 june december 308 samples were collected out of the combined 447 samples there were two cases of presumptive false positive detections where legiolert gave a result of 1 mpn 100 ml but no genetic material associated with l pneumophila was detected by qpcr in the legiolert sample post incubation in the summer of 2020 two reservoirs had confirmed l pneumophila detections 42 mpn 100 ml and 5 mpn 100 ml triggering the shutdown of the wells w028 w029a w033 w086 in fig s1 that serve these reservoirs these detections were approximately two weeks after groundwater started to be discharged to these reservoirs reservoir 1 gowan was drained cleaned and monitored prior to and following return to routine operation during draining and cleaning biofilm was observed after a brief shutdown of the well w086 in fig s1 serving reservoir 2 rice the chlorine injected at the well head was temporarily boosted and once the reservoir was confirmed negative for l pneumophila the well and reservoir were returned to routine operation overall well managed chlorine monitoring and dosing was shown to effectively control l pneumophila in reservoirs however frequent legionella sample collection and reservoir maintenance was also demonstrated as essential particularly at the time of groundwater well startups 3 4 correlation between legionella well characteristics and water quality correlations between well characteristics and water quality data were evaluated to 1 potentially identify sources or factors contributing to the levels of l pneumophila in groundwater and 2 evaluate indicators that may suggest l pneumophila presence earlier than legiolert mf analyses 7 days the positive correlations between l pneumophila concentration and atp and turbidity were statistically significant at α 0 05 with moderate to moderately strong correlations table 1 fig 6 and regardless of whether raw water only or raw chlorinated sample results table s1 were used and whether parametric log transformed non transformed or non parametric analysis was performed the correlations were strongest for non parametric analysis which is the most appropriate correlation analysis for moderately censored data atp is an indicator of biological activity and higher turbidity has been associated with poor bacteriological water quality and thus the strong positive correlation between l pneumophila and these two parameters is logical l pneumophila atp and turbidity were generally highest at well startup this may indicate the presence of l pneumophila due to stagnant water or the sloughing of l pneumophila containing biofilm from the well or aquifer whereas a decrease in atp and turbidity may indicate when stagnant water and sloughed biofilm have been flushed out of the column pipe and area of influence monitoring both atp and turbidity could reduce the likelihood of discharging l pneumophila from a groundwater well work is currently being pursued to determine threshold atp and or turbidity values to use as operational tools e g how long to run wells to waste when it is appropriate to sample for l pneumophila and if when it is appropriate to return a well to service hpc is another general measure of bacteriological water quality and l pneumophila was statistically correlated with hpc at α 0 05 when non parametric analysis and parametric analysis with non transformed data was performed and statistically significant at α 0 10 when log transformed l pneumophila data were used the slight discrepancy in significance testing may be an artifact of the low sample number n 14 and though the degree of censorship of l pneumophila data was low 7 the degree of censorship of hpc data was high 64 the correlation between l pneumophila and hpc was moderate to moderately strong with all correlation analyses indicating hpc may be a decent indicator of l pneumophila however when chlorinated sample data were removed and only non treated samples were included in the analysis the correlation was no longer significant whether non or log transformed data were used table s1 this result suggests that hpc may be a better indicator of chlorination efficacy rather than an indicator of l pneumophila occurrence hpc is also a less ideal indicator than atp or turbidity because hpc requires a multi day incubation whereas atp and turbidity can be measured in near real time and allow for an immediate response the dataset in which both hpc and l pneumophila were quantified was small and more research may better inform this relationship but due to the required incubation time it is of lower priority than other parameters as an indicator of l pneumophila nutrients including nitrate and orthophosphate are necessary for microbiological growth and proliferation l pneumophila was statistically correlated with orthophosphate at α 0 05 when non parametric analysis was performed and statistically correlated at α 0 10 when parametric analysis with both non and log transformed data was performed table 1 the discrepancy in significance again may be an artifact of the low sample number n 13 the correlation between l pneumophila and orthophosphate was moderately strong with all analyses indicating orthophosphate as a potentially important indicator and influencing parameter for l pneumophila the correlation between l pneumophila and nitrate was substantially weaker the correlation between l pneumophila and nitrate was significant at α 0 05 when non transformed combined data raw chlorinated was used and significant at α 0 10 when parametric analysis with log transformed data was used table 1 given the weak correlation and the fact that non parametric analysis and parametric analysis with log transformed data are more conservative and likely most appropriate for this dataset nitrate was considered a lower priority water quality parameter to consider these results suggest that l pneumophila proliferation may be phosphorous limited and that elevated nutrient levels could potentially drive the growth of l pneumophila in groundwater wells though further research is needed to make definitive conclusions if further research does indicate a strong correlation between l pneumophila and nutrient levels this could indicate that a comprehensive l pneumophila control strategy should include management of nutrient sources e g septic influence irrigation with recycled water agriculture etc for future well development decisions nutrient analysis of groundwater and identification of potential point sources could also indicate suitability the positive correlation between l pneumophila and ph was statistically significant with all analyses at α 0 05 but the correlation coefficients were weak to moderate at best table 1 this weak but statistically significant correlation may be an artifact of the high number of samples n 970 included in the analyses when chlorinated sample data were removed the correlation between l pneumophila and ph remained significant but weak furthermore when data from the pre cleanup samples turbidity 3 0 ntu were removed the correlation with ph was no longer statistically significant with both non and log transformed l pneumophila concentrations it was also found that ph was statistically correlated with multiple other water quality parameters including turbidity temperature and presence of a chlorine residual due to correlation with other parameters and the weakness of the correlation ph is less relevant as a meaningful parameter or potential indicator of l pneumophila occurrence in previous studies lechevallier 2019a national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2019 temperature was indicated as a potentially important factor in l pneumophila occurrence in distribution and building water systems with 25 30 c as the optimal proliferation range and 18 c as a threshold above which l pneumophila had been detected in distribution systems all water temperatures measured in this study were above 18 c ranging from 18 7 to 27 8 c fig s2 log transformed l pneumophila concentration was statistically positively correlated with groundwater temperature at α 0 05 but the correlation was very weak r 0 11 also no other analyses indicated statistical significance or a stronger correlation this weak but statistically significant correlation may again be an artifact of the high number of samples n 970 included in the analyses these results suggest that temperature may not be an important parameter influencing l pneumophila concentrations in warmer groundwater e g t 18 c more research is needed in other regions and water temperature ranges to provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between temperature and l pneumophila proliferation in groundwater and whether warmer groundwaters are at higher risk for l pneumophila occurrence l pneumophila concentration was only statistically correlated at α 0 05 with one evaluated well characteristic pump depth and the strength of the positive correlation was moderate fig s3 this correlation may indicate that the deeper the pump intake the higher the l pneumophila concentration was likely to be and thus l pneumophila may be deeper in groundwater wells and or the aquifer this correlation however was weak and not statistically significant when non transformed data or non parametric analysis was used l pneumophila was not statistically correlated with well depth which indicates the depth of the bore hole and well materials whereas pump depth indicates where the water is being pulled from and the area of influence well age pump type and screen type were statistically correlated at α 0 10 with only one of the three statistical analyses each the l pneumophila correlation with pump type was statistically significant only when non transformed data were used making this relationship questionable the strength of the l pneumophila correlation with well age was weak also indicating it as potentially irrelevant the l pneumophila correlation with screen type was statistically relevant at α 0 10 when a kruskal wallis test was performed non parametric analysis but there is no correlation coefficient indicated to assess the strength of this relationship fig s3 shows no apparent pattern or difference in distribution of l pneumophila concentrations amongst the screen types so significance could potentially be an artifact of there being only a single well with copper bearing steel screens overall these results suggest that atp turbidity and orthophosphate are the strongest and most relevant indicators of l pneumophila occurrence in groundwater and further investigation of these water quality parameters is warranted previous studies indicate temperature as a potentially important parameter but this was not apparent in the warm las vegas valley groundwater these results suggest that l pneumophila is likely dependent on the native well environment and groundwater quality additionally l pneumophila was not linked to specific well materials nor well age and was not directly influenced by the rate at which a well produces water i e design capacity during routine operation however the results indicate that l pneumophila presence may be more likely with deeper pump depths 3 5 legionella disinfection kinetics with chlorine a full scale study at a contaminated well was performed where free chlorine was added in line at a static mixer at varying doses 0 4 2 0 mg l and samples collected at several contact times t 0 2 1 3 9 5 7 mins legiolert results produced unexpectedly low l pneumophila concentrations 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml and 1 to 12 mpn 100 ml in non treated and chlorinated samples respectively previous legiolert results showed l pneumophila concentrations consistently higher at well startup in non treated samples at 66 to 10 176 mpn 100 ml during the pre cleanup phase and 4 to 36 mpn 100 ml in the post cleanup phase 90 min of well run time membrane filtration results during the study also showed two orders of magnitude higher concentrations than legiolert and non treated concentrations from membrane filtration were consistent with qpcr results therefore membrane filtration results legionella spp are presented it was later found that legiolert samples in this chlorination study were inadvertently overdosed with chlorine quenching agent sodium thiosulfate which may have hindered legionella growth and or interfere with the legiolert method according to idexx westbrook me usa fig s4 shows the legionella spp concentration measured in samples prior to chlorine addition and after chlorine addition at the different contact times and doses legionella spp concentrations were highest in non treated groundwater with a maximum of 221 cfu 100 ml after 20 minutes of well run time the legionella spp concentration in raw water decreased over time to reach a steady state of 45 50 cfu 100 ml after 1 hour of well run time fig 7 shows the legionella spp log inactivation as a function of chlorine ct the data were fitted using a base 10 chick watson model log inactivation 0 28 ct with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 87 according to the results and chick watson model 4 log 3 log 2 log and 1 log inactivation would require ct s of 15 11 8 and 4 mg min l respectively these results are consistent with the ct results for inactivation of free not amoeba internalized l pneumophila in bench scale studies in the literature cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 kuchta et al 1983 although amoeba internalization has been shown to substantially increase ct requirements relative to equivalent free l pneumophila inactivation cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 park 2019 thus our results may be explained by a few possible scenarios a the legionella spp observed and inactivated in the groundwater in this study were free legionella spp b the legionella spp hosts in this study were more susceptible to chlorine than in the other studies or c the amoeba internalized legionella spp did not slough off in appreciable and consistent quantities to affect the required chlorine ct chlorination resulted in substantial reduction of legionella spp down to 1 10 cfu 100 ml but consistent non detects did not occur under the conditions studied a second chick watson model log inactivation 0 19 ct fig 7 establishes the most conservative relationship between log inactivation and ct based on the current dataset specifically the lowest slope established by two points thereby incorporating a safety factor when establishing ct targets whether chlorination at the wellhead will be sufficient at other groundwater wells depends on three factors a the treatment goal b the initial concentration of legionella spp in non treated water and c the chlorine ct the chick watson model discussed above and shown in fig 7 can be used to determine to what extent a given chlorine ct can meet treatment goals based on historical data for direct to distribution wells average ct 1 4 mg min l achieving non detect conditions for legionella spp at the point of entry into the distribution system would require initial concentrations in non treated groundwater to remain 2 cfu 100 ml moreover at the lowest cts e g 0 1 mg min l chlorination would be wholly ineffective for inactivating legionella spp therefore chlorination alone would be insufficient to maintain non detect 1 mpn 100 ml legionella spp post chlorination at the majority of lvvwd wells that discharge directly to the distribution system eight of 38 wells that currently operate as direct to waste have cts above the aforementioned lvvwd average even so l pneumophila occurrence at each of those wells e g average median max and the post cleanup average concentration for all wells 24 mpn 100 ml suggest that only two direct to waste wells achieve sufficient cts without operational changes w105 with a ct of 9 7 mg min l and w074 with a ct of 10 9 mg min l chlorination at the wellhead is sufficient to maintain non detect legionella spp with the caveat that initial legionella spp concentrations remain below 510 and 1 160 cfu 100 ml respectively this condition is expected based on current occurrence data if the more conservative chick watson model were used legionella spp would need to be maintained below 69 and 120 cfu 100 ml respectively if non detect is the treatment goal additional control measures or optimization of chlorine concentration and or contact time would be required at the majority of wells recent guidance from the cdc and other experts suggests a legionella spp threshold of 100 cfu 100 ml above which additional treatment or other remediation is suggested centers for disease control and prevention 2021 lechevallier 2020 less than 3 of post cleanup samples had l pneumophila 100 cfu 100 ml and these levels have been exclusively observed at well startup based on the average chlorine ct of 1 4 mg min l for direct to waste wells chlorine would be sufficient to maintain legionella spp 100 cfu 100 ml as long as initial legionella spp concentrations remain below 247 cfu 100 ml and 185 cfu 100 ml for the fitted and conservative chick watson models respectively at wells with higher than average chlorine cts 1 4 to 10 9 mg min l the cdc treatment goals could be met with even higher legionella spp concentrations in non treated groundwater fitted model 250 to 116 000 cfu 100 ml conservative model 186 to 12 000 cfu 100 ml for wells with the lowest cts e g 0 1 mg min l legionella spp would need to remain below 104 to 106 cfu 100 ml in non treated groundwater to meet the cdc guidelines overall legionella is rarely seen in non treated groundwater above the cdc suggested threshold and thus chlorination would be more of an added safety factor rather than a method to control legionella spp analyses were also performed to understand changes in the microbial community and legionella spp indicators during well startup and with chlorination similar to legionella spp total bacteria as measured by qpcr targeting the 16s rrna gene hpc turbidity and atp all decreased with well run time and with chlorination fig s5 proposed indicators namely turbidity and atp followed the same pattern as legionella spp with a maximum occurring several minutes after startup but slightly earlier than for legionella spp which peaked at 10 minutes although total bacterial and legionella spp concentrations decreased with ct chlorination also induced shifts in microbial community structure i e based on 16s rrna gene sequencing alpha diversity increased significantly as a function of chlorine exposure with the shannon index log base 2 increasing from 6 68 0 34 in the non chlorinated sample to 7 85 0 07 p 0 030 and 8 23 0 25 p 0 045 for cts of 3 6 mg min l and 7 2 mg min l respectively the shannon index then decreased to 7 35 0 30 p 0 20 for the chlorine ct of 10 4 mg min l changes in beta diversity as a function of chlorine ct were also observed as illustrated by distinct clustering in the principal coordinate analyses pcoas in fig s6 and visual differences in the phylum level taxa bar plot in fig s7 interestingly shifts in microbial community structure were also evident for legionellaceae legionella spp and l pneumophila with these taxa exhibiting increased relative abundance at higher chlorine cts figs s8 and s9 therefore legionella spp and l pneumophila may either be more chlorine resistant than the broader microbial community or perhaps they are mobilized under high chlorine exposure conditions due to biofilm dynamics further investigation is required to definitively understand the relationship between relative abundance of legionella and chlorine exposure 3 6 in situ legionella disinfection with chlorine in situ disinfection with chlorine was performed at one well w085 in fig s1 to assess whether chlorination of the well column and bore hole could be used to control legionella without need for additional treatment beyond chlorine residual needed for distribution as shown in fig s10 l pneumophila in the groundwater was 37 mpn 100 ml prior to treatment after chlorine was added to achieve 75 120 mg l residual the well was left stagnant for 25 5 hours in situ disinfection the well was flushed for 1 5 hours to bring residual chlorine to below detection 0 04 mg l the first sample was collected after 1 75 hours of flushing where the l pneumophila concentration was below detection levels in the produced groundwater in subsequent samples l pneumophila remained below detection up to 50 hrs after treatment however l pneumophila was detectable 74 hrs 98 hrs 122 hrs and longer after treatment there was a single sample beyond 122 hrs post treatment that was below detection 145 hr after treatment that may be due to a normal variation in l pneumophila concentration l pneumophila concentration appeared to increase steadily from 72 to 122 hours when the concentration plateaued around the pre treatment concentration or higher 4 implications following the detection of legionella in las vegas valley groundwater the utility lvvwd snwa and the state regulators ndep bsdw collaborated to determine the appropriate operational response ultimately the decision was made to take the direct to distribution wells out of service until a suitable treatment barrier was installed and validated guidance from ndep bsdw recommended monitoring of wells and reservoirs weekly and monitoring 50 distribution system locations on a monthly basis lang 2022 both legiolert and the mf method referred to as the cdc method in the correspondence were named as acceptable legionella quantification methods with a requirement to serotype positive samples the guidance includes maintaining chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l and legionella concentration 5 mpn 100 ml in reservoirs and the distribution system lang 2022 also wells associated with a reservoir or distribution system location will be taken out of service under any of the following conditions legionella is detected at 5 mpn 100 ml in a reservoir distribution system location l pneumophila sg1 is detected 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml in a reservoir distribution system location or if l pneumophila sg2 14 is detected 1 to 5 mpn 100 ml in both the well and reservoir distribution system location lang 2022 the existing requirement for reservoirs per the gwr remains as maintaining a chlorine ct to achieve 4 log virus inactivation this guidance represents the first approach toward creating guidelines on the topic this framework can be used to promote broader discussions as more occurrence and health risk data are generated these decisions illustrate how proactive utility research and communication with the local regulatory agency resulted in greater public health protection in the absence of a federal regulation however the decision also resulted in a temporary loss of water resources for the las vegas community 116 mgd 5 1 m3 s fortunately surface water supplies and direct to reservoir groundwater supplies were available to meet water demands while pursuing additional treatment options for the direct to distribution wells the occurrence results from this study indicate that more widespread monitoring is needed to examine the ubiquity of legionella in groundwater supplies guidance for utility monitoring of legionella in distributions systems was recently published centers for disease control and prevention 2021 lechevallier 2020 planning should also involve the local regulatory agency and consider potential outcomes of a positive legionella detection including alternative water supplies diversification and or augmentation and temporary permanent treatment barriers legionella spp and l pneumophila quantification require specialized equipment experience or expensive analysis from commercial labs the culture based analyses also require 7 day incubation time which is a major limitation for follow up monitoring and being able to rapidly respond to a positive detection additional monitoring can help support the development of different threshold water quality indicators e g temperature atp turbidity and operating parameters e g stagnation time flushing time seasonal use that could place individual groundwater supplies into different risk categories for potential legionella occurrence for example groundwater supplies with temperature 18 c may be at greater risk than supplies with temperature 18 c this type of framework could help to guide a mandated monitoring program of groundwater supplies additional site specific considerations may impact the monitoring and potential treatment response based on system size large small and disinfectant usage none chlorine chloramine our chlorine treatment results demonstrated that meeting the 4 log virus inactivation requirements may not ensure non detect legionella in groundwater prior to distribution increasing the chlorine dose up to a maximum of 4 mg l and contact time may allow groundwater systems to achieve higher exposure ct conditions for inactivation but these changes would have to be balanced with potential disinfection byproduct concerns e g trihalomethanes site footprint restrictions may prompt the use of alternative treatment strategies e g ultraviolet uv disinfection to achieve legionella inactivation cost benefit analyses and validation studies of different legionella control and treatment options are needed to justify implementation costs and confirm the efficacy of strategies at both municipal well and point of entry point of use scales 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated legionella occurrence in the las vegas valley drinking water sources surface water and groundwater finished water after treatment at wtfs treated water chlorinated reservoirs and in the distribution system we further evaluated occurrence and operational or engineered treatment options including a full scale assessment of chlorination to control legionella in groundwater our major findings included the following legionella did not occur or was well controlled in surface water water treatment facilities reservoirs with extended chlorine ct 39 to 164 mg min l and in the distribution system all lvvwd wells had at least one non treated groundwater sample that tested positive for l pneumophila and there was an overall positivity rate of 38 343 908 legionella concentration was negatively statistically correlated with time from well startup p 0 05 atp and turbidity were also highest at startup of wells and decreased significantly with well run time flushing wells to turbidity 3 0 ntu successfully reduced legionella but did not fully eliminate contamination in some wells atp and turbidity are good indicators for legionella contamination and can potentially be used as operational tools during startup atp turbidity orthophosphate and pump depth were found to be the most relevant indicators of l pneumophila concentration in the las vegas valley groundwater as indicated by the strength of correlations and their statistical significance this indicates that the native well environment influences l pneumophila and that contamination may increase with depth chlorination resulted in substantial reduction of legionella spp up to 2 5 logs but complete inactivation did not occur in the full scale study chlorine ct is insufficient to fully inactivate legionella spp at most las vegas valley groundwater production wells that historically discharged direct to distribution primarily due to short contact times between chlorine application and connection points within the distribution system chlorine cts must be 15 11 and 8 mg min l to achieve 4 3 and 2 log inactivation respectively chlorine ct increased relative abundance of legionella potentially indicating greater resistance to chlorine than the general bacterial community in situ well disinfection reduced l pneumophila in produced groundwater for the first 48 hours after treatment but l pneumophila concentrations increased after 72 hours to stabilize at pretreatment concentrations author contributions the manuscript was written

15802,electroactive pyrogenic carbon pc is an intriguing candidate for realizing the ambitious goals of large scale applications of microbial electrochemical technologies mets in this study pc was employed to promote the extracellular electron transfer eet within the electrogenic granular sludge egs by acting as an electron conduit the pecan shell derived pc prepared at three temperatures 600 800 and 1000 c contained rich oxygenated functional moieties mainly quinone on the surface endowing a good electron transfer capacity eec the maximum current density jmax of egs with pc amendment outperformed the control egs without pc amendment i e 100 132 times higher than jamx of egs in the absence of pc among various pyrolysis temperatures the pc derived from 600 c produced the highest jmax 0 40 a m2 0 67 times and 0 33 times higher than that of pc derived from 800 and 1000 c respectively furthermore more polysaccharides were secreted in extracellular polymeric substance with pc amendments the microbial community analysis demonstrated that the pc favored the growth of electroactive bacteria over methanogens the metabolic pathway revealed that pc induced more functional enzymes in the quinone biosynthesis and cytochrome c and heme synthesis resulting in an enhanced eet the eec of pc was responsible for the eet enhancement effect via pc acting as a geobattery to wire up the egs and electrodes overall this study pinpoints the finding of pc role in a mixed electroactive biofilm and provides a wide scenario of the pc applications in met at large scales graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular electron transfer pyrogenic carbon electrogenic granular sludge electron transfer capacity geobattery 1 introduction microbial electrochemical technologies mets which employ a fascinating group of electroactive bacteria eab to extract electrons from organic wastes and transport the electrons to solid electrodes via pili structures or multiheme cytochromes or other redox mediators have gained an exponential interest among the research community chu et al 2020 tucci et al 2021 the core of versatile mets is the unique extracellular electron transfer eet capacity of eabs to interact with electrodes catania et al 2021 eet describes microbial metabolism in which electrons from intracellular are exported to extracellular space i e minerals in nature or electrodes logan et al 2019 recently the electrogenic granular sludge egs has been envisaged as a promising and attractive bioelectrocatalyst owing to the property of current generation and stronger resistance to ph shock zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 nevertheless the electron flux was only effective when the egs established a direct contact with the current collector electrodes the contribution of egs which had a physical distance i e over several inches with electrodes to current generation remained marginal zhao et al 2019 thus enhancing the electrical communications between electrodes and egs despite the granular positions is of high importance for the up scaling of mets liu et al 2022 yu et al 2020 pyrogenic carbon pc as a ubiquitous and economically friendly material in the environment is increasingly attractive in the last decade pignatello et al 2017 yu et al 2022 pc with the excellent properties of being widely available biocompatible and completely recyclable has raised more attention compared to other carbon materials schievano et al 2019 the pc with high specific surface area and porous structure makes it a good absorbent and most importantly the electron transfer capacity eec endows pc with acting as an electrical conduit among microbes yuan et al 2018 the pc was proved to act as an electrode to facilitate eet within an electroactive biofilm chakraborty et al 2020 huggins et al 2014 reported a wood derived char electrode generated a power output of 532 mw m 2 which was comparable to that of granular activated carbon 674 mw m 2 the pyrolysis char was recommended as a more suitable electrode candidate than the commercial conductive carbons when taking the much lower expense and lower carbon footprint of char into account as a fluid like bioelectrode electroconductive char could also boost the bacterial electroactivity tejedor sanz et al 2017 in this regard exploiting pyrolysis char as electroactive material to enhance the electrical connection between egs would be promising the mainstream mechanisms for the role of pc involvement in eet are geoconductor and geobattery sun et al 2017 the geoconductor mechanism mainly results from the graphitic structure the conjugated π electrons of aromatic rings which often appear at a high pyrolysis temperature over 600 c prado et al 2019 the geobattery mechanisms are mainly contributed by the surface functional groups including redox active phenolic quinone couples which can reversibly accept electrons and donate electrons yuan et al 2022 these two main mechanisms endow char with the capacity of shuttling electrons in eet these two mechanisms are not always dominated at the same time in most cases one is the major responsible mechanism while the other s effect is weakened a recent study reported that the geoconductor mechanism alone was not sufficient in promoting electron transfer from bacterial to minerals unless with the assistance of surface functional moieties yu et al 2022 another metland using conductive materials in wetland study found that pc outperformed other conductive carbon materials albeit the pc possessed much lower conductivity prado et al 2019 they ascribed the pc enhancement effect to the large numbers of surface oxygenated groups mainly redox active quinone hydroquinone moieties due to the complex properties of pyrolysis char the mechanisms of pc in facilitating eet need more investigations under various situations to bridge the research gap mentioned above the pyrolysis char was employed in this study aimed at serving as an electroactive bioelectrode to wire up the reticular egs wherever the egs was placed in the reactor very recently wang et al 2022 used the biochar prepared at 500 c to boost the eet within eab although a 69 220 higher current density was gained by 15 g l biochar addition a detailed characterization of the biochar physicochemical properties as well as the biochar effects on redox active extracellular polymeric substance eps were still missing therefore in this study the pecan shells were heated in a furnace at various temperatures with n2 flow to produce pcs and the physicochemical properties of pcs including graphitic structure surface functional groups electrical conductivity and eec were characterized the optimal conditions regarding the char derived from different pyrolysis temperatures pc additional amounts and organic loading were investigated the eps architecture and compositions were compared with and without pc amendment the microbial community and dominant metabolic pathways were deciphered to uncover the main mechanisms of pc mediating eet within egs we expect this study can offer new insight into the role of electroactive pc serving as an electrical conduit in eabs of met 2 materials and methods 2 1 pc preparation and characterization pecan shells were used as the raw materials for the pc preparation the raw materials were heated in a tubular furnace at various pyrolysis temperatures for 60 min in n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 different heating temperatures of 600 800 and 1000 c were applied to produce three pcs which were noted as b600 b800 and b1000 respectively the physicochemical properties of pc including brunauer emmett teller bet surface area surface morphology the functional surface groups and eec were determined following previous study yu et al 2022 the detailed information can be found in the supplementary material the electrical conductivity ec of pcs was determined using a four probe powder resistivity meter st2253 jingge electronics co ltd china 2 2 reactor configuration and operation nine identical reactors were set up for the experiments all the reactors share the same configuration of three electrode each reactor with an effective working volume of 210 ml 7 cm diameter 7 3 cm height was made of glass a graphite plate with a 4 cm diameter with 5 mm thickness was employed as the working electrode angss were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and the feeding influent of the upflow anaerobic granular sludge reactor was juice wastewater 10 g wet granules with an intact granular structure were placed in each reactor good contact between granules and the graphite plate was ensured a stainless steel mesh with an area of 49 cm2 and ag agcl sat kcl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively all the potentials reported in this study were versus ag agcl 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode the reactors were sealed with silicone gaskets to ensure tightness the feeding medium was composed of 1 g l sodium acetate in a pbs buffer solution 50 mm pbs na2hpo4 g l nah2po4 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l kcl 0 13 g l trace elements 12 5 ml l vitamin solution 12 5 ml l during the pyrolysis temperature investigation three pcs b600 b800 and b1000 were separately added to the three different reactors with a dosage concentration of 1 g l before using the pcs samples were rinsed with deionized waster over ten times to exclude the role of pc leachate on microbial growth or in eet according to recent work yu et al 2022 the sodium acetate concentration was maintained at 1 g l the one without pc amendment was the control group after the selection of the optimal pc type b600 the influence of pc amounts was investigated other two reactors were separately filled with 0 5 and 2 g char l and both with 1 g l sodium acetate for the study of sodium acetate concentration effect three reactors were all amended with b600 1 g char l but with different acetate concentrations of 0 5 2 and 4 g l during all the experiments 160 ml medium was supplied to fully immerse the granules and electrodes the whole reactors were purged with pure nitrogen all the time to ensure a strictly anaerobic environment all the reactors were controlled at 0 2 v by the potentiostat vmp3 16 biologic co france and the current variation with time was recorded automatically the medium was refreshed until the current decreased below 0 05 ma a water bath was used to control the operating temperature of 25 c all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the time profile of the current response ma was recorded by the potentiostat with an interval of 60 s the current density j ma m2 was normalized by the projected electrode area cm2 when the time profile of current density was repeatable in each cycle it meant the reactor was stable the maximum current density jmax during the stable period was compared among various conditions including the pc prepared at different temperatures additional pc amounts and initial acetate concentrations student t test was performed for the statistical analysis between each sample in spss software the pearson s correlation coefficient below 0 05 suggested a significant difference 2 4 eps characterization the eps of granules with and without pc amendment was analyzed following the previous protocol liu et al 2022 briefly several granules were sampled from the control group and in the b600 group 2 g l sodium acetate and 2 g pc l after the experiments to determine the chemical amounts of eps fractions the granular suspensions 10 ml 0 3 g dry weight mixed with nacl solution 0 05 10 ml were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min the 0 22 μm filtered supernatant was solvable eps s eps the residues in the tube were resuspended in nacl solution 0 05 10 ml followed by sonication for 2 min and horizontal blending at 150 rpm for 10 min in a shaker the mixture was sonicated for another 2 min before centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min the filtered supernatant was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps in the extraction of tightly bound eps tb eps a mixture solution of nacl 0 05 5 ml and na2 edta 5 5 ml was added to the sediments left in the tube the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 4 h and was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min the collected supernatant was tb eps the contents of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in all eps fractions were characterized by the sulfuric acid phenol method and bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china respectively the zeta potential of eps fractions was determined using nano zs malvern uk the spatial distribution of eps components including proteins α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids within granules were visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica sp8 following the previous protocol wang et al 2018b firstly the granules were cleaned with pbs 50 mm ph 7 and then were covered with sodium bicarbonate 0 1 mol l then the samples were stained with fitc solution 1000 mg l 30 min con a solution 250 mg l 60 min calcofluor white cw solution 30 g l 30 min and nile red nr solution 10 mg l 30 min respectively the 3d structure of these components was studied by zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the fluorescence intensity fi was determined using image j 2 4 microbial community the control egs in the absence of pc and pc egs were sampled to investigate the microbial community changes the total genomic dna was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio powersoil the primers of 515f 907r were used to amplify the v4 v5 region of 16s rrna illumina miseq sequencer mingke biotechnology co ltd hangzhou china was conducted to perform 16s rrna sequencing analysis all the gene files have been submitted to ncbi database with the accession number prjna782355 and prjna 784693 a heatmap based on the hierarchical clustering method was constructed in the multi experiment viewer software mev 4 9 0 to reflect the relative microbial abundance and fold changes picrust analysis was applied to predict the dominant functional pathways based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database langille et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of pc 3 1 1 morphologies distinct morphologies were observed with various pcs prepared at different heating temperatures fig s1 generally higher temperatures b1000 resulted in an internal structure of more fragments with rough surfaces while lower temperatures b600 led to a smoother surface with pores and channels in agreement with a previous study which reported that the pcs obtained from a higher temperature i e 1100 c exhibited a rough surface morphology due to the collapse of carbon structure zhang et al 2018 all three pc samples had the largest volume proportion of particle size of 500 μm fig s2 these macropores greater than 1 μm would benefit the bacterial colonization and the organic adsorption on these macropores was accessible to the bacteria which enabled pc superior to the commercial activated carbons mostly with micropores less than 1 μm huggins et al 2016 the bet analysis revealed the highest surface area of 510 7 m2 g of b800 followed by 386 9 m2 g of b600 and 193 9 m2 g of b1000 table s1 these bet values of pcs prepared from the pecan shells were comparable to the pcs prepared from other wastes i e sugarcane bagasse char produced at 700 c 270 5 m2 g li et al 2021b and sludge char produced at 700 c 29 96 m2 g zhang et al 2018 the macropores and high surface areas are usually believed to benefit the eab growth chen et al 2012 wang et al 2018a considering the high amounts of eab in egs the addition of these pyrolysis carbons was expected to boost the electroactivity of egs 3 1 2 functional groups on the pc surface ftir spectra exhibited a similar feature to those reported of pcs derived from other sources sathishkumar et al 2020 no distinct changes of the spectra of functional groups were distinguished among three samples fig 1 a the bands at around 3450 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were attributed to the phenolic oh ch2 asymmetrical stretching vibrations respectively the slightly stronger intensity of the band at 1575 cm 1 c c stretching in b1000 indicated the increase of aromaticity at higher temperatures magid et al 2021 all three samples shared a weak c o stretching vibration located at 1050 cm 1 which corresponded to phenolic compounds yuan et al 2018 the geobattery theory describes the capacities of reversibly electron accepting and donating which were contributed by the oxygenated moieties i e phenolic hydroquinone c o and quinoid c o sun et al 2017 the weak absorbances of phenolic c o in three pcs samples suggested a low capacity of electron donating since the phenolic fractions were accountable for edc to further identify the different compositions of such functional fractions in three pcs xps analysis was performed xps with characteristic spectra of c1s and o1s disclosed the presence of carbon and oxygen fig 1b the surface o c atomic ratio decreased from 0 37 for b600 to 0 30 for b1000 with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures table s2 indicating the decomposition of oxygen containing functional fractions at a higher pyrolysis temperature the c 1s xps spectra indicated the content of c o at 288 ev reduced from 0 67 for b600 to 0 46 for b1000 with the pyrolysis temperature increasing suggesting a decreasing content of quinonoid fractions in the pcs derived from a higher pyrolysis temperature the increasing content of c o at 286 ev from 0 18 b600 to 0 45 b1000 with increasing temperature was indicative of higher amounts of hydroquinone phenolic groups with pyrolysis temperatures increasing as reported previously the phenolic compounds were recognized as the important moieties responsible for edc whereas quinoid fractions were accountable for eac sun et al 2021 sun et al 2017 yu et al 2022 the oxygenated functional groups in pcs collectively govern the eec these quinones and phenols endowed the pcs active in the microbial eet for example facilitating eet in methane oxidizing biogeochemical process in the soil zhang et al 2019 and improving the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between geobacter cocultures zhang et al 2018 3 1 3 redox properties and electrical conductivities of pc the phenolic c o fractions and quinoid c o moieties are responsible for edc and eac of pcs respectively li et al 2022 prado et al 2019 sun et al 2017 all pcs exhibited a significantly higher eac value 1 96 mmol e 1 g 1 of b600 than edc value 0 09 mmol e 1 g 1 of b600 fig 1c p 0 05 the almost 40 times higher eac of edc suggested the predominance of quinonal moieties over phenolic groups which agreed well with xps spectra ai et al 2020b observed a significantly higher eac than edc of the bone meal powder derived char and the eac mediated a faster dichlorination of trichloroethylene very recently yu et al 2022 claimed that the eac plays a more vital role than edc in eet since in the pc amended shewanella culture a faster ferrihydrite reduction was obtained in the pc possessing a higher eac thus the extremely higher eac values of all pcs than edc here were expected to facilitate the microbial eet process furthermore it was noticed that b600 owned a highest eac among three pcs which was consistent with the content of quinoid c o as revealed by xps spectra klüpfel et al 2014 also found that the edc of pcs dominated over eac within a low temperature range 200 300 c owing to the predominance of phenolic moieties while eac was superior to edc within a high temperature range 600 700 c ascribed to the quinone moieties and condensed aromatic structures the pcs obtained at a low temperature 700 c had a predominance of geobattery function closely related to the eec while the pcs polysized at a high temperature 700 c additionally possess the geoconductor mechanism which was ascribed to the polycondensed aromatic graphitic structure conjugated π electron yu et al 2022 the conductivity is an indicator for evaluating the pcs function as a geoconductor as shown in fig 1d the ec of pcs increased greatly with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures the ec of b1000 61200 s m for b1000 showed a 7 orders of magnitude higher value than that of b600 5 78 ms m for b600 which was due to the increasing aromaticity at a high temperature klüpfel et al 2014 the findings were similar to the previous studies which reported that the pcs pyrolyzed at a higher temperature 700 c displayed a better conductivity yu et al 2022 3 2 enhancement of pc on the electroactivity of egs the reproducible current profiles were obtained in all the experiments fig 2 a and fig s4 and the jmax was grabbed from the current profiles fig 2b d the jmax greatly increased with pcs amendments the egs with b600 generated the highest jmax of 0 40 a m2 which was 132 times higher than the control without pc amendment 0 003 a m2 this increment of jmax in pc egs was similar to the recent study wang et al 2022 the profound increase of jmax with pc additions identified the positive role of pc in improving egs electroactivity the morphological structure of egs was not broken down by the pc addition as revealed by sem images fig s6 the higher pyrolysis temperature did not result in a higher jmax among three pcs b600 outperformed b800 and b1000 and jmax of b600 was 0 67 times and 0 33 times higher than that of b800 and b1000 respectively fig 2a the cv curves of three pcs agreed well with jmax variations fig s5 the remarkable value of jmax in b600 was mainly ascribed to the functional groups and redox properties as revealed by eac results b600 contained a much higher amount of oxygenated functional groups and a significantly higher eac than that of b800 and b1000 as shown in 3 1 these oxygenated functional moieties and superior eac suggested the b600 served as a geobattery prado et al 2019 performing a charge discharge cycle the increasing jmax in the b800 and b1000 amended egs can be explained by the coupled mechanisms of geoconductor and geobattery of pcs at a high pyrolysis temperature klüpfel et al 2014 yu et al 2022 since both pcs owned an eec value of around 1 2 mmol e 1 g 1 char and a quite high conductivity b600 was selected as the optimal pc type to further explore the influence of additional amounts of pc on jmax fig 2b the jmax exhibited a significant increase from 0 29 to 0 40 a m2 with the increasing pc amount from 0 5 to 1 g l and further declined to 0 22 a m2 with 2 g pc l addition a recent study reported that higher amounts of pcs 5 g l vs 1 g l pcs amounts increased the nitrobenzene reduction rate in shewanella oneidensis mr 1 culture due to the more active sites contributed by more pcs wang et al 2020 cai et al 2021 found that an apparent increase of current densities was observed when the pcs amounts in the soil increased from 1 to 3 mass ratios while the current densities became stable when the pcs amounts raised from 3 to 6 accordingly the phenanthrene biodegradation in the pc amendment soil did not exhibit a great difference in the pc amended soil within the range of 1 3 and 6 ratios of pcs amounts generally a higher amount of pc would result in a higher current generation however in this study it showed that excessive or insufficient pc amounts would hinder a further jmax increment not all the egs had sufficient contact with the electroactive pc at 0 5 g l while excessive pc might stimulate other electron transfer processes i e diet for methanogenesis at 2 g l pc addition yuan et al 2018 other than eet for electricity producing a more rapid acetate degradation rate with 2 g pc l amendment than that at a lower pc content 0 5 g l supported this deduction fig s7a the acetate concentrations ranging over 0 5 1 2 and 4 g l were fed to the egs amended with b600 consecutively to explore the effect of organic contents on jmax the jmax increased from 0 12 to 0 82 a m2 when the initial sodium acetate concentration rose from 0 5 to 2 g l fig 2c which was explained by the sufficient accessible organics to eab at 2 g l however when the sodium acetate was further increased to 4 g l jmax showed 91 reduction normally higher organics would release more electrons via metabolism in this study the released electrons seemed to be consumed by other microbial consortia i e sulfate reducing bacteria or methanogens all of the sodium acetate removal efficiency achieved around 100 while the acetate removal rate decreased with the increase of initial organic loading fig s7b 3 3 influence of pc addition on the surrounding eps eps can reserve the redox active species such as c type cytochromes flavins humic substances xiao and zhao 2017 thereby they are capable of mediating electron transfers fig 3 depicts the eps distribution with and without pc amendment both samples were dominated by the proteins followed by the lipids and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides after the pc addition the whole architecture was more compact and the distribution of proteins became homogenous the fluorescence intensities fi of proteins slightly improved with pc amendment the stable fi of polysaccharides suggested the pc addition did not influence instability of the granules since they were mainly used for maintaining the stability of granules chen et al 2007 the denser distribution of proteins in eps in pc egs was similar to the previous report that red mud addition induced a denser distribution of proteins ye et al 2018 overall the pc amendment resulted in a more compact eps architecture and the proteins distributed more evenly the eps contents of egs showed an increment after the pc addition fig 4 generally the conductive materials i e hematite can drive endogenous electron shuttles such as flavins move from the eab periplasm to the surrounding eps thereby promoting eps contents ye et al 2018 however it should be noticed that the conductivity of b600 was quite low 5 78 ms m the low conductivity cannot increase the eps contents via the transportation of flavins to the surrounding eps it was likely due to the cell protection behavior under external environmental conditions here it was pc amendment as seen in fig 4 a the pc amendment mainly induced a significant increment of ps contents among various eps fractions the cells secreted more ps in the tb eps of pc egs the total pn contents in eps showed a surprisingly slight decrease after the pc addition the ps mainly function as the protection barrier for the cells against the external environmental shock han et al 2017 and pn is widely considered as redox active in eet owing to the multiple redox molecules such as c type cytochromes xiao et al 2017 some studies observed an increasing pn contents with a more efficient eet li et al 2021a mao et al 2021 herein although an enhanced eet indicated by the higher jmax was obtained with pc amendment the total redox active pn contents did not increase correspondingly it was inferred that with pc amendment the granules preferentially stored ps over pn as stated above the pc seemed to induce a protection behavior of egs and only in this protective case the pn on the cell surface have a chance to be active in eet yang et al 2019 however it is arbitrary to conclude that the eet was only associated with pn and the ps was only related to the protection role since the eet and protection roles might be co effects of the main components jennings et al 2015 li et al 2021a the zeta potential of s eps reduced while zeta potentials of lb eps and tb eps increased the zeta potential was indicative of the negative charge amount the decreased negative charges would reduce the electrostatic repulsive interactions according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory ye et al 2018 with a low repulsive force cell to cell interactions would be promoted albeit increasing the surface charge of eps was still negative which would not affect the electrostatic attraction between egs and the polarized current collector 3 4 microbial community response to pc addition 3 4 1 microbial diversity to determine the microbial diversity the metagenomic sequences of both samples with and without pc amendment were analyzed and compared there was a distinct change between the two samples table s3 and fig s8 the pc greatly changed the microbial richness which was in line with previous findings that the pc influenced the diversity of microbial communities cai et al 2020 3 4 2 microbial community dynamics at the phylum level euryarchaeota proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes thermotogae wsa2 synergistetes actinobacteria firmicutes and bathyarchaeota were identified as the dominant phyla with over 1 relative abundance fig 5 a in both samples euryarchaeota were the uppermost accounting for 49 59 and 48 76 in control and pc samples respectively in the domain of bacteria two samples showed a distinct distribution the pc profited the enrichment of several phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes the pc did not induce a conspicuous difference in the methanogenic communities according to the comparison of two samples at the class level of archaea consortia fig 5b however several eab members belonging to the phyla of proteobacteria chloroflexi and synergistia were present with pc amendment the main members of phyla proteobacteria including betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria exhibited a 1 52 fold higher abundance in the pc sample 21 86 compared to that in the control 7 64 fig 5c the anaerolineae belonging to the phyla chloroflexi and synergistia belonging to phyla synergistetes were also enriched after pc addition the relative abundance of anaerolineae greatly increased from 2 56 control to 16 73 pc the prominent increase of relative abundance of such phyla after pc addition manifested an enhancement of eabs to gain a deep insight into the functional microorganisms and the microbial community changes the microbial community compositions at the genus level were analyzed and the fold change between the two samples was compared fig 5d only the genera with relative abundance over 1 were selected and based on the fold changes the whole group was divided into group 1 increasing abundance and group 2 decreasing abundance in the heatmap the color intensity represented the corresponding abundance of each species and fold changes as illustrated a significant increase in relative abundance was observed in the eab after pc addition for example geobacter the well known eab strain increased from 0 16 to 0 72 after the pc addition accounting for a 2 21 fold change geobacter was proved to be capable of passing electrons either indirectly via mediators or directly via nanowire structures or c cyt logan et al 2019 a recent study similarly reported an increased relative abundance of geobacter with biochar presence wang et al 2022 wang et al 2021b demonstrated in the methanogenic consortia the biochar presence promoted the relative abundance of both geobacter and relevant syntrophic microorganisms the species of acinetobacter and arcobacter which were widely found in the electroactive biofilm of met hassan et al 2018 had an overwhelming abundance after the biochar addition intriguingly another kind of eab of desulfovibrio increased from 0 46 to 1 99 after the pc addition the desulfovibrio was electroactive and recently was demonstrated to be capable of bidirectional electron transfer with electrodes yun et al 2016 the increase of such genus implied that the pc presence favored the growth of eab which can both accept or donate electrons from other redox species including the electrodes and other eabs such enhancement supported an improved eet within eabs with pc amendment the overview distributions of functional genera including eabs and methanogens were further estimated to provide an insight into the influence of pc on specific microorganisms fig 5e and f the eabs genera included anaerolineaceae uncultured acinetobacter arcobacter desulfovibrio geobacter dechlorobacter syntrophobacter and synergistaceae uncultured the detected eabs showed a 3 73 times increase while the methanogens showed a decrease from 96 95 to 89 88 after the pc addition the evident increase in the relative abundance of eabs induced by pc addition proved the proliferation of eabs and the results were consistent with a higher jmax of pc egs different from the eabs distributions the relative abundance of methanogens was diminished as shown in fig 5f the relative abundance of methanosarcina showed a significant decrease from 36 41 control to 2 29 pc the metabolically versatile methanosarcina was capable of either oxidizing acetate or reducing co2 via accepting electrons directly from the diet partners i e geobacter strains lovley and holmes 2021 the diet partners were active with the pc presence since the pc also could act as the electron conductor to be involved in the diet process wang et al 2018a in this study the decreasing abundance of methanosarcina manifested that the electrons either from geobacter or from the pc would not flow to the methanosarcina for co2 reduction instead these electrons would be captured by the electrode or other eabs additionally the slightly increasing abundance of methanosaeta was likely assigned to the granulation role other than the diet between geobacter and methanosaeta wang et al 2021b since the methane was not detectable in this study maintaining a continuous n2 flow generally with pc amendment there are several enhancement effects 1 electrical communication between eabs and methanogenic community which is actually diet 2 eet within eabs community 3 electron transfer between the electrode and eabs it has been widely proved that the pc amendment can facilitate diet between some eabs and methanogens via the pc functioning as a geobattery and a geoconductor jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however in this study the first effect was clearly weakened considering the low conductivity of b600 the geoconductor role of pc was negligible the decreasing relative abundance of diet involved methanogens suggested the geobattery role of pc for diet enhancement was deteriorated as well the latter two effects can both contribute to a higher jmax thus the significantly increasing jmax with pc amendment was likely due to a synergistic effect of eet improvement between eabs and between eabs and electrodes however the contribution of two effects cannot be differentiated clearly in the current study future studies can focus on the role of pc amendment in such electroactive biofilm to figure out the contribution of each part moreover the quantitative relationship between the physicochemical parameters and microbial communities was conducted using the redundancy analysis rda as shown in fig s9 all the identified eabs assemblages especially the well known geobacter and desulfovibrio and a few methanogens i e methanosaeta exhibited a positive response to the jmax eps and eac most of the methanogens had a weak correlation with three parameters the results indicated that eabs were more directly affected by the pcs amendment while the methanogens especially diet involved partners were less likely associated with pcs amendment and jmax it should be noted that the rda analysis has limitations in this study due to the limited data and it cannot be overinterpreted 3 5 metabolic functions prediction analyzed by picrust to better understand the pc effect on the microbial metabolism related to eet process picrust was applied to predict the functional features and the accuracy of prediction could reach 85 90 chen et al 2021 fig 6 there are several functional categories about metabolic functions based on kegg database which integrates information on genome chemistry and functions langille et al 2013 the proportions of metabolism and cellular processing showed a slight increase with the pc addition while the other two pathways genetic information processing and environmental information processing exhibited a decrease in the proportions fig 6a carbohydrate metabolism 10 35 for control and 10 56 for pc respectively and amino acid metabolism 10 36 and 10 52 were the main pathways in the clusters of metabolisms followed by energy metabolism 6 31 and 6 80 and cofactors and vitamins metabolism 4 33 and 4 40 in the clusters of cellular processing the main metabolism pathway was cell motility 1 34 and 2 23 the cell wall membrane and coenzyme metabolism and transport were closely associated with an improved eet yin et al 2018 these results implied that a higher metabolism activity and an enhanced eet were induced by the pc addition the functional enzymes related to carbon and energy were selected and compared between the two samples fig 6b and c these functional enzymes were clustered into several groups a profound increase was observed in each cluster the nad p h dehydrogenases were closely associated with intracellular metabolism the significant increasing abundances of nad p h dehydrogenase in the pc egs sample supported a more active metabolism of carbon degradation intracellularly it was noted that a group of fe or s nad p h dehydrogenases were similarly improved in the abundances in the pc egs sample fe or s was widely found to play a vital role in the eet and intracellular electron transfer jiang et al 2019 melton et al 2014 the increasing abundance of fe s nad p h dehydrogenases cluster suggested that with pc presence both the intracellular and extracellular electron flows might be stimulated the enhanced eet would contribute to a higher current response when the diet partners for methane production were inhibited as discussed in 3 4 moreover the redox active proteins c type cytochrome and heme were significantly increased in abundance with pc presence the cytochromes and heme were reported to be actively involved in the eet process shi et al 2016 it was arbitrary to relate the enhanced eet with the current generation since eet was also found in methanogenesis however considering the higher relative abundance of electroactive bacteria and improved current response the increased abundances of functional eet associated enzymes more likely resulted in an electron flux to electroactive species including the electroactive bacteria and electrodes instead of the methanogens these results strongly approve the eet enhancement by pc and are in good accordance with the elevated current response fig 2 quinone redox mediators are capable of electron transfer and serve as a pivotal electron shuttle in the cytoplasmic bridging the intracellular and extracellular electron flows jiang et al 2019 higher abundances of functional enzymes responsible for quinone biosynthesis were observed with pc addition fig 6d the enhanced biosynthesis of quinone was another explanation of the higher current response with pc presence the previous study reported that the pc facilitated the diet within geobacter co cultures and the enhancement was mainly ascribed to the electron transfer capacity of pc contributed by the surface functional groups the quinone was identified as the key functional group on the pc contributing to the eec prado et al 2019 in this study the pc presence seemed to induce an elevation of quinone synthesis in the microbes it is not clear if this up regulated behavior was associated with the quinone presence on the pc itself it has been reported that acinetobacter can secrete quinone to facilitate eet wang et al 2021a as displayed in fig 5 the relative abundance of acinetobacter was significantly increased in the pc egs sample explaining the biosynthesis of quinone overall the pc not only functioned as the electron conduit but also facilitate electroactive bacteria to generate the redox species i e quinone 3 6 mechanism of pc facilitating eet in egs the aforementioned results indicated that pc amendment induced a more compact eps structure fig 3 and greatly changed the concentrations of each component in eps fig 4 clsm images supported a denser distribution of proteins with pc presence while no major difference was observed for the distribution of α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids the total eps concentrations increased from 207 20 to 234 53 μg g vss after pc addition the concentration of hydrophilic polysaccharides overwhelmed the concentration of hydrophobic proteins in eps higher contents of polysaccharides were found with pc presence and the main increase of polysaccharides appeared in tb eps this increase was explained by the protective role of polysaccharides when the granules were in contact with the pc as an exogenous invader the granules stored polysaccharides over proteins when the pc was present more polysaccharides served as a protective barrier to enable the proteins on the granular surface to be active in eet additionally a higher content of hydrophilic polymers and a higher zeta potential value negative charge fig 4 reduced the electrostatic force and energy barriers between the granules nearby the well known electroactive microorganisms such as geobacter acinetobacter arcobacter and desulfovibrio were significantly increased in relative abundance with pc presence which boosted the bacterial eet thereby further enhancing the current generation syntrophic diet in methanogenesis was probably broken down via the pc since the methanogens were inhibited in this case furthermore the pc samples resulted in a higher abundance of redox active enzymes c type cytochrome and heme and facilitate quinone biosynthesis these results suggested that the pc presence induced more electron flows from exoelectrogens to electrodes thereby being captured by the electrode pyrogenic carbon acts as an electron shuttle in the microbial community the oxygenated functional groups were accountable for the current enhancement with pc amendment as revealed in fig 1 the eec property and graphitic structure of three pcs varied with the pyrolysis temperatures it has been demonstrated that the eec plays a crucial role in electron transfer at a relatively low temperature below 700 c while graphitic structures were dominant in mediating electron transfer at a high temperature above 700 c yu et al 2022 in this study it was observed the highest current improvement appeared with the pc at 600 c which was mainly ascribed to the oxygenated functional moieties fig 7 the relatively low conductivity of b600 5 78 ms m was not able to endow it the geoconductor function thus the geobattery function was the crucial reason to explain the higher jmax in b600 although electron accepting groups and electron donating groups appeared in a redox couple in the electron shuttle process a profound higher value was determined for the eac groups compared to the edc groups wu et and ai et al also demonstrated that the eac groups were more important than edc groups in mediating electron flows ai et al 2020a wu et al 2017 the correlation analysis also demonstrated a significantly positive correlation p 0 02 between jmax and eac fig s10 however the graphitic structure could not be fully ignored the jmax of b800 0 24 a m2 and b1000 0 30 a m2 were still significantly higher than that of control in the absence of pc 0 003 a m2 albeit they were lower than that of b600 0 40 a m2 with the pyrolysis increasing from 500 to 900 c the aliphatic carbon transformed into aromatic carbon followed by the conversion of aromatic carbon into graphitic carbon yu et al 2022 the graphitic structures endowed the pyrogenic carbon as geoconductor sun et al 2017 xu et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 the graphitic structures resulted in the current generation enhancement of b800 and b1000 the positive effect of graphitic structures on mediating electron transfer was realized only when the oxygenated functional groups were present yu et al 2022 thus the synergistic effects of oxygenated functional groups and graphitic structures boosted the eet with pc presence especially the pcs obtained from 800 and 1000 c 4 conclusion overall the results demonstrated that the pc derived from pecan shells promoted the current density of egs pc produced at 600 c outperformed the other pcs prepared at higher temperatures 800 and 1000 c the b600 had the highest contents of oxygenated functional groups resulting in an extraordinarily higher capacity of electron accepting more ps were induced by pc amendment to protect cells typical eab was proliferated and quinone c type cytochrome and heme synthesis were induced with pc amendment the positive role of pc in eet enhancement was ascribed to the electron transfer capacity of pc this study provides an insight into pc facilitating eet in the electroactive biofilm and opens up the scenario of pc applications in large scale of mets future studies can choose a wide range of the pyrolysis temperature i e 300 1000 c to investigate the coupled function of geobattery and geoconductor of pcs in mediating microbial eet of such biocatalyst credit authorship

15802,electroactive pyrogenic carbon pc is an intriguing candidate for realizing the ambitious goals of large scale applications of microbial electrochemical technologies mets in this study pc was employed to promote the extracellular electron transfer eet within the electrogenic granular sludge egs by acting as an electron conduit the pecan shell derived pc prepared at three temperatures 600 800 and 1000 c contained rich oxygenated functional moieties mainly quinone on the surface endowing a good electron transfer capacity eec the maximum current density jmax of egs with pc amendment outperformed the control egs without pc amendment i e 100 132 times higher than jamx of egs in the absence of pc among various pyrolysis temperatures the pc derived from 600 c produced the highest jmax 0 40 a m2 0 67 times and 0 33 times higher than that of pc derived from 800 and 1000 c respectively furthermore more polysaccharides were secreted in extracellular polymeric substance with pc amendments the microbial community analysis demonstrated that the pc favored the growth of electroactive bacteria over methanogens the metabolic pathway revealed that pc induced more functional enzymes in the quinone biosynthesis and cytochrome c and heme synthesis resulting in an enhanced eet the eec of pc was responsible for the eet enhancement effect via pc acting as a geobattery to wire up the egs and electrodes overall this study pinpoints the finding of pc role in a mixed electroactive biofilm and provides a wide scenario of the pc applications in met at large scales graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular electron transfer pyrogenic carbon electrogenic granular sludge electron transfer capacity geobattery 1 introduction microbial electrochemical technologies mets which employ a fascinating group of electroactive bacteria eab to extract electrons from organic wastes and transport the electrons to solid electrodes via pili structures or multiheme cytochromes or other redox mediators have gained an exponential interest among the research community chu et al 2020 tucci et al 2021 the core of versatile mets is the unique extracellular electron transfer eet capacity of eabs to interact with electrodes catania et al 2021 eet describes microbial metabolism in which electrons from intracellular are exported to extracellular space i e minerals in nature or electrodes logan et al 2019 recently the electrogenic granular sludge egs has been envisaged as a promising and attractive bioelectrocatalyst owing to the property of current generation and stronger resistance to ph shock zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 nevertheless the electron flux was only effective when the egs established a direct contact with the current collector electrodes the contribution of egs which had a physical distance i e over several inches with electrodes to current generation remained marginal zhao et al 2019 thus enhancing the electrical communications between electrodes and egs despite the granular positions is of high importance for the up scaling of mets liu et al 2022 yu et al 2020 pyrogenic carbon pc as a ubiquitous and economically friendly material in the environment is increasingly attractive in the last decade pignatello et al 2017 yu et al 2022 pc with the excellent properties of being widely available biocompatible and completely recyclable has raised more attention compared to other carbon materials schievano et al 2019 the pc with high specific surface area and porous structure makes it a good absorbent and most importantly the electron transfer capacity eec endows pc with acting as an electrical conduit among microbes yuan et al 2018 the pc was proved to act as an electrode to facilitate eet within an electroactive biofilm chakraborty et al 2020 huggins et al 2014 reported a wood derived char electrode generated a power output of 532 mw m 2 which was comparable to that of granular activated carbon 674 mw m 2 the pyrolysis char was recommended as a more suitable electrode candidate than the commercial conductive carbons when taking the much lower expense and lower carbon footprint of char into account as a fluid like bioelectrode electroconductive char could also boost the bacterial electroactivity tejedor sanz et al 2017 in this regard exploiting pyrolysis char as electroactive material to enhance the electrical connection between egs would be promising the mainstream mechanisms for the role of pc involvement in eet are geoconductor and geobattery sun et al 2017 the geoconductor mechanism mainly results from the graphitic structure the conjugated π electrons of aromatic rings which often appear at a high pyrolysis temperature over 600 c prado et al 2019 the geobattery mechanisms are mainly contributed by the surface functional groups including redox active phenolic quinone couples which can reversibly accept electrons and donate electrons yuan et al 2022 these two main mechanisms endow char with the capacity of shuttling electrons in eet these two mechanisms are not always dominated at the same time in most cases one is the major responsible mechanism while the other s effect is weakened a recent study reported that the geoconductor mechanism alone was not sufficient in promoting electron transfer from bacterial to minerals unless with the assistance of surface functional moieties yu et al 2022 another metland using conductive materials in wetland study found that pc outperformed other conductive carbon materials albeit the pc possessed much lower conductivity prado et al 2019 they ascribed the pc enhancement effect to the large numbers of surface oxygenated groups mainly redox active quinone hydroquinone moieties due to the complex properties of pyrolysis char the mechanisms of pc in facilitating eet need more investigations under various situations to bridge the research gap mentioned above the pyrolysis char was employed in this study aimed at serving as an electroactive bioelectrode to wire up the reticular egs wherever the egs was placed in the reactor very recently wang et al 2022 used the biochar prepared at 500 c to boost the eet within eab although a 69 220 higher current density was gained by 15 g l biochar addition a detailed characterization of the biochar physicochemical properties as well as the biochar effects on redox active extracellular polymeric substance eps were still missing therefore in this study the pecan shells were heated in a furnace at various temperatures with n2 flow to produce pcs and the physicochemical properties of pcs including graphitic structure surface functional groups electrical conductivity and eec were characterized the optimal conditions regarding the char derived from different pyrolysis temperatures pc additional amounts and organic loading were investigated the eps architecture and compositions were compared with and without pc amendment the microbial community and dominant metabolic pathways were deciphered to uncover the main mechanisms of pc mediating eet within egs we expect this study can offer new insight into the role of electroactive pc serving as an electrical conduit in eabs of met 2 materials and methods 2 1 pc preparation and characterization pecan shells were used as the raw materials for the pc preparation the raw materials were heated in a tubular furnace at various pyrolysis temperatures for 60 min in n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 different heating temperatures of 600 800 and 1000 c were applied to produce three pcs which were noted as b600 b800 and b1000 respectively the physicochemical properties of pc including brunauer emmett teller bet surface area surface morphology the functional surface groups and eec were determined following previous study yu et al 2022 the detailed information can be found in the supplementary material the electrical conductivity ec of pcs was determined using a four probe powder resistivity meter st2253 jingge electronics co ltd china 2 2 reactor configuration and operation nine identical reactors were set up for the experiments all the reactors share the same configuration of three electrode each reactor with an effective working volume of 210 ml 7 cm diameter 7 3 cm height was made of glass a graphite plate with a 4 cm diameter with 5 mm thickness was employed as the working electrode angss were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant and the feeding influent of the upflow anaerobic granular sludge reactor was juice wastewater 10 g wet granules with an intact granular structure were placed in each reactor good contact between granules and the graphite plate was ensured a stainless steel mesh with an area of 49 cm2 and ag agcl sat kcl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively all the potentials reported in this study were versus ag agcl 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode the reactors were sealed with silicone gaskets to ensure tightness the feeding medium was composed of 1 g l sodium acetate in a pbs buffer solution 50 mm pbs na2hpo4 g l nah2po4 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l kcl 0 13 g l trace elements 12 5 ml l vitamin solution 12 5 ml l during the pyrolysis temperature investigation three pcs b600 b800 and b1000 were separately added to the three different reactors with a dosage concentration of 1 g l before using the pcs samples were rinsed with deionized waster over ten times to exclude the role of pc leachate on microbial growth or in eet according to recent work yu et al 2022 the sodium acetate concentration was maintained at 1 g l the one without pc amendment was the control group after the selection of the optimal pc type b600 the influence of pc amounts was investigated other two reactors were separately filled with 0 5 and 2 g char l and both with 1 g l sodium acetate for the study of sodium acetate concentration effect three reactors were all amended with b600 1 g char l but with different acetate concentrations of 0 5 2 and 4 g l during all the experiments 160 ml medium was supplied to fully immerse the granules and electrodes the whole reactors were purged with pure nitrogen all the time to ensure a strictly anaerobic environment all the reactors were controlled at 0 2 v by the potentiostat vmp3 16 biologic co france and the current variation with time was recorded automatically the medium was refreshed until the current decreased below 0 05 ma a water bath was used to control the operating temperature of 25 c all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the time profile of the current response ma was recorded by the potentiostat with an interval of 60 s the current density j ma m2 was normalized by the projected electrode area cm2 when the time profile of current density was repeatable in each cycle it meant the reactor was stable the maximum current density jmax during the stable period was compared among various conditions including the pc prepared at different temperatures additional pc amounts and initial acetate concentrations student t test was performed for the statistical analysis between each sample in spss software the pearson s correlation coefficient below 0 05 suggested a significant difference 2 4 eps characterization the eps of granules with and without pc amendment was analyzed following the previous protocol liu et al 2022 briefly several granules were sampled from the control group and in the b600 group 2 g l sodium acetate and 2 g pc l after the experiments to determine the chemical amounts of eps fractions the granular suspensions 10 ml 0 3 g dry weight mixed with nacl solution 0 05 10 ml were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min the 0 22 μm filtered supernatant was solvable eps s eps the residues in the tube were resuspended in nacl solution 0 05 10 ml followed by sonication for 2 min and horizontal blending at 150 rpm for 10 min in a shaker the mixture was sonicated for another 2 min before centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min the filtered supernatant was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps in the extraction of tightly bound eps tb eps a mixture solution of nacl 0 05 5 ml and na2 edta 5 5 ml was added to the sediments left in the tube the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 4 h and was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min the collected supernatant was tb eps the contents of polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in all eps fractions were characterized by the sulfuric acid phenol method and bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china respectively the zeta potential of eps fractions was determined using nano zs malvern uk the spatial distribution of eps components including proteins α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids within granules were visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica sp8 following the previous protocol wang et al 2018b firstly the granules were cleaned with pbs 50 mm ph 7 and then were covered with sodium bicarbonate 0 1 mol l then the samples were stained with fitc solution 1000 mg l 30 min con a solution 250 mg l 60 min calcofluor white cw solution 30 g l 30 min and nile red nr solution 10 mg l 30 min respectively the 3d structure of these components was studied by zen 2011 blue edition carl zeiss the fluorescence intensity fi was determined using image j 2 4 microbial community the control egs in the absence of pc and pc egs were sampled to investigate the microbial community changes the total genomic dna was extracted using a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio powersoil the primers of 515f 907r were used to amplify the v4 v5 region of 16s rrna illumina miseq sequencer mingke biotechnology co ltd hangzhou china was conducted to perform 16s rrna sequencing analysis all the gene files have been submitted to ncbi database with the accession number prjna782355 and prjna 784693 a heatmap based on the hierarchical clustering method was constructed in the multi experiment viewer software mev 4 9 0 to reflect the relative microbial abundance and fold changes picrust analysis was applied to predict the dominant functional pathways based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database langille et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of pc 3 1 1 morphologies distinct morphologies were observed with various pcs prepared at different heating temperatures fig s1 generally higher temperatures b1000 resulted in an internal structure of more fragments with rough surfaces while lower temperatures b600 led to a smoother surface with pores and channels in agreement with a previous study which reported that the pcs obtained from a higher temperature i e 1100 c exhibited a rough surface morphology due to the collapse of carbon structure zhang et al 2018 all three pc samples had the largest volume proportion of particle size of 500 μm fig s2 these macropores greater than 1 μm would benefit the bacterial colonization and the organic adsorption on these macropores was accessible to the bacteria which enabled pc superior to the commercial activated carbons mostly with micropores less than 1 μm huggins et al 2016 the bet analysis revealed the highest surface area of 510 7 m2 g of b800 followed by 386 9 m2 g of b600 and 193 9 m2 g of b1000 table s1 these bet values of pcs prepared from the pecan shells were comparable to the pcs prepared from other wastes i e sugarcane bagasse char produced at 700 c 270 5 m2 g li et al 2021b and sludge char produced at 700 c 29 96 m2 g zhang et al 2018 the macropores and high surface areas are usually believed to benefit the eab growth chen et al 2012 wang et al 2018a considering the high amounts of eab in egs the addition of these pyrolysis carbons was expected to boost the electroactivity of egs 3 1 2 functional groups on the pc surface ftir spectra exhibited a similar feature to those reported of pcs derived from other sources sathishkumar et al 2020 no distinct changes of the spectra of functional groups were distinguished among three samples fig 1 a the bands at around 3450 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were attributed to the phenolic oh ch2 asymmetrical stretching vibrations respectively the slightly stronger intensity of the band at 1575 cm 1 c c stretching in b1000 indicated the increase of aromaticity at higher temperatures magid et al 2021 all three samples shared a weak c o stretching vibration located at 1050 cm 1 which corresponded to phenolic compounds yuan et al 2018 the geobattery theory describes the capacities of reversibly electron accepting and donating which were contributed by the oxygenated moieties i e phenolic hydroquinone c o and quinoid c o sun et al 2017 the weak absorbances of phenolic c o in three pcs samples suggested a low capacity of electron donating since the phenolic fractions were accountable for edc to further identify the different compositions of such functional fractions in three pcs xps analysis was performed xps with characteristic spectra of c1s and o1s disclosed the presence of carbon and oxygen fig 1b the surface o c atomic ratio decreased from 0 37 for b600 to 0 30 for b1000 with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures table s2 indicating the decomposition of oxygen containing functional fractions at a higher pyrolysis temperature the c 1s xps spectra indicated the content of c o at 288 ev reduced from 0 67 for b600 to 0 46 for b1000 with the pyrolysis temperature increasing suggesting a decreasing content of quinonoid fractions in the pcs derived from a higher pyrolysis temperature the increasing content of c o at 286 ev from 0 18 b600 to 0 45 b1000 with increasing temperature was indicative of higher amounts of hydroquinone phenolic groups with pyrolysis temperatures increasing as reported previously the phenolic compounds were recognized as the important moieties responsible for edc whereas quinoid fractions were accountable for eac sun et al 2021 sun et al 2017 yu et al 2022 the oxygenated functional groups in pcs collectively govern the eec these quinones and phenols endowed the pcs active in the microbial eet for example facilitating eet in methane oxidizing biogeochemical process in the soil zhang et al 2019 and improving the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between geobacter cocultures zhang et al 2018 3 1 3 redox properties and electrical conductivities of pc the phenolic c o fractions and quinoid c o moieties are responsible for edc and eac of pcs respectively li et al 2022 prado et al 2019 sun et al 2017 all pcs exhibited a significantly higher eac value 1 96 mmol e 1 g 1 of b600 than edc value 0 09 mmol e 1 g 1 of b600 fig 1c p 0 05 the almost 40 times higher eac of edc suggested the predominance of quinonal moieties over phenolic groups which agreed well with xps spectra ai et al 2020b observed a significantly higher eac than edc of the bone meal powder derived char and the eac mediated a faster dichlorination of trichloroethylene very recently yu et al 2022 claimed that the eac plays a more vital role than edc in eet since in the pc amended shewanella culture a faster ferrihydrite reduction was obtained in the pc possessing a higher eac thus the extremely higher eac values of all pcs than edc here were expected to facilitate the microbial eet process furthermore it was noticed that b600 owned a highest eac among three pcs which was consistent with the content of quinoid c o as revealed by xps spectra klüpfel et al 2014 also found that the edc of pcs dominated over eac within a low temperature range 200 300 c owing to the predominance of phenolic moieties while eac was superior to edc within a high temperature range 600 700 c ascribed to the quinone moieties and condensed aromatic structures the pcs obtained at a low temperature 700 c had a predominance of geobattery function closely related to the eec while the pcs polysized at a high temperature 700 c additionally possess the geoconductor mechanism which was ascribed to the polycondensed aromatic graphitic structure conjugated π electron yu et al 2022 the conductivity is an indicator for evaluating the pcs function as a geoconductor as shown in fig 1d the ec of pcs increased greatly with the increasing pyrolysis temperatures the ec of b1000 61200 s m for b1000 showed a 7 orders of magnitude higher value than that of b600 5 78 ms m for b600 which was due to the increasing aromaticity at a high temperature klüpfel et al 2014 the findings were similar to the previous studies which reported that the pcs pyrolyzed at a higher temperature 700 c displayed a better conductivity yu et al 2022 3 2 enhancement of pc on the electroactivity of egs the reproducible current profiles were obtained in all the experiments fig 2 a and fig s4 and the jmax was grabbed from the current profiles fig 2b d the jmax greatly increased with pcs amendments the egs with b600 generated the highest jmax of 0 40 a m2 which was 132 times higher than the control without pc amendment 0 003 a m2 this increment of jmax in pc egs was similar to the recent study wang et al 2022 the profound increase of jmax with pc additions identified the positive role of pc in improving egs electroactivity the morphological structure of egs was not broken down by the pc addition as revealed by sem images fig s6 the higher pyrolysis temperature did not result in a higher jmax among three pcs b600 outperformed b800 and b1000 and jmax of b600 was 0 67 times and 0 33 times higher than that of b800 and b1000 respectively fig 2a the cv curves of three pcs agreed well with jmax variations fig s5 the remarkable value of jmax in b600 was mainly ascribed to the functional groups and redox properties as revealed by eac results b600 contained a much higher amount of oxygenated functional groups and a significantly higher eac than that of b800 and b1000 as shown in 3 1 these oxygenated functional moieties and superior eac suggested the b600 served as a geobattery prado et al 2019 performing a charge discharge cycle the increasing jmax in the b800 and b1000 amended egs can be explained by the coupled mechanisms of geoconductor and geobattery of pcs at a high pyrolysis temperature klüpfel et al 2014 yu et al 2022 since both pcs owned an eec value of around 1 2 mmol e 1 g 1 char and a quite high conductivity b600 was selected as the optimal pc type to further explore the influence of additional amounts of pc on jmax fig 2b the jmax exhibited a significant increase from 0 29 to 0 40 a m2 with the increasing pc amount from 0 5 to 1 g l and further declined to 0 22 a m2 with 2 g pc l addition a recent study reported that higher amounts of pcs 5 g l vs 1 g l pcs amounts increased the nitrobenzene reduction rate in shewanella oneidensis mr 1 culture due to the more active sites contributed by more pcs wang et al 2020 cai et al 2021 found that an apparent increase of current densities was observed when the pcs amounts in the soil increased from 1 to 3 mass ratios while the current densities became stable when the pcs amounts raised from 3 to 6 accordingly the phenanthrene biodegradation in the pc amendment soil did not exhibit a great difference in the pc amended soil within the range of 1 3 and 6 ratios of pcs amounts generally a higher amount of pc would result in a higher current generation however in this study it showed that excessive or insufficient pc amounts would hinder a further jmax increment not all the egs had sufficient contact with the electroactive pc at 0 5 g l while excessive pc might stimulate other electron transfer processes i e diet for methanogenesis at 2 g l pc addition yuan et al 2018 other than eet for electricity producing a more rapid acetate degradation rate with 2 g pc l amendment than that at a lower pc content 0 5 g l supported this deduction fig s7a the acetate concentrations ranging over 0 5 1 2 and 4 g l were fed to the egs amended with b600 consecutively to explore the effect of organic contents on jmax the jmax increased from 0 12 to 0 82 a m2 when the initial sodium acetate concentration rose from 0 5 to 2 g l fig 2c which was explained by the sufficient accessible organics to eab at 2 g l however when the sodium acetate was further increased to 4 g l jmax showed 91 reduction normally higher organics would release more electrons via metabolism in this study the released electrons seemed to be consumed by other microbial consortia i e sulfate reducing bacteria or methanogens all of the sodium acetate removal efficiency achieved around 100 while the acetate removal rate decreased with the increase of initial organic loading fig s7b 3 3 influence of pc addition on the surrounding eps eps can reserve the redox active species such as c type cytochromes flavins humic substances xiao and zhao 2017 thereby they are capable of mediating electron transfers fig 3 depicts the eps distribution with and without pc amendment both samples were dominated by the proteins followed by the lipids and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides after the pc addition the whole architecture was more compact and the distribution of proteins became homogenous the fluorescence intensities fi of proteins slightly improved with pc amendment the stable fi of polysaccharides suggested the pc addition did not influence instability of the granules since they were mainly used for maintaining the stability of granules chen et al 2007 the denser distribution of proteins in eps in pc egs was similar to the previous report that red mud addition induced a denser distribution of proteins ye et al 2018 overall the pc amendment resulted in a more compact eps architecture and the proteins distributed more evenly the eps contents of egs showed an increment after the pc addition fig 4 generally the conductive materials i e hematite can drive endogenous electron shuttles such as flavins move from the eab periplasm to the surrounding eps thereby promoting eps contents ye et al 2018 however it should be noticed that the conductivity of b600 was quite low 5 78 ms m the low conductivity cannot increase the eps contents via the transportation of flavins to the surrounding eps it was likely due to the cell protection behavior under external environmental conditions here it was pc amendment as seen in fig 4 a the pc amendment mainly induced a significant increment of ps contents among various eps fractions the cells secreted more ps in the tb eps of pc egs the total pn contents in eps showed a surprisingly slight decrease after the pc addition the ps mainly function as the protection barrier for the cells against the external environmental shock han et al 2017 and pn is widely considered as redox active in eet owing to the multiple redox molecules such as c type cytochromes xiao et al 2017 some studies observed an increasing pn contents with a more efficient eet li et al 2021a mao et al 2021 herein although an enhanced eet indicated by the higher jmax was obtained with pc amendment the total redox active pn contents did not increase correspondingly it was inferred that with pc amendment the granules preferentially stored ps over pn as stated above the pc seemed to induce a protection behavior of egs and only in this protective case the pn on the cell surface have a chance to be active in eet yang et al 2019 however it is arbitrary to conclude that the eet was only associated with pn and the ps was only related to the protection role since the eet and protection roles might be co effects of the main components jennings et al 2015 li et al 2021a the zeta potential of s eps reduced while zeta potentials of lb eps and tb eps increased the zeta potential was indicative of the negative charge amount the decreased negative charges would reduce the electrostatic repulsive interactions according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory ye et al 2018 with a low repulsive force cell to cell interactions would be promoted albeit increasing the surface charge of eps was still negative which would not affect the electrostatic attraction between egs and the polarized current collector 3 4 microbial community response to pc addition 3 4 1 microbial diversity to determine the microbial diversity the metagenomic sequences of both samples with and without pc amendment were analyzed and compared there was a distinct change between the two samples table s3 and fig s8 the pc greatly changed the microbial richness which was in line with previous findings that the pc influenced the diversity of microbial communities cai et al 2020 3 4 2 microbial community dynamics at the phylum level euryarchaeota proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes thermotogae wsa2 synergistetes actinobacteria firmicutes and bathyarchaeota were identified as the dominant phyla with over 1 relative abundance fig 5 a in both samples euryarchaeota were the uppermost accounting for 49 59 and 48 76 in control and pc samples respectively in the domain of bacteria two samples showed a distinct distribution the pc profited the enrichment of several phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes the pc did not induce a conspicuous difference in the methanogenic communities according to the comparison of two samples at the class level of archaea consortia fig 5b however several eab members belonging to the phyla of proteobacteria chloroflexi and synergistia were present with pc amendment the main members of phyla proteobacteria including betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria exhibited a 1 52 fold higher abundance in the pc sample 21 86 compared to that in the control 7 64 fig 5c the anaerolineae belonging to the phyla chloroflexi and synergistia belonging to phyla synergistetes were also enriched after pc addition the relative abundance of anaerolineae greatly increased from 2 56 control to 16 73 pc the prominent increase of relative abundance of such phyla after pc addition manifested an enhancement of eabs to gain a deep insight into the functional microorganisms and the microbial community changes the microbial community compositions at the genus level were analyzed and the fold change between the two samples was compared fig 5d only the genera with relative abundance over 1 were selected and based on the fold changes the whole group was divided into group 1 increasing abundance and group 2 decreasing abundance in the heatmap the color intensity represented the corresponding abundance of each species and fold changes as illustrated a significant increase in relative abundance was observed in the eab after pc addition for example geobacter the well known eab strain increased from 0 16 to 0 72 after the pc addition accounting for a 2 21 fold change geobacter was proved to be capable of passing electrons either indirectly via mediators or directly via nanowire structures or c cyt logan et al 2019 a recent study similarly reported an increased relative abundance of geobacter with biochar presence wang et al 2022 wang et al 2021b demonstrated in the methanogenic consortia the biochar presence promoted the relative abundance of both geobacter and relevant syntrophic microorganisms the species of acinetobacter and arcobacter which were widely found in the electroactive biofilm of met hassan et al 2018 had an overwhelming abundance after the biochar addition intriguingly another kind of eab of desulfovibrio increased from 0 46 to 1 99 after the pc addition the desulfovibrio was electroactive and recently was demonstrated to be capable of bidirectional electron transfer with electrodes yun et al 2016 the increase of such genus implied that the pc presence favored the growth of eab which can both accept or donate electrons from other redox species including the electrodes and other eabs such enhancement supported an improved eet within eabs with pc amendment the overview distributions of functional genera including eabs and methanogens were further estimated to provide an insight into the influence of pc on specific microorganisms fig 5e and f the eabs genera included anaerolineaceae uncultured acinetobacter arcobacter desulfovibrio geobacter dechlorobacter syntrophobacter and synergistaceae uncultured the detected eabs showed a 3 73 times increase while the methanogens showed a decrease from 96 95 to 89 88 after the pc addition the evident increase in the relative abundance of eabs induced by pc addition proved the proliferation of eabs and the results were consistent with a higher jmax of pc egs different from the eabs distributions the relative abundance of methanogens was diminished as shown in fig 5f the relative abundance of methanosarcina showed a significant decrease from 36 41 control to 2 29 pc the metabolically versatile methanosarcina was capable of either oxidizing acetate or reducing co2 via accepting electrons directly from the diet partners i e geobacter strains lovley and holmes 2021 the diet partners were active with the pc presence since the pc also could act as the electron conductor to be involved in the diet process wang et al 2018a in this study the decreasing abundance of methanosarcina manifested that the electrons either from geobacter or from the pc would not flow to the methanosarcina for co2 reduction instead these electrons would be captured by the electrode or other eabs additionally the slightly increasing abundance of methanosaeta was likely assigned to the granulation role other than the diet between geobacter and methanosaeta wang et al 2021b since the methane was not detectable in this study maintaining a continuous n2 flow generally with pc amendment there are several enhancement effects 1 electrical communication between eabs and methanogenic community which is actually diet 2 eet within eabs community 3 electron transfer between the electrode and eabs it has been widely proved that the pc amendment can facilitate diet between some eabs and methanogens via the pc functioning as a geobattery and a geoconductor jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however in this study the first effect was clearly weakened considering the low conductivity of b600 the geoconductor role of pc was negligible the decreasing relative abundance of diet involved methanogens suggested the geobattery role of pc for diet enhancement was deteriorated as well the latter two effects can both contribute to a higher jmax thus the significantly increasing jmax with pc amendment was likely due to a synergistic effect of eet improvement between eabs and between eabs and electrodes however the contribution of two effects cannot be differentiated clearly in the current study future studies can focus on the role of pc amendment in such electroactive biofilm to figure out the contribution of each part moreover the quantitative relationship between the physicochemical parameters and microbial communities was conducted using the redundancy analysis rda as shown in fig s9 all the identified eabs assemblages especially the well known geobacter and desulfovibrio and a few methanogens i e methanosaeta exhibited a positive response to the jmax eps and eac most of the methanogens had a weak correlation with three parameters the results indicated that eabs were more directly affected by the pcs amendment while the methanogens especially diet involved partners were less likely associated with pcs amendment and jmax it should be noted that the rda analysis has limitations in this study due to the limited data and it cannot be overinterpreted 3 5 metabolic functions prediction analyzed by picrust to better understand the pc effect on the microbial metabolism related to eet process picrust was applied to predict the functional features and the accuracy of prediction could reach 85 90 chen et al 2021 fig 6 there are several functional categories about metabolic functions based on kegg database which integrates information on genome chemistry and functions langille et al 2013 the proportions of metabolism and cellular processing showed a slight increase with the pc addition while the other two pathways genetic information processing and environmental information processing exhibited a decrease in the proportions fig 6a carbohydrate metabolism 10 35 for control and 10 56 for pc respectively and amino acid metabolism 10 36 and 10 52 were the main pathways in the clusters of metabolisms followed by energy metabolism 6 31 and 6 80 and cofactors and vitamins metabolism 4 33 and 4 40 in the clusters of cellular processing the main metabolism pathway was cell motility 1 34 and 2 23 the cell wall membrane and coenzyme metabolism and transport were closely associated with an improved eet yin et al 2018 these results implied that a higher metabolism activity and an enhanced eet were induced by the pc addition the functional enzymes related to carbon and energy were selected and compared between the two samples fig 6b and c these functional enzymes were clustered into several groups a profound increase was observed in each cluster the nad p h dehydrogenases were closely associated with intracellular metabolism the significant increasing abundances of nad p h dehydrogenase in the pc egs sample supported a more active metabolism of carbon degradation intracellularly it was noted that a group of fe or s nad p h dehydrogenases were similarly improved in the abundances in the pc egs sample fe or s was widely found to play a vital role in the eet and intracellular electron transfer jiang et al 2019 melton et al 2014 the increasing abundance of fe s nad p h dehydrogenases cluster suggested that with pc presence both the intracellular and extracellular electron flows might be stimulated the enhanced eet would contribute to a higher current response when the diet partners for methane production were inhibited as discussed in 3 4 moreover the redox active proteins c type cytochrome and heme were significantly increased in abundance with pc presence the cytochromes and heme were reported to be actively involved in the eet process shi et al 2016 it was arbitrary to relate the enhanced eet with the current generation since eet was also found in methanogenesis however considering the higher relative abundance of electroactive bacteria and improved current response the increased abundances of functional eet associated enzymes more likely resulted in an electron flux to electroactive species including the electroactive bacteria and electrodes instead of the methanogens these results strongly approve the eet enhancement by pc and are in good accordance with the elevated current response fig 2 quinone redox mediators are capable of electron transfer and serve as a pivotal electron shuttle in the cytoplasmic bridging the intracellular and extracellular electron flows jiang et al 2019 higher abundances of functional enzymes responsible for quinone biosynthesis were observed with pc addition fig 6d the enhanced biosynthesis of quinone was another explanation of the higher current response with pc presence the previous study reported that the pc facilitated the diet within geobacter co cultures and the enhancement was mainly ascribed to the electron transfer capacity of pc contributed by the surface functional groups the quinone was identified as the key functional group on the pc contributing to the eec prado et al 2019 in this study the pc presence seemed to induce an elevation of quinone synthesis in the microbes it is not clear if this up regulated behavior was associated with the quinone presence on the pc itself it has been reported that acinetobacter can secrete quinone to facilitate eet wang et al 2021a as displayed in fig 5 the relative abundance of acinetobacter was significantly increased in the pc egs sample explaining the biosynthesis of quinone overall the pc not only functioned as the electron conduit but also facilitate electroactive bacteria to generate the redox species i e quinone 3 6 mechanism of pc facilitating eet in egs the aforementioned results indicated that pc amendment induced a more compact eps structure fig 3 and greatly changed the concentrations of each component in eps fig 4 clsm images supported a denser distribution of proteins with pc presence while no major difference was observed for the distribution of α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and lipids the total eps concentrations increased from 207 20 to 234 53 μg g vss after pc addition the concentration of hydrophilic polysaccharides overwhelmed the concentration of hydrophobic proteins in eps higher contents of polysaccharides were found with pc presence and the main increase of polysaccharides appeared in tb eps this increase was explained by the protective role of polysaccharides when the granules were in contact with the pc as an exogenous invader the granules stored polysaccharides over proteins when the pc was present more polysaccharides served as a protective barrier to enable the proteins on the granular surface to be active in eet additionally a higher content of hydrophilic polymers and a higher zeta potential value negative charge fig 4 reduced the electrostatic force and energy barriers between the granules nearby the well known electroactive microorganisms such as geobacter acinetobacter arcobacter and desulfovibrio were significantly increased in relative abundance with pc presence which boosted the bacterial eet thereby further enhancing the current generation syntrophic diet in methanogenesis was probably broken down via the pc since the methanogens were inhibited in this case furthermore the pc samples resulted in a higher abundance of redox active enzymes c type cytochrome and heme and facilitate quinone biosynthesis these results suggested that the pc presence induced more electron flows from exoelectrogens to electrodes thereby being captured by the electrode pyrogenic carbon acts as an electron shuttle in the microbial community the oxygenated functional groups were accountable for the current enhancement with pc amendment as revealed in fig 1 the eec property and graphitic structure of three pcs varied with the pyrolysis temperatures it has been demonstrated that the eec plays a crucial role in electron transfer at a relatively low temperature below 700 c while graphitic structures were dominant in mediating electron transfer at a high temperature above 700 c yu et al 2022 in this study it was observed the highest current improvement appeared with the pc at 600 c which was mainly ascribed to the oxygenated functional moieties fig 7 the relatively low conductivity of b600 5 78 ms m was not able to endow it the geoconductor function thus the geobattery function was the crucial reason to explain the higher jmax in b600 although electron accepting groups and electron donating groups appeared in a redox couple in the electron shuttle process a profound higher value was determined for the eac groups compared to the edc groups wu et and ai et al also demonstrated that the eac groups were more important than edc groups in mediating electron flows ai et al 2020a wu et al 2017 the correlation analysis also demonstrated a significantly positive correlation p 0 02 between jmax and eac fig s10 however the graphitic structure could not be fully ignored the jmax of b800 0 24 a m2 and b1000 0 30 a m2 were still significantly higher than that of control in the absence of pc 0 003 a m2 albeit they were lower than that of b600 0 40 a m2 with the pyrolysis increasing from 500 to 900 c the aliphatic carbon transformed into aromatic carbon followed by the conversion of aromatic carbon into graphitic carbon yu et al 2022 the graphitic structures endowed the pyrogenic carbon as geoconductor sun et al 2017 xu et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 the graphitic structures resulted in the current generation enhancement of b800 and b1000 the positive effect of graphitic structures on mediating electron transfer was realized only when the oxygenated functional groups were present yu et al 2022 thus the synergistic effects of oxygenated functional groups and graphitic structures boosted the eet with pc presence especially the pcs obtained from 800 and 1000 c 4 conclusion overall the results demonstrated that the pc derived from pecan shells promoted the current density of egs pc produced at 600 c outperformed the other pcs prepared at higher temperatures 800 and 1000 c the b600 had the highest contents of oxygenated functional groups resulting in an extraordinarily higher capacity of electron accepting more ps were induced by pc amendment to protect cells typical eab was proliferated and quinone c type cytochrome and heme synthesis were induced with pc amendment the positive role of pc in eet enhancement was ascribed to the electron transfer capacity of pc this study provides an insight into pc facilitating eet in the electroactive biofilm and opens up the scenario of pc applications in large scale of mets future studies can choose a wide range of the pyrolysis temperature i e 300 1000 c to investigate the coupled function of geobattery and geoconductor of pcs in mediating microbial eet of such biocatalyst credit authorship

15803,electrochemical membrane filtration emf technology is effective to remove the micropollutant in the wastewater but its efficacy is drastically compromised in treating the surface water having a typically low conductivity in this work a janus fe pt electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm was fabricated by depositing a thin fe layer on the side of a ceramic membrane facing feed cathode and pt layer on the other side facing permeate anode the low fe pt electrode distance 1 mm ensured a decent conductance of the emf system even in the low salinity surface water and thereby maintained the removal efficiency of the micropollutant it was identified that hydroxyl radicals oh generated via anodic water oxidation and cathodic heterogenous fenton process on bilateral sides of ecm were the dominant reactive oxygen species the emf system not only achieved 74 removal of atrazine atz from the low conductance synthetic surface water with a low energy consumption 3 6 wh per gatz or 7 2 wh m 3 but also realized a stable removal of atz from real surface water over a continuous filtration experiment of 168 h the theoretical computations and experimental analysis identified the degradation pathway i e the dechlorination and dealkylation of atz in the emf system this study highlights the great potential of the janus ecm in removing micropollutants from low conductance surface water and wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane water treatment electrochemical membrane filtration hydroxyl radical micropollutant removal 1 introduction low pressure membrane filtration technology using ceramic membranes has received increasing attention for water wastewater treatment and reuse owing to its high separation efficiency excellent corrosion resistance and robust mechanical property chen et al 2020 however critical challenges remain with regard to conventional ceramic membranes incapable of removing low molecular weight organic contaminants which can easily pass through the porous membranes and lead to their occurrences in the permeate ma et al 2018a to overcome these challenges integrating the ceramic membrane filtration with some other advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops has long been of a great interest li et al 2020a since the intrinsic properties e g high corrosion resistance and good affinity with inorganic catalysts endow ceramic membranes with a superior compatibility with aops to polymeric membranes electrochemical membrane filtration emf technology which couples electrochemical advanced oxidation process with the low pressure membrane filtration technology has been proven effective to degrade the organic pollutants in the wastewater particularly those recalcitrant organics and micropollutants falås et al 2016 that could not be effectively removed by the conventional water or wastewater treatment processes its effectiveness is mainly due to the combination of the advantages of each technology fan et al 2019 zaky and chaplin 2013 in which the membrane can not only reject the large sized particles but also enhance the mass transfer rate of small sized organic pollutants under spatial confinement within the porous structure while the ros generated via electrochemical oxidation is capable of degrading the target pollutants and simultaneously mitigating membrane fouling li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 nonetheless the efficacy of electrochemical systems is drastically compromised when the background electrolyte concentration is decreased to a certain level e g below 10 mm within the concentration range of surface water which has been observed in removing various contaminants from the wastewater fig s1a that is because a low conductivity commonly causes a significant ohm loss kim et al 2020 shin et al 2020 and such a bottleneck leads to a fact that very rare electrochemical studies have been done in an electrolyte solution having a concentration equivalent to surface water fig s1b increasing cell voltage to enhance the electricity output is not a practical way to solve this issue because of the significantly increased energy consumption and cooccurrence of side reactions zhu and jassby 2019 alternately one possible solution is narrowing down the cathode anode distance to a sufficiently low level that can compensate the high resistance caused by the low conductance surface water however making two electrodes too close might lead to a risk of short circuit another concern of using the membrane module with a very low anode cathode distance is that strong oxidant e g oh produced on anode might be rapidly consumed by the reaction with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from adjacent cathode possible reactions shown in eq 1 eq 4 and ultimately generates much less strong oxidants which possibly leads to a low oxidative ability towards micropollutants khan and kasha 1994 yang et al 2019 1 cathode o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 anode m h2o m oh h e 3 anode m oh h2o2 m o2 h2o h 4 anode m oh o2 m 1o2 oh to address these above challenges a janus electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm coupling the anode and cathode in one membrane substrate is a promising solution in the janus configuration the two sides of the membrane are differently functionalized to serve as the anode and cathode respectively obviously the anode and cathode are separated by the porous membrane in between and the anode cathode distance μm or mm can be one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional emf module cm in addition the janus ecm can be endowed with different electrochemical properties which allows a synergistic manipulation of electrochemical reaction occurring on each electrode and enables a high production of desirable oxidizing agents zhao et al 2020 moreover another benefit of using janus ecm is the enhanced efficacy of half cell reaction on both electrodes compared to the conventional emf module in which only one electrode i e the one incorporated with membrane is benefited from enhanced mass transfer by the membrane to the best of our knowledge the application of janus ecm in treating surface water has not been reported elsewhere yet thus several critical issues need to be explored for applying this novel hybrid technology to micropollutant removal in low conductance surface water i can the janus ecm generate a substantial amount of strong oxidants for an efficient degradation of model micropollutant ii how do operation conditions impact the performance of the janus ecm and iii what are the degradation mechanism and pathway of atz in this emf system in this study a janus ecm was designed by constructing fe cathode and pt anode on respective sides of a ceramic membrane via sputter coating atrazine atz was selected as the model micropollutant because it is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world and listed as an endocrine disruptor that has been frequently detected in surface waters following the electrochemical characterization of the janus ecm the oxidant species generated in the emf system were identified and the treating performance of the janus ecm in the synthetic surface water as well as its long term performance in real surface water were evaluated both experimental and theoretical analysis was performed to elucidate the possible the degradation mechanism of atz in order to further verify the efficacy of this janus ecm our results highlight the great potential of using the janus ecm system for micropollutant removal from low conductance surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents used in this study was of analytical grade unless otherwise stated

scour the membrane surface for fouling mitigation and iii enhance the mass transfer of micropollutants towards the electrodes two different electrolyte solutions 5 mm na2so4 and 50 mm na2so4 were used to simulate the low conductance surface waters see the surveyed data in table s3 and high conductance solution commonly used for lab scale emf studies respectively the peristaltic pump was used to control the membrane flux in order to adjust the contact time s i e the residence time of solution within the membrane which can be calculated using the following equation 6 contact time 3600 d j where d is the thickness of membrane mm a dc power supply l305spl etommens china was employed to provide a constant voltage for the emf system luo et al 2014 in the long term continuous emf experiment the real surface water spiked with atz was used as the feed while the contact time was 90 s with an air flow rate of 300 ml min 1 and cell voltage of 3 v 2 5 analytical methods and calculations prior to further analysis all collected water samples were filtrated by polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters mean pore size 0 45 μm while the first 3 ml of permeate was discarded in order to minimize the impacts of membrane adsorption on analysis accuracy the concentrations of atz were measured using reversed phase high performance liquid phase chromatography hplc agilent 1200 with a variable wavelength detector using the protocol modified from the previous study niu et al 2021 briefly the hplc analysis was performed at 35 c using a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm while the mobile phase was a mixture of water and acetonitrile 60 40 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 all intermediates produced in the degradation experiments were analyzed using a waters ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography uplc system equipped with a q exactive mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa separation was performed with an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 μm at 40 c and the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 05 formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 with specific chromatographic separation conditions given in table s4 both the positive and negative modes were performed for the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms to detect ions with m z 70 1050 that can cover all intermediates of atz degradation in which the spray voltages for the positive and negative modes were 3 0 kv and 3 2 kv respectively the atz removal efficiency η of the emf system and the inhibition ratio of scavengers on atz removal efficiency by the emf system were calculated according to the following equations 7 removal efficiency 1 c p c f 100 8 inhibition ratio 1 η s η c 100 where c p and c f are the atz concentrations in the permeate and feed respectively η s and η c are the atz removal efficiencies in the scavenging experiments and control experiments respectively the energy consumption e v per unit of treated water and specific energy consumption e atz per unit of removed atz were calculated by the following equations 9 e v uit v 10 e atz uit ηc 0 v where u is the applied cell voltage v i is the current a t is the filtration time hour and the v is the permeate volume m3 the data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova and a p value less than 0 05 is statistically significant 2 6 theoretical computations dft computations were carried out by using the gaussian 09 package and the geometric optimizations were conducted at m06 2x 6 311g d p level with the implicit solvation models smd of water zaky and chaplin 2014 it was confirmed that the optimized structures had no imaginary frequency using frequency calculation electrostatic potential esp and average local ionization energy alie analyses were all performed using the multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 to predict the active reaction sites of atz bulat et al 2010 politzer et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of janus ecm sem images show that the ecm used in this study is featured with a porous structure fig 2 a and 2b and shares a similar surface morphology to the pristine cm fig s3 suggesting that the sputter coating had a minor effect on the structure of the membrane the characteristic porous structure can enhance the convective mass transfer of pollutants and thus benefit the enhancement of degradation efficiency chen et al 2019 the elemental mapping fig 2a and 2b shows that ti was coated on the both sides of the janus membrane with a thickness ranging from 2 0 to 6 5 μm which could ensure good conductivity and minimize the ohm loss of the electrode a bright strip was observed on each side from the elemental mapping the thickness and location of which were well matched with the corresponding ti layer indicating that the majority of fe and pt was sputter coated on the conductive layer as shown in x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of fig 2c and 2d the deconvolution of fe 2p indicated the presence of fe3 and fe2 in both fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 regions as the peaks at binding energy of 709 9 ev 711 8 ev and 714 2 ev are assigned to fe0 fe2 and fe3 respectively li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 similarly the peaks of pt0 70 3 ev and pt2 73 5 ev were identified in the regions of pt 4f5 2 and pt 4f7 2 xu et al 2015 noteworthy no signal of ti species was detected in both xps spectra suggesting a full coverage of fe and pt coating on the ti conductive layers the gixrd analysis also revealed that the crystalline pt was present on the anode side of the janus ecm while fe layer on the cathode side mainly existed in amorphous form fig s4 the structural and electrochemical properties of the janus ecm were further characterized fig 2e shows that the pore size distribution of the janus ecm was nearly identical to that of the pristine ceramic membrane mean pore size 2 84 μm and the n2 adsorption desorption results fig s5 revealed that the bet specific surface areas as well as bjh pore volumes also had a minor change after sputter coating nevertheless afm measurements fig s6 showed that the sputter coated metal layer made the membrane surface less rough which was beneficial to reducing the adhesion of microbes zhao et al 2018 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization showed that the charge transfer resistances of both sides of ecm after sputtering coating were drastically reduced from 16 668 12 ohm for cm substrate to 18 90 ohm and 77 63 ohm for pt deposited anode and fe deposited cathode respectively fig 2f linear sweep voltammetry lsv revealed that the oxygen evolution potential and oxygen reduction potential of the janus ecm were 1 79 and 0 80 v vs she respectively when the concentration of dissolved oxygen was 10 72 mg l 1 fig s7 3 2 identifications of ros in the emf system ros were firstly identified in emf system under flow by and flow through modes with epr as illustrated in fig 3 a an epr spectrum with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 confirmed that oh was generated on the fe based cathode under both flow modes the generation of oh on the fe based cathode was mainly attributed to the heterogenous fenton reaction occurring on the cathode surface eq 10 by consuming h2o2 generated through reduction of o2 eq 1 given that an adequate amount of dissolved o2 was supplied in the emf system sun et al 2018 as noted in eq 11 feiii can be electrochemically reduced to feii on the cathode and the cycle between feiii and feii enables a sustainable generation of oh for pollutant degradation zheng et al 2017 11 feii h2o2 feiii oh oh 12 feiii e feii on the anode side the generation of oh was also observed under the flow through mode which was mainly due to the high efficiency of pt in water oxidation cavalcanti et al 2013 dominguez et al 2018 meanwhile a less strong oxidant 1o2 was also identified according to its typical triplet signal intensity ratio of 1 1 1 green line in fig 3a of 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperdinol n oxyl tempo generated from 1o2 trapping agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp however the typical 1o2 signal disappeared on the anode side after the operation was changed to the flow by mode in which there was no water flowing through the janus ecm blue and gray lines in fig 3a the result suggested that the generation of 1o2 in this emf system was a process involved with both cathode and anode which excluded the possibility of generation of 1o2 mediated by fe based cathode only li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 the possible generation mechanism of 1o2 can be illustrated by eq 1 4 i e h2o2 was generated on cathode and subsequently consumed via heterogeneous fenton reaction zheng et al 2017 whereas some unreacted h2o2 could migrate to anode via diffusion and convective flow and ultimately transform to 1o2 by reacting with local oh zhao et al 2020 apparently the design of this janus ecm enables a high production of oh by rapidly consuming in situ generated h2o2 at the local fe based cathode surface via fenton reaction and thus minimizes the generation of 1o2 downstream typically a maximized production of oh is highly desirable to effectively degrading micropollutants in the surface water owing to its more powerful oxidation ability than other common oxidizing agents epr analysis demonstrated that three types of ros including cathodic oh anodic oh and anodic 1o2 were produced in the emf system all of which were potentially involved in the micropollutant degradation to clarify the relative contribution of each ros to the degradation of atz a series of scavenging experiments were conducted in the emf system with a cell voltage of 3 v and contact time of 90 s fig 3b the control experiment achieved 74 removal of atz after adding furfuryl alcohol ffa the scavenger of both oh k 1 1 1 6 1010 m 1 s 1 sanches neto et al 2021 and 1o2 k 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the removal of atz was drastically dropped to 0 5 and the inhibition ratio was 99 suggesting that there was no other major ros apart from cathodic oh anodic oh and 1o2 in the emf system in a separate experiment n2 purging was used to remove the dissolved oxygen in order to inhibit the generation of cathodic oh and anodic 1o2 consequently the removal of atz was reduced to 57 and the inhibition ratio was 22 suggesting a significant contribution from anodic oh furthermore isopropanol ipa was added to the emf system to selectively scavenge cathodic oh and anodic oh because of its much greater reaction rate constant with oh than that with 1o2 devasagayam et al 1991 zheng et al 2018 noticeably the atz removal efficiency dropped to 4 showing that approximately 95 of oxidation ability had vanished after scavenging oh on the basis of the above results it could be concluded that cathodic and anodic oh contributed to the majority of atz removal as stated above oh is a very strong oxidizing agent and thus favorable to the pollutant removal in some cases although 1o2 was also generated in this emf system its two stage production process was apparently inhibited in the configuration of janus ecm due to the presence of competitive reaction of oh i e fenton reaction on the cathode side 3 3 effects of operation conditions on the removal of atz cell voltage is critical to the treating efficiency of organic pollutants in the emf system and the optimal cell voltage was firstly explored as shown in fig 4 a atz removal was less than 5 when no cell voltage was applied indicating a minor contribution of membrane rejection or adsorption when the voltage was increased to 1 v the atz removal was significantly enhanced to 41 further increasing the voltage to 3 v led to a higher removal efficiency of atz 74 the enhanced atz removal was primarily attributed to the intensified electrochemical generation of ros because of the increased potential of both sides of ecm fig 4b nonetheless the increasing of voltage was also coupled with a rising of energy consumption which became more dramatic when the cell voltage was increased from 3 v to 4 v fig 4a probably due to intensive side reactions e g oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction scialdone et al 2009 specifically the energy consumption was increased from 3 6 wh g 1 to 29 wh g 1 while the removal was only enhanced slightly from 74 to 83 as such a cell voltage of 3 v was selected as the optimal voltage for the subsequent emf experiments in light of a balance between the removal efficiency and energy consumption in theory increasing the contact time between atz and the janus ecm allows a longer retention time of atz in the membrane pores and consequently more ros generated in the local membrane surface can react with atz molecules in this confined environment chen et al 2019 the experiments fig 4c also confirmed that the atz removal gradually increased with an increase of contact time the removal efficiency at the contact time of 90 s 74 was nearly tripled in comparison with that at the contact time of 15 s 27 doubling the contact time to 180 s could further increase the remove efficiency to 84 but the benefits seemed low because of the noticeably low flux in contrast the contact time had much less impact on the energy consumption of the emf system fig 4c as the energies consumed under different contact times were all below 7 0 wh g 1 the treating efficiency of the janus ecm in the solution 5 mm na2so4 having an ionic concentration comparable to real surface waters was further compared with that conducted with the solution having a high ionic concentration 50 mm na2so4 which was commonly used in emf studies as shown in fig 4d it is evident that the atz removal efficiencies for both feeds had minor difference under different periods of contact time 60 s 90 s and 180 s for example the atz removal efficiency was 75 with the feed of 50 mm na2so4 under 90 s of contact time while the value was still maintained at 74 with the feed of 5 mm na2so4 under the same contact time moreover the energy consumption of each emf experiment operated with the low conductance feed was lower than that with the high conductance feed under the same contact time e g 3 6 wh g 1 at 5 mm na2so4 vs 6 5 wh g 1 at 50 mm na2so4 90 s of contact time which should be attributed to the less intensified side reactions ma et al 2018b it was also observed that the potential distribution slightly shifted to the positive direction when the electrolyte concentration decreased from 50 mm to 5 mm fig s8 suggesting that the less intensive cathodic reactions in terms of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution might contribute to the reduction of overall energy consumption apparently the use of janus ecm shows robustness in treating performance when treating the low conductance wastewater see the compiled data in fig s9 specifically when the electrolyte concentration decreased from a high level 50 mm to a low level which approached the typical electrolyte concentration of surface water the removal efficiency of janus ecm only declined by 0 8 5 0 an average value of 2 6 while those of conventional ecms experienced a 18 6 90 0 drop an average value of 43 4 the nearly uncompromised removal efficiency at the low conductance background solution could be largely due to that the small electrode distance of the janus ecm 1 mm which ensured a low ohm loss of electrolyte and thereby maintained the electricity output for ros generation compared with other reported electrochemical membrane technologies the janus ecm shows a comparable or superior performance in terms of water flux removal efficiency and energy consumption albeit with a much lower concentration of supporting electrolyte table s5 3 4 long term continuous emf experiment with real surface water the uncompromised removal efficiency and low energy consumption at the low conductance feed demonstrated a great potential to apply the janus ecm in treating real surface water to verify the efficacy of janus ecm in treating real surface water a long term continuous flow through experiment was conducted over 168 h by feeding the emf system with atz spiked surface water the real surface water had a comparably low conductivity 828 9 μs cm 1 to the synthetic low conductance wastewater 1047 μs cm 1 the water quality parameters are summarized in table s6 and the concentration of organic matters in the surface water was less than 8 mgcod l 1 which were identified to be mainly protein like substances fig s10 wang et al 2009 yamashita and tanoue 2003 the long term continuous experiments fig 5 shows that the atz removal by the emf system ranged from 53 to 64 over the entire operation period with an average removal efficiency of 59 and a low atz concentration 0 65 mg l 1 0 83 mg l 1 in permeate the lower removal efficiency in real surface water than that in the synthetic one suggested a negative impact of organic matters and interfering ions e g cl hco3 in the real surface water on the treating efficiency of emf system possibly via a competition reaction with ros lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 a higher removal might be achieved from an enhanced production of oh or more selective ros through the further optimization of the janus ecm as well as operation parameters in addition the energy consumption for the atz spiked real surface water ranged from 2 4 to 3 7 wh g 1 with an average value of 2 9 wh g 1 as shown in fig s11 3 5 dft modeling for prediction of reactive sites by taking advantage of dft calculation the electrostatic potential esp and average local ionization energy alie were analyzed to provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and predict reactive sites in electrophilic reactions as clarified in section 3 2 oh was proven to be the predominant ros in the emf system with the janus fe pt ecm the electrophilic oh is predicted to be more likely attracted by the sites possessing more negative esp bulat et al 2010 to illustrate it the atoms of atz molecule are firstly numbered as shown in fig 6 a the surface minima of esp in atz indicated by the blue dots in fig 6b c are mainly located near the nitrogen atoms i e n2 n3 n4 of heterocyclic ring 42 92 19 97 kcal mol 1 and the nitrogen atoms i e n1 n5 of side chains 9 42 1 92 kcal mol 1 due to the presence of lone pair electrons the surface maxima of esp indicated by the yellow dots in fig 6b c unapproachable for oh are mainly located near the hydrogen atoms connected to n1 n5 and c1 c8 of side chains 17 63 46 94 kcal mol 1 because the reaction rates of oh with organics are typically high the difficulty level of oh approaching the reaction sites primarily govern the overall reaction kinetics in most cases chen et al 2019 therefore it can be inferred that oh attacks were more likely to occur at those sites drawing oh by strong electrostatic potential based on the premise that the electrons of those sites have equivalent reactivities to oh however the activities of local electrons cannot be revealed by esp analysis hence esp analysis was performed together with other approaches to yield satisfying prediction results of reactive sites alie analysis focusing on the reactivities of electrons was proved to be an excellent supplement to esp analysis because the lowest values of alie revealed the least tightly held and the most reactive electrons in a molecule politzer et al 2002 as shown in fig 6d e the lowest alie value 245 99 kcal mol 1 was found near the n4 atom and the second lowest value near n2 n3 257 58 258 77 kcal mol 1 however these sites could not be substituted via oh attacks to form stable intermediates abdelraheem et al 2019 the sites near cl atom also possessed relatively low alie values 258 09 258 12 kcal mol 1 suggesting a possibility of ccl bond cleavage the sites near n2 n5 had alie values of 261 40 284 49 kcal mol 1 and 268 97 278 72 kcal mol 1 respectively meanwhile the sites near c7 had alie values of 279 56 280 60 kcal mol 1 implying that cn bond cleavage might occur hence it is reasonable to predict that in combination with the esp results the cn bonds of c2 n1 and c7 n5 as well as the ccl bonds were the primary reactive sites for the electrophilic reactions with oh c1 c3 and c8 are the least possible reactive sites due to their both high alie and esp values in addition electrophilic reactions are not likely to occur on n1 c4 and n5 c6 due to the absence of potential sites on c4 and c6 for substitution reactions which are necessary steps for oh mediated cleavage abdelraheem et al 2019 3 6 possible degradation pathways of atz the mass spectrometric characterization was conducted using uplc ms ms to identify the intermediates formed during emf process in order to elucidate the possible atz degradation pathway five intermediates in the permeate of the emf system had been identified while the mass spectrometric ms figures of these intermediates given in figs s12 s16 on the basis of the experimental results from ms characterizations as well as theoretical predications by dft the possible degradation pathways of atz was proposed fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the atz degradation started from the dealkylation reaction occurred at the cn bonds which was also verified by other studies niu et al 2021 saltmiras and lemley 2002 moreover cn bonds on both side chains of atz were predicted to be potential reactive sites for electrophilic attack of oh after removing the alkyl groups from the side chains of atz the de isopropylated compound c5h8cln5 m z 174 and the de ethylated compound c6h10cln5 m z 188 the two primary intermediates were obtained next further dealkylation on the other side of primary intermediates resulted in the formation of secondary intermediate c3h4cln5 m z 146 finally the dechlorination hydroxylation the cleavage of ccl bond under electrophilic attack by oh yielded the downstream product c3h5n5o m z 128 which was supported by the results of dft modeling the longest bond ccl bond confirmed by previous study chen et al 2009 and this present study is known to be prone to cleavage as for the upper degradation pathway the major difference was that the second step could be dechlorination hydroxylation to obtain the secondary intermediate c5h9n5o m z 156 next c5h9n5o was ultimately transformed into downstream intermediates i e c3h5n5o through dealkylation at the other side chain 4 conclusions in this study a fe pt janus electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm was fabricated to remove the micropollutant in the low conductance surface water the intrinsically low electrode distance of the janus ecm endowed the emf system with a good conductance even in an electrolyte solution having a low conductivity and thereby achieved an uncompromised treating efficiency the pairing of fe pt electrodes also enabled an efficient production of the strong oxidant oh which was capable of decomposing atz via dechlorination and dealkylation a series of tests showed that the janus ecm could acquire a high removal of atz from the synthetic surface water and also achieve a stable treating performance in the long term continuous experiment with the real surface water in addition the energy consumption of this well designed emf system was low demonstrating that the janus ecm had a great potential to remove the micropollutant in the surface water in a cost effective manner and thus break the bottleneck of low efficiency of emf in treating low conductance wastewater declaration of

15803,electrochemical membrane filtration emf technology is effective to remove the micropollutant in the wastewater but its efficacy is drastically compromised in treating the surface water having a typically low conductivity in this work a janus fe pt electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm was fabricated by depositing a thin fe layer on the side of a ceramic membrane facing feed cathode and pt layer on the other side facing permeate anode the low fe pt electrode distance 1 mm ensured a decent conductance of the emf system even in the low salinity surface water and thereby maintained the removal efficiency of the micropollutant it was identified that hydroxyl radicals oh generated via anodic water oxidation and cathodic heterogenous fenton process on bilateral sides of ecm were the dominant reactive oxygen species the emf system not only achieved 74 removal of atrazine atz from the low conductance synthetic surface water with a low energy consumption 3 6 wh per gatz or 7 2 wh m 3 but also realized a stable removal of atz from real surface water over a continuous filtration experiment of 168 h the theoretical computations and experimental analysis identified the degradation pathway i e the dechlorination and dealkylation of atz in the emf system this study highlights the great potential of the janus ecm in removing micropollutants from low conductance surface water and wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane water treatment electrochemical membrane filtration hydroxyl radical micropollutant removal 1 introduction low pressure membrane filtration technology using ceramic membranes has received increasing attention for water wastewater treatment and reuse owing to its high separation efficiency excellent corrosion resistance and robust mechanical property chen et al 2020 however critical challenges remain with regard to conventional ceramic membranes incapable of removing low molecular weight organic contaminants which can easily pass through the porous membranes and lead to their occurrences in the permeate ma et al 2018a to overcome these challenges integrating the ceramic membrane filtration with some other advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops has long been of a great interest li et al 2020a since the intrinsic properties e g high corrosion resistance and good affinity with inorganic catalysts endow ceramic membranes with a superior compatibility with aops to polymeric membranes electrochemical membrane filtration emf technology which couples electrochemical advanced oxidation process with the low pressure membrane filtration technology has been proven effective to degrade the organic pollutants in the wastewater particularly those recalcitrant organics and micropollutants falås et al 2016 that could not be effectively removed by the conventional water or wastewater treatment processes its effectiveness is mainly due to the combination of the advantages of each technology fan et al 2019 zaky and chaplin 2013 in which the membrane can not only reject the large sized particles but also enhance the mass transfer rate of small sized organic pollutants under spatial confinement within the porous structure while the ros generated via electrochemical oxidation is capable of degrading the target pollutants and simultaneously mitigating membrane fouling li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 nonetheless the efficacy of electrochemical systems is drastically compromised when the background electrolyte concentration is decreased to a certain level e g below 10 mm within the concentration range of surface water which has been observed in removing various contaminants from the wastewater fig s1a that is because a low conductivity commonly causes a significant ohm loss kim et al 2020 shin et al 2020 and such a bottleneck leads to a fact that very rare electrochemical studies have been done in an electrolyte solution having a concentration equivalent to surface water fig s1b increasing cell voltage to enhance the electricity output is not a practical way to solve this issue because of the significantly increased energy consumption and cooccurrence of side reactions zhu and jassby 2019 alternately one possible solution is narrowing down the cathode anode distance to a sufficiently low level that can compensate the high resistance caused by the low conductance surface water however making two electrodes too close might lead to a risk of short circuit another concern of using the membrane module with a very low anode cathode distance is that strong oxidant e g oh produced on anode might be rapidly consumed by the reaction with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from adjacent cathode possible reactions shown in eq 1 eq 4 and ultimately generates much less strong oxidants which possibly leads to a low oxidative ability towards micropollutants khan and kasha 1994 yang et al 2019 1 cathode o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 anode m h2o m oh h e 3 anode m oh h2o2 m o2 h2o h 4 anode m oh o2 m 1o2 oh to address these above challenges a janus electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm coupling the anode and cathode in one membrane substrate is a promising solution in the janus configuration the two sides of the membrane are differently functionalized to serve as the anode and cathode respectively obviously the anode and cathode are separated by the porous membrane in between and the anode cathode distance μm or mm can be one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional emf module cm in addition the janus ecm can be endowed with different electrochemical properties which allows a synergistic manipulation of electrochemical reaction occurring on each electrode and enables a high production of desirable oxidizing agents zhao et al 2020 moreover another benefit of using janus ecm is the enhanced efficacy of half cell reaction on both electrodes compared to the conventional emf module in which only one electrode i e the one incorporated with membrane is benefited from enhanced mass transfer by the membrane to the best of our knowledge the application of janus ecm in treating surface water has not been reported elsewhere yet thus several critical issues need to be explored for applying this novel hybrid technology to micropollutant removal in low conductance surface water i can the janus ecm generate a substantial amount of strong oxidants for an efficient degradation of model micropollutant ii how do operation conditions impact the performance of the janus ecm and iii what are the degradation mechanism and pathway of atz in this emf system in this study a janus ecm was designed by constructing fe cathode and pt anode on respective sides of a ceramic membrane via sputter coating atrazine atz was selected as the model micropollutant because it is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world and listed as an endocrine disruptor that has been frequently detected in surface waters following the electrochemical characterization of the janus ecm the oxidant species generated in the emf system were identified and the treating performance of the janus ecm in the synthetic surface water as well as its long term performance in real surface water were evaluated both experimental and theoretical analysis was performed to elucidate the possible the degradation mechanism of atz in order to further verify the efficacy of this janus ecm our results highlight the great potential of using the janus ecm system

to simulate the low conductance surface waters see the surveyed data in table s3 and high conductance solution commonly used for lab scale emf studies respectively the peristaltic pump was used to control the membrane flux in order to adjust the contact time s i e the residence time of solution within the membrane which can be calculated using the following equation 6 contact time 3600 d j where d is the thickness of membrane mm a dc power supply l305spl etommens china was employed to provide a constant voltage for the emf system luo et al 2014 in the long term continuous emf experiment the real surface water spiked with atz was used as the feed while the contact time was 90 s with an air flow rate of 300 ml min 1 and cell voltage of 3 v 2 5 analytical methods and calculations prior to further analysis all collected water samples were filtrated by polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters mean pore size 0 45 μm while the first 3 ml of permeate was discarded in order to minimize the impacts of membrane adsorption on analysis accuracy the concentrations of atz were measured using reversed phase high performance liquid phase chromatography hplc agilent 1200 with a variable wavelength detector using the protocol modified from the previous study niu et al 2021 briefly the hplc analysis was performed at 35 c using a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm while the mobile phase was a mixture of water and acetonitrile 60 40 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 all intermediates produced in the degradation experiments were analyzed using a waters ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography uplc system equipped with a q exactive mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa separation was performed with an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 μm at 40 c and the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 05 formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 with specific chromatographic separation conditions given in table s4 both the positive and negative modes were performed for the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms to detect ions with m z 70 1050 that can cover all intermediates of atz degradation in which the spray voltages for the positive and negative modes were 3 0 kv and 3 2 kv respectively the atz removal efficiency η of the emf system and the inhibition ratio of scavengers on atz removal efficiency by the emf system were calculated according to the following equations 7 removal efficiency 1 c p c f 100 8 inhibition ratio 1 η s η c 100 where c p and c f are the atz concentrations in the permeate and feed respectively η s and η c are the atz removal efficiencies in the scavenging experiments and control experiments respectively the energy consumption e v per unit of treated water and specific energy consumption e atz per unit of removed atz were calculated by the following equations 9 e v uit v 10 e atz uit ηc 0 v where u is the applied cell voltage v i is the current a t is the filtration time hour and the v is the permeate volume m3 the data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova and a p value less than 0 05 is statistically significant 2 6 theoretical computations dft computations were carried out by using the gaussian 09 package and the geometric optimizations were conducted at m06 2x 6 311g d p level with the implicit solvation models smd of water zaky and chaplin 2014 it was confirmed that the optimized structures had no imaginary frequency using frequency calculation electrostatic potential esp and average local ionization energy alie analyses were all performed using the multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 to predict the active reaction sites of atz bulat et al 2010 politzer et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of janus ecm sem images show that the ecm used in this study is featured with a porous structure fig 2 a and 2b and shares a similar surface morphology to the pristine cm fig s3 suggesting that the sputter coating had a minor effect on the structure of the membrane the characteristic porous structure can enhance the convective mass transfer of pollutants and thus benefit the enhancement of degradation efficiency chen et al 2019 the elemental mapping fig 2a and 2b shows that ti was coated on the both sides of the janus membrane with a thickness ranging from 2 0 to 6 5 μm which could ensure good conductivity and minimize the ohm loss of the electrode a bright strip was observed on each side from the elemental mapping the thickness and location of which were well matched with the corresponding ti layer indicating that the majority of fe and pt was sputter coated on the conductive layer as shown in x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of fig 2c and 2d the deconvolution of fe 2p indicated the presence of fe3 and fe2 in both fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 regions as the peaks at binding energy of 709 9 ev 711 8 ev and 714 2 ev are assigned to fe0 fe2 and fe3 respectively li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 similarly the peaks of pt0 70 3 ev and pt2 73 5 ev were identified in the regions of pt 4f5 2 and pt 4f7 2 xu et al 2015 noteworthy no signal of ti species was detected in both xps spectra suggesting a full coverage of fe and pt coating on the ti conductive layers the gixrd analysis also revealed that the crystalline pt was present on the anode side of the janus ecm while fe layer on the cathode side mainly existed in amorphous form fig s4 the structural and electrochemical properties of the janus ecm were further characterized fig 2e shows that the pore size distribution of the janus ecm was nearly identical to that of the pristine ceramic membrane mean pore size 2 84 μm and the n2 adsorption desorption results fig s5 revealed that the bet specific surface areas as well as bjh pore volumes also had a minor change after sputter coating nevertheless afm measurements fig s6 showed that the sputter coated metal layer made the membrane surface less rough which was beneficial to reducing the adhesion of microbes zhao et al 2018 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization showed that the charge transfer resistances of both sides of ecm after sputtering coating were drastically reduced from 16 668 12 ohm for cm substrate to 18 90 ohm and 77 63 ohm for pt deposited anode and fe deposited cathode respectively fig 2f linear sweep voltammetry lsv revealed that the oxygen evolution potential and oxygen reduction potential of the janus ecm were 1 79 and 0 80 v vs she respectively when the concentration of dissolved oxygen was 10 72 mg l 1 fig s7 3 2 identifications of ros in the emf system ros were firstly identified in emf system under flow by and flow through modes with epr as illustrated in fig 3 a an epr spectrum with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 confirmed that oh was generated on the fe based cathode under both flow modes the generation of oh on the fe based cathode was mainly attributed to the heterogenous fenton reaction occurring on the cathode surface eq 10 by consuming h2o2 generated through reduction of o2 eq 1 given that an adequate amount of dissolved o2 was supplied in the emf system sun et al 2018 as noted in eq 11 feiii can be electrochemically reduced to feii on the cathode and the cycle between feiii and feii enables a sustainable generation of oh for pollutant degradation zheng et al 2017 11 feii h2o2 feiii oh oh 12 feiii e feii on the anode side the generation of oh was also observed under the flow through mode which was mainly due to the high efficiency of pt in water oxidation cavalcanti et al 2013 dominguez et al 2018 meanwhile a less strong oxidant 1o2 was also identified according to its typical triplet signal intensity ratio of 1 1 1 green line in fig 3a of 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperdinol n oxyl tempo generated from 1o2 trapping agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp however the typical 1o2 signal disappeared on the anode side after the operation was changed to the flow by mode in which there was no water flowing through the janus ecm blue and gray lines in fig 3a the result suggested that the generation of 1o2 in this emf system was a process involved with both cathode and anode which excluded the possibility of generation of 1o2 mediated by fe based cathode only li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 the possible generation mechanism of 1o2 can be illustrated by eq 1 4 i e h2o2 was generated on cathode and subsequently consumed via heterogeneous fenton reaction zheng et al 2017 whereas some unreacted h2o2 could migrate to anode via diffusion and convective flow and ultimately transform to 1o2 by reacting with local oh zhao et al 2020 apparently the design of this janus ecm enables a high production of oh by rapidly consuming in situ generated h2o2 at the local fe based cathode surface via fenton reaction and thus minimizes the generation of 1o2 downstream typically a maximized production of oh is highly desirable to effectively degrading micropollutants in the surface water owing to its more powerful oxidation ability than other common oxidizing agents epr analysis demonstrated that three types of ros including cathodic oh anodic oh and anodic 1o2 were produced in the emf system all of which were potentially involved in the micropollutant degradation to clarify the relative contribution of each ros to the degradation of atz a series of scavenging experiments were conducted in the emf system with a cell voltage of 3 v and contact time of 90 s fig 3b the control experiment achieved 74 removal of atz after adding furfuryl alcohol ffa the scavenger of both oh k 1 1 1 6 1010 m 1 s 1 sanches neto et al 2021 and 1o2 k 1 8 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 the removal of atz was drastically dropped to 0 5 and the inhibition ratio was 99 suggesting that there was no other major ros apart from cathodic oh anodic oh and 1o2 in the emf system in a separate experiment n2 purging was used to remove the dissolved oxygen in order to inhibit the generation of cathodic oh and anodic 1o2 consequently the removal of atz was reduced to 57 and the inhibition ratio was 22 suggesting a significant contribution from anodic oh furthermore isopropanol ipa was added to the emf system to selectively scavenge cathodic oh and anodic oh because of its much greater reaction rate constant with oh than that with 1o2 devasagayam et al 1991 zheng et al 2018 noticeably the atz removal efficiency dropped to 4 showing that approximately 95 of oxidation ability had vanished after scavenging oh on the basis of the above results it could be concluded that cathodic and anodic oh contributed to the majority of atz removal as stated above oh is a very strong oxidizing agent and thus favorable to the pollutant removal in some cases although 1o2 was also generated in this emf system its two stage production process was apparently inhibited in the configuration of janus ecm due to the presence of competitive reaction of oh i e fenton reaction on the cathode side 3 3 effects of operation conditions on the removal of atz cell voltage is critical to the treating efficiency of organic pollutants in the emf system and the optimal cell voltage was firstly explored as shown in fig 4 a atz removal was less than 5 when no cell voltage was applied indicating a minor contribution of membrane rejection or adsorption when the voltage was increased to 1 v the atz removal was significantly enhanced to 41 further increasing the voltage to 3 v led to a higher removal efficiency of atz 74 the enhanced atz removal was primarily attributed to the intensified electrochemical generation of ros because of the increased potential of both sides of ecm fig 4b nonetheless the increasing of voltage was also coupled with a rising of energy consumption which became more dramatic when the cell voltage was increased from 3 v to 4 v fig 4a probably due to intensive side reactions e g oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction scialdone et al 2009 specifically the energy consumption was increased from 3 6 wh g 1 to 29 wh g 1 while the removal was only enhanced slightly from 74 to 83 as such a cell voltage of 3 v was selected as the optimal voltage for the subsequent emf experiments in light of a balance between the removal efficiency and energy consumption in theory increasing the contact time between atz and the janus ecm allows a longer retention time of atz in the membrane pores and consequently more ros generated in the local membrane surface can react with atz molecules in this confined environment chen et al 2019 the experiments fig 4c also confirmed that the atz removal gradually increased with an increase of contact time the removal efficiency at the contact time of 90 s 74 was nearly tripled in comparison with that at the contact time of 15 s 27 doubling the contact time to 180 s could further increase the remove efficiency to 84 but the benefits seemed low because of the noticeably low flux in contrast the contact time had much less impact on the energy consumption of the emf system fig 4c as the energies consumed under different contact times were all below 7 0 wh g 1 the treating efficiency of the janus ecm in the solution 5 mm na2so4 having an ionic concentration comparable to real surface waters was further compared with that conducted with the solution having a high ionic concentration 50 mm na2so4 which was commonly used in emf studies as shown in fig 4d it is evident that the atz removal efficiencies for both feeds had minor difference under different periods of contact time 60 s 90 s and 180 s for example the atz removal efficiency was 75 with the feed of 50 mm na2so4 under 90 s of contact time while the value was still maintained at 74 with the feed of 5 mm na2so4 under the same contact time moreover the energy consumption of each emf experiment operated with the low conductance feed was lower than that with the high conductance feed under the same contact time e g 3 6 wh g 1 at 5 mm na2so4 vs 6 5 wh g 1 at 50 mm na2so4 90 s of contact time which should be attributed to the less intensified side reactions ma et al 2018b it was also observed that the potential distribution slightly shifted to the positive direction when the electrolyte concentration decreased from 50 mm to 5 mm fig s8 suggesting that the less intensive cathodic reactions in terms of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution might contribute to the reduction of overall energy consumption apparently the use of janus ecm shows robustness in treating performance when treating the low conductance wastewater see the compiled data in fig s9 specifically when the electrolyte concentration decreased from a high level 50 mm to a low level which approached the typical electrolyte concentration of surface water the removal efficiency of janus ecm only declined by 0 8 5 0 an average value of 2 6 while those of conventional ecms experienced a 18 6 90 0 drop an average value of 43 4 the nearly uncompromised removal efficiency at the low conductance background solution could be largely due to that the small electrode distance of the janus ecm 1 mm which ensured a low ohm loss of electrolyte and thereby maintained the electricity output for ros generation compared with other reported electrochemical membrane technologies the janus ecm shows a comparable or superior performance in terms of water flux removal efficiency and energy consumption albeit with a much lower concentration of supporting electrolyte table s5 3 4 long term continuous emf experiment with real surface water the uncompromised removal efficiency and low energy consumption at the low conductance feed demonstrated a great potential to apply the janus ecm in treating real surface water to verify the efficacy of janus ecm in treating real surface water a long term continuous flow through experiment was conducted over 168 h by feeding the emf system with atz spiked surface water the real surface water had a comparably low conductivity 828 9 μs cm 1 to the synthetic low conductance wastewater 1047 μs cm 1 the water quality parameters are summarized in table s6 and the concentration of organic matters in the surface water was less than 8 mgcod l 1 which were identified to be mainly protein like substances fig s10 wang et al 2009 yamashita and tanoue 2003 the long term continuous experiments fig 5 shows that the atz removal by the emf system ranged from 53 to 64 over the entire operation period with an average removal efficiency of 59 and a low atz concentration 0 65 mg l 1 0 83 mg l 1 in permeate the lower removal efficiency in real surface water than that in the synthetic one suggested a negative impact of organic matters and interfering ions e g cl hco3 in the real surface water on the treating efficiency of emf system possibly via a competition reaction with ros lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 a higher removal might be achieved from an enhanced production of oh or more selective ros through the further optimization of the janus ecm as well as operation parameters in addition the energy consumption for the atz spiked real surface water ranged from 2 4 to 3 7 wh g 1 with an average value of 2 9 wh g 1 as shown in fig s11 3 5 dft modeling for prediction of reactive sites by taking advantage of dft calculation the electrostatic potential esp and average local ionization energy alie were analyzed to provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and predict reactive sites in electrophilic reactions as clarified in section 3 2 oh was proven to be the predominant ros in the emf system with the janus fe pt ecm the electrophilic oh is predicted to be more likely attracted by the sites possessing more negative esp bulat et al 2010 to illustrate it the atoms of atz molecule are firstly numbered as shown in fig 6 a the surface minima of esp in atz indicated by the blue dots in fig 6b c are mainly located near the nitrogen atoms i e n2 n3 n4 of heterocyclic ring 42 92 19 97 kcal mol 1 and the nitrogen atoms i e n1 n5 of side chains 9 42 1 92 kcal mol 1 due to the presence of lone pair electrons the surface maxima of esp indicated by the yellow dots in fig 6b c unapproachable for oh are mainly located near the hydrogen atoms connected to n1 n5 and c1 c8 of side chains 17 63 46 94 kcal mol 1 because the reaction rates of oh with organics are typically high the difficulty level of oh approaching the reaction sites primarily govern the overall reaction kinetics in most cases chen et al 2019 therefore it can be inferred that oh attacks were more likely to occur at those sites drawing oh by strong electrostatic potential based on the premise that the electrons of those sites have equivalent reactivities to oh however the activities of local electrons cannot be revealed by esp analysis hence esp analysis was performed together with other approaches to yield satisfying prediction results of reactive sites alie analysis focusing on the reactivities of electrons was proved to be an excellent supplement to esp analysis because the lowest values of alie revealed the least tightly held and the most reactive electrons in a molecule politzer et al 2002 as shown in fig 6d e the lowest alie value 245 99 kcal mol 1 was found near the n4 atom and the second lowest value near n2 n3 257 58 258 77 kcal mol 1 however these sites could not be substituted via oh attacks to form stable intermediates abdelraheem et al 2019 the sites near cl atom also possessed relatively low alie values 258 09 258 12 kcal mol 1 suggesting a possibility of ccl bond cleavage the sites near n2 n5 had alie values of 261 40 284 49 kcal mol 1 and 268 97 278 72 kcal mol 1 respectively meanwhile the sites near c7 had alie values of 279 56 280 60 kcal mol 1 implying that cn bond cleavage might occur hence it is reasonable to predict that in combination with the esp results the cn bonds of c2 n1 and c7 n5 as well as the ccl bonds were the primary reactive sites for the electrophilic reactions with oh c1 c3 and c8 are the least possible reactive sites due to their both high alie and esp values in addition electrophilic reactions are not likely to occur on n1 c4 and n5 c6 due to the absence of potential sites on c4 and c6 for substitution reactions which are necessary steps for oh mediated cleavage abdelraheem et al 2019 3 6 possible degradation pathways of atz the mass spectrometric characterization was conducted using uplc ms ms to identify the intermediates formed during emf process in order to elucidate the possible atz degradation pathway five intermediates in the permeate of the emf system had been identified while the mass spectrometric ms figures of these intermediates given in figs s12 s16 on the basis of the experimental results from ms characterizations as well as theoretical predications by dft the possible degradation pathways of atz was proposed fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the atz degradation started from the dealkylation reaction occurred at the cn bonds which was also verified by other studies niu et al 2021 saltmiras and lemley 2002 moreover cn bonds on both side chains of atz were predicted to be potential reactive sites for electrophilic attack of oh after removing the alkyl groups from the side chains of atz the de isopropylated compound c5h8cln5 m z 174 and the de ethylated compound c6h10cln5 m z 188 the two primary intermediates were obtained next further dealkylation on the other side of primary intermediates resulted in the formation of secondary intermediate c3h4cln5 m z 146 finally the dechlorination hydroxylation the cleavage of ccl bond under electrophilic attack by oh yielded the downstream product c3h5n5o m z 128 which was supported by the results of dft modeling the longest bond ccl bond confirmed by previous study chen et al 2009 and this present study is known to be prone to cleavage as for the upper degradation pathway the major difference was that the second step could be dechlorination hydroxylation to obtain the secondary intermediate c5h9n5o m z 156 next c5h9n5o was ultimately transformed into downstream intermediates i e c3h5n5o through dealkylation at the other side chain 4 conclusions in this study a fe pt janus electrochemical ceramic membrane ecm was fabricated to remove the micropollutant in the low conductance surface water the intrinsically low electrode distance of the janus ecm endowed the emf system with a good conductance even in an electrolyte solution having a low conductivity and thereby achieved an uncompromised treating efficiency the pairing of fe pt electrodes also enabled an efficient production of the strong oxidant oh which was capable of decomposing atz via dechlorination and dealkylation a series of tests showed that the janus ecm could acquire a high removal of atz from the synthetic surface water and also achieve a stable treating performance in the long term continuous experiment with the real surface water in addition the energy consumption of this well designed emf system was low demonstrating that the janus ecm had a great potential to remove the micropollutant in the surface water in a cost effective manner and thus break the bottleneck of low efficiency of emf in treating low conductance wastewater declaration of

15804,copper water pipelines are widely used in water distribution systems but the effects of solid copper corrosion products ccps including cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 on the generation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during chloramination remain unknown this study found that the formation of i thms during chloramination of humic acid ha was inhibited by the presence of cuo and cu2o but promoted with the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 the negative effect of cuo and cu2o is mainly exerted by promoting the decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cu2 oh 2co3 also accelerated the decomposition of nh2cl and hoi it was found that the complexes formed between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha facilitated through carboxyl functional groups the reaction between ha and hoi leading to an enhancement of i thm generation during chloramination which was further confirmed by model compound experiments additionally this study demonstrated that the effects of solid ccps on i thm generation during chloramination were solid ccp and ha concentration dependent but almost unaffected by different initial i and br concentrations this study provides new insights into the health risks caused by the corrosion of copper water pipelines especially in areas intruded by sea water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodinated trihalomethanes copper corrosion products humic acid chloramine 1 introduction a water distribution system a part of the water supply network is the ultimate barrier for drinking water safety before delivery to taps and copper is extensively used in water distribution systems and household plumbing throughout the world due to its effectiveness in inhibiting bacterial growth feng et al 1996 shim and kim 2004 according to previous surveys copper pipes account for 56 3 of the total distribution and customer service lines in the united state ding et al 2019 however the corrosion of copper pipes can occur in the presence of residual disinfectant oxygen and natural organic matter nom fang et al 2019 leading to the formation of copper corrosion products ccps which mainly consist of released copper ions cu2 and solid ccps including cupric oxide cuo cuprous oxide cu2o and basic cupric carbonate cu2 oh 2co3 li et al 2007 merkel et al 2002 keeping a certain amount of residual chlorine in the distribution system is a generally used strategy to control microbial contaminants and bacterial regrowth so as to maintain the disinfection efficacy during delivery usepa 1989 however the residual chlorine when present in water in the form of hocl can react with nom iodide i and bromide br to form toxic disinfection by products dbps increasing potential health risks richardson and kimura 2020 zhang et al 2018 in order to reduce the generation of chlorine associated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas many drinking water treatment plants have switched to chloramine nh2cl li et al 2019b seidel et al 2005 as a result there will be a certain amount of nh2cl in distribution systems unfortunately it has been found that the i present in water can be oxidized by nh2cl to produce hypoiodous acid hoi which subsequently reacts with nom resulting in enhanced generation of more genotoxic and cytotoxic iodinated dbps i dbps krasner 2009 richardson et al 2007 in particular iodinated trihalomethanes i thms have been detected in drinking water of many cities around the world dong et al 2019 it has been reported that both hocl and hobr can adsorb on the surface of solid ccps to form ccp hypohalite complexes casey 1993 remarkably accelerating the decay of hocl and hobr fang et al 2019 hu et al 2016 however elevated concentrations of thms haas haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were reported in the presence of solid ccps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 the most commonly proposed mechanism for the formation of solid ccp catalyzed dbps is the enhanced polarization of cl br atoms in hocl hobr by solid ccps and the subsequent enhanced reactivity of hocl hobr towards nom thereby increasing the formation of dbps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 since the oxidizability and polarity of hoi are weaker than those of hocl and hobr solid ccps may behave differently during formation of i thms which needs to be explored on the other hand it has been widely reported that nom can interact with metal oxides to form complexes that affect nom properties huangfu et al 2019 sowers et al 2019 wang et al 2015 which as a consequence may affect the formation of dbps for instance huang et al 2019 reported the enhanced formation of dichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetamide during chloramination in the presence of ccps which might result from the complexation between ccps and slow reacting organic precursors additionally a recent study found that the accumulation of organic substances by mnox led to the enhanced formation of cl br thms yu et al 2021 therefore it is quite likely that the complexation between solid ccps and nom would also affect the formation of i dbps which warrants further investigation the main objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of three solid ccps namely cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 on nom changes oxidant decay and consequently the generation of i thms in the presence of nh2cl humic acid ha was used as the representative nom substrate first the interactions between ha and the three solid ccps were evaluated second the decay of both nh2cl and hoi was compared in the presence and absence of solid ccps third the effects of the solid ccp type solid ccp dose ha concentration initial i and br concentrations ph and alkalinity were examined in detail to gain a comprehensive insight into the solid ccp catalyzed i thm formation finally the mechanism mediating the effect of the three solid ccps on the formation of i thms was further investigated and discussed including using a range of structurally diverse model compounds 2 materials and

stock solutions were stored in refrigerator at 4 c after filtering through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane 2 2 experimental procedures each experiment was performed in triplicate in this study in order to determine whether copper oxides adsorb i thms the solution with 20 μg l i thms i e chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 was mixed by stirring in the presence and absence of 0 5 g l of each solid ccp the maximum concentration used in our experiments for 24 h and then an aliquot of the solution was withdrawn and filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter for i thm analysis the initial filtrate was discarded to avoid interference from the filter and then the sample was stored in a 4 c refrigerator and analyzed within 2 days all disinfection experiments were performed in the dark with continuous magnetic stirring at ambient temperature 25 2 c and no headspace in the reaction bottles 200 ml the solution ph was kept at an appropriate constant value with phosphate buffer reactions were initiated by the addition of a small volume of nh2cl stock solution to the buffered solutions containing nom i and solid ccps where br was added if required the setup of the disinfection experiments is shown in table s1 in which the concentrations of solid ccps were set according to previous studies duan et al 2021 hu et al 2020 the initial concentrations of nh2cl and ha were selected to achieve the desired concentration of 10 mg cl2 l cl2 doc of the nom 2 1 which has been applied in several studies bougeard et al 2010 fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 control experiments were performed under same conditions without solid ccps subsequently after performing the disinfection procedures for 24 h the water aliquots were withdrawn and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the reactions of the filtrates were immediately terminated by adding a certain amount of sodium thiosulfate 20 higher than that of the initial disinfectant xia et al 2018 in the oxidant decay experiments the initial concentration of nh2cl was consistent with that in disinfection experiment in order to clearly explore the mechanisms of solid ccps on the decay of oxidants an initial concentration of 30 μm for hoi was selected according to previous studies tang et al 2021 xia et al 2018 solutions containing oxidants and solid ccps were buffered with phosphate buffer and then stirred in capped amber bottles in the dark control experiments were also performed under the same conditions without the addition of solid ccps sample aliquots were taken from the reactors at preset time intervals 0 5 15 30 50 70 100 130 and 160 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter then the concentration of both nh2cl and hoi in the filtrate was immediately measured in order to investigate the possible interactions between nom and solid ccps solid ccps 0 25 g l were mixed with a ha solution 5 10 mg c l and then stirred in the dark for 24 h afterwards the mixed sample was divided into two parts one part was filtered

inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes on an optima 7300 dv icp aes spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between ha and ccp solids the sem images of solid ccps reveal that the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 was looser and more porous compared to that of cuo and cu2o fig 1 a c in addition the bet surface areas of cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were determined to be 0 62 0 52 and 4 86 m2 g respectively as shown in fig s2 when initial ha concentration was 10 mg c l the amounts of ha absorbed by cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were 0 74 0 69 and 7 04 mg c l respectively the adsorption capacity of ha per unit bet surface area was calculated and the results are shown in fig 1d it is noteworthy that the concentrations of ha adsorbed per unit bet surface area by cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were 0 92 0 95 and 1 48 g mg c m 2 l 1 respectively obviously cu2 oh 2co3 had the better adsorption capability compared to cuo and cu2o moreover the sem image of the precipitate collected after mixing cu2 oh 2co3 in the ha solution reveals that the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 became looser with the generation of large lumps fig 1e the increased carbon content determined by eds mapping fig 1f further confirms the higher adsorption of ha on cu2 oh 2co3 particles on the contrary the morphology of the precipitate collected after mixing cuo fig s3a or cu2o fig s3b in ha solution for 24 h almost unchanged compared to the pristine cuo and cu2o fig 1a and b respectively these factors together imply that there might be interactions between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha notably a large amount of suspended solid ccps was only observed in the solution with the mixture of cu2 oh 2co3 and ha after stirring for 24 h fig s4a b implying the possible formation of ha cu2 oh 2co3 complexes huangfu et al 2019 li et al 2019a in order to further examine the interaction between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 different samples were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy and the assignments of functional groups are shown in table s2 as shown in fig s5 no evident peaks are present in the ftir spectra of precipitates collected from the ha cuo and ha cu2o mixed solutions which is consistent with the weak adsorption of ha onto cuo and cu2o in fig 1d the ftir spectrum of the precipitate obtained from the ha cu2 oh 2co3 solution is basically consistent with that of ha as shown in fig 2 a except for the almost disappeared peak of carboxyl functional groups in the spectra of the precipitates this deviation might be due to the bonding of carboxyl functional groups in ha with cu2 oh 2co3 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 therefore the carboxyl functional groups are likely responsible for the complexation between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 moreover we used xps analysis to investigate the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha as it can track the variations of bonding on the surface of materials li et al 2016 as shown in fig 2b besides the oxygen in cu2 oh 2co3 peak at 531 5 ev and the hydroxyl groups adsorbed in the aqueous solution 532 0 ev there are carboxyl groups 532 8 ev on the surface of the precipitate which are derived from ha huang et al 2017 wagner and taylor 1980 wang et al 2015 suggesting that carboxyl functional groups are the surface complexation sites between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha which is in agreement with the ftir spectroscopy analysis results the complexation between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 could be initiated by the adsorption of ha on the cu2 oh 2co3 surface and then the adsorbed ha molecules could serve as ligands to interact with cu2 oh 2co3 and subsequently increase the dispersity and mobility of ha cu2 oh 2co3 particles as indicated in eq 1 jones and su 2012 wang et al 2015 1 c u 2 oh 2 c o 3 oh l z c u 2 oh 2 c o 3 l 1 z o h where cu2 oh

decay in the presence of various solid ccps batch experiments were performed to investigate the changes of nh2cl and hoi in the presence and absence of three solid ccps as shown in fig 3 a after 12 h in the absence of solid ccps the nh2cl concentration decreased slightly from 10 0 0 5 to 9 84 0 1 mg l however in the presence of 0 25 g l cu2 oh 2co3 cuo and cu2o it decreased to 8 53 0 3 8 48 0 5 and 8 83 0 2 mg l respectively it has been reported that both solid ccps and their released copper ions can catalyze the consumption of nh2cl duan et al 2021 accordingly in this study the release of cooper ions from solid ccps in solution after 24 was determined at 0 8 1 0 and 1 1 mg l for cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 respectively and the results were comparable to those reported by duan et al 2021 therefore released copper ions and the particles might be both involved in the accelerated decay of nh2cl for the three solid ccps the effect of solid ccps on hoi decay was also investigated and the results are shown in fig 2b in the absence of solid ccps the hoi decomposition rate was 2 68 0 10 m 1 s 1 while in the presence of cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 it was 3 46 0 18 5 91 0 09 and 3 36 0 01 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s6 the three solid ccps all exhibited a promoting effect on the decomposition of hoi and the sequence was in the following order cu2o cuo cu2 oh 2co3 which is in agreement with the enhanced hocl and hobr decay by solid ccps reported previously duan et al 2021 hu et al 2016 li et al 2008 besides the catalytic effect of copper ions solid ccps might combine with hoi to form hoi ccp solid complexes thereby polarizing i atoms and facilitating the depletion of hoi fang et al 2019 lewis 1928 notably cu2o caused a noticeable decrease in the hoi concentration among the three tested solid ccps which might be related to the additional reaction in which hoi can oxidize cu to cu2 nguyen et al 2012 3 3 i thm formation in the presence of various solid ccps there was a slight difference in i thm concentration between the adsorption experiments in the presence and absence of solid ccps fig s7 indicating negligible adsorption of i thms on solid ccps fig 4 a shows the variations of i thm generation with three solid ccps after chloramination of three different nom containing water it is obvious that the addition of cuo and cu2o inhibited the formation of i thms and this negative effect enhanced as cuo or cu2o concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 g l fig 4b in particular the level of total i thms decreased from 133 6 1 8 nm to 88 2 5 1 and 54 0 3 1 nm with increasing cuo or cu2o concentration from 0 to 0 5 g l respectively in contrast it was found that both cuo and cu2o improved the generation of cl or br dbps during chlorination and chloramination fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 interestingly it was observed that the introduction of cu2 oh 2co3 enhanced the formation of i thms compared to corresponding cases without solid ccps fig 4a and this promotional effect improved accordingly as the increase of the concentration of cu2 oh 2co3 from 0 to 0 5 g l fig 4b it is noteworthy that the yield of i thms increased by 28 3 when the cu2 oh 2co3 concentration reached up to 0 5 g l this would likely increase potential health risks as there are concerns that cu2 oh 2co3 might be the main corrosion scale constituent especially in long term stagnation merkel et al 2002 more importantly the effect of cu2 oh 2co3 on i thm formation is completely different from that of cuo and cu2o and the possible mechanisms are investigated in section 3 4 regarding the distribution of i thm species the chcl2i production was inhibited by all three solid ccps and this inhibitory effect became more pronounced with the increase of the concentration of solid ccps instead in the presence of solid ccps the generation of more iodinated i thms chcli2 and chi3 was improved this is presumably due to the polarization of the iodine atom in hoi by solid ccps as several studies have reported that the enhanced polarity of a halogen atom can promote the formation of more halogenated dbps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2016 liu and croue 2016 considering the actual situations in drinking water distribution systems merkel et al 2002 disinfection experiment with mixed solid ccps were conducted and the results are shown in fig s8 the addition of mixed solid ccps enhanced the formation of i thms but the enhancement was weaker compared to cu2 oh 2co3 interestingly chcl2i and chcli2 were the dominant i thm species in the control group without ccps while chcli2 and chi3 were dominant in the presence of mixed solid ccps such a preferential composition of i thms formed also confirmed that the enhanced polarity of i atom in hoi by ccps could promote the formation of more iodinated dbps however it should be noted that the morphology of actual deposits might be different from the ones used in this study therefore further studies focusing on the dbp risks caused by ccps in drinking water distribution systems deserve more attention the changes in the production rate of i thm with different initial ha concentrations in the presence and absence of solid ccps are compared in fig 5 a as the ha concentration increased from 1 to 10 mg c l the inhibitory effect of cuo and cu2o on i thm formation remained unchanged while the promoting effect of cu2 oh 2co3 decreased from 13 4 to 7 2 this is presumably due to the accumulation of ha on the surface of solid ccp particles which may reduce the probability of reaction between inner ha and hoi the effect of ph in a range of 6 5 8 5 on the formation of i thms was investigated during chloramination in the presence of solid ccps as shown in fig 5b the inhibitory effect of cuo and cu2o decreased with the increase in ph which is in accordance with a recent study hu et al 2021 for instance the variation ratio of i thms were 67 47 and 41 at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 in the presence of cuo respectively on the contrary the promoting effect of cu2 oh 2co3 on i thm generation was enhanced with increasing ph the ph dependent variation of i thms might be ascribed to the following aspects first it has been reported that the impact of hoi disproportionation on i thm formation was negligible in the selected ph range 6 5 8 5 criquet et al 2012 second higher ph could decrease the positive charge on solid ccps weakening its electrostatic interactions with hoi so as to hinder the complexation between solid ccps and hoi hu et al 2021 thus reducing the decay of hoi induced by the presence of solid ccps therefore hoi can be retained for a longer time and produce more i thms since br is widely present in source water jones et al 2012 the effects of solid ccps on i thms formation at various br and i concentrations were also investigated as shown in fig 5c and d the effects of solid ccps on i thm formation changed slightly with the increase in the concentration of i and br noteworthy increasing the i concentration resulted in enhanced production of chi3 fig s9 which may bring additional risks due to the higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of chi3 dong et al 2019 as shown in fig s10 there was slight difference of i thm formation at various pbs concentrations in the absence of solid ccps when pbs concentration increased from 2 to 6 mm the formation of i thms in the presence of three solid ccps all increased this is probably due to that phosphate could compete with hoi for complexation sites casey 1993 thus hindering hoi decay and resulting in the enhanced i thm formation fang et al 2019 also reported that phosphate was a good competitor for hobr and the strong complex between phosphate and ccps slowed down the hobr decay the effect of alkalinity in a range of 0 100 mg l as caco3 on the interaction between solid ccps with ha and solid ccp participated i thm formation were examined in this study and the results are shown in fig s11 as shown in fig s11a zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of solid ccps ha mixing solutions remained unchanged as the solution alkalinity increased from 0 to 100 mg l as caco3 indicating that alkalinity in the tested range could hardly affect the interaction between solid ccps and ha li et al 2019a moreover i thm formation also remained largely unchanged with increasing alkalinity to 100 mg l as caco3 fig s11b which is consistent with a previous study fang et al 2019 although zhang and andrews 2013 found that copper ii could affect copper participated dbp forming reactions the alkalinity of 300 mg l as caco3 in their work was much higher than that in our study 3 4 impact mechanisms of ccp solids on i thm formation it has been reported that the presence of cuo and cu2o enhanced the formation of cl br dbps which is primarily due to the polarization of halogen atoms by them leading to the promotion of the reactions of hocl and hobr with nom although both cuo and cu2o could facilitate the decay of hocl and hobr duan et al 2021 hu et al 2020 huang et al 2019 instead we found that the presence of cuo and cu2o induced an inhibitory effect on i thm formation during chloramination which might primarily result from the enhanced decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cuo and cu2o could also accelerate the reaction between hoi and nom the preferential formation of dbp precursors with large molecular size by fast nh2cl decay as well as the polarization of hoi by cuo and cu2o could probably lead to the conversion of i thms to more iodinated dbps with higher molecular size xia et al 2018 additionally experiments were conducted to monitor the variations of chlorinated trihalomethanes cl thms and negligible differences of cl thms were detected between the absence and presence of solid ccps data not shown which means that there was not a shift from i thms to cl thms after adding cuo and cu2o notably even though the changes in both nh2cl and hoi in the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 were similar to those in the presence of cuo and cu2o it was found that the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 could enhance the generation of i thms during chloramination fig 4 this implies that the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha may play a key role during the formation of i thms since the above results indicate that carboxyl functional groups may be the surface complexation sites between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha a range of model compounds with and without carboxyl groups were selected based on the typical ha structure proposed by previous studies bichsel and von gunten 2000 felbeck 1986 liu et al 2019 these included butyric acid citric acid alanine and glutamic acids m cresol and hydroquinone which were used to investigate the i thm generation during their chloramination the distribution of specific i thm species chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 is shown in table s3 as shown in fig 6 a c the introduction of cu2 oh 2co3 inhibited the formation of i thms during chloramination of m cresol and hydroquinone but promoted i thm generation from the other four precursors with carboxyl functional groups in particular the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 promoted the formation of i thms by 27 during chloramination of citric acid with three carboxyl groups these results further indicate that the enhanced generation of i thms during chloramination is likely due to the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and nom on the one hand when cu2 oh 2co3 particles complexed with nom the accumulation of negatively charged nom on the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 could enhance the repulsion forces resulting in the improved dispersion of particles chen and elimelech 2008 thereby increasing the possibility of reactions with hoi thus promoting i thm formation heeb et al 2014 on the other hand as shown in fig 6d the z averaged size of cu2 oh 2co3 particles increased in the of presence of ha compared to in the absence of ha moreover the zeta potentials decreased when cu2 oh 2co3 ha complexes formed resulting in the formation of compressed electric double layer according to the derjaugin landu verwey and overbeek dlvo theory thus leading to easier interaction between the complexed nom and hoi on the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 particles promoting i thm formation hermansson 1999 yu et al 2021 considering that the changes of both nh2cl and hoi in the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 were similar to those in the presence of cuo and cu2o it can be inferred that cu2 oh 2co3 might also lead to the shift from i thms to more iodinated dbps with higher molecular size during the chloramination of carboxyl free nom which deserves further investigations in future 4 conclusion this study revealed that the formation of i thms during chloramination of ha was inhibited by the presence of cuo and cu2o but promoted by the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 the negative effects of cuo and cu2o were mainly exerted by promoting the decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cu2 oh 2co3 also accelerated the decomposition of nh2cl and hoi it was found that the complexes formed between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha through carboxyl functional groups facilitated the reaction between nom and hoi leading to the enhanced generation of i thm during chloramination which was further confirmed by experiments with several model compounds considering the widespread application of copper in distribution systems this study provides a better understanding of risks control from the water treatment

15804,copper water pipelines are widely used in water distribution systems but the effects of solid copper corrosion products ccps including cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 on the generation of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms during chloramination remain unknown this study found that the formation of i thms during chloramination of humic acid ha was inhibited by the presence of cuo and cu2o but promoted with the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 the negative effect of cuo and cu2o is mainly exerted by promoting the decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cu2 oh 2co3 also accelerated the decomposition of nh2cl and hoi it was found that the complexes formed between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha facilitated through carboxyl functional groups the reaction between ha and hoi leading to an enhancement of i thm generation during chloramination which was further confirmed by model compound experiments additionally this study demonstrated that the effects of solid ccps on i thm generation during chloramination were solid ccp and ha concentration dependent but almost unaffected by different initial i and br concentrations this study provides new insights into the health risks caused by the corrosion of copper water pipelines especially in areas intruded by sea water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodinated trihalomethanes copper corrosion products humic acid chloramine 1 introduction a water distribution system a part of the water supply network is the ultimate barrier for drinking water safety before delivery to taps and copper is extensively used in water distribution systems and household plumbing throughout the world due to its effectiveness in inhibiting bacterial growth feng et al 1996 shim and kim 2004 according to previous surveys copper pipes account for 56 3 of the total distribution and customer service lines in the united state ding et al 2019 however the corrosion of copper pipes can occur in the presence of residual disinfectant oxygen and natural organic matter nom fang et al 2019 leading to the formation of copper corrosion products ccps which mainly consist of released copper ions cu2 and solid ccps including cupric oxide cuo cuprous oxide cu2o and basic cupric carbonate cu2 oh 2co3 li et al 2007 merkel et al 2002 keeping a certain amount of residual chlorine in the distribution system is a generally used strategy to control microbial contaminants and bacterial regrowth so as to maintain the disinfection efficacy during delivery usepa 1989 however the residual chlorine when present in water in the form of hocl can react with nom iodide i and bromide br to form toxic disinfection by products dbps increasing potential health risks richardson and kimura 2020 zhang et al 2018 in order to reduce the generation of chlorine associated trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas many drinking water treatment plants have switched to chloramine nh2cl li et al 2019b seidel et al 2005 as a result there will be a certain amount of nh2cl in distribution systems unfortunately it has been found that the i present in water can be oxidized by nh2cl to produce hypoiodous acid hoi which subsequently reacts with nom resulting in enhanced generation of more genotoxic and cytotoxic iodinated dbps i dbps krasner 2009 richardson et al 2007 in particular iodinated trihalomethanes i thms have been detected in drinking water of many cities around the world dong et al 2019 it has been reported that both hocl and hobr can adsorb on the surface of solid ccps to form ccp hypohalite complexes casey 1993 remarkably accelerating the decay of hocl and hobr fang et al 2019 hu et al 2016 however elevated concentrations of thms haas haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides were reported in the presence of solid ccps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 the most commonly proposed mechanism for the formation of solid ccp catalyzed dbps is the enhanced polarization of cl br atoms in hocl hobr by solid ccps and the subsequent enhanced reactivity of hocl hobr towards nom thereby increasing the formation of dbps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liu et al 2014 since the oxidizability and polarity of hoi are weaker than those of hocl and hobr solid ccps may behave differently during formation of i thms which needs to be explored on the other hand it has been widely reported that nom can interact with metal oxides to form complexes that affect nom properties huangfu et al 2019 sowers et al 2019 wang et al 2015 which as a consequence may affect the formation of dbps for instance huang et al 2019 reported the enhanced formation of dichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetamide during chloramination in the presence of ccps which might result from the complexation between ccps and slow reacting organic precursors additionally a recent study found that the accumulation of organic substances by mnox led to the enhanced formation of cl br thms yu et al 2021 therefore it is quite likely that the complexation between solid ccps and nom would also affect the formation of i dbps which warrants further investigation the main objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of three solid ccps namely cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 on nom changes oxidant decay and consequently the generation of i thms in the presence of nh2cl humic acid ha was used as the representative nom substrate first the interactions between ha and the three solid ccps were evaluated second the decay of both nh2cl and hoi was compared in the presence and absence of solid ccps third the effects of the solid ccp type solid ccp dose ha concentration initial i and br concentrations ph and alkalinity were examined in detail to gain a comprehensive insight into the solid ccp catalyzed i thm formation finally the mechanism mediating the effect of the three solid ccps on the formation of i thms was further investigated and discussed including using a range of structurally diverse model compounds 2 materials and

avoid interference from the filter and then the sample was stored in a 4 c refrigerator and analyzed within 2 days all disinfection experiments were performed in the dark with continuous magnetic stirring at ambient temperature 25 2 c and no headspace in the reaction bottles 200 ml the solution ph was kept at an appropriate constant value with phosphate buffer reactions were initiated by the addition of a small volume of nh2cl stock solution to the buffered solutions containing nom i and solid ccps where br was added if required the setup of the disinfection experiments is shown in table s1 in which the concentrations of solid ccps were set according to previous studies duan et al 2021 hu et al 2020 the initial concentrations of nh2cl and ha were selected to achieve the desired concentration of 10 mg cl2 l cl2 doc of the nom 2 1 which has been applied in several studies bougeard et al 2010 fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 control experiments were performed under same conditions without solid ccps subsequently after performing the disinfection procedures for 24 h the water aliquots were withdrawn and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the reactions of the filtrates were immediately terminated by adding a certain amount of sodium thiosulfate 20 higher than that of the initial disinfectant xia et al 2018 in the oxidant decay experiments the initial concentration of nh2cl was consistent with that in disinfection experiment in order to clearly explore the mechanisms of solid ccps on the decay of oxidants an initial concentration of 30 μm for hoi was selected according to previous studies tang et al 2021 xia et al 2018 solutions containing oxidants and solid ccps were buffered with phosphate buffer and then stirred in capped amber bottles in the dark control experiments were also performed under the same conditions without the addition of solid ccps sample aliquots were taken from the reactors at preset time intervals 0 5 15 30 50 70 100 130 and 160 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter then the concentration of both nh2cl and hoi in the filtrate was immediately measured in order to investigate the possible interactions between nom and solid ccps solid ccps 0 25 g l were mixed with a ha solution 5 10 mg c l and then stirred in the dark for 24 h afterwards the mixed sample was divided into two parts one part was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured to determine the amount of ha adsorbed on the solid ccps the other part was centrifuged at 5500 rpm

was set 230 c the detection limits of chcl2i chclbri chbr2i chcli2 chbri2 and chi3 were 0 041 0 032 0 044 0 030 0 022 and 0 038 μg l respectively the concentration of hoi was analyzed using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 515 nm on a uv 1800bpc uv visible spectrophotometer shanghai mapada instruments co ltd shanghai china according to a previous study liu et al 2014 a toc vcph total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used to determine doc concentration in the solution the concentration of released copper ions from solid ccps was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes on an optima 7300 dv icp aes spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions between ha and ccp solids the sem images of solid ccps reveal that the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 was looser and more porous compared to that of cuo and cu2o fig 1 a c in addition the bet surface areas of cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were determined to be 0 62 0 52 and 4 86 m2 g respectively as shown in fig s2 when initial ha concentration was 10 mg c l the amounts of ha absorbed by cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were 0 74 0 69 and 7 04 mg c l respectively the adsorption capacity of ha per unit bet surface area was calculated and the results are shown in fig 1d it is noteworthy that the concentrations of ha adsorbed per unit bet surface area by cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 were 0 92 0 95 and 1 48 g mg c m 2 l 1 respectively obviously cu2 oh 2co3 had the better adsorption capability compared to cuo and cu2o moreover the sem image of the precipitate collected after mixing cu2 oh 2co3 in the ha solution reveals that the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 became looser with the generation of large lumps fig 1e the increased carbon content determined by eds mapping fig 1f further confirms the higher adsorption of ha on cu2 oh 2co3 particles on the contrary the morphology of the precipitate collected after mixing cuo fig s3a or cu2o fig s3b in ha solution for 24 h almost unchanged compared to the pristine cuo and cu2o fig 1a and b respectively these factors together imply that there might be interactions between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha notably a large amount of suspended solid ccps was only observed in the solution with the mixture of cu2 oh 2co3 and ha after stirring for 24 h fig s4a b implying the possible formation of ha cu2 oh 2co3 complexes huangfu et al 2019 li et al 2019a in order to further examine the interaction between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 different samples were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy and the assignments of functional groups are shown in table s2 as shown in fig s5 no evident peaks are present in the ftir spectra of precipitates collected from the ha cuo and ha cu2o mixed solutions which is consistent with the weak adsorption of ha onto cuo and cu2o in fig 1d the ftir spectrum of the precipitate obtained from the ha cu2 oh 2co3 solution is basically consistent with that of ha as shown in fig 2 a except for the almost disappeared peak of carboxyl functional groups in the spectra of the precipitates this deviation might be due to the bonding of carboxyl functional groups in ha with cu2 oh 2co3 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 therefore the carboxyl functional groups are likely responsible for the complexation between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 moreover we used xps analysis to investigate the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha as it can track the variations of bonding on the surface of materials li et al 2016 as shown in fig 2b besides the oxygen in cu2 oh 2co3 peak at 531 5 ev and the hydroxyl groups adsorbed in the aqueous solution 532 0 ev there are carboxyl groups 532 8 ev on the surface of the precipitate which are derived from ha huang et al 2017 wagner and taylor 1980 wang et al 2015 suggesting that carboxyl functional groups are the surface complexation sites between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha which is in agreement with the ftir spectroscopy analysis results the complexation between ha and cu2 oh 2co3 could be initiated by the adsorption of ha on the cu2 oh 2co3 surface and then the adsorbed ha molecules could serve as ligands to interact with cu2 oh 2co3 and subsequently increase the dispersity and mobility of ha cu2 oh 2co3 particles as indicated in eq 1 jones and su 2012 wang et al 2015 1 c u 2 oh 2 c o 3 oh l z c u 2 oh 2 c o 3 l 1 z o h where cu2 oh

decay in the presence of various solid ccps batch experiments were performed to investigate the changes of nh2cl and hoi in the presence and absence of three solid ccps as shown in fig 3 a after 12 h in the absence of solid ccps the nh2cl concentration decreased slightly from 10 0 0 5 to 9 84 0 1 mg l however in the presence of 0 25 g l cu2 oh 2co3 cuo and cu2o it decreased to 8 53 0 3 8 48 0 5 and 8 83 0 2 mg l respectively it has been reported that both solid ccps and their released copper ions can catalyze the consumption of nh2cl duan et al 2021 accordingly in this study the release of cooper ions from solid ccps in solution after 24 was determined at 0 8 1 0 and 1 1 mg l for cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 respectively and the results were comparable to those reported by duan et al 2021 therefore released copper ions and the particles might be both involved in the accelerated decay of nh2cl for the three solid ccps the effect of solid ccps on hoi decay was also investigated and the results are shown in fig 2b in the absence of solid ccps the hoi decomposition rate was 2 68 0 10 m 1 s 1 while in the presence of cuo cu2o and cu2 oh 2co3 it was 3 46 0 18 5 91 0 09 and 3 36 0 01 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s6 the three solid ccps all exhibited a promoting effect on the decomposition of hoi and the sequence was in the following order cu2o cuo cu2 oh 2co3 which is in agreement with the enhanced hocl and hobr decay by solid ccps reported previously duan et al 2021 hu et al 2016 li et al 2008 besides the catalytic effect of copper ions solid ccps might combine with hoi to form hoi ccp solid complexes thereby polarizing i atoms and facilitating the depletion of hoi fang et al 2019 lewis 1928 notably cu2o caused a noticeable decrease in the hoi concentration among the three tested solid ccps which might be related to the additional reaction in which hoi can oxidize cu to cu2 nguyen et al 2012 3 3 i thm formation in the presence of various solid ccps there was a slight difference in i thm concentration between the adsorption experiments in the presence and absence of solid ccps fig s7 indicating negligible adsorption of i thms on solid ccps fig 4 a shows the variations of i thm generation with three solid ccps after chloramination of three different nom containing water it is obvious that the addition of cuo and cu2o inhibited the formation of i thms and this negative effect enhanced as cuo or cu2o concentration increased from 0 to 0 5 g l fig 4b in particular the level of total i thms decreased from 133 6 1 8 nm to 88 2 5 1 and 54 0 3 1 nm with increasing cuo or cu2o concentration from 0 to 0 5 g l respectively in contrast it was found that both cuo and cu2o improved the generation of cl or br dbps during chlorination and chloramination fang et al 2019 hu et al 2020 interestingly it was observed that the introduction of cu2 oh 2co3 enhanced the formation of i thms compared to corresponding cases without solid ccps fig 4a and this promotional effect improved accordingly as the increase of the concentration of cu2 oh 2co3 from 0 to 0 5 g l fig 4b it is noteworthy that the yield of i thms increased by 28 3 when the cu2 oh 2co3 concentration reached up to 0 5 g l this would likely increase potential health risks as there are concerns that cu2 oh 2co3 might be the main corrosion scale constituent especially in long term stagnation merkel et al 2002 more importantly the effect of cu2 oh 2co3 on i thm formation is completely different from that of cuo and cu2o and the possible mechanisms are investigated in section 3 4 regarding the distribution of i thm species the chcl2i production was inhibited by all three solid ccps and this inhibitory effect became more pronounced with the increase of the concentration of solid ccps instead in the presence of solid ccps the generation of more iodinated i thms chcli2 and chi3 was improved this is presumably due to the polarization of the iodine atom in hoi by solid ccps as several studies have reported that the enhanced polarity of a halogen atom can promote the formation of more halogenated dbps fang et al 2019 hu et al 2016 liu and croue 2016 considering the actual situations in drinking water distribution systems merkel et al 2002 disinfection experiment with mixed solid ccps were conducted and the results are shown in fig s8 the addition of mixed solid ccps enhanced the formation of i thms but the enhancement was weaker compared to cu2 oh 2co3 interestingly chcl2i and chcli2 were the dominant i thm species in the control group without ccps while chcli2 and chi3 were dominant in the presence of mixed solid ccps such a preferential composition of i thms formed also confirmed that the enhanced polarity of i atom in hoi by ccps could promote the formation of more iodinated dbps however it should be noted that the morphology of actual deposits might be different from the ones used in this study therefore further studies focusing on the dbp risks caused by ccps in drinking water distribution systems deserve more attention the changes in the production rate of i thm with different initial ha concentrations in the presence and absence of solid ccps are compared in fig 5 a as the ha concentration increased from 1 to 10 mg c l the inhibitory effect of cuo and cu2o on i thm formation remained unchanged while the promoting effect of cu2 oh 2co3 decreased from 13 4 to 7 2 this is presumably due to the accumulation of ha on the surface of solid ccp particles which may reduce the probability of reaction between inner ha and hoi the effect of ph in a range of 6 5 8 5 on the formation of i thms was investigated during chloramination in the presence of solid ccps as shown in fig 5b the inhibitory effect of cuo and cu2o decreased with the increase in ph which is in accordance with a recent study hu et al 2021 for instance the variation ratio of i thms were 67 47 and 41 at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 in the presence of cuo respectively on the contrary the promoting effect of cu2 oh 2co3 on i thm generation was enhanced with increasing ph the ph dependent variation of i thms might be ascribed to the following aspects first it has been reported that the impact of hoi disproportionation on i thm formation was negligible in the selected ph range 6 5 8 5 criquet et al 2012 second higher ph could decrease the positive charge on solid ccps weakening its electrostatic interactions with hoi so as to hinder the complexation between solid ccps and hoi hu et al 2021 thus reducing the decay of hoi induced by the presence of solid ccps therefore hoi can be retained for a longer time and produce more i thms since br is widely present in source water jones et al 2012 the effects of solid ccps on i thms formation at various br and i concentrations were also investigated as shown in fig 5c and d the effects of solid ccps on i thm formation changed slightly with the increase in the concentration of i and br noteworthy increasing the i concentration resulted in enhanced production of chi3 fig s9 which may bring additional risks due to the higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of chi3 dong et al 2019 as shown in fig s10 there was slight difference of i thm formation at various pbs concentrations in the absence of solid ccps when pbs concentration increased from 2 to 6 mm the formation of i thms in the presence of three solid ccps all increased this is probably due to that phosphate could compete with hoi for complexation sites casey 1993 thus hindering hoi decay and resulting in the enhanced i thm formation fang et al 2019 also reported that phosphate was a good competitor for hobr and the strong complex between phosphate and ccps slowed down the hobr decay the effect of alkalinity in a range of 0 100 mg l as caco3 on the interaction between solid ccps with ha and solid ccp participated i thm formation were examined in this study and the results are shown in fig s11 as shown in fig s11a zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of solid ccps ha mixing solutions remained unchanged as the solution alkalinity increased from 0 to 100 mg l as caco3 indicating that alkalinity in the tested range could hardly affect the interaction between solid ccps and ha li et al 2019a moreover i thm formation also remained largely unchanged with increasing alkalinity to 100 mg l as caco3 fig s11b which is consistent with a previous study fang et al 2019 although zhang and andrews 2013 found that copper ii could affect copper participated dbp forming reactions the alkalinity of 300 mg l as caco3 in their work was much higher than that in our study 3 4 impact mechanisms of ccp solids on i thm formation it has been reported that the presence of cuo and cu2o enhanced the formation of cl br dbps which is primarily due to the polarization of halogen atoms by them leading to the promotion of the reactions of hocl and hobr with nom although both cuo and cu2o could facilitate the decay of hocl and hobr duan et al 2021 hu et al 2020 huang et al 2019 instead we found that the presence of cuo and cu2o induced an inhibitory effect on i thm formation during chloramination which might primarily result from the enhanced decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cuo and cu2o could also accelerate the reaction between hoi and nom the preferential formation of dbp precursors with large molecular size by fast nh2cl decay as well as the polarization of hoi by cuo and cu2o could probably lead to the conversion of i thms to more iodinated dbps with higher molecular size xia et al 2018 additionally experiments were conducted to monitor the variations of chlorinated trihalomethanes cl thms and negligible differences of cl thms were detected between the absence and presence of solid ccps data not shown which means that there was not a shift from i thms to cl thms after adding cuo and cu2o notably even though the changes in both nh2cl and hoi in the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 were similar to those in the presence of cuo and cu2o it was found that the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 could enhance the generation of i thms during chloramination fig 4 this implies that the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha may play a key role during the formation of i thms since the above results indicate that carboxyl functional groups may be the surface complexation sites between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha a range of model compounds with and without carboxyl groups were selected based on the typical ha structure proposed by previous studies bichsel and von gunten 2000 felbeck 1986 liu et al 2019 these included butyric acid citric acid alanine and glutamic acids m cresol and hydroquinone which were used to investigate the i thm generation during their chloramination the distribution of specific i thm species chcl2i chcli2 and chi3 is shown in table s3 as shown in fig 6 a c the introduction of cu2 oh 2co3 inhibited the formation of i thms during chloramination of m cresol and hydroquinone but promoted i thm generation from the other four precursors with carboxyl functional groups in particular the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 promoted the formation of i thms by 27 during chloramination of citric acid with three carboxyl groups these results further indicate that the enhanced generation of i thms during chloramination is likely due to the complexation between cu2 oh 2co3 and nom on the one hand when cu2 oh 2co3 particles complexed with nom the accumulation of negatively charged nom on the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 could enhance the repulsion forces resulting in the improved dispersion of particles chen and elimelech 2008 thereby increasing the possibility of reactions with hoi thus promoting i thm formation heeb et al 2014 on the other hand as shown in fig 6d the z averaged size of cu2 oh 2co3 particles increased in the of presence of ha compared to in the absence of ha moreover the zeta potentials decreased when cu2 oh 2co3 ha complexes formed resulting in the formation of compressed electric double layer according to the derjaugin landu verwey and overbeek dlvo theory thus leading to easier interaction between the complexed nom and hoi on the surface of cu2 oh 2co3 particles promoting i thm formation hermansson 1999 yu et al 2021 considering that the changes of both nh2cl and hoi in the presence of cu2 oh 2co3 were similar to those in the presence of cuo and cu2o it can be inferred that cu2 oh 2co3 might also lead to the shift from i thms to more iodinated dbps with higher molecular size during the chloramination of carboxyl free nom which deserves further investigations in future 4 conclusion this study revealed that the formation of i thms during chloramination of ha was inhibited by the presence of cuo and cu2o but promoted by the addition of cu2 oh 2co3 the negative effects of cuo and cu2o were mainly exerted by promoting the decay of both nh2cl and hoi although cu2 oh 2co3 also accelerated the decomposition of nh2cl and hoi it was found that the complexes formed between cu2 oh 2co3 and ha through carboxyl functional groups facilitated the reaction between nom and hoi leading to the enhanced generation of i thm during chloramination which was further confirmed by experiments with several model compounds considering the widespread application of copper in distribution systems this study provides a better understanding of risks control from the water treatment
