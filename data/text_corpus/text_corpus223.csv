1115,trace elements are common contaminants in aquatic ecosystems their detection in biota yields information on their availability in the environment and provides an indirect indication of freshwater ecological status we analyzed samples of freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates from six watercourses in friuli venezia giulia northeast italy to verify whether trace elements accumulation is related to their ecological status sensu water framework directive wfd and to determine tropic level influences on the accumulation of 18 trace elements in macrobenthic communities observed concentrations could be in line with results of ecological status assessment defined by the wfd in fact two sites classified as moderate had the highest trace elements content the genus calopteryx odonata predator was positively correlated with be cr fe mn mo ni sn and v ρ s range 0 777 0 844 positive correlations were also determined for the genus rhyacophila trichoptera predator with cu ρ s 0 757 suggesting bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate tissue ephemeroptera of the genus caenis collector gatherers were positively correlated with be fe mn pb sb and v ρ s range 0 757 0 802 indicating that ingestion of sediment is the most effective uptake of these metals results of this study albeit preliminary showed that trace elements detection in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is a useful analysis for obtaining information about the status of freshwater course our study provides evidence for a greater accumulation of trace elements in predators and collector gatherers suggesting that the tropic level of macrobenthic communities influence the accumulation of trace elements keywords trace elements macrobenthic invertebrates functional feeding guilds water framework directive 1 introduction trace elements contamination of freshwater and marine ecosystems is a widespread environmental issue monitoring of these contaminants is often based on their detection in the water column the suspended particulate matter and the sediment bervoets et al 2016 haus et al 2007 loos et al 2008 such analyses define only the temporary state of pollution however without considering the effective bioavailability of trace elements which is often influenced by biotic i e trophic level and abiotic i e water temperature ph conductivity or water hardness factors analysis of the sediment or the water column is insufficient to explain the medium and long term effects of contamination on aquatic communities detection of trace elements in aquatic organisms is a valid tool to evaluate the real contaminant bioavailability and could allow indirect assessment of ecological water quality macrobenthic invertebrates are of pivotal importance in aquatic ecosystems as they cover all trophic functions cummins 1974 metcalfe smith 1994 and are trophic resources for many species of fish and birds pizzul et al 2008 however information about trace elements accumulation in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is limited beasley and kneale 2003 goodyear and mcneill 1999 santoro et al 2009 solà et al 2004 and only data regarding few taxa or trace elements are available for example anderson 1977 for the first time detected the concentrations of cadmium copper lead and zinc in the fox river illinois and wisconsin using freshwater macroinvertebrates burrows and whitton 1983 studied the concentration of heavy metals in invertebrate from metal contaminated river and showed how mayflies tended to concentrate zn cd and pb to higher levels than other groups cain et al 1992 recorded differences in trace elements accumulation among aquatic insects taxa due to hydrogeochemical and biological factors colborn 1982 used aquatic insects to measure the levels of molybdenum in the environment jop and wojtan 1982 detected the concentrations of cadmium and lead in the body of some invertebrate species from five streams of southern poland and showed that the concentrations of metals decreased with increasing age in all species and that the relationship of metals concentration in aquatic invertebrates were not consistent with the degree of contamination in streams krantzberg and stokes 1988 reported the importance of surface adsorption and ph in metals accumulation by chironomids saiki et al 1995 evaluated the copper cadmium and zinc concentrations in aquatic food chains also using aquatic insects smock 1983 examined the influence of organism size on whole body metal concentrations of eight trace elements in aquatic insects and an exponential decrease in concentration with increasing organism size was observed for certain trace elements co cr fe sb and sc moreover unlike other organisms such as fish authman et al 2015 fatima and usmani 2013 luczyńska et al 2018 squadrone et al 2013 2016a 2016b aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates are seldom used as matrix to evaluate chemical pollution in inland freshwater even though they are widely used in biomonitoring practices indeed numerous taxa goodyear and mcneill 1999 hare 1992 hare and campbell 1992 lynch et al 1988 myslinski and ginsburg 1977 are largely ubiquitous in freshwaters are fairly sedentary and representative of local pollution are benthic and closely associated with the sediment are tolerant to low moderate metal concentrations and can accumulate rather high levels of contaminants are long lived organisms with life cycles sufficiently long and diversified to provide integrated information about local disturbances have immature stages of the life cycle which is why body metal concentrations are not affected by sexual differences or reproductive cycles have an energy input for aquatic vertebrates fish or birds as such they can represent one of the first trace elements inputs of metal contamination in food webs for these reasons aquatic macroinvertebrates have become an important element of biological quality eqb to assess freshwater ecological status as required by the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec european commission 2000 macrobenthic invertebrate communities include species with diverse sensitivity to contaminants and have been used to evaluate the ecological impact of metal contamination in streams augustine and selunathi 2018 bian et al 2016 burgess 2015 hickey and clements 1998 kiffney and clements 1996 maret et al 2003 trace elements contamination can reduce the density species richness growth and production of macrobenthic species gray and delaney 2008 maret et al 2003 the accumulation of these contaminants in aquatic organisms is influenced by processes that vary among species and results from metal input and output by the organism which closely depend on its morphology kiffney and clements 1993 physiology hare 1992 and the metals distribution in cells luoma 1989 therefore metal bioaccumulation depends on the species hare 1992 and the tropic level moreover macrobenthic invertebrates have been categorized into functional feeding guilds ffg cummins 1973 merritt and cummins 2006 that can be used to describe their role in the food web shredders process coarse particulate organic matter cpom collectors filter and collect smaller particles of organic matter fpom found in the water column and benthic sediments as a result of cpom being broken down by shredder species grazers found on rocks and woody debris feed on periphyton detritus and submerged aquatic plants and finally predators prey on animal tissue the literature on trace elements accumulation in freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates is focused especially on few heavy metals cu pb while the accumulation of other elements as al fe hg mn ni and zn is studied less often and very little data exist for co li na mo and sb goodyear and mcneill 1999 with this study we sampled aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates from six watercourses in friuli venezia giulia northeast italy with the aim to 1 verify whether trace elements accumulation is related to their ecological status sensu water framework directive 2 detect the tropic level influence on the accumulation of 18 trace elements as be cd co cr cu fe hg mn mo ni pb sb se sn tl v zn in macrobenthic invertebrate communities the choice of these elements was dictated by the necessity to improve the knowledge of inorganic contaminants in macrobenthic invertebrate communities considering that data are available for only few trace elements or certain heavy metals as presented above and in our opinion these groups of organisms could reflect inorganic contamination in freshwater 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hydrological system of friuli venezia giulia is highly diversified with the presence of torrential streams alluvial watercourses and rivers the territory could be roughly divided in three zones an alpine prealpine area a high plain area with wide alluvial fans and coarse grain sediments allowing water underflow and a lowland area south of a zone where sediment grain becomes finer so called resurgence line and numerous alluvial spring watercourses originate mosetti 1983 for this study six sampling sites subject to different impact sources were chosen fig 1 table 1 the pusala creek site 1 is a small watercourse with alternating natural and much altered stretches sections of artificial riverbed devoid of bank vegetation in addition farmlands natural woodlands and industrial areas are present in the territory near the sampling site the cosa stream site site 2 is located downstream of a fish farm and ditches where stretches of the watercourse were diverted for hydropower purposes due to these impacts distribution of the riverbed microhabitat is altered as a consequence of variation in the watercourse charge there is a small town upstream of the sampling site but the area is lowly anthropized two sampling sites were located on cormor stream at the first site 3 the stream is categorized as a natural intermittent watercourse due to its sediment nature the area is characterized by intensive farming and bank vegetation is reduced the site on the natisone river site 4 is located within an anthropized area towns while the molini ditch site 5 is located in an urbanized context with intensive farming and agricultural activities finally the ecological status of the second cormor stream site site 6 is altered due to major alterations of the riverbed floodway rectification weirs and the watercourse is classified as intermittent despite the inflow of water from other watercourses where sewage treatment plants are present table 2 presents the values of the main chemical and physical features and the ecological status of each sampling site data performed provided by the regional agency for environmental protection of friuli venezia giulia arpa fvg 2015 2 2 macrobenthic invertebrate sampling macrobenthic invertebrates were collected with the collaboration of the arpa fvg using a standardized multihabitat sampling protocol for ecological status assessment buffagni et al 2014 in agreement with the requirements of european wfd and italian laws d lgs 152 2006 d m 260 2010 at each site sampling was performed in a wadable stretch considered representative of the hydrological characteristics of the watercourse each sampling site comprised a 50 m stretch of the stream surber nets were used subtended area of 0 1m2 and 0 05m2 for the sites within her 02 calcareous southern alps and dolomites and her 06 po plain respectively the nets were 1 5m long with a mesh size of 500μm placing them on different microhabitats proportionally to their occurrence 10 replicates were collected at each site bertoli et al 2014 buffagni et al 2014 sorting operations and taxonomical identification were performed mainly on the field due to the small size of some organisms individuals belonging to the orders diptera plecoptera and to the class oligochaeta were identified in laboratory using a stereomicroscope wild m3 to compose a picture of the community structure all taxa were recorded and their abundance was estimated as described in buffagni et al 2014 six hester dendy artificial substrates were used for sampling operations at site 6 due to the high flow rate and depth bertoli et al 2014 buffagni et al 2007 and according to sampling protocols reported for non wadable streams artificial substrates were built with 10 hardboard plates separated by rubber rings and groups of five substrates constituted a sampling unit total area of 0 5m2 sampling units were placed in the non wadable stream sections and suspended at a depth of 0 5 1 5m by ropes secured to trees or artificial structures and secured to the stream bottom using bricks substrates were collected after 30 days of submersion the plates were cleaned of organisms and other material and the resulting samples were sieved with a 500 μm mesh sieve sorting and taxonomical identification were conducted as for the multihabitat samples most abundant taxa were then chosen to investigate the trace elements concentration in the macrobenthic invertebrate communities groups with n 1 or present only in a single replicate were considered rare bazzanti et al 2010 and excluded from the trace elements sample samples for trace elements detection were immediately frozen after identification brought to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until further analyses samples from each site were oven dried at 70 c for 72h or until constant weight to obtain dry weight dw 0 1mg and then used for trace elements determination feeding functional groups ffg were assigned to each taxon as described in merritt and cummins 2006 2 3 detection of trace elements the samples were divided into two aliquots one for hg quantification on a direct mercury analyzer dma 80 analyzer milestone shelton ct usa and the other for detecting all the other trace elements by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms xseries ii thermo scientific bremen germany the direct mercury analyzer performs thermal decomposition catalytic reduction amalgamation desorption and atomic absorption spectroscopy without the need to pre treat the samples the samples were then directly weighed on graphite shuttles and processed for hg content determination of as be cd co cr cu fe hg mn mo ni pb sb se sn tl v and zn was performed following previously described protocols squadrone et al 2016a multi elemental determination was performed by means of icp ms after daily optimization of instrumental parameters and using an external standard calibration curve analytical performance was verified by processing certified reference materials oyster tissue srm 1566b from the national institute of standard and technology along with blank reagents in each analytical session the limit of quantification loq was 0 010mgkg 1 for each element 2 4 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ s was used to test for correlations between measured trace elements concentration and macrobenthic invertebrate density ind m 2 for the main taxa families genera identified in the six samples used for trace elements determination of each sampling site spearman s rank correlation coefficient was also used to check for relationship between densities of the same taxa and values of the main chemical and physical parameters measured at each sampling site analyses were carried out using statsoft statistica 7 1 statsoft 2005 a p level of 0 05 was set for all tests to interpret significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characterization of water for all six sample sites ph ranged between 8 2 and 8 5 except for site 5 where it was 7 9 oxygen saturation was 100 and 101 for sites 1 and 3 respectively and ranged between 92 and 96 for sites 2 4 5 and 6 conductivity was highest for sites 3 and 6 541μscm 1 and 454μscm 1 respectively phosphate concentration was 0 070mgl 1 for all sites nitrate concentration was 1 0mgl 1 for sites 1 2 4 and 6 and much higher for sites 3 and 5 3 25mgl 1 and 1 3mgl 1 respectively ammonium concentration was 0 03mgl 1 for all sites except for sites 5 1 01mgl 1 and 6 0 05mgl 1 there is a large body of literature on the relationship between hydrochemistry and macrobenthic community composition in streams clarke and scruton 1997 and von fumetti et al 2017 reported that population density and diversity showed no patterns regarding stream acidity ph or density and that the diversity of macroinvertebrates was not related to any of the principal environmental parameters they investigated in contrast other authors graça et al 2004 niba and sakwe 2018 found a correlation between nutrients water ph temperature conductivity and richness of microbenthic communities since the ph oxygen saturation phosphate ammonium and nitrate levels were within the limits specified by law 152 2006 for italian water courses for the purposes of the present study we considered the effect of these parameters on macrobenthic communities to be less important and not influential for the accumulation of trace elements moreover application of the spearman s rank correlation coefficient did not allow to highlight relationships between the observed taxa and values of the main chemical and physical parameters of note is that the values of conductivity at sites 3 and 6 were higher compared to the other sites conductivity is known to increase as the ion concentration increases conductivity increases with water dissolved ionic species an increase or decrease in conductivity in a watercourse can indicate pollution agricultural runoff or a sewage leak could increase conductivity due to the additional chloride phosphate and nitrate ions an addition of other organic compounds would decrease conductivity as these elements do not break down into ions in both cases the additional dissolved solids will have a negative impact on water quality wetzel 2001 this was confirmed by the total content mgkg 1 of the trace elements detected in macrobenthic invertebrates at these two sites and corroborated our hypothesis that these groups of organisms could reflect inorganic contamination in freshwater see section 3 3 3 2 macrobenthic invertebrate communities a total of 7518 individuals were identified 5970 of which were insects their composition in the communities is shown in fig 2 insects class hexapoda made up the most abundant invertebrate group percentage frequency range 76 05 99 66 fig 2a at all sampling sites except at site 5 where they accounted for 23 10 of the samples the class malacostraca was the second most abundant taxon with a percentage frequency between 11 50 and 20 20 again except for site 5 where they were the most abundant group 64 71 and site 6 where the percentage frequency was lower than for the other sites 1 53 except for oligochaeta at site 5 11 64 the percentage frequency of other taxa was generally 5 the percentage frequency of ephemeroptera ranged between 18 18 site 4 and 79 80 site 6 with the genera baetis caenis and ephemerella and families heptageniidae and leptophlebiidae the percentage frequency of diptera was between 19 59 and 78 21 except at site 6 6 80 and was generally represented by the athericidae chironomidae and simuliidae families fig 2b the percentage frequency of other orders was usually 5 observed communities were generally well structured number of families ranging between 19 site 4 and 30 site 2 at sites 1 2 3 and 4 close to the expected number n 26 27 for the investigated watercourse types indicated by the italian law currently in force dm 260 2010 number of observed families was lower than the expected values n 29 on site 5 18 and especially in site 6 16 in particular the latter site is affected by impacts such as riverbed alteration and water discharge from sewage treatment plants located in little tributaries upstream of the sampling site arpa fvg 2015 both sensitive and tolerant taxa were observed heptageniidae is generally considered a good water quality indicator belfiore 1983 campaioli et al 1994 siligardi et al 2007 such as the trichopteran rhyacophila which inhabits well oxygenated environments moretti 1983 campaioli et al 1999 and represents the main genus of the rhiacophilidae family morse 2009 coppa et al 2012 and the only genus present in europe moretti 1983 among the tolerant taxa hydropsychidae is one of the most frequent trichoptera family which could inhabit altered environments and tolerate both organic moretti 1983 campaioli et al 1999 and trace elements pollution solà et al 2004 baetis is the most widespread ephemeroptera genus within watercourses belfiore 1983 sansoni 1988 the most abundant taxa included also the family elmidae order coleoptera genera leuctra and protonemura order plecoptera and the malacostraca families asellidae and gammaridae which were all considered for metal trace analyses in particular gammaridae were the most abundant malacostraca observed especially in site 5 these organisms generally inhabit middle and low sections of watercourses and are related to the presence of algae and macrophytes campaioli et al 1994 siligardi et al 2007 which were abundant in the site 5 finally the order odonata genera calopterix and onychogomphus were considered due to their size consistent biomass at the sampling sites table 3 and especially due to their trophic role as predators despite their lower density in comparison to other orders in fact odonata larvae seem to be good organisms to detect iron manganese zinc and cadmium in the environment corbi and froehlich 2010 and good indicators for metal pollution corbi and froehlich 2010 corbi and trivinh strixino 2008 fig 3 presents the observed frequencies of functional feeding groups ffg collector gatherers were the most frequent 21 30 81 00 and were dominant at site 5 collector filterers were most frequent at sites 4 64 64 and 1 43 96 but were generally less abundant at the other sites range 1 53 8 98 shredders were the most abundant ffg at site 5 64 89 range between 1 30 and 25 17 at the other sites the percentage frequency of scrapers was between 2 26 and 21 25 finally predators were the least abundant ffg percentage frequency between 1 18 and 8 86 3 3 trace elements in sampling sites and in macrobenthic invertebrates table 3 presents the biomass used for trace elements concentration measurements the trends of trace elements concentrations in macrobenthic invertebrates are shown in fig 4 the concentrations are reported in table 4 the total metal concentration by order of amount was site 6 2100 65 site 3 1979 56 site 4 1252 64 site 1 622 52 site 2 536 27 site 5 517 87 mgkg 1 it can be observed that the content of total trace elements was higher for samples from sites 3 and 6 compared to other sites 1 2 4 and 5 observed concentrations could be in line with results of ecological status assessment arpa fvg 2015 defined by the wfd that assigns the class moderate to sites 3 and 6 in fact several anthropogenic impacts agricultural sewage treatments and industrial activities were observed near these study sites on the contrary sites 1 2 4 and 5 classified as good showed lower trace elements concentrations these results although preliminary seem to support the ability of macrobenthic invertebrates to accumulate trace elements in their tissues reflecting the level of pollution in watercourses site 3 located near farming areas had the highest amount of as co mn and se content arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the earth s crust and is present as inorganic and organic arsenic less toxic soils contain some amount of arsenic but significantly high amounts can result from the presence of mining waste pesticides or wastewater sludge punshon et al 2017 the value noted for site 3 1 3mgkg 1 table 4 could be related to the application of phosphate fertilizer or pesticides in crops growing near the sampling site manganese is one of the most abundant trace elements in soils where it occurs as oxides and hydroxides and in water as small particles the principal anthropogenic sources are industrial activities use of fossil fuels and pesticides some aquatic freshwater organisms like diatoms accumulate this element kazumi et al 1987 cobalt is an essential trace element widely distributed in nature in many different chemical forms it usually occurs in association with other metals like arsenic and manganese this latter element is a component of many rock types particularly those of metamorphic and sedimentary origin and it is used in industrial processes the primary source seems to be domestic wastewater nriagu and pacyna 1988 in our study the high values of co and mn are probably related to the use of fertilizers or pesticides too since they are widely used in the nutrient management of crops uchida 2000 selenium is an essential trace element that is released from some mining waste rock through precipitation and flows into water systems the high content of se at site 3 table 4 4 6mgkg 1 could be related to the use of fertilizers that contain sodium selenite a chemical for crop bio fortification and as a food or feed fortifier to mitigate selenium deficiency in humans and livestock irmak 2017 site 4 had the highest ni concentration table 4 nickel is widely distributed in the environment and is one of the five most common elements on the earth it finds use in many industrial and commercial processes cempel and nikel 2006 the value 3 6mgkg 1 we detected is probably related to the presence of a town near the sampling site since environmental pollution with nickel is caused by transport industry increasing consumption of liquid and solid fuels as well as municipal and industrial waste harasim and filipek 2015 site 2 had the highest value of cd 0 53mgkg 1 and tl 0 11mgkg 1 as compared to the other sites cadmium is a non essential rare element distributed in the most abundant rocks of the earth s crust the most common source of cd in industry is in the production of nickel cadmium rechargeable batteries solar cells and pigments a portion of the cd discharged into freshwater is adsorbed into solids in suspension but only the soluble forms are toxic to biota pereira et al 2015 thallium is widely dispersed in potassium minerals since it is partially water soluble it can spread with groundwater when soils contain large amounts of the element it is considered toxic even at very low concentrations and is generally present at very low concentrations in polluted areas e g proximity of power plants cement factories smelting works wastes from mining activities however it may reach much higher levels karbowska 2016 site 6 table 4 had the highest concentration of be cr fe mo pb sb sn v and zn the concentration of four trace elements cr 6 2mgkg 1 pb 7 1mgkg 1 sn 0 81mgkg 1 and zn 155 77mgkg 1 in particular reflects the presence of industrial activities and sewage treatment chromium occurs in the environment primarily in two valence states trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr iv soil contaminated by textile factory effluents has also been found to contain high concentrations of cr jaishankar et al 2014 lead is a non essential element found in small amounts in the earth s crust the main sources of pb come from human activities lead is still used in a wide variety of products including paint gasoline batteries and cosmetics in freshwater environments lead primarily exists as the divalent cation pb2 under acidic conditions and forms lead carbonate pbco3 and hydroxide pb oh 2 under alkaline conditions natural processes tend to remove lead from the water and deposit it in sediments where it becomes available to aquatic organisms thornton et al 2001 lead can move from one place to another in waterways as soluble complexes and ions its transport is largely controlled by the exchange of lead with sediments and the nature and size of the particles in surface waters the average residence times of biological particles containing lead have been estimated at 2 5 years unep 2010 the long term route of lead is from rivers to estuaries to oceans tin occurs naturally in small amounts in the earth s crust at a concentration of approximately 2 3ppm budavari 2001 tin compounds are found in both inorganic and organic forms in various environmental media and can be released into the environment from natural and anthropogenic sources including agriculture it is released during smelting and refining processes industrial processing of tin waste incineration and burning of fossil fuels byrd and andreae 1986 who 1980 senesil et al 1999 it is also used in agriculture as a pesticide in the form of triphenyltin in general organotin compounds are released into water from anthropogenic sources however methyltin compounds can be produced in the environment by biomethylation of inorganic tin and can occur naturally fent 1996 zinc is a very common substance that occurs naturally being one of the most abundant elements in the earth s crust watercourses can contain certain amounts of zinc which may be higher in the vicinity of industrial sources or toxic waste sites mason 1996 in our case as reported in the site s descriptions the presence of several sewage treatment plants industrial included has caused the increase of this element furthermore zinc polluted sludge could accumulate in the river banks putting it back in water when the river is in flood li 2014 finally the highest value of cu was at site 5 the use of copper to kill algae fungi and molluscs demonstrates that it is highly toxic to aquatic organisms copper is in fact one of the most toxic metals to aquatic organisms and ecosystems this is just one of the reasons why environmentally sensitive mining practices are so important the most bioavailable and therefore most toxic form of copper is the cupric ion cu2 copper is moderately soluble in water and binds easily to sediments and organic matter copper concentration is particularly high in organisms in the sediments at the bottom of a water body 3 4 correlation between macrobenthic invertebrates and trace elements bioaccumulation refers to how contaminants enter the food web and consequently in the biological tissues of aquatic organisms from different sources such as water food and particles of suspended sediment wang and fisher 1998 the dynamic processes of bioaccumulation are important in the evaluation of chemical risks radomyski et al 2017 and to protect human beings and other organisms from the effects of metal exposure blowes et al 2003 a wide range of aquatic organisms e g phytoplankton invertebrates and fish has been used in bioaccumulation studies as have freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates but to a lesser extent macrobenthic invertebrates can accumulate trace elements at concentrations that depend on those present in the aquatic environment hare et al 1991 diet seems to be the predominant form of trace elements exposure poteat and buchwalter 2014 rather than direct aqueous exposure xie et al 2010 diptera and ephemeroptera are the most extensively investigated orders while odonata and decapoda have been less studied in our study spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ s between macrobenthic invertebrate density and trace elements level is presented in table 5 for families and genera for which analyses were possible the genus calopteryx odonata predator was positively correlated with be cr fe mn mo ni sn and v ρ s range 0 777 0 844 positive correlations were also determined for the genus rhyacophila trichoptera predator with cu ρ s 0 757 the ffg predators seem to have the strongest correlation with the detected trace elements suggesting bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate tissue predators can accumulate trace elements at concentrations that depend on those in the environment hare et al 1991 though diet seems to be the predominant form of trace elements exposure poteat and buchwalter 2014 several factors influence how trace elements are transferred along the food chain depending on trace elements concentration in the water column sediment and prey tissues another aspect to consider is the way an organism detoxifies ingested metals which is related to prey species along with intrinsic prey and predator factors such as physiology digestion process and assimilation rates for example ephemeroptera of the genus caenis collector gatherers were positively correlated with be fe mn pb sb and v ρ s range 0 757 0 802 suggesting that ingestion of sediment or substratum is the most effective uptake of these metals santoro et al 2009 studied the occurrence of toxic heavy metals as cd cr cu pb and zn in collector gatherers and found that the biological uptake of these metals from contact with the sediment is the most effective biological sequestering pathway indeed aquatic sediment is the major sink for trace elements especially for heavy metals chen et al 1996 and collector gatherers can move into sediment and collect smaller particles of organic matter coming in contact with polluted substrates differences between trace elements concentration in predators and collector gatherers could be related to a lower trace elements concentration in invertebrates eaten by predators as compared to those found in detritus or in scraped periphyton kim et al 2012 this latter category is also a major sink for trace elements in aquatic environments cain et al 2011 martin et al 2007 xie et al 2010 xie and buchwalter 2011 kiffney and clements 1993 and goodyear and mcneill 1999 showed that the correlation between internal and external zn and cu concentration is greater in collector gatherers and scraper grazers than in predators indicating that predators regulate their internal metal concentration for example bossuyt and janssen 2005 and taylor et al 2016 reported that daphnia magna has a greater ability to regulate aqueous copper than algae another influential factor is body size which can contribute to metal uptake predators with a higher body mass surface ratio can accumulate less metals than those with a lower one kiffney and clements 1996 liess et al 2017 we found negative correlations between heptageniidae ephemeroptera scrapers and cr and ni athericidae diptera predators and mo simuliidae diptera collector filterers and co and rhyacophila and mn table 5 these results are probably related to accumulation and subsequent excretion in macroinvertebrates as well as the availability of these elements in different compartments of the aquatic environment sediment detritus or periphyton furthermore aquatic invertebrates could excrete the metals or retains these in the releasing tissues in function of the seedlings during their larval development for these reasons further studies are needed to better clarify the trace elements cycles in these organisms 4 conclusions water pollution has been a problem of major concern and originates from different sources as agricultural industrial and landfills drainage waters these pollutants once entered into the water are very deleterious to the natural ecosystems also for humans some aquatic plants and also terrestrial plants have high capacity for the phytofiltration of heavy metals from the streams sharma et al 2015 xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 nevertheless this technique has some weak aspects that includes a long time for the removal of contaminants producing a large amount of contaminated phytomass disposal of which is still a problem thus more experimental works are needed to understand the use and implementation of phytoremediation in natural ecosystems different land use forms affect the river ecosystems through loading of suspended solids nutrients metals and acidifying substances for example the riverbank filtration rbf has the advantage of removing or attenuating certain heavy metals bourg and bertin 1993 and the high content in trace elements in site 6 could be also related to the alterations of the riverbanks thus compromising the performance of rbf system promoting the maintenance of the natural conditions and an ecologically sustainable land use of watercourses are definitely the best way to control water pollution this study showed that trace elements detection in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is a useful analysis for obtaining information about the status of freshwater courses our results are in line with the ecological status defined by the wfd the detection of trace elements in macrobenthic communities can provide a valid support to improve the analyses required by the wfd especially in altered and polluted streams where monitoring of the movement and the bioavailability of pollutants is fundamental our study provides evidence for a greater accumulation of trace elements in predators and collector gatherers suggesting that the tropic level of macrobenthic communities influence the accumulation of trace elements conflict of interest none declared ethical

1115,trace elements are common contaminants in aquatic ecosystems their detection in biota yields information on their availability in the environment and provides an indirect indication of freshwater ecological status we analyzed samples of freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates from six watercourses in friuli venezia giulia northeast italy to verify whether trace elements accumulation is related to their ecological status sensu water framework directive wfd and to determine tropic level influences on the accumulation of 18 trace elements in macrobenthic communities observed concentrations could be in line with results of ecological status assessment defined by the wfd in fact two sites classified as moderate had the highest trace elements content the genus calopteryx odonata predator was positively correlated with be cr fe mn mo ni sn and v ρ s range 0 777 0 844 positive correlations were also determined for the genus rhyacophila trichoptera predator with cu ρ s 0 757 suggesting bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate tissue ephemeroptera of the genus caenis collector gatherers were positively correlated with be fe mn pb sb and v ρ s range 0 757 0 802 indicating that ingestion of sediment is the most effective uptake of these metals results of this study albeit preliminary showed that trace elements detection in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is a useful analysis for obtaining information about the status of freshwater course our study provides evidence for a greater accumulation of trace elements in predators and collector gatherers suggesting that the tropic level of macrobenthic communities influence the accumulation of trace elements keywords trace elements macrobenthic invertebrates functional feeding guilds water framework directive 1 introduction trace elements contamination of freshwater and marine ecosystems is a widespread environmental issue monitoring of these contaminants is often based on their detection in the water column the suspended particulate matter and the sediment bervoets et al 2016 haus et al 2007 loos et al 2008 such analyses define only the temporary state of pollution however without considering the effective bioavailability of trace elements which is often influenced by biotic i e trophic level and abiotic i e water temperature ph conductivity or water hardness factors analysis of the sediment or the water column is insufficient to explain the medium and long term effects of contamination on aquatic communities detection of trace elements in aquatic organisms is a valid tool to evaluate the real contaminant bioavailability and could allow indirect assessment of ecological water quality macrobenthic invertebrates are of pivotal importance in aquatic ecosystems as they cover all trophic functions cummins 1974 metcalfe smith 1994 and are trophic resources for many species of fish and birds pizzul et al 2008 however information about trace elements accumulation in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is limited beasley and kneale 2003 goodyear and mcneill 1999 santoro et al 2009 solà et al 2004 and only data regarding few taxa or trace elements are available for example anderson 1977 for the first time detected the concentrations of cadmium copper lead and zinc in the fox river illinois and wisconsin using freshwater macroinvertebrates burrows and whitton 1983 studied the concentration of heavy metals in invertebrate from metal contaminated river and showed how mayflies tended to concentrate zn cd and pb to higher levels than other groups cain et al 1992 recorded differences in trace elements accumulation among aquatic insects taxa due to hydrogeochemical and biological factors colborn 1982 used aquatic insects to measure the levels of molybdenum in the environment jop and wojtan 1982 detected the concentrations of cadmium and lead in the body of some invertebrate species from five streams of southern poland and showed that the concentrations of metals decreased with increasing age in all species and that the relationship of metals concentration in aquatic invertebrates were not consistent with the degree of contamination in streams krantzberg and stokes 1988 reported the importance of surface adsorption and ph in metals accumulation by chironomids saiki et al 1995 evaluated the copper cadmium and zinc concentrations in aquatic food chains also using aquatic insects smock 1983 examined the influence of organism size on whole body metal concentrations of eight trace elements in aquatic insects and an exponential decrease in concentration with increasing organism size was observed for certain trace elements co cr fe sb and sc moreover unlike other organisms such as fish authman et al 2015 fatima and usmani 2013 luczyńska et al 2018 squadrone et al 2013 2016a 2016b aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates are seldom used as matrix to evaluate chemical pollution in inland freshwater even though they are widely used in biomonitoring practices indeed numerous taxa goodyear and mcneill 1999 hare 1992 hare and campbell 1992 lynch et al 1988 myslinski and ginsburg 1977 are largely ubiquitous in freshwaters are fairly sedentary and representative of local pollution are benthic and closely associated with the sediment are tolerant to low moderate metal concentrations and can accumulate rather high levels of contaminants are long lived organisms with life cycles sufficiently long and diversified to provide integrated information about local disturbances have immature stages of the life cycle which is why body metal concentrations are not affected by sexual differences or reproductive cycles have an energy input for aquatic vertebrates fish or birds as such they can represent one of the first trace elements inputs of metal contamination in food webs for these reasons aquatic macroinvertebrates have become an important element of biological quality eqb to assess freshwater ecological status as required by the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec european commission 2000 macrobenthic invertebrate communities include species with diverse sensitivity to contaminants and have been used to evaluate the ecological impact of metal contamination in streams augustine and selunathi 2018 bian et al 2016 burgess 2015 hickey and clements 1998 kiffney and clements 1996 maret et al 2003 trace elements contamination can reduce the density species richness growth and production of macrobenthic species gray and delaney 2008 maret et al 2003 the accumulation of these contaminants in aquatic organisms is influenced by processes that vary among species and results from metal input and output by the organism which closely depend on its morphology kiffney and clements 1993 physiology hare 1992 and the metals distribution in cells luoma 1989 therefore metal bioaccumulation depends on the species hare 1992 and the tropic level moreover macrobenthic invertebrates have been categorized into functional feeding guilds ffg cummins 1973 merritt and cummins 2006 that can be used to describe their role in the food web shredders process coarse particulate organic matter cpom collectors filter and collect smaller particles of organic matter fpom found in the water column and benthic sediments as a result of cpom being broken down by shredder species grazers found on rocks and woody debris feed on periphyton detritus and submerged aquatic plants and finally predators prey on animal tissue the literature on trace elements accumulation in freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates is focused especially on few heavy metals cu pb while the accumulation of other elements as al fe hg mn ni and zn is studied less often and very little data exist for co li na mo and sb goodyear and mcneill 1999 with this study we sampled aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates from six watercourses in friuli venezia giulia northeast italy with the aim to 1 verify whether trace elements accumulation is related to their ecological status sensu water framework directive 2 detect the tropic level influence on the accumulation of 18 trace elements as be cd co cr cu fe hg mn mo ni pb sb se sn tl v zn in macrobenthic invertebrate communities the choice of these elements was dictated by the necessity to improve the knowledge of inorganic contaminants in macrobenthic invertebrate communities considering that data are available for only few trace elements or certain heavy metals as presented above and in our opinion these groups of organisms could reflect inorganic contamination in freshwater 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hydrological system of friuli venezia giulia is highly diversified with the presence of torrential streams alluvial watercourses and rivers the territory could be roughly divided in three zones an alpine prealpine area a high plain area with wide alluvial fans and coarse grain sediments allowing water underflow and a lowland area south of a zone where sediment grain becomes finer so called resurgence line and numerous alluvial spring watercourses originate mosetti 1983 for this study six sampling sites subject to different impact sources were chosen fig 1 table 1 the pusala creek site 1 is a small watercourse with alternating natural and much altered stretches sections of artificial riverbed devoid of bank vegetation in addition farmlands natural woodlands and industrial areas are present in the territory near the sampling site the cosa stream site site 2 is located downstream of a fish farm and ditches where stretches of the watercourse were diverted for hydropower purposes due to these impacts distribution of the riverbed microhabitat is altered as a consequence of variation in the watercourse charge there is a small town upstream of the sampling site but the area is lowly anthropized two sampling sites were located on cormor stream at the first site 3 the stream is categorized as a natural intermittent watercourse due to its sediment nature the area is characterized by intensive farming and bank vegetation is reduced the site on the natisone river site 4 is located within an anthropized area towns while the molini ditch site 5 is located in an urbanized context with intensive farming and agricultural activities finally the ecological status of the second cormor stream site site 6 is altered due to major alterations of the riverbed floodway rectification weirs and the watercourse is classified as intermittent despite the inflow of water from other watercourses where sewage treatment plants are present table 2 presents the values of the main chemical and physical features and the ecological status of each sampling site data performed provided by the regional agency for environmental protection of friuli venezia giulia arpa fvg 2015 2 2 macrobenthic invertebrate sampling macrobenthic invertebrates were collected with the collaboration of the arpa fvg using a standardized multihabitat sampling protocol for ecological status assessment buffagni et al 2014 in agreement with the requirements of european wfd and italian laws d lgs 152 2006 d m 260 2010 at each site sampling was performed in a wadable stretch considered representative of the hydrological characteristics of the watercourse each sampling site comprised a 50 m stretch of the stream surber nets were used subtended area of 0 1m2 and 0 05m2 for the sites within her 02 calcareous southern alps and dolomites and her 06 po plain respectively the nets were 1 5m long with a mesh size of 500μm placing them on different microhabitats proportionally to their occurrence 10 replicates were collected at each site bertoli et al 2014 buffagni et al 2014 sorting operations and taxonomical identification were performed mainly on the field due to the small size of some organisms individuals belonging to the orders diptera plecoptera and to the class oligochaeta were identified in laboratory using a stereomicroscope wild m3 to compose a picture of the community structure all taxa were recorded and their abundance was estimated as described in buffagni et al 2014 six hester dendy artificial substrates were used for sampling operations at site 6 due to the high flow rate and depth bertoli et al 2014 buffagni et al 2007 and according to sampling protocols reported for non wadable streams artificial substrates were built with 10 hardboard plates separated by rubber rings and groups of five substrates constituted a sampling unit total area of 0 5m2 sampling units were placed in the non wadable stream sections and suspended at a depth of 0 5 1 5m by ropes secured to trees or artificial structures and secured to the stream bottom using bricks substrates were collected after 30 days of submersion the plates were cleaned of organisms and other material and the resulting samples were sieved with a 500 μm mesh sieve sorting and taxonomical identification were conducted as for the multihabitat samples most abundant taxa were then chosen to investigate the trace elements concentration in the macrobenthic invertebrate communities groups with n 1 or present only in a single replicate were considered rare bazzanti et al 2010 and excluded from the trace elements sample samples for trace elements detection were immediately frozen after identification brought to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until further analyses samples from each site were oven dried at 70 c for 72h or until constant weight to obtain dry weight dw 0 1mg and then used for trace elements determination feeding functional groups ffg were assigned to each taxon as described in merritt and cummins 2006 2 3 detection of trace elements the samples were divided into two aliquots one for hg quantification on a direct mercury analyzer dma 80 analyzer milestone shelton ct usa and the other for detecting all the other trace elements by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms xseries ii thermo scientific bremen germany the direct mercury analyzer performs thermal decomposition catalytic reduction amalgamation desorption and atomic absorption spectroscopy without the need to pre treat the samples the samples were then directly weighed on graphite shuttles and processed for hg content determination of as be cd co cr cu fe hg mn mo ni pb sb se sn tl v and zn was performed following previously described protocols squadrone et al 2016a multi elemental determination was performed by means of icp ms after daily optimization of instrumental parameters and using an external standard calibration curve analytical performance was verified by processing certified reference materials oyster tissue srm 1566b from the national institute of standard and technology along with blank reagents in each analytical session the limit of quantification loq was 0 010mgkg 1 for each element 2 4 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ s was used to test for correlations between measured trace elements concentration and macrobenthic invertebrate density ind m 2 for the main taxa families genera identified in the six samples used for trace elements determination of each sampling site spearman s rank correlation coefficient was also used to check for relationship between densities of the same taxa and values of the main chemical and physical parameters measured at each sampling site analyses were carried out using statsoft statistica 7 1 statsoft 2005 a p level of 0 05 was set for all tests to interpret significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characterization of water for all six sample sites ph ranged between 8 2 and 8 5 except for site 5 where it was 7 9 oxygen saturation was 100 and 101 for sites 1 and 3 respectively and ranged between 92 and 96 for sites 2 4 5 and 6 conductivity was highest for sites 3 and 6 541μscm 1 and 454μscm 1 respectively phosphate concentration was 0 070mgl 1 for all sites nitrate concentration was 1 0mgl 1 for sites 1 2 4 and 6 and much higher for sites 3 and 5 3 25mgl 1 and 1 3mgl 1 respectively ammonium concentration was 0 03mgl 1 for all sites except for sites 5 1 01mgl 1 and 6 0 05mgl 1 there is a large body of literature on the relationship between hydrochemistry and macrobenthic community composition in streams clarke and scruton 1997 and von fumetti et al 2017 reported that population density and diversity showed no patterns regarding stream acidity ph or density and that the diversity of macroinvertebrates was not related to any of the principal environmental parameters they investigated in contrast other authors graça et al 2004 niba and sakwe 2018 found a correlation between nutrients water ph temperature conductivity and richness of microbenthic communities since the ph oxygen saturation phosphate ammonium and nitrate levels were within the limits specified by law 152 2006 for italian water courses for the purposes of the present study we considered the effect of these parameters on macrobenthic communities to be less important and not influential for the accumulation of trace elements moreover application of the spearman s rank correlation coefficient did not allow to highlight relationships between the observed taxa and values of the main chemical and physical parameters of note is that the values of conductivity at sites 3 and 6 were higher compared to the other sites conductivity is known to increase as the ion concentration increases conductivity increases with water dissolved ionic species an increase or decrease in conductivity in a watercourse can indicate pollution agricultural runoff or a sewage leak could increase conductivity due to the additional chloride phosphate and nitrate ions an addition of other organic compounds would decrease conductivity as these elements do not break down into ions in both cases the additional dissolved solids will have a negative impact on water quality wetzel 2001 this was confirmed by the total content mgkg 1 of the trace elements detected in macrobenthic invertebrates at these two sites and corroborated our hypothesis that these groups of organisms could reflect inorganic contamination in freshwater see section 3 3 3 2 macrobenthic invertebrate communities a total of 7518 individuals were identified 5970 of which were insects their composition in the communities is shown in fig 2 insects class hexapoda made up the most abundant invertebrate group percentage frequency range 76 05 99 66 fig 2a at all sampling sites except at site 5 where they accounted for 23 10 of the samples the class malacostraca was the second most abundant taxon with a percentage frequency between 11 50 and 20 20 again except for site 5 where they were the most abundant group 64 71 and site 6 where the percentage frequency was lower than for the other sites 1 53 except for oligochaeta at site 5 11 64 the percentage frequency of other taxa was generally 5 the percentage frequency of ephemeroptera ranged between 18 18 site 4 and 79 80 site 6 with the genera baetis caenis and ephemerella and families heptageniidae and leptophlebiidae the percentage frequency of diptera was between 19 59 and 78 21 except at site 6 6 80 and was generally represented by the athericidae chironomidae and simuliidae families fig 2b the percentage frequency of other orders was usually 5 observed communities were generally well structured number of families ranging between 19 site 4 and 30 site 2 at sites 1 2 3 and 4 close to the expected number n 26 27 for the investigated watercourse types indicated by the italian law currently in force dm 260 2010 number of observed families was lower than the expected values n 29 on site 5 18 and especially in site 6 16 in particular the latter site is affected by impacts such as riverbed alteration and water discharge from sewage treatment plants located in little tributaries upstream of the sampling site arpa fvg 2015 both sensitive and tolerant taxa were observed heptageniidae is generally considered a good water quality indicator belfiore 1983 campaioli et al 1994 siligardi et al 2007 such as the trichopteran rhyacophila which inhabits well oxygenated environments moretti 1983 campaioli et al 1999 and represents the main genus of the rhiacophilidae family morse 2009 coppa et al 2012 and the only genus present in europe moretti 1983 among the tolerant taxa hydropsychidae is one of the most frequent trichoptera family which could inhabit altered environments and tolerate both organic moretti 1983 campaioli et al 1999 and trace elements pollution solà et al 2004 baetis is the most widespread ephemeroptera genus within watercourses belfiore 1983 sansoni 1988 the most abundant taxa included also the family elmidae order coleoptera genera leuctra and protonemura order plecoptera and the malacostraca families asellidae and gammaridae which were all considered for metal trace analyses in particular gammaridae were the most abundant malacostraca observed especially in site 5 these organisms generally inhabit middle and low sections of watercourses and are related to the presence of algae and macrophytes campaioli et al 1994 siligardi et al 2007 which were abundant in the site 5 finally the order odonata genera calopterix and onychogomphus were considered due to their size consistent biomass at the sampling sites table 3 and especially due to their trophic role as predators despite their lower density in comparison to other orders in fact odonata larvae seem to be good organisms to detect iron manganese zinc and cadmium in the environment corbi and froehlich 2010 and good indicators for metal pollution corbi and froehlich 2010 corbi and trivinh strixino 2008 fig 3 presents the observed frequencies of functional feeding groups ffg collector gatherers were the most frequent 21 30 81 00 and were dominant at site 5 collector filterers were most frequent at sites 4 64 64 and 1 43 96 but were generally less abundant at the other sites range 1 53 8 98 shredders were the most abundant ffg at site 5 64 89 range between 1 30 and 25 17 at the other sites the percentage frequency of scrapers was between 2 26 and 21 25 finally predators were the least abundant ffg percentage frequency between 1 18 and 8 86 3 3 trace elements in sampling sites and in macrobenthic invertebrates table 3 presents the biomass used for trace elements concentration measurements the trends of trace elements concentrations in macrobenthic invertebrates are shown in fig 4 the concentrations are reported in table 4 the total metal concentration by order of amount was site 6 2100 65 site 3 1979 56 site 4 1252 64 site 1 622 52 site 2 536 27 site 5 517 87 mgkg 1 it can be observed that the content of total trace elements was higher for samples from sites 3 and 6 compared to other sites 1 2 4 and 5 observed concentrations could be in line with results of ecological status assessment arpa fvg 2015 defined by the wfd that assigns the class moderate to sites 3 and 6 in fact several anthropogenic impacts agricultural sewage treatments and industrial activities were observed near these study sites on the contrary sites 1 2 4 and 5 classified as good showed lower trace elements concentrations these results although preliminary seem to support the ability of macrobenthic invertebrates to accumulate trace elements in their tissues reflecting the level of pollution in watercourses site 3 located near farming areas had the highest amount of as co mn and se content arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the earth s crust and is present as inorganic and organic arsenic less toxic soils contain some amount of arsenic but significantly high amounts can result from the presence of mining waste pesticides or wastewater sludge punshon et al 2017 the value noted for site 3 1 3mgkg 1 table 4 could be related to the application of phosphate fertilizer or pesticides in crops growing near the sampling site manganese is one of the most abundant trace elements in soils where it occurs as oxides and hydroxides and in water as small particles the principal anthropogenic sources are industrial activities use of fossil fuels and pesticides some aquatic freshwater organisms like diatoms accumulate this element kazumi et al 1987 cobalt is an essential trace element widely distributed in nature in many different chemical forms it usually occurs in association with other metals like arsenic and manganese this latter element is a component of many rock types particularly those of metamorphic and sedimentary origin and it is used in industrial processes the primary source seems to be domestic wastewater nriagu and pacyna 1988 in our study the high values of co and mn are probably related to the use of fertilizers or pesticides too since they are widely used in the nutrient management of crops uchida 2000 selenium is an essential trace element that is released from some mining waste rock through precipitation and flows into water systems the high content of se at site 3 table 4 4 6mgkg 1 could be related to the use of fertilizers that contain sodium selenite a chemical for crop bio fortification and as a food or feed fortifier to mitigate selenium deficiency in humans and livestock irmak 2017 site 4 had the highest ni concentration table 4 nickel is widely distributed in the environment and is one of the five most common elements on the earth it finds use in many industrial and commercial processes cempel and nikel 2006 the value 3 6mgkg 1 we detected is probably related to the presence of a town near the sampling site since environmental pollution with nickel is caused by transport industry increasing consumption of liquid and solid fuels as well as municipal and industrial waste harasim and filipek 2015 site 2 had the highest value of cd 0 53mgkg 1 and tl 0 11mgkg 1 as compared to the other sites cadmium is a non essential rare element distributed in the most abundant rocks of the earth s crust the most common source of cd in industry is in the production of nickel cadmium rechargeable batteries solar cells and pigments a portion of the cd discharged into freshwater is adsorbed into solids in suspension but only the soluble forms are toxic to biota pereira et al 2015 thallium is widely dispersed in potassium minerals since it is partially water soluble it can spread with groundwater when soils contain large amounts of the element it is considered toxic even at very low concentrations and is generally present at very low concentrations in polluted areas e g proximity of power plants cement factories smelting works wastes from mining activities however it may reach much higher levels karbowska 2016 site 6 table 4 had the highest concentration of be cr fe mo pb sb sn v and zn the concentration of four trace elements cr 6 2mgkg 1 pb 7 1mgkg 1 sn 0 81mgkg 1 and zn 155 77mgkg 1 in particular reflects the presence of industrial activities and sewage treatment chromium occurs in the environment primarily in two valence states trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr iv soil contaminated by textile factory effluents has also been found to contain high concentrations of cr jaishankar et al 2014 lead is a non essential element found in small amounts in the earth s crust the main sources of pb come from human activities lead is still used in a wide variety of products including paint gasoline batteries and cosmetics in freshwater environments lead primarily exists as the divalent cation pb2 under acidic conditions and forms lead carbonate pbco3 and hydroxide pb oh 2 under alkaline conditions natural processes tend to remove lead from the water and deposit it in sediments where it becomes available to aquatic organisms thornton et al 2001 lead can move from one place to another in waterways as soluble complexes and ions its transport is largely controlled by the exchange of lead with sediments and the nature and size of the particles in surface waters the average residence times of biological particles containing lead have been estimated at 2 5 years unep 2010 the long term route of lead is from rivers to estuaries to oceans tin occurs naturally in small amounts in the earth s crust at a concentration of approximately 2 3ppm budavari 2001 tin compounds are found in both inorganic and organic forms in various environmental media and can be released into the environment from natural and anthropogenic sources including agriculture it is released during smelting and refining processes industrial processing of tin waste incineration and burning of fossil fuels byrd and andreae 1986 who 1980 senesil et al 1999 it is also used in agriculture as a pesticide in the form of triphenyltin in general organotin compounds are released into water from anthropogenic sources however methyltin compounds can be produced in the environment by biomethylation of inorganic tin and can occur naturally fent 1996 zinc is a very common substance that occurs naturally being one of the most abundant elements in the earth s crust watercourses can contain certain amounts of zinc which may be higher in the vicinity of industrial sources or toxic waste sites mason 1996 in our case as reported in the site s descriptions the presence of several sewage treatment plants industrial included has caused the increase of this element furthermore zinc polluted sludge could accumulate in the river banks putting it back in water when the river is in flood li 2014 finally the highest value of cu was at site 5 the use of copper to kill algae fungi and molluscs demonstrates that it is highly toxic to aquatic organisms copper is in fact one of the most toxic metals to aquatic organisms and ecosystems this is just one of the reasons why environmentally sensitive mining practices are so important the most bioavailable and therefore most toxic form of copper is the cupric ion cu2 copper is moderately soluble in water and binds easily to sediments and organic matter copper concentration is particularly high in organisms in the sediments at the bottom of a water body 3 4 correlation between macrobenthic invertebrates and trace elements bioaccumulation refers to how contaminants enter the food web and consequently in the biological tissues of aquatic organisms from different sources such as water food and particles of suspended sediment wang and fisher 1998 the dynamic processes of bioaccumulation are important in the evaluation of chemical risks radomyski et al 2017 and to protect human beings and other organisms from the effects of metal exposure blowes et al 2003 a wide range of aquatic organisms e g phytoplankton invertebrates and fish has been used in bioaccumulation studies as have freshwater macrobenthic invertebrates but to a lesser extent macrobenthic invertebrates can accumulate trace elements at concentrations that depend on those present in the aquatic environment hare et al 1991 diet seems to be the predominant form of trace elements exposure poteat and buchwalter 2014 rather than direct aqueous exposure xie et al 2010 diptera and ephemeroptera are the most extensively investigated orders while odonata and decapoda have been less studied in our study spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ s between macrobenthic invertebrate density and trace elements level is presented in table 5 for families and genera for which analyses were possible the genus calopteryx odonata predator was positively correlated with be cr fe mn mo ni sn and v ρ s range 0 777 0 844 positive correlations were also determined for the genus rhyacophila trichoptera predator with cu ρ s 0 757 the ffg predators seem to have the strongest correlation with the detected trace elements suggesting bioaccumulation in macroinvertebrate tissue predators can accumulate trace elements at concentrations that depend on those in the environment hare et al 1991 though diet seems to be the predominant form of trace elements exposure poteat and buchwalter 2014 several factors influence how trace elements are transferred along the food chain depending on trace elements concentration in the water column sediment and prey tissues another aspect to consider is the way an organism detoxifies ingested metals which is related to prey species along with intrinsic prey and predator factors such as physiology digestion process and assimilation rates for example ephemeroptera of the genus caenis collector gatherers were positively correlated with be fe mn pb sb and v ρ s range 0 757 0 802 suggesting that ingestion of sediment or substratum is the most effective uptake of these metals santoro et al 2009 studied the occurrence of toxic heavy metals as cd cr cu pb and zn in collector gatherers and found that the biological uptake of these metals from contact with the sediment is the most effective biological sequestering pathway indeed aquatic sediment is the major sink for trace elements especially for heavy metals chen et al 1996 and collector gatherers can move into sediment and collect smaller particles of organic matter coming in contact with polluted substrates differences between trace elements concentration in predators and collector gatherers could be related to a lower trace elements concentration in invertebrates eaten by predators as compared to those found in detritus or in scraped periphyton kim et al 2012 this latter category is also a major sink for trace elements in aquatic environments cain et al 2011 martin et al 2007 xie et al 2010 xie and buchwalter 2011 kiffney and clements 1993 and goodyear and mcneill 1999 showed that the correlation between internal and external zn and cu concentration is greater in collector gatherers and scraper grazers than in predators indicating that predators regulate their internal metal concentration for example bossuyt and janssen 2005 and taylor et al 2016 reported that daphnia magna has a greater ability to regulate aqueous copper than algae another influential factor is body size which can contribute to metal uptake predators with a higher body mass surface ratio can accumulate less metals than those with a lower one kiffney and clements 1996 liess et al 2017 we found negative correlations between heptageniidae ephemeroptera scrapers and cr and ni athericidae diptera predators and mo simuliidae diptera collector filterers and co and rhyacophila and mn table 5 these results are probably related to accumulation and subsequent excretion in macroinvertebrates as well as the availability of these elements in different compartments of the aquatic environment sediment detritus or periphyton furthermore aquatic invertebrates could excrete the metals or retains these in the releasing tissues in function of the seedlings during their larval development for these reasons further studies are needed to better clarify the trace elements cycles in these organisms 4 conclusions water pollution has been a problem of major concern and originates from different sources as agricultural industrial and landfills drainage waters these pollutants once entered into the water are very deleterious to the natural ecosystems also for humans some aquatic plants and also terrestrial plants have high capacity for the phytofiltration of heavy metals from the streams sharma et al 2015 xie et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 nevertheless this technique has some weak aspects that includes a long time for the removal of contaminants producing a large amount of contaminated phytomass disposal of which is still a problem thus more experimental works are needed to understand the use and implementation of phytoremediation in natural ecosystems different land use forms affect the river ecosystems through loading of suspended solids nutrients metals and acidifying substances for example the riverbank filtration rbf has the advantage of removing or attenuating certain heavy metals bourg and bertin 1993 and the high content in trace elements in site 6 could be also related to the alterations of the riverbanks thus compromising the performance of rbf system promoting the maintenance of the natural conditions and an ecologically sustainable land use of watercourses are definitely the best way to control water pollution this study showed that trace elements detection in aquatic macrobenthic invertebrates is a useful analysis for obtaining information about the status of freshwater courses our results are in line with the ecological status defined by the wfd the detection of trace elements in macrobenthic communities can provide a valid support to improve the analyses required by the wfd especially in altered and polluted streams where monitoring of the movement and the bioavailability of pollutants is fundamental our study provides evidence for a greater accumulation of trace elements in predators and collector gatherers suggesting that the tropic level of macrobenthic communities influence the accumulation of trace elements conflict of interest none declared ethical

1116,in the context of climate changes detailed information concerning the response of different components of the environment to the observed situation is of high importance due to strong correlations of air and water temperatures water ecosystems have been subject to a considerable transformation for several decades the paper presents the analysis of long term 1960 2009 water temperature fluctuations in the warta river third longest river in poland based on six stations located along the bank of the warta river its thermal parameters and tendencies and rate of changes were determined moreover based on data concerning air temperature correlations between those two media were analysed water temperature in the warta river over the last fifty years was characterised by low variability ranging in the analysed stations from 9 5 c in sieradz to 10 3 c in poznan and skwierzyna the mann kendall trend tests sen s slope estimator and the pettitt test were applied to long term time series of air and water temperature analysis long term fluctuations of mean annual water temperatures were characterised by an increase statistically significant depending on the station at a level of p 0 05 and p 0 001 from 0 096 to 0 281 c dec 1 water temperature in the case of the analysed stations appears to be particularly determined by climatic factors as suggested by very strong correlations with air temperature from 0 82 to 0 94 evident changes in the thermal regime of the warta river in the context of functioning of the entire ecosystem should be considered unfavourable the observed as well as future increase in water temperature will modify current processes occurring in the river referring to among others water quality composition of ichthyofauna or hydrological

abiotic variable modelling the chemical composition of both water and organisms in rivers and streams st hilaire et al 2012 changes in water temperature have important impacts on freshwater ecosystems such as changes in phenology and in species distribution the facilitation of species invasions and the deterioration of water quality for example through enhanced algal blooms moreover the increase in temperature may accelerate the process of water reservoir degradation sojka et al 2019 analysis of water temperature trends is important to determine future changes in river and lake water quality and to identify potential threats to aquatic ecosystems water temperature trend analysis can represent a reliable tool for decision makers by providing an overview of the potential threats on the aquatic ecosystem in addition the process of self purification of water depends on the water temperature therefore the quality standards of treated wastewater discharged into the water should be verified diamantini et al 2018 shows that positive trends of water temperature and negative of dissolved oxygen are correlated with upward trends of air temperatures the aquatic ecosystems of these rivers are therefore experiencing a reduction in oxygen which may exacerbate in the future given the projected further increase in temperature in this context detailed knowledge of thermal characteristics is an element to identify and interpret the processes and phenomena occurring in these ecosystems in addition information on this subject is important for human economic activity energy fishing fishery etc the transformation of thermal conditions of river waters is particularly important in the context of global warming the importance of thermal changes occurring in rivers is within a broad range of

et al 2017 skolasińska and nowak 2018 dysarz et al 2019 górski et al 2019 but the abundant literature shows lack of current knowledge concerning water temperature such a study in the context of dynamically occurring climate changes should be considered important for the functioning of the entire ecosystem moreover it is worth emphasising that research in the scope is undertaken in different regions of the world bartholow 2005 kvambekk and melvold 2010 beaufort et al 2013 usually pointing to an increase in water temperature in rivers one of the most effective statistical methods for determining long term changes in hydrology and climatology is the nonparametric mann kendall test burn and elnur 2002 the advantage of the mann kendall test is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the distribution of analysed variables and is therefore preferred over parametric tests hirsch et al 1991 in order to calculate the sign and magnitude of trends sen s slope estimator is preferred in literature sen 1968 sen s slope estimator is less sensitive to outliers not requiring that the variables have gaussian probability distribution finally the pettitt test was used to detect the changing point and then the dataset can be divided into two sub sequences pettitt 1979 the objective of the paper was the analysis of long term water temperature fluctuations in the warta river in the years 1960 2009 the analysis was performed based on data from six water gauge stations located along the river course in reference to maximum mean and minimum temperatures the obtained results were analysed in the context of long term air temperature fluctuations the following research hypotheses were stated directions and magnitude of water temperature fluctuations along the river course are the same in the scope of minimum mean and maximum values water and air temperature fluctuations show the same tendency values of water temperature fluctuations are higher than air temperature

particular water gauge stations in reference to the values of fluctuations of mean water temperatures the cluster analysis was applied ca it was performed by means of the ward method and square euclidean distance was applied as a measure of similarity water gauge stations characterised by the highest similarity of thermal parameters were designated by adopting the cut off criterion at a level of 66 100dlink dlink max 1 ptak et al 2018 for a complete description of water temperature fluctuations in particular water gauge stations their relative differences were calculated as the ratio of fluctuation of decade temperature to mean monthly temperature from the multiannual period 3 results and discussion water temperature in the warta river was characterised by low variability mean water temperatures from the multiannual period 1960 2009 in particular stations along the warta river ranged from 9 5 c in sieradz to 10 3 c in poznań and skwierzyna the greatest variability of mean annual water temperatures was observed in sieradz and the lowest in station bobry considering mean annual water temperatures in all six cases july was the warmest mean value for poznań and nowa wieś podgórna was 20 2 c and for station bobry 17 6 c and january the coldest mean value for station bobry 2 1 c for sieradz and nowa wieś podgórna 1 1 c the analysis of long term water temperature fluctuations in reference to months showed table 1 the lowest fluctuations in station bobry 2 4 and 0 for lt mt and ht respectively and the highest in station nowa wieś podgórna 6 7 and 5 for lt mt and ht respectively in the case of mean temperatures in stations sieradz and nowa wieś podgórna significant water temperature fluctuations were observed in seven months and in the case of station bobry only in two in stations sieradz nowa wieś podgórna and skwierzyna fluctuations occurred in the winter hydrological half year and in station gorzów wlkp fluctuations occurred more frequently in the summer hydrological half year fluctuations of mean temperatures usually occurred in january five times february may july and august four times and the most seldom in june september and november one time a somewhat different situation was observed in the scope of low temperatures fluctuations were observed more frequently in the summer hydrological half year the greatest fluctuations were observed in stations nowa wieś podgórna and poznań in six months and the lowest in station bobry and skwierzyna in two months fluctuations occurred more often in may six times and in january november and december no temperature fluctuations were recorded in the scope of high temperatures in seven months they were statistically significant in station sieradz and in station bobry no fluctuations were observed in any month fluctuations of maximum temperatures in the analysed multiannual period particularly occurred in january four times and no significant fluctuations were recorded in july and september in reference to hydrological years statistically significant fluctuations particularly occurred in the scope of mean temperatures they were statistically significant on a level from 0 05 in stations bobry and skwierzyna and in stations nowa wieś podgórna poznań and gorzów wlkp on a level of 0 001 water temperature fluctuations ranged from 0 096 to 0 281 cdec 1 respectively in water gauge stations bobry and sieradz fig 2 analysis using petitt s test showed that in the case of bobry nowa wieś podgórna poznań skwierzyna and gorzów wlkp station the point of change occurred in 1987 and in the sieradz station in 1988 in 1987 2009 mt changes in sieradz nowa wieś podgórna poznań and gorzów wlkp station were statistically significant on a level from 0 05 and ranged from 0 299 to 0 428 cdec

wlkp five times and most seldom in poznań three times fluctuations in each meteorological station occurred in april and august and no fluctuations were recorded in january february march june september october november and december in reference to mean annual air temperatures their fluctuations were on a level from 0 28 to 0 35 cdec 1 respectively in meteorological stations częstochowa and gorzów wlkp fig 3 the comparison of values of annual water and air temperature fluctuations in the multiannual period 1960 2009 showed that air temperature fluctuations were higher than water temperature fluctuations the differences were statistically significant on a level of p α 0 05 the cluster analysis revealed that in reference to monthly fluctuations of mean water temperatures the stations can be divided into two groups fig 4 the first group included stations bobry and gorzów wlkp where water temperature fluctuations were on the lowest level the second group included the remaining water gauge stations the second group can be further divided into two sub groups the first one includes the station in sieradz where fluctuations were on the highest level moreover the fluctuations showed different directions in particular months the second sub group covered stations nowa wieś podgórna poznań and skwierzyna where the fluctuations were on an average level the obtained results show that the greatest changes occur in january and february on a level from 10 to 23 temperature fluctuations from april to october usually do not exceed 4 the developed heat diagram fig 5 confirms the results of the cluster analysis in terms of similarities occurring in particular water gauge stations in reference to water temperature fluctuations analysis of values in columns the analysis in rows permits the assessment of the variability of water temperature fluctuations in particular months the greatest variability evidently occurs in the period from december to march and the lowest in july and august the characteristics of long term water temperature fluctuations in the warta river presented in the papercorresponds with the global research trend concerning thermal conditions of rivers and their changes in the context of the observed climate changes analysing water temperature fluctuations in three rivers in croatia and žganec 2012 determined their increase over a period of several decades the greatest increase was recorded for the mrežnica river in the years 1953 2008 it equalled 0 48 cdec 1 in the case of the loire river the longest river in france according to floury et al 2012 in the years 1977 2008 water temperature in the middle course of loire increased by 1 2 c mean annual water temperatures in the garonne river france in the years 1978 2005 increased by 1 29 c and in summer by 2 92 c air temperature showed similar tendencies that in the case of mean annual values increased by 1 58 c and mean values from the summer period by 2 57 c larnier et al 2010 in the case of the fraser river british columbia canada from 1950 martins et al 2011 recorded an increase in mean water temperature in the summer period by 1 5 c in the case of five rivers located in the coastal zone of the baltic sea in poland ptak et al 2016 determined an increase in mean annual water temperature at a level from 0 26 cdec 1 to 0 31 cdec 1 rivers located in the southern part of poland sub sudeten region were characterised by an increase in water temperature from 0 15 cdec 1 to 0 33 cdec 1 ptak 2018 in the case of the hudson river water became warmer by 0 94 c from 1946 seekell and pace 2011 based on 84 rivers in lithuania jurgelėnaitė et al 2012 determined that the greatest increase in water temperature 0 04 c occurred in the last period i e in the years 1991 2010 in the territory of austria webb and nobilis 2007 analysed water temperature fluctuations in three rivers salzach traun and danube in the years 1901 2000 in all the cases it increased by approximately 1 5 c interesting observations concerning changes in the thermal regime of surface waters were made among others by north et al 2013 or woolway et al 2017 noting its change at the end of the 1980s in the first case the analysis concerned the water temperature of rivers and lakes in switzerland and in the second case the lakes themselves in central europe including poland against the background of the above mentioned studies the water temperature in the warta river was compared in a similar manner establishing that a clear change in its course took place after 1987 after 1987 changes in water temperature were even more dynamic in the case of five observation stations located in the lowland zone only for the skwierzyna station an increase in mean temperature did not exceed 0 2 cdec 1 and equalled 0 16 cdec 1 such a situation can be explained by the location of the station that encloses the section of warta flowing along approximately 110km one of the largest forest complexes in poland namely the notecka forest kristensen et al 2015 observing temperature in five streams in denmark in the period from june 2010 to july 2011 determined among others that even the shortest sections of the forest at the banks 100m decreased water temperature in the river by a maximum of 1 c in comparison to temperature in open space a higher contribution of forest in the zone up to 500m reduces the temperature by approximately 2 5 c in the case of poland the role of forestation in reference to thermal regime of rivers is discussed by ptak and nowak 2017 who evidenced that the greatest share of cover of the catchment area with forests contributes to a decrease in water temperature in the river in the case of the analysed river it is not the area of the bank zone on the warta river itself due to its considerable width but its tributary along the selected section that can be of importance in the case of rivers located in the central atlantic region in the usa rice and jastram 2015 found that the vicinity of agricultural areas was correlated with faster growth of water temperature the conclusions can be referred to the remaining lowland stations of the analysed river where such a land use structure is dominant moreover groundwater supply may play an important role in slower increase in water temperature in the case of skwierzyna in comparison to the remaining lowland stations bogan et al 2003 emphasise that inflow of groundwaters reduces the temperature of the stream in summer and increases it in winter simulations performed by loinaz et al 2013 for research conducted for the silver creek basin usa show that a decrease in the flow of groundwaters by 10 can cause an average and maximum increase in temperature by 0 3 c and 1 5 c respectively through analogy to the above statement an increase of groundwater supply contributes to a decrease in the temperature of surface waters hydrogeological conditions occurring in the belt of dunes between warta and noteć provide a situation in which a weakly developed river network feeding the warta river is observed which as a consequence contributes to the predominance of groundwater runoff over surface runoff in the runoff structure of the warta river the share of groundwater supply is up to 60 przybyła et al 2017 the role of groundwaters in the development of hydrological conditions in the region is evidenced by their numerous outflows puk 2005 performed an inventory of 121 single and 94 groups of groundwater outflows within the sierakowski landscape park approximately 400km2 adjacent to the warta river over a considerable section according to information provided in the hydrological atlas of poland 1987 referring to fluctuations of mean water temperature along the river course in stations analysed in the paper they were caused by natural factors in the context of the analysis such a situation is confirmed by high correlations of water and air temperature ranging from 0 82 bobry to 0 94 gorzów wlkp similar results were obtained by isaak et al 2012 in reference to streams in north west usa where air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long term trends of water temperatures 82 94 of trends high correlation between air temperature and water temperature for all monthly and seasonal values was determined by among others ducić et al 2015 in reference to the danube river serbia bogojevo it should be emphasised that the recorded state does not mean that the warta river is completely unaffected by anthropogenic components influencing its thermal regime modification of the thermal regime of rivers as a result of human activity is evident among others as a result of functioning of water dams preece and jones 2002 lessard and hayes 2003 maheu et al 2016 deep water reservoirs with a bottom outlet cause an increase in water temperature in rivers in winter and its decrease in summer olden and naiman 2010 in the case of the discussed river in 1987 on its 484 3km an artificial dam was constructed creating artificial lake jeziorsko with a surface area of 42 5km2 and volume of 202 8million m3 among the analysed water temperature measurement sites station nowa wieś podgórna is the first station located behind jeziorsko the distance of the profile from the reservoir however is substantial approximately 130km and a potential effect of the impoundment on water temperature in the river is obscured the course of water temperature in this case does not differ from that of air temperature r 0 91 this suggests lack of factors disturbing the relations water reservoir poraj 5 5km2 25million m3 considerably smaller than jeziorsko located in the upper course of the river shows no effect on water temperature for station bobry no evident differences in the course of water and air temperature located at a distance of approximately 70km another important anthropogenic factor transforming the thermal regime of water in the river is the functioning of the power plant the discharge of waters used in the technological process of energy production can considerably change the thermal conditions deng et al 2006 li et al 2013 álvarez troncoso et al 2015 the hydroelectric power plant with a flow through character and power of 4 89mw is located on the dam of lake jeziorsko similarly as in the case of the effect of the dam itself and considerable distance of the measurement point however its impact on the thermal conditions of the warta river is not observed the effect of the dam itself and the existing power plantis undoubtedly an interesting issue requiring more detailed investigation in the future for this purpose the expansion of the water temperature monitoring network in the vicinity of lake jeziorsko should be considered it would provide information in addition to the standard measurements conducted so far by imgw pib in the context of energy production another reference should be made to the comparison in hydrological atlas of poland 1987 in the case of station konin not analysed in the paper due to substantial gaps in data water temperatures were found to be affected by natural and anthropogenic factors such a state can be caused by the inflow of water through the warta gopło channel which is in contact with the heated waters of the konin lakes used for energy production research on the prediction of future water temperature fluctuations in rivers suggests its further increase van vliet et al 2011 chang et al 2018 the process will depend on regional conditions local conditions of each catchment area and individual parameters of particular rivers based on the provided data also in the case of warta the current process will progress in that direction in the case of rivers in the territory of poland van vliet et al 2011 forecast that at the end of the 21st century 2071 2100 water temperature in extreme cases will be higher by more than 3 c depending on the adopted scenario of transformations considerable transformations of the thermal regime of warta in the context of functioning of the entire ecosystem should be considered unfavourable due to the importance of water temperature for most processes and phenomena the observed as well as the future increase in water temperature will modify the current processes occurring in the river in reference to both the biotic an abiotic conditions as emphasised in the introduction water temperature is its elementary parameter determining a number of processes and phenomena therefore transformations of thermal conditions in the river can be analysed in many aspects for example with consideration of water quality composition of ichthyofauna or hydrological conditions one of reports concerning the state of cleanliness of flowing waters covering the period analysed in the paper report 2010 based on a dozen measurement control points conducting year round observations showed higher than norm prescribed pollution of water in the warta river along the entire analysed section the sanitary state of waters and their saprobic index determining the intensity of decomposition of dead organic matter were the worst concentrations characteristic of biogenic substances at three observation sites did not correspond with the contemporary norms and those at the remaining 10 were within class iii of water cleanliness the self cleaning capacity of water is among factors important for water quality it is the key determinant of the amount of dissolved oxygen in water ptak and nowak 2016 an increase in water temperature may affect freshwater ecosystems by reducing dissolved oxygen concentrations bunn et al 1999 this statement confirms among others caissie 2006 or costa and gonçalves 2011 emphasising that the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen is a natural process warmer water becomes easier to saturate with oxygen and can contain less dissolved oxygen the observed water warming in warta and close relations between temperature increase and a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen is a serious challenge for measures aimed at the improvement of water quality in the discussed river the measures are intensively implemented in the catchment area of warta they cover among others more efficient water management introduction of closed systems of cooling water circulation and implementation of technologies allowing for meeting the standards of quality of the environment the occurrence of cyanobacteria can be a direct threat to human health according to cha et al 2017 water temperature is a predictor of their abundance benjamin et al 2016 emphasise that the thermal regime of the river strongly affects the thermoregulation and bioenergetics of fish as well as their migration and spawning terms in the case of the rhine river leuven et al 2011 point out that an increase in water temperature favours the presence of exotic species promoting competition between native and exotic species so far the share of invasive species including silver carp topmouth gudgeon and brown bullhead in the ichthyofauna population in warta was very low ciepłucha et al 2014 considerable transformations in the thermal regime recorded over the recent decades will not contribute to the transformation of the structure invasive species owe their colonisation success to among others exceptional resistance to difficult environmental conditions e g oxygen deficits grabowska et al 2008 resulting from among others increasing temperature other effects of an increase in water temperature can contribute to a reduction of duration of ice phenomena as determined by among others ptak and nowak 2017 in the case of prosna the longest left tributary of warta or a change in the components of the water balance in the form of an increase in evaporation ptak et al 2018 large and rapid changes in the structure of the heat and water balance of the whole country increased evaporation from the water surface and wetlands kędziora et al 2014 as the same authors further point out evaporation from the free water surface in wielkopolska part of the warta river basin in the period 1996 2006 exceeded the total precipitation annual evaporation totals increased from 600mm to 1000mm łaszewski 2015 analysing heat streams and energy budget of the świder river eastern poland stated that the biggest energy losses caused by evaporation occurred at high temperatures as well as low relative humidity and wind speed evaporation is a key process in the thermal system of rivers but its quantification remains a challenge mainly due to difficulties in direct measurements maheu et al 2014 some of the activities that may contribute to mitigating the effects of global warming include appropriate management of river banks and the entire catchment area ptak 2017 showed that in a river with more afforested banks and the whole catchment area there was a smaller increase in water temperature than in a catchment area with less afforested areas 4 conclusions the analysis of data for six gauging stations along the warta river showed that over the last fifty years there has been a significant transformation of the thermal regime manifesting itself in a successive increase in water temperature depending on the station at the level from 0 096 to 0 281 cdec 1 in the case of the analysed quasi natural gauging stations it was found that the observed changes were caused mainly by climatic factors which is confirmed by strong relations between water temperature and air temperature from 0 82 to 0 94 the elimination of human activity in the river s thermal regime allowed indicating the role of local factors which is visible in the slower rate of water warming it was established that such a situation is caused by the vicinity of a large forest complex and intensive groundwater supply the results obtained in the study are particularly important from the point of view of water management a significant part of the warta river basin is considered to be the region with the lowest water resources in poland and the observed situation will further intensify this unfavourable condition in terms of both quantity and quality of water as an application potential the situation captured by the analysis of the warta river water temperature considered along its entire course should be recorded compared to other observation gauging stations a slower increase in water temperature was observed which was due to local factors such a situation may constitute a basis for potential activities carried out in drainage basins or in the immediate vicinity of rivers in order to develop conditions that may mitigate the effects of climate warming in relation to the thermal regime of these ecosystems conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards funding body none declared acknowledgements none declared 
1116,in the context of climate changes detailed information concerning the response of different components of the environment to the observed situation is of high importance due to strong correlations of air and water temperatures water ecosystems have been subject to a considerable transformation for several decades the paper presents the analysis of long term 1960 2009 water temperature fluctuations in the warta river third longest river in poland based on six stations located along the bank of the warta river its thermal parameters and tendencies and rate of changes were determined moreover based on data concerning air temperature correlations between those two media were analysed water temperature in the warta river over the last fifty years was characterised by low variability ranging in the analysed stations from 9 5 c in sieradz to 10 3 c in poznan and skwierzyna the mann kendall trend tests sen s slope estimator and the pettitt test were applied to long term time series of air and water temperature analysis long term fluctuations of mean annual water temperatures were characterised by an increase statistically significant depending on the station at a level of p 0 05 and p 0 001 from 0 096 to 0 281 c dec 1 water temperature in the case of the analysed stations appears to be particularly determined by climatic factors as suggested by very strong correlations with air temperature from 0 82 to 0 94 evident changes in the thermal regime of the warta river in the context of functioning of the entire ecosystem should be considered unfavourable the observed as well as future increase in water temperature will modify current processes occurring in the river referring to among others water quality composition of ichthyofauna or hydrological conditions further temperature changes should be mitigated by among others appropriate management of the riverbank zone planting trees and by increasing the share of forest areas in the catchment

evaporation and consequently impoverishment of water resources choiński et al 2016 the situation is particularly unfavourable in reference to areas with observed water deficits in poland the deficit zone covers among others a part of wielkopolska where the mean unitary runoff is approximately 3 0dm3 s 1 km 2 the main river of the region is warta fig 1 constituting the third considering the total length of the oder river also in the territory of the czech republic longest river in poland so far warta has been a subject of interest of many researchers wrzesiński 1999 ilnicki et al 2014 kałuża et al 2017 skolasińska and nowak 2018 dysarz et al 2019 górski et al 2019 but the abundant literature shows lack of current knowledge concerning water temperature such a study in the context of dynamically occurring climate changes should be considered important for the functioning of the entire ecosystem moreover it is worth emphasising that research in the scope is undertaken in different regions of the world bartholow 2005 kvambekk and melvold 2010 beaufort et al 2013 usually pointing to an increase in water temperature in rivers one of the most effective statistical methods for determining long term changes in hydrology and climatology is the nonparametric mann kendall test burn and elnur 2002 the advantage of the mann kendall test is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the distribution of analysed variables and is therefore preferred over parametric tests hirsch et al 1991 in order to calculate the sign and magnitude of trends sen s slope estimator is preferred in literature sen 1968 sen s slope estimator is less sensitive to outliers not requiring that the variables have gaussian probability distribution finally the pettitt test was used to detect the changing point and then the dataset can be divided into two sub sequences pettitt 1979 the objective of the paper was the analysis of long term water temperature fluctuations in the warta river in the years 1960 2009 the analysis was performed based on data from six water gauge stations located along the river course in reference to maximum mean and minimum temperatures the obtained results were analysed in the context of long term air temperature fluctuations the following research hypotheses were stated directions and magnitude of water temperature fluctuations along the river course are the same in the scope of minimum mean and maximum values water and air temperature fluctuations show the same tendency values of water temperature fluctuations are higher than air temperature fluctuations 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the warta river has its springs on the krakowsko częstochowska plateau at a height of approximately 377m a s l in kromołowo the total length of the river

of the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib obtained for six hydrological stations fig 1 in the years 1960 2009 one of the stations is located in the plateau belt bobry and the remaining ones in the lowland zone sieradz nowa wieś podgórna poznań skwierzyna gorzów wlkp the collected information included daily measurements of water temperature and air temperature measurement of water temperature was point based and performed daily at a depth of 0 4m under the water surface at 6 00 utc all hydrological data were presented in the cycle of a hydrological year beginning on 1 november and lasting until 30 october of the following year in reference to climatic data mean monthly air temperatures for four meteorological stations częstochowa koło poznań gorzów wlkp fig 1 were used in the multiannual period corresponding with the performed hydrological measurements 2 3 methods the analysis of directions of water temperature fluctuations in the warta river in the years 1960 2009 was performed in a monthly and annual cycle by means of a non parametric mann kendall test mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 a non parametric sen test sen 1968 was applied for the assessment of the value of monthly and annual water temperature fluctuations the analysis was performed in reference to minimum lt mean mt and maximum temperatures ht the analysis of significance of trends was performed for three levels of p α 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 the analysis of the values and directions of air temperature fluctuations was performed in reference to particular months and hydrological years adopting the analogical procedure as in the case of water temperature mann kendal and sen tests the assessment of differences in the values of monthly and annual fluctuations of water temperature in the warta river and air temperatures employed a mann whitney test u the analysis was performed at a significance level of p α 0 05 finally the pettitt test was used to detect the changing point and then the mean water temperature series were divided into two sub sequences pettitt 1979 for the purpose of determination of similarities and differences between particular water gauge stations in reference to the values of fluctuations of mean water temperatures the cluster analysis was applied ca it was performed by means of the ward method and square euclidean distance was applied as a measure of similarity water gauge stations characterised by the highest similarity of thermal parameters were designated by adopting the cut off criterion at a level of 66 100dlink dlink max 1 ptak et al 2018 for a complete description of water temperature fluctuations in particular water gauge stations their relative differences were calculated as the ratio of fluctuation of decade temperature to mean monthly temperature from the multiannual period 3 results and discussion water temperature in the warta river was characterised by low variability mean water temperatures from the multiannual period 1960 2009 in particular stations along the warta river ranged from 9 5 c in sieradz to 10 3 c in poznań and skwierzyna the greatest variability of mean annual water temperatures was observed in sieradz and the lowest in station bobry considering mean annual water temperatures in all six cases july was the warmest mean value for poznań and nowa wieś podgórna was 20 2 c and for station bobry 17 6 c and january the coldest mean value for station bobry 2 1 c for sieradz and nowa wieś podgórna 1 1 c the analysis of long term water temperature fluctuations in reference to months showed table 1 the lowest fluctuations in station bobry 2 4 and 0 for lt mt and ht respectively and the highest in station nowa wieś podgórna 6 7 and 5 for lt mt and ht respectively in the case of mean temperatures in stations sieradz and nowa wieś podgórna significant water temperature fluctuations were observed in seven months and in the case of station bobry only in two in stations sieradz nowa wieś podgórna and skwierzyna fluctuations occurred in the winter hydrological half year and in station gorzów wlkp fluctuations occurred more frequently in the summer hydrological half year fluctuations of mean temperatures usually occurred in january five times february may july and august four times and the most seldom in june september and november one time a somewhat different situation was observed in the scope of low temperatures fluctuations were observed more frequently in the summer hydrological half year the greatest fluctuations were observed in stations nowa wieś podgórna and poznań in six months and the lowest in station bobry and skwierzyna in two months fluctuations occurred more often in may six times and in january november and december no temperature fluctuations were recorded in the scope of high temperatures in seven months they were statistically significant in station sieradz and in station bobry no fluctuations were observed in any month fluctuations of maximum temperatures in the analysed multiannual period particularly occurred in january four times and no significant fluctuations were recorded in july and september in reference to hydrological years statistically significant fluctuations particularly occurred in the scope of mean temperatures they were statistically significant on a level from 0 05 in stations bobry and skwierzyna and in stations nowa wieś podgórna poznań and gorzów wlkp on a level of 0 001 water temperature fluctuations ranged from 0 096 to 0 281 cdec 1 respectively in water gauge stations bobry and sieradz fig 2 analysis using petitt s test showed that in the case of bobry nowa wieś podgórna poznań skwierzyna and gorzów wlkp station the point of change occurred in 1987 and in the sieradz station in 1988 in 1987 2009 mt changes in sieradz nowa wieś podgórna poznań and gorzów wlkp station were statistically significant on a level from 0 05 and ranged from 0 299 to 0 428 cdec 1 a somewhat different situation was observed in reference to air temperatures table 2 fluctuations particularly occurred in the summer hydrological half year the most frequently in station gorzów wlkp five times and most seldom in poznań three times fluctuations in each meteorological station occurred in april and august and no fluctuations were recorded in january february march june september october november and december in reference to mean annual air temperatures their fluctuations were on a level from 0 28 to 0 35 cdec 1 respectively in meteorological stations częstochowa and gorzów wlkp fig 3 the comparison of values of annual water and air temperature fluctuations in the multiannual period 1960 2009 showed that air temperature fluctuations were higher than water temperature fluctuations the differences were statistically significant on a level of p α 0 05 the cluster analysis revealed that in reference to monthly fluctuations of mean water temperatures the stations can be divided into two groups fig 4 the first group included stations bobry and gorzów wlkp where water temperature fluctuations were on the lowest level the second group included the remaining water gauge stations the second group can be further divided into two sub groups the first one includes the station in sieradz where fluctuations were on the highest level moreover the fluctuations showed different directions in particular months the second sub group covered stations nowa wieś podgórna poznań and skwierzyna where the fluctuations were on an average level the obtained results show that the greatest changes occur in january and february on a level from 10 to 23 temperature fluctuations from april to october usually do not exceed 4 the developed heat diagram fig 5 confirms the results of the cluster analysis in terms of similarities occurring in particular water gauge stations in reference to water temperature fluctuations analysis of values in columns the analysis in rows permits the assessment of the variability of water temperature fluctuations in particular months the greatest variability evidently occurs in the period from december to march and the lowest in july and august the characteristics of long term water temperature fluctuations in the warta river presented in the papercorresponds with the global research trend concerning thermal conditions of rivers and their changes in the context of the observed climate changes analysing water temperature fluctuations in three rivers in croatia and žganec 2012 determined their increase over a period of several decades the greatest increase was recorded for the mrežnica river in the years 1953 2008 it equalled 0 48 cdec 1 in the case of the loire river the longest river in france according to floury et al 2012 in the years 1977 2008 water temperature in the middle course of loire increased by 1 2 c mean annual water temperatures in the garonne river france in the years 1978 2005 increased by 1 29 c and in summer by 2 92 c air temperature showed similar tendencies that in the case of mean annual values increased by 1 58 c and mean values from the summer period by 2 57 c larnier et al 2010 in the case of the fraser river british columbia canada from 1950 martins et al 2011 recorded an increase in mean water temperature in the summer period by 1 5 c in the case of five rivers located in the coastal zone of the baltic sea in poland ptak et al 2016 determined an increase in mean annual water temperature at a level from 0 26 cdec 1 to 0 31 cdec 1 rivers located in the southern part of poland sub sudeten region were characterised by an increase in water temperature from 0 15 cdec 1 to 0 33 cdec 1 ptak 2018 in the case of the hudson river water became warmer by 0 94 c from 1946 seekell and pace 2011 based on 84 rivers in lithuania jurgelėnaitė et al 2012 determined that the greatest increase in water temperature 0 04 c occurred in the last period i e in the years 1991 2010 in the territory of austria webb and nobilis 2007 analysed water temperature fluctuations in three rivers salzach traun and danube in the years 1901 2000 in all the cases it increased by approximately 1 5 c interesting observations concerning changes in the thermal regime of surface waters were made among others by north et al 2013 or woolway et al 2017 noting its change at the end of the 1980s in the first case the analysis concerned the water temperature of rivers and lakes in switzerland and in the second case the lakes themselves in central europe including poland against the background of the above mentioned studies the water temperature in the warta river was compared in a similar manner establishing that a clear change in its course took place after 1987 after 1987 changes in water temperature were even more dynamic in the case of five observation stations located in the lowland zone only for the skwierzyna station an increase in mean temperature did not exceed 0 2 cdec 1 and equalled 0 16 cdec 1 such a situation can be explained by the location of the station that encloses the section of warta flowing along approximately 110km one of the largest forest complexes in poland namely the notecka forest kristensen et al 2015 observing temperature in five streams in denmark in the period from june 2010 to july 2011 determined among others that even the shortest sections of the forest at the banks 100m decreased water temperature in the river by a maximum of 1 c in comparison to temperature in open space a higher contribution of forest in the zone up to 500m reduces the temperature by approximately 2 5 c in the case of poland the role of forestation in reference to thermal regime of rivers is discussed by ptak and nowak 2017 who evidenced that the greatest share of cover of the catchment area with forests contributes to a decrease in water temperature in the river in the case of the analysed river it is not the area of the bank zone on the warta river itself due to its considerable width but its tributary along the selected section that can be of importance in the case of rivers located in the central atlantic region in the usa rice and jastram 2015 found that the vicinity of agricultural areas was correlated with faster growth of water temperature the conclusions can be referred to the remaining lowland stations of the analysed river where such a land use structure is dominant moreover groundwater supply may play an important role in slower increase in water temperature in the case of skwierzyna in comparison to the remaining lowland stations bogan et al 2003 emphasise that inflow of groundwaters reduces the temperature of the stream in summer and increases it in winter simulations performed by loinaz et al 2013 for research conducted for the silver creek basin usa show that a decrease in the flow of groundwaters by 10 can cause an average and maximum increase in temperature by 0 3 c and 1 5 c respectively through analogy to the above statement an increase of groundwater supply contributes to a decrease in the temperature of surface waters hydrogeological conditions occurring in the belt of dunes between warta and noteć provide a situation in which a weakly developed river network feeding the warta river is observed which as a consequence contributes to the predominance of groundwater runoff over surface runoff in the runoff structure of the warta river the share of groundwater supply is up to 60 przybyła et al 2017 the role of groundwaters in the development of hydrological conditions in the region is evidenced by their numerous outflows puk 2005 performed an inventory of 121 single and 94 groups of groundwater outflows within the sierakowski landscape park approximately 400km2 adjacent to the warta river over a considerable section according to information provided in the hydrological atlas of poland 1987 referring to fluctuations of mean water temperature along the river course in stations analysed in the paper they were caused by natural factors in the context of the analysis such a situation is confirmed by high correlations of water and air temperature ranging from 0 82 bobry to 0 94 gorzów wlkp similar results were obtained by isaak et al 2012 in reference to streams in north west usa where air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long term trends of water temperatures 82 94 of trends high correlation between air temperature and water temperature for all monthly and seasonal values was determined by among others ducić et al 2015 in reference to the danube river serbia bogojevo it should be emphasised that the recorded state does not mean that the warta river is completely unaffected by anthropogenic components influencing its thermal regime modification of the thermal regime of rivers as a result of human activity is evident among others as a result of functioning of water dams preece and jones 2002 lessard and hayes 2003 maheu et al 2016 deep water reservoirs with a bottom outlet cause an increase in water temperature in rivers in winter and its decrease in summer olden and naiman 2010 in the case of the discussed river in 1987 on its 484 3km an artificial dam was constructed creating artificial lake jeziorsko with a surface area of 42 5km2 and volume of 202 8million m3 among the analysed water temperature measurement sites station nowa wieś podgórna is the first station located behind jeziorsko the distance of the profile from the reservoir however is substantial approximately 130km and a potential effect of the impoundment on water temperature in the river is obscured the course of water temperature in this case does not differ from that of air temperature r 0 91 this suggests lack of factors disturbing the relations water reservoir poraj 5 5km2 25million m3 considerably smaller than jeziorsko located in the upper course of the river shows no effect on water temperature for station bobry no evident differences in the course of water and air temperature located at a distance of approximately 70km another important anthropogenic factor transforming the thermal regime of water in the river is the functioning of the power plant the discharge of waters used in the technological process of energy production can considerably change the thermal conditions deng et al 2006 li et al 2013 álvarez troncoso et al 2015 the hydroelectric power plant with a flow through character and power of 4 89mw is located on the dam of lake jeziorsko similarly as in the case of the effect of the dam itself and considerable distance of the measurement point however its impact on the thermal conditions of the warta river is not observed the effect of the dam itself and the existing power plantis undoubtedly an interesting issue requiring more detailed investigation in the future for this purpose the expansion of the water temperature monitoring network in the vicinity of lake jeziorsko should be considered it would provide information in addition to the standard measurements conducted so far by imgw pib in the context of energy production another reference should be made to the comparison in hydrological atlas of poland 1987 in the case of station konin not analysed in the paper due to substantial gaps in data water temperatures were found to be affected by natural and anthropogenic factors such a state can be caused by the inflow of water through the warta gopło channel which is in contact with the heated waters of the konin lakes used for energy production research on the prediction of future water temperature fluctuations in rivers suggests its further increase van vliet et al 2011 chang et al 2018 the process will depend on regional conditions local conditions of each catchment area and individual parameters of particular rivers based on the provided data also in the case of warta the current process will progress in that direction in the case of rivers in the territory of poland van vliet et al 2011 forecast that at the end of the 21st century 2071 2100 water temperature in extreme cases will be higher by more than 3 c depending on the adopted scenario of transformations considerable transformations of the thermal regime of warta in the context of functioning of the entire ecosystem should be considered unfavourable due to the importance of water temperature for most processes and phenomena the observed as well as the future increase in water temperature will modify the current processes occurring in the river in reference to both the biotic an abiotic conditions as emphasised in the introduction water temperature is its elementary parameter determining a number of processes and phenomena therefore transformations of thermal conditions in the river can be analysed in many aspects for example with consideration of water quality composition of ichthyofauna or hydrological conditions one of reports concerning the state of cleanliness of flowing waters covering the period analysed in the paper report 2010 based on a dozen measurement control points conducting year round observations showed higher than norm prescribed pollution of water in the warta river along the entire analysed section the sanitary state of waters and their saprobic index determining the intensity of decomposition of dead organic matter were the worst concentrations characteristic of biogenic substances at three observation sites did not correspond with the contemporary norms and those at the remaining 10 were within class iii of water cleanliness the self cleaning capacity of water is among factors important for water quality it is the key determinant of the amount of dissolved oxygen in water ptak and nowak 2016 an increase in water temperature may affect freshwater ecosystems by reducing dissolved oxygen concentrations bunn et al 1999 this statement confirms among others caissie 2006 or costa and gonçalves 2011 emphasising that the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen is a natural process warmer water becomes easier to saturate with oxygen and can contain less dissolved oxygen the observed water warming in warta and close relations between temperature increase and a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen is a serious challenge for measures aimed at the improvement of water quality in the discussed river the measures are intensively implemented in the catchment area of warta they cover among others more efficient water management introduction of closed systems of cooling water circulation and implementation of technologies allowing for meeting the standards of quality of the environment the occurrence of cyanobacteria can be a direct threat to human health according to cha et al 2017 water temperature is a predictor of their abundance benjamin et al 2016 emphasise that the thermal regime of the river strongly affects the thermoregulation and bioenergetics of fish as well as their migration and spawning terms in the case of the rhine river leuven et al 2011 point out that an increase in water temperature favours the presence of exotic species promoting competition between native and exotic species so far the share of invasive species including silver carp topmouth gudgeon and brown bullhead in the ichthyofauna population in warta was very low ciepłucha et al 2014 considerable transformations in the thermal regime recorded over the recent decades will not contribute to the transformation of the structure invasive species owe their colonisation success to among others exceptional resistance to difficult environmental conditions e g oxygen deficits grabowska et al 2008 resulting from among others increasing temperature other effects of an increase in water temperature can contribute to a reduction of duration of ice phenomena as determined by among others ptak and nowak 2017 in the case of prosna the longest left tributary of warta or a change in the components of the water balance in the form of an increase in evaporation ptak et al 2018 large and rapid changes in the structure of the heat and water balance of the whole country increased evaporation from the water surface and wetlands kędziora et al 2014 as the same authors further point out evaporation from the free water surface in wielkopolska part of the warta river basin in the period 1996 2006 exceeded the total precipitation annual evaporation totals increased from 600mm to 1000mm łaszewski 2015 analysing heat streams and energy budget of the świder river eastern poland stated that the biggest energy losses caused by evaporation occurred at high temperatures as well as low relative humidity and wind speed evaporation is a key process in the thermal system of rivers but its quantification remains a challenge mainly due to difficulties in direct measurements maheu et al 2014 some of the activities that may contribute to mitigating the effects of global warming include appropriate management of river banks and the entire catchment area ptak 2017 showed that in a river with more afforested banks and the whole catchment area there was a smaller increase in water temperature than in a catchment area with less afforested areas 4 conclusions the analysis of data for six gauging stations along the warta river showed that over the last fifty years there has been a significant transformation of the thermal regime manifesting itself in a successive increase in water temperature depending on the station at the level from 0 096 to 0 281 cdec 1 in the case of the analysed quasi natural gauging stations it was found that the observed changes were caused mainly by climatic factors which is confirmed by strong relations between water temperature and air temperature from 0 82 to 0 94 the elimination of human activity in the river s thermal regime allowed indicating the role of local factors which is visible in the slower rate of water warming it was established that such a situation is caused by the vicinity of a large forest complex and intensive groundwater supply the results obtained in the study are particularly important from the point of view of water management a significant part of the warta river basin is considered to be the region with the lowest water resources in poland and the observed situation will further intensify this unfavourable condition in terms of both quantity and quality of water as an application potential the situation captured by the analysis of the warta river water temperature considered along its entire course should be recorded compared to other observation gauging stations a slower increase in water temperature was observed which was due to local factors such a situation may constitute a basis for potential activities carried out in drainage basins or in the immediate vicinity of rivers in order to develop conditions that may mitigate the effects of climate warming in relation to the thermal regime of these ecosystems conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards funding body none declared acknowledgements none declared 
1117,among the natural prerequisites that affect the recreational appeal of the region along with the geomorphological landscape and biological features of the terrain the hydroclimatic conditions of the region play a decisive role the paper analyses the hydroclimatic features of the russian part of the transboundary altai and their impact on the prospects for recreational use of the region it contains the analysis of the literature data on the climate and hydrology of the region supplemented with the results of the author s field studies the hydro environmental tension for each natural and recreational area was established the data were compared with an assessment of the recreational attractiveness of the region s water resources the results of the research can be used at the stage of the creation of tourist and recreational projects when developing and carrying out the excursion ecological and sports activities as well as and health tourism keywords water resources hydrological process recreation physiographic province socio ecological interactions 1 introduction recreational attractiveness of any region including the transboundary altai consists of many factors this is the recreational attractiveness of the landscape and the presence of unique natural sites the developed infrastructure and many other components an important role among which is played by water bodies recreational resources are natural technical natural socio economic complexes and their elements that contribute to restoration and development of spiritual and physical powers of people and their work capacity the term recreational resources was coined after the publication of several works by efremov 1963 in one of them he suggests including places of resort and travel picturesque landscapes decorative plants into recreational resources at the same time v b nefedova proposed that such natural elements as geological structure terrain climate surface and subsurface waters vegetation and soils should be viewed as recreational resources mironenko and nefedova 1963 in scientific publications the notion of natural resources usually accompanies the notion of natural conditions berrahou et al 2015 the natural area is a part of the land surface with a comparatively high degree of homogeneousness of its morphostructure climate vegetation and fauna in general and are little or in the limited degree transformed by human natural protected areas have special environmental scientific cultural esthetic and recreational value and a special protection regime has been established for them the climatic conditions such as temperature humidity and the cycling are the factors which have an influence on hydro environmental tension posed on human activities within a certain region recreational areas are territories that are used for various types and forms of human recreational activities there are such basic types landscape and recreational green areas the main function of which is the organization of the population s recreation urbanized recreational areas such as entertainment centers amusement rides and other facilities that perform recreational functions but do not always include green areas the landscape recreational analysis has been held in the study undoubtedly in the altai region the natural areas interweave the recreational ones because the frequency of the days favorable for recreational activities with comfortable warm and sub comfortable moderately hot and cold weather contributes to the development of tourism are varying across regions tourism is also possible in natural areas but only if it does not harm the environment in addition the development of ecological tourism will contribute to the preservation of the natural beauty of the unique territories as well as the reduction of the pressure on the environment creation and systematic replenishment of the database on the state of the environment and environmental violations of nature by their users the frequency of favorable weathers in the warm season ranges from 35 of the days at the heights to 55 in deep valleys and to 70 in the submontane altai in the cold season the number of days favorable for winter recreational activities amounts to 40 in the highland area 40 60 in the intermountain basins 60 80 in the middle highland and forest steppe low hill terrains and 80 90 days in the middle reaches of the katun river and the forest low hill terrains the most favorable climatic conditions for tourism and spa are in the low hill terrains and forested middle highlands the hydrographic network of the altai has more than 20 thousand rivers and streams with the total length of over 60 thousand km about 7 thousand lakes of more than 600km2 of the total area the rivers of the altai mountain area due to the significant slope and rapid flow are not navigable but present a great interest for water sports and general tourism the altai is among a few regions of the country where water trips of any complexity are possible to organize there are frequent waterfalls on the rivers attracting a great number of tourists and vacationers the environmental assessment of natural recreational resources is necessary to justify investments in protection of recreational resources and improvement of their use this assessment is closely connected with the resource type its location in relation to the areas of demand usage technology ecological qualities harada and li 2018 turley et al 2016 bondar 2018 fedchyshyn and ignatenko 2018 this connection can be expressed by a system of quality and quantity indicators quantity indicators include accessibility of places of resort and travel their capacity expenditure of curative resources on a person per day concentration of people in recreational zones etc quality indicators include appeal of a tourist attraction landscape comfort level etc paolucci et al 2015 vitense et al 2018 the area of the altai region is 168 thousand km2 the region occupies the 24th position in russia and the 10th position in the siberian federal district in terms of surface area two types of landscapes dominate in this region mountainous to the east and steppe to the west in total 7 intermountain basins are located in the russian part of the altai mountain area the considerable part of the study area is covered by forests mostly coniferous mineral resources of the altai territory are represented by the deposits of polymetallic and iron ores nickel cobalt halite soda coal and precious metals the climate is continental the population was 2 376 774 inhabitants the urban population amounts to 56 18 the population density is 14 inhabitants per sq km altai region federal state statistics service the advantageous geographical position of the region and its high transport accessibility provide ample opportunities to build strong economic and trade relations of interregional and international levels the recreational potential combined with the favorable climate of the southern part of western siberia rich historical and cultural heritage provide opportunities for the development of various kinds of tourism and entertaining recreation on the region of the altai region many rivers lakes and glaciers attract tourists with their picturesqueness and are the destinations of tours when organizing such extreme types of entertainment and sports as rafting on the mountain rivers kayaking and simple rest by water and fishing it is necessary to ensure both the safety of the recreants and the environmental safety of the water bodies as such hydro environmental safety is considered as a state of relations between the population the economy ecosystems including water bodies under which the economically efficient and environmentally safe water use is provided it is determined by the peculiarities of the spatial and temporal variability of river flow its natural regulation and the lack of water scarcity frolova 2012 recent years show an increase in the manifestations of dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena in this regard the assessment of the hydro environmental tension of the region is very relevant alekseevskiy et al 2007 de michele 2005 lavers 2011 schulz et al 2009 climatic factors also play an important role in determining the level of hydro environmental tension but the role of climate factors is indirect in the calculations since they do not take part in mathematical formulas but the presence or absence of a natural phenomenon depends on them since precipitation affects water levels high or low coastal erosion freezing temperatures affect the formation of ice crusts etc all these phenomena are directly involved in the calculation of the level of tension the study has been performed in the russian part of the transboundary altai within the boundaries of the four physiographic provinces charyshsko bashchelaksky katunsko terektinsky chulyshmansky and ukoksko chuysky this is the most promising part of the altai mountain area for recreational development harms et al 2016 sukhova et al 2016 according to the principle of the oroclimatic homogeneity it is based on the unity of the geo and morphostructures of a certain territory 14 natural and recreational areas nras were identified in the study region tigireksky bashchelaksky koksuisko korgonsky terektinsky seminsky tongoshsky uimonsky katunsky north south chuysky ulagansky chulyshmansky ukoksky chuysko kuraisky djulukulsky fig 1 nras are spatial units of homogeneous degree of bio climatic characteristics for recreation harms 2016 the subject of this research is the water resources and dangerous hydrological processes occurring in the study area within a spatial extent of natural and recreational areas nra the main objective of this study is to identify and assess ecological attractiveness for recreational use of nature and the specific objective is to analyze the hydroclimatic peculiarities of the russian part of the transboundary altai as well as to determine the parameters of the tension affecting the hydro environmental situation and subsequently the perspectives of the recreational use of the region based on the above said the authors set the following tasks to analyze the water bodies and climatic peculiarities within the 4 studied physiographical provinces to choose the methods to determine the indicators that influence the hydro environmental tension of the territory to define the degree of recreational attractiveness of the region using the scores assessment to compare the degree of the nra recreational attractiveness with the hydro environmental tension of the territory to present the research results 2 methodology the authors used various common theoretical methods contributing to the determination of the hydrological and climatic recreational attractiveness for recreation of the altai mountain area initially they analyzed the existing methods for the determination of the effect on the natural environment namely methods of analysis synthesis comparison modeling idealization formalization stepin 2006 hegel 2015 for the in depth study of the set issue the work was divided into several stages at the first stage they assessed the recreational attractiveness degree of the water resources for the recreational activities based on the hydrological characteristics of a region s water resources table 1 the assessment of the water bodies was carried out for such indicators as density of the river network km km2 variety of water bodies annual outflow l s from km2 and glaciers presence the typology of natural and recreational areas was constructed according to the degree of quality and quantity indicators for water objects on the basis of the obtained estimations then the points were assigned to water objects and the classes of recreational attractiveness were determined the least attractive 4 points relatively attractive 3 points attractive 2 points the most attractive 1 point then the collection and analysis of the information on dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena of the studied region was carried out the initial information was obtained from maps reference books literary and stock data materials of long term field observations of the authors the data of the ministry of emergency situations nikolaev and samoylova 1978 zavadsky and morozova 2016 kanaev 1986 sokolov 1976 skladchikova 1979 revyakin and kravtsova 1977 panina 1962 rotanova et al 2010 khairullin 1997 the second stage of the study presumed scoring of the degree of danger of the identified hydrological and climatic processes which resulted in the determination of the tension of the hydro environmental tension indicator in the assessment process the scores were assigned considering the frequency of occurrence of the phenomena of the unfavorable hydrological phenomena the general distribution of the data according to the danger classes is presented in table 1 the following indicators had influence on the hydro environmental tension and the grading high water levels flooding low water levels low water period ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions the maximum score for danger degree was 4 therefore for 7 indicators the maximum total score for a region is 28 the results of the scoring procedure are presented in table 4 repeatability of dangerous phenomena more than 50 in most parts of the rivers of the region corresponds to a degree of danger equal 4 and the absence of these 0 score the recurrence of hazardous phenomena of more than 50 provides for the fact that within a specific natural area a certain hydrological phenomenon can be observed more than six times a year high low water levels ice dam icy sat down avalanches coastal erosion for example if there are no mudflows in uimon pi then the degree of danger will be zero the combination of two or more simultaneously observed hydrological phenomena can lead to negative environmental consequences the following parameters were evaluated the water level in the high water the probability of flooding the area low water level low water level hanging dams ice dams icy conditions mudflows avalanches coastal erosion the intensity indicator for hydro ecological safety was expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible tension and was calculated using formula 1 climatic indicators take indirect part in the defining of the hydro environmental tension but is of not less importance since climatic indicators influence a particular hydrological phenomenon the formation of avalanches and icing depends on the indicator of ambient temperature the amount of precipitation affects the water level the erosion of the coast therefore just the degree of temperature and the amount of precipitation were not included in the calculations but climatic factors influenced the occurrence of a hydrological phenomenon the indicator of hydro environmental tension is expressed as the percentage of the maximum possible tension and is calculated as follows alekseevskiy and frolova 2000 danilov danilyan et al 2007 1 ng i 1 7 b i 100 b max where ng hydro environmental tension expressed as a percentage b i scores assessment of the danger degree of a particular hydrological phenomenon or process b max maximum possible total scores of the danger degree of hydrological processes and phenomena in the assessed region the three classes for hydro environmental tension were used favorable when the level of tension was less then 40 tense level of tension 40 60 critical level of tension above 60 the estimation of the threats to the recreational use of natural resources as a result of unfavorable hydrological phenomena requires taking into account the peculiarities of the formation of extremely large water levels during floods when there is a danger of flooding of tourist facilities destruction of infrastructure facilities and unsafe river and bank destruction the basis is the following scale 0 20 favorable situation 21 40 satisfactory 41 60 tense 61 80 critical 81 100 the situation is disastrous these percentage ratings are the authors approach to the assessment of the situation as the region is mountainous and the specifics of the conditions may significantly differ depending on the physical geographical conditions it was decided upon using the 5 rank scale in this paper the danger of hydro environmental phenomena was assessed based on their frequency in the estimated region because there is not enough reliable information for the other assessments such as e g the damage value in the conditions of extreme low water during the summer autumn and winter meadows there may be a shortage of water resources deterioration of water quality deterioration of the state of water and coastal ecosystems unfavorable development of channel processes it was assumed that all the phenomena high water levels low water levels bottle necks ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions are capable of affecting the safety of the recreants lives and activities and more frequently some or other phenomenon or process is fixed in the estimated region the higher is the danger score the result of the work was the comparison of the natural and recreational areas nra degree of recreational attractiveness of their waterbodies with the hydro environmental tension resulting from the probability of occurrence of the dangerous hydrological and hydro morphological phenomena in order to identify the areas of increased risk of water and near water recreation it should be noted that the degree of attractiveness of water objects is an assessment from the point of view of recreation furthermore the presence of water objects their diversity and attractiveness were taken into account and the level of hydro environmental tension is an indicator that meets other goals it contains the assessment of dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena the number of classes in the first and second indicators does not necessarily have to be the same here the authors were guided by the nature of the source information therefore the tension classes were determined based on eq 1 for this purpose the authors assessed the danger degrees of some or other hydrological phenomena process with the scores the scores assessment was considered equivalent to the maximum possible sum of the scores of the hydrological processes and phenomena danger degree within the investigated region 3 results and discussion 3 1 features for the hydrological network of the transboundary altai the altai mountain region has a developed hydrological network about 95 are rivers with the length of less than 10km the density of the river network often reaches the values of 1 5 2 0km km2 the densest river network is in the tigireksky and bashchelaksky districts the rivers are mostly mountainous in their nature by the nature of the intra annual flow distribution and taking nourishment into account three main groups of rivers are distinguished rivers with summer flood rivers with spring summer flood and summer autumn floods and rivers with spring flood and summer floods a specific feature of the rivers of the region is high coefficients of spring summer flow from 75 to 100 of the annual flow passes during the warm period high drainage coefficients are caused by the presence of permafrost soils in the highlands the shallow occurrence of dense bedrock and considerable terrain slopes which fill the riverbeds and spread over the floodplain in places numerous lakes with their picturesqueness are the ultimate target of tours these include the most visited morainal dam lakes multinsky akkemskoye kucherlinskoye and talmen katunsky nra kaljin kol bass ukok gusinoye muzdy bulak beloye kara kol nur of the ukoksky nra lakes and others the powerful centers of icing are the tavan bogdo ula plexus of mountains the north chuysky and the south chuysky ridges mountain belukha the main characteristics of water resources are given in table 2 the hydrological characteristics of water objects presented in table 2 were collected on the basis of an analysis of various information from various sources maps and field observations as a result of this analysis a brief table of water resource characteristics was presented nikolaev and samoylova 1978 zavadsky and morozova 2016 rotanova et al 2010 a typology of natural and recreational areas was carried out according to the degree of recreational attractiveness of water resources on the basis of these assessments fig 2 the most attractive areas are katunsky and djulukulsky due to the presence of icing the north south chuysky district holds a special appeal thus three of the natural and recreational areas have the most attractive water resources while the rest of the region is classified as attractive as mentioned above the information on dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena was collected and analyzed at the next stage of the work for convenience the results are described in the physiographic areas initially the authors presented the general climate characteristic of four physiographic provinces table 3 3 2 charyshsko bashchelaksky province there are three natural and recreational areas bashchelaksky tigireksky and koksuisko korgonsky the orographic basis of the province is formed by the tigireksky bashchelaksky and korgonsky ridges the ridges are oriented from the southeast to the northwest the average height of the ridges is 1500 2000m in the direction to the northwest of the height of the massifs mass it decreases to 800 1000m the ridges are a barrier to the wet air masses coming from the west so the province is characterized by damp climate table 3 stable snow cover lasts up to 180 days from november to march the amount of days with weather favorable and relatively favorable for winter tourism is 130 150 most of the rivers belong to the basin of the charysh river the left influx of the ob river which flows from the korgonsky ridge the river length is about 550km only the upper part of the basin is located in the province the valley of the charysh in the mountainous part is deeply embedded up to 100m its width is from 0 5 to 1 0km the slopes are steep from 10 15 to 400m sometimes with ledge rocks the nutrition is mixed with the predominance of snow prechannel flow on the water collecting header is formed by snow melt water 45 rainwater 32 and groundwater 23 it freezes in the first second decade of november landfast ice lasts from late november to late march early april the thickness of the ice is up to 1 5m icing is common in winter the course of the flood course is multi peak from april to july maximum flooding as a rule occurs at the end of may early june the water level rises by 3 5m and with intensive snowmelt up to 8m the speed of the current increases 1 5 2 times the decline of the high water is complicated by rain floods churakov et al 1997 summary of emergencies and incidents the largest settlement is charyshskoye village the village is located in the floodplain partly on the man made land due to backfilling in the bed and floodplain the erection of a number of protective dams the blockage of flows the level and ice regime of the charysh river and confluents and the riverbed evolution were largely changed this led to an increase in the amount of damage from the harmful water effects due to the almost annual flooding of a part of the village the riverbed evolution changed due to anthropogenic reasons on the section between the charyshskoye and krasny partizan villages there is annual coast erosion due to which there is a danger of the main riverbed leaving the charysh river in the right duct passing through the center of charyshskoye village this can lead to disastrous consequences churakov et al 1997 in charyshskoye village and other settlements of the charyshsky region the smallest rivers and flows of the charysh river raise concerns because every year in winter the icing is formed on them due to which the apartment houses are flooded the residential buildings in charyshskoe village charysh river red partizan village sentelek village sentelek river tulata village tulata river dolinskoye village tula river are in the flood zone 3 3 katunsko terektinsky province katunsko terektinsky province is located in the highest part of the russian altai six nras were singled out within the province seminsky terektinsky tongoshsky uimonsky katunsky and north south chuysky the katunsky north and south chuysky ridges have an average elevation of 2200 3000m the highest peak mountain belukha 4506m high is situated here the horizontal ruggedness of relief is 0 8 1 2km the vertical ruggedness of relief on the katun ridge is more than 800m on the terektinsky 600 800m the angles of surface slopes inclinations are from 12 to 45 and more a feature of the orographic structure is the presence of intermountain hollows uimonskaya and katandinskaya the absolute height of the bottom of the hollows is 800 1000m they are mainly composed of soft sediments the climate of the province is heterogeneous table 3 the main water artery is the katun river the hydrographic network in its basin is well developed the river is a typical mountain stream with significant slopes and high speeds a rocky bed for almost the entire length the bottom of the bed is boulder pebble the width of the channel in the upper and middle reaches is more than 100m the banks of the channel are steep and rocky the riverbed evolution of the katun river is determined by the geographical location of the catchment basin the formation of the river s water regime occurs at different altitude levels the melted waters of glaciers seasonal and high mountain snows rainfall and groundwater are involved in the nourishment the main feed source is snow melt water it accounts for 53 of the annual flow of which about 13 are of the flow falls to the glacial component and 40 to the snow component the degree of participation of rainfall in the river s feeding varies greatly from year to year and on average is 22 groundwater provides a fairly high water content in the low flow period of the year they account for up to 25 according to the riverbed evolution the river refers to mountain rivers with the spring summer flood the flooding is stretched multistage the duration of the ascent can reach more than 40 days the maximum water content in the river is most often observed at the end of may or beginning of june the average date of the maximum water flow is on the 30th of may the average duration of the flood is 115 days the maximum 166 days the minimum 57 days the course of the katun river levels in the free channel period generally follows the flow hydrograph sharp upswings and fluctuations in the water level in winter are caused by the ice phenomena on the river the amplitude of fluctuations in the katun river water level at a water station in the tungur village can reach 6m in recent years cases of flooding of residential buildings and the destruction of roads as a result of floods are regularly recorded analysis of the main hydrometeorological situations and the mechanisms of formation of flow leading to flooding showed that the main reason is the high intensity of snowmelt with a large amount of rainfall sukhova et al 2015 september october and early november before the onset of ice phenomena are the months of the open low water on the river when the most persistent decline in flooding occurs winter low water is established on the rivers in november and lasts until april the average duration of the winter low water is 155 days the least water costs are observed in winter the rivers of the province are characterized by processes of formation of bottom and frazil ice during the pre landfast ice period in the narrowing of the channel with sharp turns of the river near the islands ice jams may occur during the pre landfast ice period as a result of the raftings which also cause a rise in the water level the duration of the spring ice drift on katun on average is 15 days the longest 29 days the shortest 1 day at present the threat of shore erosion on katun exists for 25 settlements the largest number of settlements with active shore erosions is confined to the areas with a wide floodplain branching channel of the uimonskaya intermountain hollow the danger of flooding is also increased to the settlements located in the mouths of the katun influxes 3 4 chulyshmanskaya province the physiographic base of the province is the shapshalsky and chulyshmansky ridges the ulaganskoye plateau and the chulyshmanskoye highlands the average height of the shapshalsky ridge is 2700 2800m in the relief there is a wide spread of planation surface nowhere in the altai there are such wide watershed spaces in combination with deeply embedded river valleys the depth of vertical dismemberment in the chulyshman valley is 1400 1600m this valley is a trough it was developed by a glacier descending along it toward teletskoye lake in the chulyshman valley there is a high frequency of local warm and dry winds fohns which increase the air temperature the climatic characteristics are presented in table 3 the main rivers are chulyshman and bashkaus which belong to the basin of the biya river the most significant influxes of the chulyshman river are the chulcha shavla bashkaus rivers the bashkaus river flows from a carved lake located in the eastern part of the kuraisky ridge its length is 219km the catchment area is 8400km2 thawed waters of seasonal and mountain snows rainfall and groundwater take part in the nourishment of the rivers the preferred source of nourishment is thawed water which is from 20 to 70 of annual flow an average of 45 the degree of rainfall participation in the nutrition of the rivers varies greatly from year to year and on average is 22 according to the riverbed evolution the chulyshman river and its influxes belong to the mountain rivers with spring summer high water and floods in the warm season flow in the spring is formed due to the melting of the snow in the catchment then with the onset of summer raindrops are mixed with melted waters flooding ends purely with a rainfall formed with precipitations which fall out at this time of the year in the mountains abundantly and continuously in some years for example 1961 rainfall can form the maximum annual discharge of water in the river the hydrograph of the annual flow has a comb like appearance with sharp peaks of frequent ups and downs of the river s discharge values in quantitative terms the change in river water content during high waters and floods is significant which regularly leads to flooding of territories in particular more than 80 houses in the village balykcha of ulagan district were flooded in late may 2006 and 2014 as a result of rising water levels in the chulyshman river the water rose above the floor level by 10 30cm in addition bridges were destroyed on the section of the koo balykcha road and considerable damage was done to the economy flooding is observed in the other settlements of the province the freezing process is a combination of all the ice phenomena taking place on the rivers the beginning of ice phenomena in the form of submerged landfast ice slob averagely falls on november 2 landfast ice on the river averagely set on november 19 is steady the average duration of landfast ice is 168 days the maximum thickness of ice during the observation period is 125cm in spring during the ice drift jam phenomena can often be seen on the chulyshman river several settlements the villages of ulagan balyktuyul and pasparta are subject to the negative influence of icing processes in ulagan village activity of processes is high there are three sections of icing development in the locality the situation is caused by the complete freezing of the riverbed of the great ulagan coastal erosion is developed fragmentarily in the floodplain and terrace areas the maximum erosion is confined to the peak of the flood by the degree of avalanche danger a significant part of the province refers to areas with a strong avalanche hazard with a dense network of powerful avalanches avalanches descend systematically with an interval of 2 3 years 3 5 ukoksko chuyskaya province ukoksko chuyskaya province differs from the other provinces in its landscapes and has more similarities with the neighboring territories of mongolia than with the other altai provinces three nras were singled out within the province djulukulsky chuysko kuraisky and ukoksky the climate of the province is sharply continental its feature is large daily and annual temperature differences table 3 there are two large rivers on the region influxes of the katun river the chuya river 320km and the argut river 232km the formation of river water flow is characterized by the presence of a powerful modern glaciation of the ridges of tabyn bogdo ola the continental climate and the presence of permafrost the average annual water discharge for the argut river near the village of argut 92m3 s for the chuya river on the border of the district 42m3 s lower specific rivers water content of the chuya river basin is explained by the ridges of the chuya hollow blocking the moisture bearing winds from penetration melt snow and glaciers waters rain and ground water take part in nourishment of the rivers rivers with an average height of the catchment from 600 to 2000m reach the greatest value of groundwater recharge at high altitudes the share of groundwater recharge significantly decreases it reaches only 9 10 of the annual recharge on the rivers of highland areas the chuya river in the lower reaches is an exception this is due to the fact that the chuya hollow filled with sand and pebble deposits is a huge accumulator of groundwater according to the nature of the annual expenditure regime all the rivers of the ukoksko chuyskaya province belong to rivers with summer high water regime most of the region is characterized by a lack of winter flow right influxes of the chuya river in the middle reaches are characterized as was already noted by increased groundwater supply about 30 and respectively a relatively high flow in winter in the highlands given that up to 90 of the annual flow occurs in the summer months it is natural and predictable that the water level will rise sharply and as a consequence flood the area in the years when several flow stimulating processes coincide the situation is further aggravated for example the may flood in 1985 was supported by the melting of an abnormally large amount of solid precipitation accumulated in the basins of most rivers of the region and then a month later a wave of high floods was triggered by rainfall and ice melting in the mountains storm rains combined with high air temperatures which led to intensive snow and ice melting in the mountains led to the july 2005 flood as a result a suspension bridge over the argut river and a wooden bridge across the ak alakha river were destroyed and two more bridges across the argut and karagem rivers were damaged sukhova et al 2015 the thermal and ice regime of rivers is determined by the course of air temperature the prevailing nourishment and the degree of regulation by lakes due to small rivers freezing to the bottom their valleys are covered with icing with an ice thickness of 2 3m flat icings are found mainly along the valleys of rivers and streams and can occupy the entire stream bed breadthwise and even spill over into the floodplains reaching a length of 1 10km they may also have the form of spots with a diameter of 2 5m in the chuysko kuraisky region there are mudslides which usually develop during a high water peak activity is high emergency situations are possible in the affected area there are residential estates a bridge and a road to the kyzyl tash village coastal erosion is developed fragmentarily in the bends of the rivers activation occurs in flood peak the degree of activity is high and medium the erosion is caused either by the reorganization of the channels or by the influence of thick icings 3 6 determination of recreational attractiveness and indicator of the hydro environmental tension based on the calculations a typology of natural and recreational areas was carried out according to the hydro environmental tension fig 3 considering the five hydrological tension classes defined only three classes were present in the study area favorable level of tension less than 40 tense level of tension 40 60 and critical level of tension above 60 most of the regions unfortunately are characterized by hydro environmental tension only in three districts uimonsky ukoksky and djulukulsky the situation is considered better and was classified as favorable one district of katunsko terektinskaya province north south chuysky causes the greatest concern because the indicator of the hydro environmental tension is critical the final stage of our study is the identification of areas of increased risk for the recreants by comparing the recreational attractiveness of water resources in the nra and the situation of the hydro environmental tension fig 4 in the regions that are most attractive for water resources the hydro environmental tension reaches a tense and critical level but in the rest of the region which are distant from the most attractive water crossing points a favorable level of tension coincides with the recreational attractiveness of the water bodies this implies that the most attractive water objects are those that have a good coastline have sufficient water level are socially and esthetically attractive the level of pollution is insignificant which is not determined in the presented study but there is a progressive deterioration in the quality of the aquatic environment which constitutes a threat to the country s ecological food and national security the wide scope of degradation processes occurring in the hydrosphere leads to events and phenomena of different nature these regions are distant from the main water crossing points they are the least used for recreational activities consequently in most of the russian territory of the transboundary altai which is less attractive than that which obtains all parameters and is presented in this study water resources are favorable and do not pose a risk to water and near water tourism the evaluation of the waterbodies is an important part of this study because it gives possibility to determine the hydro environmental tension that is why the hydro environmental situation is considered favorable the determination of the hydro environmental tension includes an aggregation of facts they are both the hydrological parameters of the region high water levels low water levels bottle necks ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions and the climatic ones during the research of the regional climate the authors used a sufficient amount of the literature sources and scientific encyclopedia which contributed to the comparison of the obtained results as well as allowed revealing specific climatic regularities the climatic indicators undoubtedly affect the hydrological ones as low temperatures lead to the formation of the ice jams and ice mounds the increase in the amount of precipitations leads to the banked up water level flooding and stream bank erosion all these factors take an adverse effect on the environmental situation in the region the degradation of the landscapes nearby water bodies may be accompanied with the increase in the volume of the surface water drainage and erosion all this affects the environmental situation and the use of the region for the recreational purposes favorable geographical location contributes to the development of tourism 4 conclusions the assessment of natural and recreational areas in terms of the recreational attractiveness of water resources showed that the most attractive natural and recreational areas include katunsky north south chuysky and djulukulsky located respectively in the katunsko terektinsky and chulyshmansky physiographic provinces it is worth noting that the entire region being surveyed is characterized by a sufficient degree of recreational attractiveness of water bodies for the development of recreation 14 nras the most favorable for the presence of water bodies is katunsky chulyshmansky and djulukulsky nras but the level of the hydroecological situation is calculated as tense the most favorable waterbodies in terms of availability and technological parameters are in katunsky chulyshmansky and djulukulsky nras due to the presence of icing north south chuysky nra is identified separately most of the region unfortunately is characterized by considerable level of hydro environmental tension the favorable level is only in three regions ukoksky uimonsky and djulukulsky natural changes in the hydrological regime of rivers lead to the emergence of risks of their negative impact on the population and recreational facilities in recent decades there has been an increase in the extreme nature of changes in the characteristic costs and water levels channel processes and ice phenomena the local and basin problems of the water quality change are not uncommon the risk of floods and other negative impacts of water can increase in new climatic and economic conditions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the authors state that the research was

1117,among the natural prerequisites that affect the recreational appeal of the region along with the geomorphological landscape and biological features of the terrain the hydroclimatic conditions of the region play a decisive role the paper analyses the hydroclimatic features of the russian part of the transboundary altai and their impact on the prospects for recreational use of the region it contains the analysis of the literature data on the climate and hydrology of the region supplemented with the results of the author s field studies the hydro environmental tension for each natural and recreational area was established the data were compared with an assessment of the recreational attractiveness of the region s water resources the results of the research can be used at the stage of the creation of tourist and recreational projects when developing and carrying out the excursion ecological and sports activities as well as and health tourism keywords water resources hydrological process recreation physiographic province socio ecological interactions 1 introduction recreational attractiveness of any region including the transboundary altai consists of many factors this is the recreational attractiveness of the landscape and the presence of unique natural sites the developed infrastructure and many other components an important role among which is played by water bodies recreational resources are natural technical natural socio economic complexes and their elements that contribute to restoration and development of spiritual and physical powers of people and their work capacity the term recreational resources was coined after the publication of several works by efremov 1963 in one of them he suggests including places of resort and travel picturesque landscapes decorative plants into recreational resources at the same time v b nefedova proposed that such natural elements as geological structure terrain climate surface and subsurface waters vegetation and soils should be viewed as recreational resources mironenko and nefedova 1963 in scientific publications the notion of natural resources usually accompanies the notion of natural conditions berrahou et al 2015 the natural area is a part of the land surface with a comparatively high degree of homogeneousness of its morphostructure climate vegetation and fauna in general and are little or in the limited degree transformed by human natural protected areas have special environmental scientific cultural esthetic and recreational value and a special protection regime has been established for them the climatic conditions such as temperature humidity and the cycling are the factors which have an influence on hydro environmental tension posed on human activities within a certain region recreational areas are territories that are used for various types and forms of human recreational activities there are such basic types landscape and recreational green areas the main function of which is the organization of the population s recreation urbanized recreational areas such as entertainment centers amusement rides and other facilities that perform recreational functions but do not always include green areas the landscape recreational analysis has been held in the study undoubtedly in the altai region the natural areas interweave the recreational ones because the frequency of the days favorable for recreational activities with comfortable warm and sub comfortable moderately hot and cold weather contributes to the development of tourism are varying across regions tourism is also possible in natural areas but only if it does not harm the environment in addition the development of ecological tourism will contribute to the preservation of the natural beauty of the unique territories as well as the reduction of the pressure on the environment creation and systematic replenishment of the database on the state of the environment and environmental violations of nature by their users the frequency of favorable weathers in the warm season ranges from 35 of the days at the heights to 55 in deep valleys and to 70 in the submontane altai in the cold season the number of days favorable for winter recreational activities amounts to 40 in the highland area 40 60 in the intermountain basins 60 80 in the middle highland and forest steppe low hill terrains and 80 90 days in the middle reaches of the katun river and the forest low hill terrains the most favorable climatic conditions for tourism and spa are in the low hill terrains and forested middle highlands the hydrographic network of the altai has more than 20 thousand rivers and streams with the total length of over 60 thousand km about 7 thousand lakes of more than 600km2 of the total area the rivers of the altai mountain area due to the significant slope and rapid flow are not navigable but present a great interest for water sports and general tourism the altai is among a few regions of the country where water trips of any complexity are possible to organize there are frequent waterfalls on the rivers attracting a great number of tourists and vacationers the environmental assessment of natural recreational resources is necessary to justify investments in protection of recreational resources and improvement of their use this assessment is closely connected with the resource type its location in relation to the areas of demand usage technology ecological qualities harada and li 2018 turley et al 2016 bondar 2018 fedchyshyn and ignatenko 2018 this connection can be expressed by a system of quality and quantity indicators quantity indicators include accessibility of places of resort and travel their capacity expenditure of curative resources on a person per day concentration of people in recreational zones etc quality indicators include appeal of a tourist attraction landscape comfort level etc paolucci et al 2015 vitense et al 2018 the area of the altai region is 168 thousand km2 the region occupies the 24th position in russia and the 10th position in the siberian federal district in terms of surface area two types of landscapes dominate in this region mountainous to the east and steppe to the west in total 7 intermountain basins are located in the russian part of the altai mountain area the considerable part of the study area is covered by forests mostly coniferous mineral resources of the altai territory are represented by the deposits of polymetallic and iron ores nickel cobalt halite soda coal and precious metals the climate is continental the population was 2 376 774 inhabitants the urban population amounts to 56 18 the population density is 14 inhabitants per sq km altai region federal state statistics service the advantageous geographical position of the region and its high transport accessibility provide ample opportunities to build strong economic and trade relations of interregional and international levels the recreational potential combined with the favorable climate of the southern part of western siberia rich historical and cultural heritage provide opportunities for the development of various kinds of tourism and entertaining recreation on the region of the altai region many rivers lakes and glaciers attract tourists with their picturesqueness and are the destinations of tours when organizing such extreme types of entertainment and sports as rafting on the mountain rivers kayaking and simple rest by water and fishing it is necessary to ensure both the safety of the recreants and the environmental safety of the water bodies as such hydro environmental safety is considered as a state of relations between the population the economy ecosystems including water bodies under which the economically efficient and environmentally safe water use is provided it is determined by the peculiarities of the spatial and temporal variability of river flow its natural regulation and the lack of water scarcity frolova 2012 recent years show an increase in the manifestations of dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena in this regard the assessment of the hydro environmental tension of the region is very relevant alekseevskiy et al 2007 de michele 2005 lavers 2011 schulz et al 2009 climatic factors also play an important role in determining the level of hydro environmental tension but the role of climate factors is indirect in the calculations since they do not take part in mathematical formulas but the presence or absence of a natural phenomenon depends on them since precipitation affects water levels high or low coastal erosion freezing temperatures affect the formation of ice crusts etc all these phenomena are directly involved in the calculation of the level of tension the study has been performed in the russian part of the transboundary altai within the boundaries of the four physiographic provinces charyshsko bashchelaksky katunsko terektinsky chulyshmansky and ukoksko chuysky this is the most promising part of the altai mountain area for recreational development harms et al 2016 sukhova et al 2016 according to the principle of the oroclimatic homogeneity it is based on the unity of the geo and morphostructures of a certain territory 14 natural and recreational areas nras were identified in the study region tigireksky bashchelaksky koksuisko korgonsky terektinsky seminsky tongoshsky uimonsky katunsky north south chuysky ulagansky chulyshmansky ukoksky chuysko kuraisky djulukulsky fig 1 nras are spatial units of homogeneous degree of bio climatic characteristics for recreation harms 2016 the subject of this research is the water resources and dangerous hydrological processes occurring in the study area within a spatial extent of natural and recreational areas nra the main objective of this study is to identify and assess ecological attractiveness for recreational use of nature and the specific objective is to analyze the hydroclimatic peculiarities of the russian part of the transboundary altai as well as to determine the parameters of the tension affecting the hydro environmental situation and subsequently the perspectives of the recreational use of the region based on the above said the authors set the following tasks to analyze the water bodies and climatic peculiarities within the 4 studied physiographical provinces to choose the methods to determine the indicators that influence the hydro environmental tension of the territory to define the degree of recreational attractiveness of the region using the scores assessment to compare the degree of the nra recreational attractiveness with the hydro environmental tension of the territory to present the research results 2 methodology the authors used various common theoretical methods contributing to the determination of the hydrological and climatic recreational attractiveness for recreation of the altai mountain area initially they analyzed the existing methods for the determination of the effect on the natural environment namely methods of analysis synthesis comparison modeling idealization formalization stepin 2006 hegel 2015 for the in depth study of the set issue the work was divided into several stages at the first stage they assessed the recreational attractiveness degree of the water resources for the recreational activities based on the hydrological characteristics of a region s water resources table 1 the assessment of the water bodies was carried out for such indicators as density of the river network km km2 variety of water bodies annual outflow l s from km2 and glaciers presence the typology of natural and recreational areas was constructed according to the degree of quality and quantity indicators for water objects on the basis of the obtained estimations then the points were assigned to water objects and the classes of recreational attractiveness were determined the least attractive 4 points relatively attractive 3 points attractive 2 points the most attractive 1 point then the collection and analysis of the information on dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena of the studied region was carried out the initial information was obtained from maps reference books literary and stock data materials of long term field observations of the authors the data of the ministry of emergency situations nikolaev and samoylova 1978 zavadsky and morozova 2016 kanaev 1986 sokolov 1976 skladchikova 1979 revyakin and kravtsova 1977 panina 1962 rotanova et al 2010 khairullin 1997 the second stage of the study presumed scoring of the degree of danger of the identified hydrological and climatic processes which resulted in the determination of the tension of the hydro environmental tension indicator in the assessment process the scores were assigned considering the frequency of occurrence of the phenomena of the unfavorable hydrological phenomena the general distribution of the data according to the danger classes is presented in table 1 the following indicators had influence on the hydro environmental tension and the grading high water levels flooding low water levels low water period ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions the maximum score for danger degree was 4 therefore for 7 indicators the maximum total score for a region is 28 the results of the scoring procedure are presented in table 4 repeatability of dangerous phenomena more than 50 in most parts of the rivers of the region corresponds to a degree of danger equal 4 and the absence of these 0 score the recurrence of hazardous phenomena of more than 50 provides for the fact that within a specific natural area a certain hydrological phenomenon can be observed more than six times a year high low water levels ice dam icy sat down avalanches coastal erosion for example if there are no mudflows in uimon pi then the degree of danger will be zero the combination of two or more simultaneously observed hydrological phenomena can lead to negative environmental consequences the following parameters were evaluated the water level in the high water the probability of flooding the area low water level low water level hanging dams ice dams icy conditions mudflows avalanches coastal erosion the intensity indicator for hydro ecological safety was expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible tension and was calculated using formula 1 climatic indicators take indirect part in the defining of the hydro environmental tension but is of not less importance since climatic indicators influence a particular hydrological phenomenon the formation of avalanches and icing depends on the indicator of ambient temperature the amount of precipitation affects the water level the erosion of the coast therefore just the degree of temperature and the amount of precipitation were not included in the calculations but climatic factors influenced the occurrence of a hydrological phenomenon the indicator of hydro environmental tension is expressed as the percentage of the maximum possible tension and is calculated as follows alekseevskiy and frolova 2000 danilov danilyan et al 2007 1 ng i 1 7 b i 100 b max where ng hydro environmental tension expressed as a percentage b i scores assessment of the danger degree of a particular hydrological phenomenon or process b max maximum possible total scores of the danger degree of hydrological processes and phenomena in the assessed region the three classes for hydro environmental tension were used favorable when the level of tension was less then 40 tense level of tension 40 60 critical level of tension above 60 the estimation of the threats to the recreational use of natural resources as a result of unfavorable hydrological phenomena requires taking into account the peculiarities of the formation of extremely large water levels during floods when there is a danger of flooding of tourist facilities destruction of infrastructure facilities and unsafe river and bank destruction the basis is the following scale 0 20 favorable situation 21 40 satisfactory 41 60 tense 61 80 critical 81 100 the situation is disastrous these percentage ratings are the authors approach to the assessment of the situation as the region is mountainous and the specifics of the conditions may significantly differ depending on the physical geographical conditions it was decided upon using the 5 rank scale in this paper the danger of hydro environmental phenomena was assessed based on their frequency in the estimated region because there is not enough reliable information for the other assessments such as e g the damage value in the conditions of extreme low water during the summer autumn and winter meadows there may be a shortage of water resources deterioration of water quality deterioration of the state of water and coastal ecosystems unfavorable development of channel processes it was assumed that all the phenomena high water levels low water levels bottle necks ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions are capable of affecting the safety of the recreants lives and activities and more frequently some or other phenomenon or process is fixed in the estimated region the higher is the danger score the result of the work was the comparison of the natural and recreational areas nra degree of recreational attractiveness of their waterbodies with the hydro environmental tension resulting from the probability of occurrence of the dangerous hydrological and hydro morphological phenomena in order to identify the areas of increased risk of water and near water recreation it should be noted that the degree of attractiveness of water objects is an assessment from the point of view of recreation furthermore the presence of water objects their diversity and attractiveness were taken into account and the level of hydro environmental tension is an indicator that meets other goals it contains the assessment of dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena the number of classes in the first and second indicators does not necessarily have to be the same here the authors were guided by the nature of the source information therefore the tension classes were determined based on eq 1 for this purpose the authors assessed the danger degrees of some or other hydrological phenomena process with the scores the scores assessment was considered equivalent to the maximum possible sum of the scores of the hydrological processes and phenomena danger degree within the investigated region 3 results and discussion 3 1 features for the hydrological network of the transboundary altai the altai mountain region has a developed hydrological network about 95 are rivers with the length of less than 10km the density of the river network often reaches the values of 1 5 2 0km km2 the densest river network is in the tigireksky and bashchelaksky districts the rivers are mostly mountainous in their nature by the nature of the intra annual flow distribution and taking nourishment into account three main groups of rivers are distinguished rivers with summer flood rivers with spring summer flood and summer autumn floods and rivers with spring flood and summer floods a specific feature of the rivers of the region is high coefficients of spring summer flow from 75 to 100 of the annual flow passes during the warm period high drainage coefficients are caused by the presence of permafrost soils in the highlands the shallow occurrence of dense bedrock and considerable terrain slopes which fill the riverbeds and spread over the floodplain in places numerous lakes with their picturesqueness are the ultimate target of tours these include the most visited morainal dam lakes multinsky akkemskoye kucherlinskoye and talmen katunsky nra kaljin kol bass ukok gusinoye muzdy bulak beloye kara kol nur of the ukoksky nra lakes and others the powerful centers of icing are the tavan bogdo ula plexus of mountains the north chuysky and the south chuysky ridges mountain belukha the main characteristics of water resources are given in table 2 the hydrological characteristics of water objects presented in table 2 were collected on the basis of an analysis of various information from various sources maps and field observations as a result of this analysis a brief table of water resource characteristics was presented nikolaev and samoylova 1978 zavadsky and morozova 2016 rotanova et al 2010 a typology of natural and recreational areas was carried out according to the degree of recreational attractiveness of water resources on the basis of these assessments fig 2 the most attractive areas are katunsky and djulukulsky due to the presence of icing the north south chuysky district holds a special appeal thus three of the natural and recreational areas have the most attractive water resources while the rest of the region is classified as attractive as mentioned above the information on dangerous hydrological processes and phenomena was collected and analyzed at the next stage of the work for convenience the results are described in the physiographic areas initially the authors presented the general climate characteristic of four physiographic provinces table 3 3 2 charyshsko bashchelaksky province there are three natural and recreational areas bashchelaksky tigireksky and koksuisko korgonsky the orographic basis of the province is formed by the tigireksky bashchelaksky and korgonsky ridges the ridges are oriented from the southeast to the northwest the average height of the ridges is 1500 2000m in the direction to the northwest of the height of the massifs mass it decreases to 800 1000m the ridges are a barrier to the wet air masses coming from the west so the province is characterized by damp climate table 3 stable snow cover lasts up to 180 days from november to march the amount of days with weather favorable and relatively favorable for winter tourism is 130 150 most of the rivers belong to the basin of the charysh river the left influx of the ob river which flows from the korgonsky ridge the river length is about 550km only the upper part of the basin is located in the province the valley of the charysh in the mountainous part is deeply embedded up to 100m its width is from 0 5 to 1 0km the slopes are steep from 10 15 to 400m sometimes with ledge rocks the nutrition is mixed with the predominance of snow prechannel flow on the water collecting header is formed by snow melt water 45 rainwater 32 and groundwater 23 it freezes in the first second decade of november landfast ice lasts from late november to late march early april the thickness of the ice is up to 1 5m icing is common in winter the course of the flood course is multi peak from april to july maximum flooding as a rule occurs at the end of may early june the water level rises by 3 5m and with intensive snowmelt up to 8m the speed of the current increases 1 5 2 times the decline of the high water is complicated by rain floods churakov et al 1997 summary of emergencies and incidents the largest settlement is charyshskoye village the village is located in the floodplain partly on the man made land due to backfilling in the bed and floodplain the erection of a number of protective dams the blockage of flows the level and ice regime of the charysh river and confluents and the riverbed evolution were largely changed this led to an increase in the amount of damage from the harmful water effects due to the almost annual flooding of a part of the village the riverbed evolution changed due to anthropogenic reasons on the section between the charyshskoye and krasny partizan villages there is annual coast erosion due to which there is a danger of the main riverbed leaving the charysh river in the right duct passing through the center of charyshskoye village this can lead to disastrous consequences churakov et al 1997 in charyshskoye village and other settlements of the charyshsky region the smallest rivers and flows of the charysh river raise concerns because every year in winter the icing is formed on them due to which the apartment houses are flooded the residential buildings in charyshskoe village charysh river red partizan village sentelek village sentelek river tulata village tulata river dolinskoye village tula river are in the flood zone 3 3 katunsko terektinsky province katunsko terektinsky province is located in the highest part of the russian altai six nras were singled out within the province seminsky terektinsky tongoshsky uimonsky katunsky and north south chuysky the katunsky north and south chuysky ridges have an average elevation of 2200 3000m the highest peak mountain belukha 4506m high is situated here the horizontal ruggedness of relief is 0 8 1 2km the vertical ruggedness of relief on the katun ridge is more than 800m on the terektinsky 600 800m the angles of surface slopes inclinations are from 12 to 45 and more a feature of the orographic structure is the presence of intermountain hollows uimonskaya and katandinskaya the absolute height of the bottom of the hollows is 800 1000m they are mainly composed of soft sediments the climate of the province is heterogeneous table 3 the main water artery is the katun river the hydrographic network in its basin is well developed the river is a typical mountain stream with significant slopes and high speeds a rocky bed for almost the entire length the bottom of the bed is boulder pebble the width of the channel in the upper and middle reaches is more than 100m the banks of the channel are steep and rocky the riverbed evolution of the katun river is determined by the geographical location of the catchment basin the formation of the river s water regime occurs at different altitude levels the melted waters of glaciers seasonal and high mountain snows rainfall and groundwater are involved in the nourishment the main feed source is snow melt water it accounts for 53 of the annual flow of which about 13 are of the flow falls to the glacial component and 40 to the snow component the degree of participation of rainfall in the river s feeding varies greatly from year to year and on average is 22 groundwater provides a fairly high water content in the low flow period of the year they account for up to 25 according to the riverbed evolution the river refers to mountain rivers with the spring summer flood the flooding is stretched multistage the duration of the ascent can reach more than 40 days the maximum water content in the river is most often observed at the end of may or beginning of june the average date of the maximum water flow is on the 30th of may the average duration of the flood is 115 days the maximum 166 days the minimum 57 days the course of the katun river levels in the free channel period generally follows the flow hydrograph sharp upswings and fluctuations in the water level in winter are caused by the ice phenomena on the river the amplitude of fluctuations in the katun river water level at a water station in the tungur village can reach 6m in recent years cases of flooding of residential buildings and the destruction of roads as a result of floods are regularly recorded analysis of the main hydrometeorological situations and the mechanisms of formation of flow leading to flooding showed that the main reason is the high intensity of snowmelt with a large amount of rainfall sukhova et al 2015 september october and early november before the onset of ice phenomena are the months of the open low water on the river when the most persistent decline in flooding occurs winter low water is established on the rivers in november and lasts until april the average duration of the winter low water is 155 days the least water costs are observed in winter the rivers of the province are characterized by processes of formation of bottom and frazil ice during the pre landfast ice period in the narrowing of the channel with sharp turns of the river near the islands ice jams may occur during the pre landfast ice period as a result of the raftings which also cause a rise in the water level the duration of the spring ice drift on katun on average is 15 days the longest 29 days the shortest 1 day at present the threat of shore erosion on katun exists for 25 settlements the largest number of settlements with active shore erosions is confined to the areas with a wide floodplain branching channel of the uimonskaya intermountain hollow the danger of flooding is also increased to the settlements located in the mouths of the katun influxes 3 4 chulyshmanskaya province the physiographic base of the province is the shapshalsky and chulyshmansky ridges the ulaganskoye plateau and the chulyshmanskoye highlands the average height of the shapshalsky ridge is 2700 2800m in the relief there is a wide spread of planation surface nowhere in the altai there are such wide watershed spaces in combination with deeply embedded river valleys the depth of vertical dismemberment in the chulyshman valley is 1400 1600m this valley is a trough it was developed by a glacier descending along it toward teletskoye lake in the chulyshman valley there is a high frequency of local warm and dry winds fohns which increase the air temperature the climatic characteristics are presented in table 3 the main rivers are chulyshman and bashkaus which belong to the basin of the biya river the most significant influxes of the chulyshman river are the chulcha shavla bashkaus rivers the bashkaus river flows from a carved lake located in the eastern part of the kuraisky ridge its length is 219km the catchment area is 8400km2 thawed waters of seasonal and mountain snows rainfall and groundwater take part in the nourishment of the rivers the preferred source of nourishment is thawed water which is from 20 to 70 of annual flow an average of 45 the degree of rainfall participation in the nutrition of the rivers varies greatly from year to year and on average is 22 according to the riverbed evolution the chulyshman river and its influxes belong to the mountain rivers with spring summer high water and floods in the warm season flow in the spring is formed due to the melting of the snow in the catchment then with the onset of summer raindrops are mixed with melted waters flooding ends purely with a rainfall formed with precipitations which fall out at this time of the year in the mountains abundantly and continuously in some years for example 1961 rainfall can form the maximum annual discharge of water in the river the hydrograph of the annual flow has a comb like appearance with sharp peaks of frequent ups and downs of the river s discharge values in quantitative terms the change in river water content during high waters and floods is significant which regularly leads to flooding of territories in particular more than 80 houses in the village balykcha of ulagan district were flooded in late may 2006 and 2014 as a result of rising water levels in the chulyshman river the water rose above the floor level by 10 30cm in addition bridges were destroyed on the section of the koo balykcha road and considerable damage was done to the economy flooding is observed in the other settlements of the province the freezing process is a combination of all the ice phenomena taking place on the rivers the beginning of ice phenomena in the form of submerged landfast ice slob averagely falls on november 2 landfast ice on the river averagely set on november 19 is steady the average duration of landfast ice is 168 days the maximum thickness of ice during the observation period is 125cm in spring during the ice drift jam phenomena can often be seen on the chulyshman river several settlements the villages of ulagan balyktuyul and pasparta are subject to the negative influence of icing processes in ulagan village activity of processes is high there are three sections of icing development in the locality the situation is caused by the complete freezing of the riverbed of the great ulagan coastal erosion is developed fragmentarily in the floodplain and terrace areas the maximum erosion is confined to the peak of the flood by the degree of avalanche danger a significant part of the province refers to areas with a strong avalanche hazard with a dense network of powerful avalanches avalanches descend systematically with an interval of 2 3 years 3 5 ukoksko chuyskaya province ukoksko chuyskaya province differs from the other provinces in its landscapes and has more similarities with the neighboring territories of mongolia than with the other altai provinces three nras were singled out within the province djulukulsky chuysko kuraisky and ukoksky the climate of the province is sharply continental its feature is large daily and annual temperature differences table 3 there are two large rivers on the region influxes of the katun river the chuya river 320km and the argut river 232km the formation of river water flow is characterized by the presence of a powerful modern glaciation of the ridges of tabyn bogdo ola the continental climate and the presence of permafrost the average annual water discharge for the argut river near the village of argut 92m3 s for the chuya river on the border of the district 42m3 s lower specific rivers water content of the chuya river basin is explained by the ridges of the chuya hollow blocking the moisture bearing winds from penetration melt snow and glaciers waters rain and ground water take part in nourishment of the rivers rivers with an average height of the catchment from 600 to 2000m reach the greatest value of groundwater recharge at high altitudes the share of groundwater recharge significantly decreases it reaches only 9 10 of the annual recharge on the rivers of highland areas the chuya river in the lower reaches is an exception this is due to the fact that the chuya hollow filled with sand and pebble deposits is a huge accumulator of groundwater according to the nature of the annual expenditure regime all the rivers of the ukoksko chuyskaya province belong to rivers with summer high water regime most of the region is characterized by a lack of winter flow right influxes of the chuya river in the middle reaches are characterized as was already noted by increased groundwater supply about 30 and respectively a relatively high flow in winter in the highlands given that up to 90 of the annual flow occurs in the summer months it is natural and predictable that the water level will rise sharply and as a consequence flood the area in the years when several flow stimulating processes coincide the situation is further aggravated for example the may flood in 1985 was supported by the melting of an abnormally large amount of solid precipitation accumulated in the basins of most rivers of the region and then a month later a wave of high floods was triggered by rainfall and ice melting in the mountains storm rains combined with high air temperatures which led to intensive snow and ice melting in the mountains led to the july 2005 flood as a result a suspension bridge over the argut river and a wooden bridge across the ak alakha river were destroyed and two more bridges across the argut and karagem rivers were damaged sukhova et al 2015 the thermal and ice regime of rivers is determined by the course of air temperature the prevailing nourishment and the degree of regulation by lakes due to small rivers freezing to the bottom their valleys are covered with icing with an ice thickness of 2 3m flat icings are found mainly along the valleys of rivers and streams and can occupy the entire stream bed breadthwise and even spill over into the floodplains reaching a length of 1 10km they may also have the form of spots with a diameter of 2 5m in the chuysko kuraisky region there are mudslides which usually develop during a high water peak activity is high emergency situations are possible in the affected area there are residential estates a bridge and a road to the kyzyl tash village coastal erosion is developed fragmentarily in the bends of the rivers activation occurs in flood peak the degree of activity is high and medium the erosion is caused either by the reorganization of the channels or by the influence of thick icings 3 6 determination of recreational attractiveness and indicator of the hydro environmental tension based on the calculations a typology of natural and recreational areas was carried out according to the hydro environmental tension fig 3 considering the five hydrological tension classes defined only three classes were present in the study area favorable level of tension less than 40 tense level of tension 40 60 and critical level of tension above 60 most of the regions unfortunately are characterized by hydro environmental tension only in three districts uimonsky ukoksky and djulukulsky the situation is considered better and was classified as favorable one district of katunsko terektinskaya province north south chuysky causes the greatest concern because the indicator of the hydro environmental tension is critical the final stage of our study is the identification of areas of increased risk for the recreants by comparing the recreational attractiveness of water resources in the nra and the situation of the hydro environmental tension fig 4 in the regions that are most attractive for water resources the hydro environmental tension reaches a tense and critical level but in the rest of the region which are distant from the most attractive water crossing points a favorable level of tension coincides with the recreational attractiveness of the water bodies this implies that the most attractive water objects are those that have a good coastline have sufficient water level are socially and esthetically attractive the level of pollution is insignificant which is not determined in the presented study but there is a progressive deterioration in the quality of the aquatic environment which constitutes a threat to the country s ecological food and national security the wide scope of degradation processes occurring in the hydrosphere leads to events and phenomena of different nature these regions are distant from the main water crossing points they are the least used for recreational activities consequently in most of the russian territory of the transboundary altai which is less attractive than that which obtains all parameters and is presented in this study water resources are favorable and do not pose a risk to water and near water tourism the evaluation of the waterbodies is an important part of this study because it gives possibility to determine the hydro environmental tension that is why the hydro environmental situation is considered favorable the determination of the hydro environmental tension includes an aggregation of facts they are both the hydrological parameters of the region high water levels low water levels bottle necks ice jams ice mounds debris flow avalanches and stream bank erosions and the climatic ones during the research of the regional climate the authors used a sufficient amount of the literature sources and scientific encyclopedia which contributed to the comparison of the obtained results as well as allowed revealing specific climatic regularities the climatic indicators undoubtedly affect the hydrological ones as low temperatures lead to the formation of the ice jams and ice mounds the increase in the amount of precipitations leads to the banked up water level flooding and stream bank erosion all these factors take an adverse effect on the environmental situation in the region the degradation of the landscapes nearby water bodies may be accompanied with the increase in the volume of the surface water drainage and erosion all this affects the environmental situation and the use of the region for the recreational purposes favorable geographical location contributes to the development of tourism 4 conclusions the assessment of natural and recreational areas in terms of the recreational attractiveness of water resources showed that the most attractive natural and recreational areas include katunsky north south chuysky and djulukulsky located respectively in the katunsko terektinsky and chulyshmansky physiographic provinces it is worth noting that the entire region being surveyed is characterized by a sufficient degree of recreational attractiveness of water bodies for the development of recreation 14 nras the most favorable for the presence of water bodies is katunsky chulyshmansky and djulukulsky nras but the level of the hydroecological situation is calculated as tense the most favorable waterbodies in terms of availability and technological parameters are in katunsky chulyshmansky and djulukulsky nras due to the presence of icing north south chuysky nra is identified separately most of the region unfortunately is characterized by considerable level of hydro environmental tension the favorable level is only in three regions ukoksky uimonsky and djulukulsky natural changes in the hydrological regime of rivers lead to the emergence of risks of their negative impact on the population and recreational facilities in recent decades there has been an increase in the extreme nature of changes in the characteristic costs and water levels channel processes and ice phenomena the local and basin problems of the water quality change are not uncommon the risk of floods and other negative impacts of water can increase in new climatic and economic conditions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the authors state that the research was

1118,spatial and seasonal variability of diversity abundance and carbon sequestration potential of net phytoplankton were examined across the sewage effluent of six wetlands in waste stabilization ponds used for the treatment of municipal wastewater cum fish culture the values of the shannon weiner diversity index for myxophycaeae euglenophyceae and chrysophyceae were higher in the facultative pond compared to maturation ponds whereas that of bacillariophyceae was higher in later than in former the gross and net primary productivity of phytoplankton ranged from 3 594gcm 2 d 1 to 32 858gcm 2 d 1 and 2 34cm 2 d 1 to 15 227cm 2 d 1 respectively the p r ratio varied from 1 365 to 5 729 in different ponds investigated two clear cut zones were well recognized the facultative pond with the supremacy of blue green algae favoured immense carbon sequestration potential the total phytocarbon biomass in the facultative pond 60 491mgcm 3 was 2 5 4 folds higher than in subsequent maturation ponds the carbon sequestration potential of the entire wastewater stabilization pond system was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 further research is needed to prepare carbon budget by quantifying the carbon capture from atmosphere and emission into the atmosphere if any through mud water interactions of the bottom sediment keywords phytoplankton algal diversity carbon sequestration sewage fed ponds 1 introduction water bodies or wetlands act as sink or source of atmospheric carbon depending on the relative performance of ecosystem metabolism as a whole ecosystem services of wetlands are more focused towards environmental protection and water conservation through reuse of municipal wastewater the interplay of different members of the aquatic ecosystem would determine the spatiotemporal succession of microalgae that captures atmospheric driven carbon and largely involved in the cycling of carbon and global warming scenario qualitative differences of photosynthesis revealed that the photosynthetic efficiency of chlorella sp 5 1 47 was considerably higher 2 5 45 than anthrospira spirulina carlsson et al 2007 increase in co2 concentrations from 5 to 20 or above resulted in a drastic decline in growth of microalgae lee and lee 2003 whereas some strains of algae grew well when co2 concentrations remained between 30 and 70 saturation iwasaki et al 1996 sung et al 1999 unicellular green algae could fix co2 concentrations about 1000 times more than the ambient level 0 036 papazi et al 2008 by controlling the ph in the culture medium and introducing co2 to the algae on demand it was possible to achieve sustained algal growth even at 100 saturation of co2 olaizola 2003 further some species of microalgae could double their biomass within 3 5h the photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae was much higher in an aquatic environment ranging from 10 to 20 compared with 1 2 in most terrestrial plants singh and ahluwahlia 2013 experimental studies with elevated co2 tolerant microalgal consortium consisting of chlorella sp scenedesmus sp sphaerocystis sp and spirulina sp procured from wastewater fed ponds revealed that 20 co2 culture medium ph of 8 9 and an illumination intensity of 50 80μmolm 2 s 1 were optimal for high density growth of consortium for elevated co2 uptake along with high nutrient removal abilities po4 p up to 59 and nh4 n up to 39 this led to conclude that the microalgal consortium could be used as an effective tool for biofuel generation from wastewater as well as bioremediation of pollutants bhakta et al 2015 domestic wastewater may be defined as the used water that contains faeces urine bacteria protozoa and sullage or grey water discharged from household sources it also contains mineral and organic matter either in solution or in suspension or in a colloidal or pseudo colloidal state of organic matter wastewater is composed of more than 99 9 water and the rest 0 1 is solid which is the major determining

net phytoplankton since all the fractional size classes of phytoplankton were not considered due to some limitations in the present study it appears that the counts for total phytoplankton were somewhat underestimated particularly due to loss of picoplankton with 0 2 2μm linear size bellinger and sigee 2010 through plankton net used for estimation of chlorophyll a content of total phytoplankton water samples were vacuum filtered through a finer grade of glass fibre filters and was transferred into an airtight glass stoppered corning tube into this was added 5ml of 90 acetone

10min and the clear supernatant solution was transferred into 1cm cuvette the optical density of the chlorophyll extract of phytoplankton was measured at 665nm in a shimadzu uv spectrophotometer model uv 1601 using 90 acetone as blank then to the cuvette containing the extract was added 2 drops of 1n hcl acid and the entire solution was shaken after which the optical density of this solution was

according to the light and dark bottle method kormondy 2002 cullen 2001 water samples were collected bimonthly in 125ml pyrex glass bottles in triplicate from each pond taking all necessary precautions during filling to prevent air bubbles from remaining in the bottle all bottles were then exposed at the water surface under normal light conditions in situ temperature for primary productivity using the dark and light bottle method kormondy 2002 cullen 2001 for 6h of daylight the oxygen content of all the dark and light bottles were monitored using winkler s modified method the rates of primary production of phytoplankton gpp and npp and planktonic community respiration cr were expressed in terms of gcm 2 d 1 the mean value of each parameter was obtained from 24 samples

located across the sewage effluent gradient level of statistical significance was accepted at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality signature water temperature of different ponds ranged from 16 to 36 c during the course of the investigation the values of ph 6 8 and total alkalinity 147 53 190 91mgl 1 of water tended to rise gradually across the sewage effluent gradient the sum total of inorganic carbon c i of water was less variable among the ponds investigated the overall mean for last maturation pond 239 8mgl 1 was mere 11 less than facultative pond 251 84mgl 1 the amount of dissolved oxygen ranged from 7 65 to 9 52mgl 1 or 75 to 140 saturation during the course of the investigation the concentrations of ammonia remained distinctly higher in the facultative pond 4 38mgl 1 compared to maturation pond 1 01mgl 1 the concentration of nitrite n and nitrate n tended to decrease from the facultative pond to last maturation pond both highest 13 01mgl 1 and lowest 8 73mgl 1 values of total inorganic nitrogen n i were registered in the facultative pond compared to other ponds investigated the concentration of phosphate ranged from 0 35mgl 1 in the facultative pond to 0 09mgl 1 in last maturation pond fig 2 likewise the concentration of cod tended to decline from facultative to last maturation pond in response to gradual reduction of organic loading and consequent enhancement of dissolved oxygen of water 3 2 δ environmental carbon δ environmental carbon the sum of organic carbon of soil and the inorganic carbon of water remained high and low in the facultative pond and in last maturation pond respectively the same trend was followed in the case of organic carbon of soil fig 3 on the contrary the ratio of total inorganic carbon c i of water to the organic carbon of soil was higher in last maturation pond than in the facultative pond fig 3 3 3 phytoplankton structure of different groups of phytoplankton chlorophyceae was the most predominant group represented by 12 14 taxa in all the ponds investigated the most common genera represented were scenedesmus microspora selenastrum crucigenia chlorella and chlamydomonas on the other side ankistrodesmus and oocystis were common in the facultative pond but were absent in four maturation ponds myxophyceae was the next dominant group represented by microcystis anabaena merismopedia formidium oscillatoria coelospherium in the facultative pond bacillariophyceae was typified by 3 6 genera of which nitzschia and cyclotella were common in all the ponds chrysophyceae represented by synura was maximum in abundance in case of the facultative pond than in last maturation pond 3 4 phytoplankton diversity in general the values of shannon weiner diversity for myxophycaeae and euglenophyceae were higher in the facultative pond than in maturation ponds anova p 0 05 the reverse was true for chlorophyceae and bacillariophyceae anova p 0 05 table 3 the simpson s index hardly differed anova p 0 05 from one pond to another for all the groups of phytoplankton except for euglenophyceae which was highest in index value in the facultative pond and lowest in maturation pond anova p 0 05 the evenness index for myxophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae did not differ anova p 0 05 among the ponds investigated 3 5 phytoplankton abundance the total counts of phytoplankton fig 4 ranged from 499 to 38 817 104 m 3 in ponds examined the mean count of total phytoplankton in the facultative pond 11 532 104 m 3 was as much as 98 396 higher than those occurring in maturation ponds 1990 4541 104 m 3 phytobiomass in the facultative pond 206 783 4mgm 3 remained 167 317 higher than those occurring in four maturation ponds 49 545 77 188mgm 3 consequently phytoplankton carbon was maximum 62 661 5mgcm 3 and minimum 15 014mgcm 3 in the facultative pond and in last maturation pond respectively 3 6 chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton the amount of chlorophyll a of total phytoplankton was largely variable ranging from 9 84 to 6567 3mgm 3 in different ponds investigated fig 4 the amount of mean chlorophyll a was again maximum in the facultative pond 1253mgm 3 and minimum in the last maturation pond 300mgm 3 due to qualitative and quantitative differences of microalgae 3 7 phytoplankton biomass the dry weight of net phytoplankton ranged from 1623 to 206 783mgm 3 in different ponds investigated fig 5 spatially the distribution of dry weight of total phytoplankton was dominant in the facultative pond and less in maturation ponds 3 8 primary productivity of phytoplankton the values of gross primary productivity of phytoplankton gpp the net primary productivity of phytoplankton npp and planktonic community respiration cr were substantially higher in the facultative pond compared to maturation ponds fig 6 as anticipated the values of gpp npp and cr remained fairly high during summer than during the rest of the year 3 9 photosynthetic efficiency the photosynthetic efficiency of gpp was much higher 2 76 28 84 in the facultative pond than in maturation ponds 0 053 13 45 3 10 photosynthesis respiration p r ratio the ratio between gross primary photosynthesis to community respiration p r ranged from 0 39 to 8 6 in the facultative pond and 0 73 to 20 24 in maturation ponds fig 2 in the facultative ponds the values were more than unity during majority 69 73 of the occasions whereas it was still higher 91 100 in maturation ponds as a consequence an autotrophic state was more prevalent in maturation pond than in the facultative ponds 4 discussion interactions between water and ecosystem measured in terms of diversity abundance and activities of biogeochemical cycling bacteria and microalgal population played a key role in the reclamation as well as sequestration of carbon across the sewage effluent gradient a heavy input of organic loading conjoined with intensive biogeochemical cycling loop was responsible for the development of the eutrophic or hypertrophic state that favoured the dense bloom of blue green algae capable of an elevated level of carbon capture through photosynthesis in the upstream facultative pond this indicates the most dynamic characteristics of microbial subsystem of the facultative pond with dominance of blue green algae harke et al 2016 that inhibited other algae to grow the same niche through their toxins in the present study the estimated values of carbon sequestrated by the phytoplankton across the sewage effluent gradient ranged from 458 to 256 199mgcm 3 during the course of the investigation the sum of the total carbon sequestration potential was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 for the entire wastewater pond stabilization system as the seasonal variability of microalgal community occurred in response to the sum total of the ecological complexity the variability of carbon sequestration on a spatiotemporal scale was anticipated while examining the microbial dynamics in wastewater fed ponds lahiri et al 2015 demonstrated the heterogeneity of the microbial activity with spatiotemporal diversity of different biogeochemical cycling bacteria across the sewage effluent gradient the phytocarbon content of microalgae was found to be the direct function of δ carbon content of the wastewater system fig 7 the reciprocal relationship between the algal carbon and δ environmental carbon in these sewage fed ponds implied that production of algal carbon was reduced per unit of environmental carbon in the last maturation pond mp 4 due to limitations caused by less amount of carbon per unit area or ecological complexity interactions manifested in the downstream of sewage effluent gradient substantial reduction in the ratios of total inorganic carbon c i of water to soil organic carbon and n i p prevailed in the last maturation pond compared to the facultative pond was clearly indication of such a proposition it is evident that carbon removal capacity varied depending upon the group or species of phytoplankton carlsson et al 2007 elevated pco2 1000 1500mgl 1 enhanced both the rate and magnitude of organic carbon removal by bacterioplankton communities and this increased removal was largely due to enhanced respiration rather than the enhanced production of bacterioplankton biomass james et al 2017 it is propounded that the ecological process driven reclaimed water played a key role in the selection of the phytoplankton community by shifting blue green algae to greens that served as the food for cultured fishes in maturation ponds the congenial water quality developed in response to holistic efforts of eco reclamation also regulated the fish growth in maturation ponds temperature and alkalinity of sewage fed wetlands have been stated to play a considerable role in regulating the gross primary production and phytoplankton communities saha et al 2016 in essence reclamation of sewage effluents occurred through the functioning of different subsystems of the ecosystem such as solar energy driven autotrophic subsystem primary productivity dependent heterotrophic animal community subsystem interacting microbial subsystem for decomposition and mineralization of organic matter biogeochemical cycling loop sedimentation benthic animal driven bioturbation and chelation led to the complex formation of heavy metals and inactivation of toxic metals further structural design and self purification of ecosystem promoted amelioration of water quality through feedback mechanisms as a consequence two clear cut zones across the sewage effluent gradient were recognized the first one the facultative pond at the upstream had greater carbon sequestration potential with dominance of blue green algae and the second one the maturation pond at the downstream dominated with green algae developed in response to integrated actions for reclamation and served as food for fishes in maturation ponds this suggests that co2 sequestration potential was not uniform throughout the sewage effluent gradient or even throughout the year but altered spatially and seasonally depending upon the nutrient enrichment water quality species composition and photosynthetic efficiency of that particular group of the phytoplankton community 5 conclusions along the biological gradient of household sewage treatment pond system the most immediate ponds had much higher potential of carbon sequestration with total phytocarbon biomass of 60 491mgcm 3 which decreased by 2 57 to 4 fold in the subsequent maturation ponds across the effluent gradient in total the carbon sequestration potential was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 for the entire wastewater pond stabilization system this was regulated by the availability of carbon inorganic and organic of water which tended to decrease from first pond 288 4mgl 1 to the last pond 252 28mgl 1 of waste stabilization pond system this was explained by ecological processes occurring in the ponds system specifically by the functioning of solar energy driven autotrophic subsystem primary productivity dependent heterotrophic animal community subsystem interacting microbial subsystem for decomposition and mineralization of organic matter it is likely that apart from wastewater purification service the interactions of phytoplankton and bacteria growing in wastewater stabilization ponds are capable of providing carbon sequestration services which was significant for mitigation of regional warming and climate change this warrants future research for quantification of carbon capture from atmosphere

supremacy of blue green algae favoured immense carbon sequestration potential the total phytocarbon biomass in the facultative pond 60 491mgcm 3 was 2 5 4 folds higher than in subsequent maturation ponds the carbon sequestration potential of the entire wastewater stabilization pond system was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 further research is needed to prepare carbon budget by quantifying the carbon capture from atmosphere and emission into the atmosphere if any through mud water interactions of the bottom sediment keywords phytoplankton algal diversity carbon sequestration sewage fed ponds 1 introduction water bodies or wetlands act as sink or source of atmospheric carbon depending on the relative performance of ecosystem metabolism as a whole ecosystem services of wetlands are more focused towards environmental protection and water conservation through reuse of municipal wastewater the interplay of different members of the aquatic ecosystem would determine the spatiotemporal succession of microalgae that captures atmospheric driven carbon and largely involved in the cycling of carbon and global warming scenario qualitative differences of photosynthesis revealed that the photosynthetic efficiency of chlorella sp 5 1 47 was considerably higher 2 5 45 than anthrospira spirulina carlsson et al 2007 increase in co2 concentrations from 5 to 20 or above resulted in a drastic decline in growth of microalgae lee and lee 2003 whereas some strains of algae grew well when co2 concentrations remained between 30 and 70 saturation iwasaki et al 1996 sung et al 1999 unicellular green algae could fix co2 concentrations about 1000 times more than the ambient level 0 036 papazi et al 2008 by controlling the ph in the culture medium and introducing co2 to the algae on demand it was possible to achieve sustained algal growth even at 100 saturation of co2 olaizola 2003 further some species of microalgae could double their biomass within 3 5h the photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae was much higher in an aquatic environment ranging from 10 to 20 compared with 1 2 in most terrestrial plants singh and ahluwahlia 2013 experimental studies with elevated co2 tolerant microalgal consortium consisting of chlorella sp scenedesmus sp sphaerocystis sp and spirulina sp procured from wastewater fed ponds revealed that 20 co2 culture medium ph of 8 9 and an illumination intensity of 50 80μmolm 2 s 1 were optimal for high density growth of consortium for elevated co2 uptake along with high nutrient removal abilities po4 p up to 59 and nh4 n up to 39 this led to conclude that the microalgal consortium could be used as an effective tool for biofuel generation from wastewater as well as bioremediation of pollutants bhakta et al 2015 domestic

according to the light and dark bottle method kormondy 2002 cullen 2001 water samples were collected bimonthly in 125ml pyrex glass bottles in triplicate from each pond taking all necessary precautions during filling to prevent air bubbles from remaining in the bottle all bottles were then exposed at the water surface under normal light conditions in situ temperature for primary productivity using the dark and light bottle method kormondy 2002 cullen 2001 for 6h of daylight the oxygen content of all the dark and light bottles were monitored using winkler s modified method the rates of primary production of phytoplankton gpp and npp and planktonic community respiration cr were expressed in terms of gcm 2 d 1 the mean value of each parameter was obtained from 24 samples collected during the period of two years and used in the study diversity indices of net phytoplankton were calculated using the formula for shannon weiner index of general diversity simpson s index of dominance and evenness index odum et al 2004 the photosynthetic efficiency pe of microalgae that occurred in different ponds across the sewage effluent gradient was determined using the formula

gram carbon and multiplied by 0 12 all data were statistically evaluated analysis of variance was applied using the statistical package spss to find the differences in the response between ponds located across the sewage effluent gradient level of statistical significance was accepted at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water quality signature water temperature of different ponds ranged from 16 to 36 c during the course of the investigation the values of ph 6 8 and total alkalinity 147 53 190 91mgl 1 of water tended to rise gradually across the sewage effluent gradient the sum total of inorganic carbon c i of water was less variable among the ponds investigated the overall mean for last maturation pond 239 8mgl 1 was mere 11 less than facultative pond 251 84mgl 1 the amount of dissolved oxygen ranged from 7 65 to 9 52mgl 1 or 75 to 140 saturation during the course of the investigation the concentrations of ammonia remained distinctly higher in the facultative pond 4 38mgl 1 compared to maturation pond 1 01mgl 1 the concentration of nitrite n and nitrate n tended to decrease from the facultative pond to last maturation pond both highest 13 01mgl 1 and lowest 8 73mgl 1 values of total inorganic nitrogen n i were registered in the facultative pond compared to other ponds investigated the concentration of phosphate ranged from 0 35mgl 1 in the facultative pond to 0 09mgl 1 in last maturation pond fig 2 likewise the concentration of cod tended to decline from facultative to last maturation pond in response to gradual reduction of organic loading and consequent enhancement of dissolved oxygen of water 3 2 δ environmental carbon δ environmental carbon the sum of organic carbon of soil and the inorganic carbon of water remained high and low in the facultative pond and in last maturation pond respectively the same trend was followed in the case of organic carbon of soil fig 3 on the contrary the ratio of total inorganic carbon c i of water to the organic carbon of soil was higher in last maturation pond than in the facultative pond fig 3 3 3 phytoplankton structure of different groups of phytoplankton chlorophyceae was the most predominant group represented by 12 14 taxa in all the ponds investigated the most common genera represented were scenedesmus microspora selenastrum crucigenia chlorella and chlamydomonas on the other side ankistrodesmus and oocystis were common in the facultative pond but were absent in four maturation ponds myxophyceae was the next dominant group represented by microcystis anabaena merismopedia formidium oscillatoria coelospherium in the facultative pond bacillariophyceae was typified by 3 6 genera of which nitzschia and cyclotella were common in all the ponds chrysophyceae represented by synura was maximum in abundance in case of the facultative pond than in last maturation pond 3 4 phytoplankton diversity in general the values of shannon weiner diversity for myxophycaeae and euglenophyceae were higher in the facultative pond than in maturation ponds anova p 0 05 the reverse was true for chlorophyceae and bacillariophyceae anova p 0 05 table 3 the simpson s index hardly differed anova p 0 05 from one pond to another for all the groups of phytoplankton except for euglenophyceae which was highest in index value in the facultative pond and lowest in maturation pond anova p 0 05 the evenness index for myxophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae did not differ anova p 0 05 among the ponds investigated 3 5 phytoplankton abundance the total counts of phytoplankton fig 4 ranged from 499 to 38 817 104 m 3 in ponds examined the mean count of total phytoplankton in the facultative pond 11 532 104 m 3 was as much as 98 396 higher than those occurring in maturation ponds 1990 4541 104 m 3 phytobiomass in the facultative pond 206 783 4mgm 3 remained 167 317 higher than those occurring in four maturation ponds 49 545 77 188mgm 3 consequently phytoplankton carbon was maximum 62 661 5mgcm 3 and minimum 15 014mgcm 3 in the facultative pond and in last maturation pond respectively 3 6 chlorophyll a content of phytoplankton the amount of chlorophyll a of total phytoplankton was largely variable ranging from 9 84 to 6567 3mgm 3 in different ponds investigated fig 4 the amount of mean chlorophyll a was again maximum in the facultative pond 1253mgm 3 and minimum in the last maturation pond 300mgm 3 due to qualitative and quantitative differences of microalgae 3 7 phytoplankton biomass the dry weight of net phytoplankton ranged from 1623 to 206 783mgm 3 in different ponds investigated fig 5 spatially the distribution of dry weight of total phytoplankton was dominant in the facultative pond and less in maturation ponds 3 8 primary productivity of phytoplankton the values of gross primary productivity of phytoplankton gpp the net primary productivity of phytoplankton npp and planktonic community respiration cr were substantially higher in the facultative pond compared to maturation ponds fig 6 as anticipated the values of gpp npp and cr remained fairly high during summer than during the rest of the year 3 9 photosynthetic efficiency the photosynthetic efficiency of gpp was much higher 2 76 28 84 in the facultative pond than in maturation ponds 0 053 13 45 3 10 photosynthesis respiration p r ratio the ratio between gross primary photosynthesis to community respiration p r ranged from 0 39 to 8 6 in the facultative pond and 0 73 to 20 24 in maturation ponds fig 2 in the facultative ponds the values were more than unity during majority 69 73 of the occasions whereas it was still higher 91 100 in maturation ponds as a consequence an autotrophic state was more prevalent in maturation pond than in the facultative ponds 4 discussion interactions between water and ecosystem measured in terms of diversity abundance and activities of biogeochemical cycling bacteria and microalgal population played a key role in the reclamation as well as sequestration of carbon across the sewage effluent gradient a heavy input of organic loading conjoined with intensive biogeochemical cycling loop was responsible for the development of the eutrophic or hypertrophic state that favoured the dense bloom of blue green algae capable of an elevated level of carbon capture through photosynthesis in the upstream facultative pond this indicates the most dynamic characteristics of microbial subsystem of the facultative pond with dominance of blue green algae harke et al 2016 that inhibited other algae to grow the same niche through their toxins in the present study the estimated values of carbon sequestrated by the phytoplankton across the sewage effluent gradient ranged from 458 to 256 199mgcm 3 during the course of the investigation the sum of the total carbon sequestration potential was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 for the entire wastewater pond stabilization system as the seasonal variability of microalgal community occurred in response to the sum total of the ecological complexity the variability of carbon sequestration on a spatiotemporal scale was anticipated while examining the microbial dynamics in wastewater fed ponds lahiri et al 2015 demonstrated the heterogeneity of the microbial activity with spatiotemporal diversity of different biogeochemical cycling bacteria across the sewage effluent gradient the phytocarbon content of microalgae was found to be the direct function of δ carbon content of the wastewater system fig 7 the reciprocal relationship between the algal carbon and δ environmental carbon in these sewage fed ponds implied that production of algal carbon was reduced per unit of environmental carbon in the last maturation pond mp 4 due to limitations caused by less amount of carbon per unit area or ecological complexity interactions manifested in the downstream of sewage effluent gradient substantial reduction in the ratios of total inorganic carbon c i of water to soil organic carbon and n i p prevailed in the last maturation pond compared to the facultative pond was clearly indication of such a proposition it is evident that carbon removal capacity varied depending upon the group or species of phytoplankton carlsson et al 2007 elevated pco2 1000 1500mgl 1 enhanced both the rate and magnitude of organic carbon removal by bacterioplankton communities and this increased removal was largely due to enhanced respiration rather than the enhanced production of bacterioplankton biomass james et al 2017 it is propounded that the ecological process driven reclaimed water played a key role in the selection of the phytoplankton community by shifting blue green algae to greens that served as the food for cultured fishes in maturation ponds the congenial water quality developed in response to holistic efforts of eco reclamation also regulated the fish growth in maturation ponds temperature and alkalinity of sewage fed wetlands have been stated to play a considerable role in regulating the gross primary production and phytoplankton communities saha et al 2016 in essence reclamation of sewage effluents occurred through the functioning of different subsystems of the ecosystem such as solar energy driven autotrophic subsystem primary productivity dependent heterotrophic animal community subsystem interacting microbial subsystem for decomposition and mineralization of organic matter biogeochemical cycling loop sedimentation benthic animal driven bioturbation and chelation led to the complex formation of heavy metals and inactivation of toxic metals further structural design and self purification of ecosystem promoted amelioration of water quality through feedback mechanisms as a consequence two clear cut zones across the sewage effluent gradient were recognized the first one the facultative pond at the upstream had greater carbon sequestration potential with dominance of blue green algae and the second one the maturation pond at the downstream dominated with green algae developed in response to integrated actions for reclamation and served as food for fishes in maturation ponds this suggests that co2 sequestration potential was not uniform throughout the sewage effluent gradient or even throughout the year but altered spatially and seasonally depending upon the nutrient enrichment water quality species composition and photosynthetic efficiency of that particular group of the phytoplankton community 5 conclusions along the biological gradient of household sewage treatment pond system the most immediate ponds had much higher potential of carbon sequestration with total phytocarbon biomass of 60 491mgcm 3 which decreased by 2 57 to 4 fold in the subsequent maturation ponds across the effluent gradient in total the carbon sequestration potential was calculated to be 133 279mgcm 3 for the entire wastewater pond stabilization system this was regulated by the availability of carbon inorganic and organic of water which tended to decrease from first pond 288 4mgl 1 to the last pond 252 28mgl 1 of waste stabilization pond system this was explained by ecological processes occurring in the ponds system specifically by the functioning of solar energy driven autotrophic subsystem primary productivity dependent heterotrophic animal community subsystem interacting microbial subsystem for decomposition and mineralization of organic matter it is likely that apart from wastewater purification service the interactions of phytoplankton and bacteria growing in wastewater stabilization ponds are capable of providing carbon sequestration services which was significant for mitigation of regional warming and climate change this warrants future research for quantification of carbon capture from atmosphere and emission into the atmosphere if any through mud water interactions of the bottom sediment conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

1119,the objective of the swatch21 project is to improve our understanding of eco hydrologic services at the catchment level and biodiversity at the river scale six research questions are proposed i how can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling ii what is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services iii how can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools iv what will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers v can we meet the targets of multi sectorial river related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios vi how detailed do es data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions the above questions are

programs swatch21 soil and water assessment tool project for switzerland in the 21st century wcmc world conservation monitoring center 1 introduction the main objective of the swatch21 project is to improve our understanding of and to model hydrologic ecosystem services supplies and demands at the catchment level as well as aquatic biodiversity at the river scale the models are used to explore the outcomes of climate and landuse change forecasting scenarios on multiple policy targets and to explore the correlations between ecosystem services bundles fig 1 in 2016 the national center for climate services and the hydrology division of the federal office of the environment has launched a new focus area climate change and its consequences on hydrology in switzerland hydro ch2018 to establish a platform for knowledge sharing between researchers and end users in the area of climate change and hydrology 1 1 http www bafu admin ch wasser 13472 16405 index html lang en this platform should provide up to date science based information to assist decision makers on determining adaptation policies to climate changes the swatch21 project will contribute to this science policy interface effort by bringing new and original solutions to explore the impact of climate and landuse changes on eco hydrologic services of swiss rivers anticipating on some not all of the conclusions of this synthesis the swatch21 project aims at filling some of the knowledge gaps 1 switzerland is a data rich country but the data needed to assess hydrologic services and biodiversity is in long term time series and difficult to gather 2 the impact of glacier and snow melting on hydrological services is not well understood 3 the provision of hydrologic services from river catchments has not been assessed across switzerland 4 the impacts of expected environmental changes on river species diversity and ecosystem services at the swiss scale has not been explored 5 the capacity to address multi sectorial policy targets is weak and 6 the desired level of model complexity to answer policy needs is unknown theses research gaps led to the six research questions in the first question q1 we explore how the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling can be improved hydrological and ecological modeling rely on accessing a large amount of high quality heterogeneous data e g weather hydrology hydropower species climate landuse and soil data in order to improve the cycle of flow from raw observations to decision making the initial time necessary to access and format the input data is often a limiting factor preparing a standard framework of essential data would greatly facilitate the cycle of decision making in the second question q2 we couple a glacier melt model with swat to better consider the future regime shifts indeed less sustained summer flow and more concentrated spring melt flows might critically reduce the annual hydropower production due to intake of overflow during spring and reduced flow during summer schaefli et al 2016 an increased seasonal melt coupled with rains will bring more intense floods because rain rather than snow falls on mountains in spring river flows will peak earlier in the year leaving summer months with increasingly drier conditions in question three q3 the aim is to assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and modeling tools the assessment of hydrological ecosystem services necessitates the evaluation of both the supply and demand side of the services increasing further the complexity of the data gathering and modeling effort in the fourth question q4 we explore the impacts of climate and landuse changes on species diversity in rivers the question here is to test what the respective impacts of climate and landuse changes could be on species diversity at the river level are these impacts similar across the swiss territory and according to different plausible forecasting scenarios for the fifth question q5 we explore the targets of multi sectorial river related policies e g biodiversity agriculture flood under different climate and landuse scenarios with this question we address the relationship between the value of ecosystems services on one hand and multiple often contradictory policies on the other hand as environmental policies are often segmented it is very difficult to assess whether multi sectorial policy targets can be reached simultaneously by using scenarios we will explore plausible futures of hydrologic es and biodiversity in the last question q6 we explore how detailed do es and species distribution data and models need to be to answer relevant policy needs such as the national water climate and biodiversity strategies this final question concerns the level of details that needs to be obtained when modeling environmental systems providing es in order to address policy relevant questions by comparing several approaches to model the hydrology and biodiversity of swiss rivers under different forecasting scenarios we explore the impact of the related uncertainty on selected policy targets expressed as es indicators it is clear that scientists always try to improve their data and models but this often results in more complexity extra costs and longer analyses exploring the relationship between model complexity and their significance on decision making processes is crucial in order to reduce the gap between these two activities 1 1 soil and water assessment tool soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is a continuous time process based semi distributed hydrologic model running on daily or sub daily time steps although many hydrological models have been used in switzerland such as wasim eth alaoui et al 2014 roessler et al 2014 prevah antonetti et al 2016 sehr echo schaefli et al 2014 hbv finger et al 2015 and topkapi eth foglia et al 2013 most suffer from various sources of limitations these include suitability of application to mountainous regions only lack of time continuity lack of one or more essential components for our study such as water quality crop yield agricultural management and sediment transport etc in the light of anticipated changes stemming from climate landuse change effects we find it timely to build a comprehensive agro hydro meteorological model of the entire switzerland and chose the model swat for the reasons outlined below indeed the swat model has been developed to quantify the impact of land management practices and climate on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds with varying soils landuses and management conditions over long periods of time the program therefore lends itself easily to climate and landuse change analysis swat is a valuable watershed scale management tool and we chose this program for our purposes because i it integrates many components such as hydrology climate nutrient soil sediment crop pesticide bacteria and agricultural management ii it has been successfully applied worldwide in many different climate and landuse situations iii the program is actively maintained and continuously updated with new and up to date knowledge of watershed processes and iv many side programs are written for swat from calibration and uncertainty analysis to graphic packages for visualization and animation of the results hence over time a universal consensus is built around the accuracy and usefulness of the program as there exist over 3000 scientific publications where swat has been used to address numerous watershed issues gassman et al 2007 gassman and wang 2015 in swat the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed is preserved by topographically dividing the basin into multiple subbasins and further into hydrologic response units hru based on soil landuse and slope characteristics these subdivisions enable the model to reflect differences in evapotranspiration for various crops and soils in each hru and on each time step the hydrologic and vegetation growth processes are simulated based on the curve number or green ampt rainfall runoff partitioning and the heat unit phenological development method neitsch et al 2011 the swat model has been applied worldwide and its hydrologic components successfully tested but the applications are mostly in areas where stream flows are predominantly generated from rainfall events arnold et al 1998 faramarzi et al 2009 rouholahnejad et al 2014 schuol et al 2008a b yang and abbaspour 2007 the model has less frequently been applied in mountainous watersheds and a few recent studies have shown model limitations in mountainous regions abbaspour et al 2007 2015 fontaine et al 2002 qi and grunwald 2005 rahman et al 2013 wang and messe 2005 although there have been different experiments with snow glacier melts and swat model there is clearly a lack of formal methods of snow glacier melt models coupled with the swat coupling a formal snow glacier melt model to swat makes it more apt to swiss hydrologic conditions allowing better predictions of river discharges and their impact on hydropower generation this will in general enable us to more accurately use swat s capabilities to study the impacts of climate on water quantity and quality in the alpine regions and other glacier snow dominated watersheds around the world 1 2 ecosystem services assessment and modeling as early as 2005 the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 used the es approach to assess the consequences of ecosystem changes for human well being the aim was also to establish the scientific foundation to enhance the conservation policy and sustainable use of ecosystems at different scales and under different scenarios the mea approach provided strong support for the creation of the intergovernmental science policy platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes larigauderie and mooney 2010 emphasizing the importance of scientific information and its transparency vohland et al 2011 the main challenge of ipbes remains to improve the science based policy interface for bes at the international level at different temporal and spatial scales perrings et al 2011 at the national scale the uk has published a spatially explicit assessment on the impact of landuse change on agricultural production emissions and sequestration of greenhouse gases recreational sites urban green space and biodiversity bateman et al 2013 in switzerland several studies have been published assessing for example the avalanche protection from forests on urban planning grêt regamey et al 2008 2013 or environmental policy in mountainous regions hirschi et al 2013 but only few studies were carried out on hydrologic ecosystem services grêt regamey et al 2011 our project can however be seen as an extension of the pnr61 hydroserv 2 2 http www nrp61 ch en projects project hydroserv project that assess ecosystem services in the emme valley to inform decision makers the impact of spatial scales on the quality of data available to assess es supply and demand burkhard et al 2012 was also investigated suggesting a multi scale approach when making decision based on es as well as the importance of the interface for stakeholder implications klein et al 2015 at a regional scale flanders in belgium has produced a state of the art assessment of es stevens et al 2015 by analyzing the relationships between the supply and demand side of the services as well as on the impact of external drivers such as landuse and climate changes and by presenting the results on very comprehensive dashboards the tradeoffs competition between services and synergies reinforcement of services between supply use and demand sides of services are also analyzed demonstrating the need to assess es cohesively several important eu research projects are building on the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capitals as ways to improve the interface between scientific knowledge on one side and policy decision making on the other side e g opera openness esmeralda mars ecopotential two of these projects are sharing the development of a particularly interesting knowledge hub www oppla eu on nature based solutions that was launched in september 2016 the openness project has reviewed the concept of es bundles berry et al 2016 as co occurring services in space and time tradeoffs and synergies turkelboom et al 2016 as interacting services positively or negatively a service can be used when it coincides between a supply and a demand the eu land and ecosystem accounts eea 2006 2011 weber 2007 provides a 1km2 grid account that can be scaled up to any administrative or ecosystem zoning e g river basins coastal zones or biogeographic regions a more recent data and model driven methodology maes et al 2013 was proposed to respond to action 5 of the eu biodiversity strategy to produce es indicators covering europe another recent european effort proposes to map the potential of ecosystems to supply es under the impact of landuse changes haines young et al 2012 finally several global assessments were proposed including the economic valuation of 17 global es costanza et al 1997 naidoo et al 2008 tallis et al 2012 turner et al 2007 and the assessment of sustainable development goals wood and declerck 2015 the growing interest for es encouraged the development of an international classification cices haines young and potschin 2013 based on the assumption that es should be regarded as fundamentally dependent on living resources e g not abiotic processes and serving human well being either as es ecosystem goods or ecosystem benefits the last version of cices proposes a hierarchical classification from three main branches of services provisioning regulation and maintenance cultural into a 3 4 digits classification several spatially explicit tools have been developed and compared to assess es bagstad et al 2013 the integrative tools encompass all the steps of es assessment from data access to modeling es assessment and valuation bsr 2011 popular applications include for invest kareiva et al 2011 tallis et al 2008 solves sherrouse et al 2011 and aries villa et al 2014 that are relying for the moment on relatively simple ecosystem models more complex existing models can also be used to assess the different es however the scientific and human investments are often too large for the available resources to justify their implementation when assessing several es in parallel in 2015 brauman 2015 reviewed 381 papers on hydrological services and concluded that the direct link from biophysical processes to human well being makes hydrological services an appealing foundation for watershed management leading to new research if we can overcome the interdisciplinary challenges and the conflicts on water needs brauman 2015 offers also a very useful framework linking ecohydrologic processes to hydrologic services in 2016 francesconi et al 2016 reviewed 44 papers on the use of swat to evaluate hydrological services indeed recent papers based on swat outputs have started to establish some links between the evaluation of river es and the nexus approach for instance in the danube catchment karabulut et al 2015 the authors have published a study proposing new standards to estimate water demands from swat outputs within a nexus framework and taking into account upstream downstream relationships in the black sea catchment fasel et al 2016 1 3 species distribution modeling even though landuse is used to assess es es depend rather on the distribution of biodiversity expressed as species and or ecosystems spatial predictions of species and ecosystem distribution have made huge advances in the last two decades by combining geographic information systems with statistical modeling elith et al 2006 several tools have been developed to facilitate these analytical workflows for example grasp lehmann et al 2002 maggini et al 2006 maxent elith et al 2011 biomod thuiller et al 2009 caret kuhn 2008 some of the main challenges have been to model species distribution from presence only data elith et al 2006 phillips et al 2009 zaniewski et al 2002 manage adequately spatial autocorrelation in species data crase et al 2014 interactions between exploratory variables as well as biotic interactions between species de araujo et al 2014 species distribution modeling are being used for informing several biodiversity conservation tools such as the assessment of species red list status fivaz and gonseth 2014 protected areas prioritization lehtomaki and moilanen 2013 species vulnerability to climate change maggini et al 2014 or ecosystem restoration targets gaston et al 2014 while many different statistical approaches exist for species distribution modeling elith et al 2006 e g glm gam mars brt rf the tendency has been to develop tools capable of building ensemble forecasting from several approaches at once e g biomod caret while increasing the complexity and computing time of the statistical analyses and decreasing the understanding of each separate statistical approaches by the user for this reason we suggest to focus on a reduced set of techniques with high predictive performance indeed species distribution modeling is of limited value to conservation assessment when the overall diversity across large region depends more on differences in biological composition amongst locations i e beta diversity than on site level diversity ferrier et al 2007 thus distance approaches like gdm can complement common alpha diversity assessment and offers an insight into beta diversity species distribution modeling in river ecosystems is clearly lagging behind its terrestrial counterpart leathwick et al 2006 with much less studies published a recent example however has been published recently to model family and ept richness at a landscape level across switzerland kaelin and altermatt 2016 one of the challenges in aquatic macroinvertebrate distribution modeling is to consider the upstream downstream relationship and the temporal variation of the hydrologic regimes advanced hydrological models like swat are therefore promising to translate landscape variables into biological conditions several studies have already linked swat and aquatic biodiversity models wu et al 2018 kakouei et al 2017 including some in the context of climate change guse et al 2015 woznicki et al 2016 they used different response variables such as biotic indicators and species abundance different modeling techniques and as we intend to do in our project they included hydrologic indices calculated from swat output time series as model predictors 2 material methods and initial results 2 1 choice of study site and biodiversity groups in order to be able to address several possible contradictory river related policies we decided to concentrate on a single scale approach at a national level as a data rich country switzerland can serve as a laboratory to explore the level of complexity needed to better inform decision makers about ecosystems services worldwide the workable solutions that we hope to find through this project will therefore be more easily generalized in other countries by adapting the policy context from the beginning of the 1970s ecosystem health was seen increasingly as valuable in many societies and multiple approaches based on benthic macroinvertebrates have been developed to assess the ecological status of rivers and streams bonada et al 2006 these organisms offer multiple advantages for biomonitoring as they are ubiquitous they offer a large spectrum of responses to different stressors high taxonomical and functional diversity they are basically sedentary which allow effective spatial analyses they have a relatively long life cycle they can easily be sampled and keys to identification are available for many groups rosenberg and vincent 1993 all macroinvertebrate groups will be considered in our analyses however we will specially focus on the ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept as they are commonly used for assessing river ecosystem and identified at the species level in several nationwide monitoring projects furthermore a relatively recent red list lubini et al 2012 has been published on these groups based on new data collections we also consider a few emblematic fish species as an indication of their recreation use 2 2 analytical workflow the general organization of the work program flows logically from the research gaps and questions starting with 1 the creation of a spatial data infrastructure sdi and an application programming interface api to facilitate the use and reuse of initial condition data 2 into the integration of a glacier and snow melt model with the hydrologic soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 program 3 followed by hydrologic es modeling and 4 river species distribution modeling plus 5 the analyses of the impacts of climate and landuse forecasting scenarios on policy targets linked to specific es and biodiversity indicators backcasting scenarios grêt regamey and brunner 2011 that would explore different pathways to selected policy targets are not considered in the first phase of the project but the proposed modeling framework should allow to explore these types of scenarios as well throughout the project we carry out development of a second api connecting the input data with the different pieces of software to automate the production of the swatch21 outputs fig 2 2 2 1 data spatial data infrastructure and application program interface the aim of this first task is to gather all the necessary data for the project in a geospatial database postgresql with postgis accessible through a spatial data infrastructure sdi and via an application program interface api in order to make them readily available as web services and in different programming environment such as in r for statistics and python for gis lehmann et al 2017a switzerland has several centralized geospatial database the main abiotic data needed for this project is described in table 1 the biotic data will focus on macroinvertebrate species and especially on the ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept groups most of the available data was collected as presence only data but exhaustive standardized samplings were recently carried out within the framework of the swiss biodiversity monitoring program bdm and the national surface water quality monitoring program nawa 2 2 2 glacier evolution runoff model state of the art glacier and snow melt models glacier evolution runoff model germ farinotti et al 2012 huss et al 2008 2014 will be coupled with swat to produce a transient dataset of runoff changes and variability from the recent past to the future using germ glacier surface mass balance and runoff are calculated in daily time steps using a distributed temperature index melt and accumulation model model components account for changes in glacier extent and surface elevation evaporation and runoff routing germ includes components for snow accumulation distribution snow and ice melt 3d glacier geometry change evapotranspiration and runoff routing the performance of the coupled swat germ models will be tested at in the altesch catchment in the rhone watershed 2 2 3 modeling hydrologic ecosystem services supply and demand in this task we will use two different hydrological models swat 3 3 http swat tamu edu invest 4 4 http www naturalcapitalproject org invest html to model water quantity and quality across the swiss river network and to quantify various ecosystem services swat is a complex hydrological model running on a daily basis using input from weather stations rainfall min and max temperature solar radiation wind soil information landuse landcover data digital elevation map and data from agricultural management practices the multiple sensitive parameters of the model are calibrated from observation of water yield sediment and nutrient loads measured at river gauges fig 3 the most commonly used tool for model calibration is swat cup arnold et al 2012 swat has been used in most countries in the world and so far few papers have been published which included swiss hydrology and water quality by the applicants abbaspour et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 once calibrated swat model return tens of output variables on a daily monthly or yearly basis such as water yield sediment loads and nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter concentrations these outputs are prepared at the subcatchment scale defined during the construction of the model and can vary from a few hectares to several thousands of square kilometers depending on the case study needs as swat was not particularly developed for mountainous regions several improvements on its calibration are needed in a country like switzerland fontaine et al 2002 rahman et al 2013 for this reason we introduced the germ model in the previous task to incorporate into swat for more accurate snow and glacier melt inputs barnhart et al 2014 ficklin et al 2012 with the expected swat improvements this project will derive daily outputs at high spatial resolution for about 5000 sub catchments in switzerland for various hydrologic ecosystem services e g water yield for hydropower blue water available for agriculture or domestic uses sediment nutrient and flood water retention other river attributes will be calculated with a geographic information system such as river sinuosity percent of forest and percent of agricultural and urban landcovers to test whether a simpler hydrological model can provide the necessary decision making information we will also use invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs that was develop as a suite of tools to spatially assess provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services haines young and potschin 2013 indeed invest was developed to bring simplified scientific information in the hands of decision makers to assess tradeoffs between policy and management options the suite of tools includes sixteen invest models for terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems the freshwater models presently include water yield necessary for hydropower production and its potential value but also its availability for other water uses agriculture domestic sediment retention and water purification that quantifies nutrient retention compared to swat invest is based on much simpler models that run on a yearly basis and that depend on a reduced number of parameters but the two models produce the same basic hydrological outputs that can be compared dennedy frank et al 2016 the outputs of swat concerns typically water quantity and quality and can be characterized by their spatial and temporal resolution the highest possible temporal and spatial resolution will be selected while building the swat model in function of the tradeoffs between model complexity and the computing time needed to run a model and therefore evaluate new scenarios we typically expect to use swat output on a daily or monthly base with sub catchments of about 10km2 about 5000 sub catchments for switzerland many ecosystem services supplies can be derived relatively simply from swat or invest outputs others will need additional analyses to assess for instance biodiversity support recreational values fishing potential transportation and flood water retention fig 4 below is the list of used services that we intend to model based on the classification proposed by brauman 2015 as the result of the combination of the water services supplies modeled by swat and or invest and the methodology used in fasel et al 2016 to assess water demand in the black sea catchment diverted waters provisioning services agriculture water used by crops will be directly derived from swat outputs irrigation demands are mapped in swat from available national data sources into agriculture management files drinking water the amount of blue water used for drinking will be assessed from the population distribution and statistics on the population water withdrawal intensity livestock blue water used by livestock will be estimated from the distribution of different types of livestocks thermoelectric power generation the amount of blue water used for cooling thermoelectric power plants will be assessed according to the generated electricity type of fuel and cooling system used by the power plants detailed data will be obtained for the nuclear power plants in situ water provisioning services hydropower blue water transformed into energy by hydropower will be estimated using the distribution and size of existing dams evaporation from reservoirs will be estimated by using the swat outputs on potential evapotranspiration transportation the amount of water needed will be derived from navigable section locations on the swiss river network water damage mitigation regulating services flood water retention the critical consecutive days analyzer ccda is a module of climate change toolkit cct which has been developed at eawag vaghefi et al 2017mm it is used to analyze extreme events dry and wet periods and find the occurrences of past flooding patterns in the future data nutrient and sediment retention will be directly derived from swat and invest outputs they will be assessed by comparing the different landuse scenarios spiritual and esthetic cultural services fishing for recreation this service will be assessed by modeling the species distribution of emblematic fish species such as trout using species distribution models recreation the recreational value of river beds will be assessed by a combination of gis analyses of accessibility from roads and walking tracks and the density of photos made available on flickr snow duration for skiing activities will be assessed from historical remote sensing classification of landsat images with the swiss data cube giuliani et al 2017 supporting supporting services biodiversity alpha and beta diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates will be assessed by several modeling techniques based on careful selection of hydrologic topographic climatic geologic and land use explanatory variables derived from swat model and complementary gis analyses at catchment and river reach levels environmental flow requirement for biodiversity flow requirements will be estimated using a defined percentage of naturalized water flow allocated for preserving water ecosystems e g poff et al 2010 pastor et al 2014 overton et al 2014 this task should result in a new methodology to assess hydrologic es in switzerland that could be easily generalized in other countries or catchments the chosen approach will be streamlined by code developed in the python and or r languages and make use of their geospatial and statistical libraries task 6 2 2 4 modeling freshwater biodiversity along river networks and predicting possible future scenarios the aim of task 4 is to model the distribution of species in order to estimate how different climate and landuse scenarios would affect alpha and beta diversity in swiss rivers spatial pattern in aquatic macroinvertebrate will be modeled focusing on 1 discrete entities species or community and on 2 collective properties of biodiversity differentiation diversity ferrier 2002 on one hand we will use species distribution modeling techniques sdm like random forest breiman 2001 or boosted regression trees brt elith et al 2008 according to our preliminary results their predictive performance of these techniques was significantly superior to 6 other techniques fig 5 for our tests we used the r package biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 and allowed level 1 interaction for generalized linear model glm and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and 3 dimensions for the generalized additive model gam smooth term otherwise we used default parametrization fig 5 sdm predictions will provide an assessment of environmental change impacts on individual species fig 6 which can be used further to derive higher level entities as community types on the other hand we will use generalized dissimilarity modeling ferrier et al 2007 for assessing spatial patterns of turnover in community beta diversity this technique accommodates two types of nonlinearity common in ecological datasets 1 the variation in the rate of compositional turnover along environmental gradients and 2 the curvilinear relationship between biological and ecological distance the r package gdm manion et al 2018 allows to make predictions across time to estimate the magnitude of expected change in biological composition in response to environmental change fitzpatrick et al 2011 final sets of predictors will be based on stepwise selection of hydrologic topographic climatic geologic and land use explanatory variables inspired from kuemmerlen et al 2014 both complementary approaches will allow to estimate how different climate and land use scenarios would affect alpha and beta diversity in swiss rivers 2 2 5 evaluating the relationship between ecosystem services bundles and multiple policy targets agriculture flood energy biodiversity based on future plausible climate and landuse scenarios first analyzing the current swiss policies and strategies for hydrology flood energy biodiversity and agriculture will identify key environmental policy targets the value of es services is derived directly from the analyses presented at the end of section 3 on modeling hydrologic ecosystem services supply and demand the es bundle analyses briner et al 2013 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 will explore the combination of different climate ch2018 2018 and three landuse wsl bolliger et al 2007 scenarios on es in relationship to key environmental policy targets grêt regamey and brunner 2011 fig 7 to estimate the impact of climate change on water resources of switzerland we will deploy the new ch2018 scenarios developed by a consortium consisting of meteoswiss eth zurich and the university of bern ch2018 2018 ch2018 data is based on the latest set of european climate model simulations from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex in cordex the global climate model simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 have been downscaled using regional climate models ch2018 is bias corrected for three emission scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the time span 1981 to 2099 in this study we will use the median value of several rcms for each rcp the landuse scenarios bolliger et al 2007 are based on a business as usual scenario that extrapolates trends observed between 1985 and 1997 into the future a liberalization scenario was defined with limited regulation while a lowered agricultural production scenario was created to foster conservation finally in order to assess the impacts of climate and landuse scenarios of es and related policy targets we will follow an experimental design fig 7 that will combine 3 climate scenarios 3 landuse scenarios 2 hydrological models 2 biodiversity models leading to a total of 36 models run with the swatch21 tool api that will be applied on all rivers of switzerland the experimental design will allow calculating the proportion of the 5000 subcatchments that reach the different policy targets in function of the different combination of climate and landuse change it will also allow to compare the outcome of each scenario to the current situation and to evaluate the differences between scenarios fig 7 a generalized linear mixed model glmm will allow also to explore which factor choice of climate scenario landuse scenario hydrologic model and species distribution model of the experimental design is more influencing the es and biodiversity assessment 2 2 6 swatch21 tools api the swatch21 tools api connects different pieces of input data and software swat invest brt rf gdm to automate the workflow for key es variables this allows information to be dynamically generated incorporating changes in or creating entirely new datasets software scenarios or policies and helps to streamline the process of going from data to decision making this approach is reusable and portable creating a process for replicable results and verification and a method that can be used to assess other environmental issues at different scales and locations by changing the input data and software components for swatch21 this is being used to create a large es dataset see table 2 for several scenarios and has great potential for reuse and interpretation as in lehmann et al 2017b this is achieved by creating middleware software to enable the models to interact via the open geospatial consortium ogc web processing service wps e g giuliani et al 2012 which provides an interoperable cloud based protocol for the exchange and processing of data this approach is inherently network based supporting distributed computing and is at the core of our framework for integrating heterogeneous processes this gives the ability to integrate previously disjointed models into a single complex process and better utilize existing resources 3 discussion 3 1 data sharing swatch21 is promoting data sharing through web services as promulgated by the open geospatial consortium ogc nogueras iso et al 2005 indeed policies are evolving toward making environmental data available with for instance the open data policy in switzerland 5 5 https opendata swiss the inspire directive in europe craglia 2010 and the geo data sharing principles at global level giuliani et al 2011 2016 however the access to data needed for eco hydrological modeling meteorological hydrological biological and pedological data remains limited by password protections policy restrictions and cost policies myroshnychenko et al 2015 web services and application programme interface api allow direct exchanges between machines as needed in modern applications over the internet lehmann et al 2017a these web based approach of data sharing in hydrology were reviewed in lehmann et al 2014 and are implemented in this project 3 2 model integration swatch21 will provide an integrated solution for accessing and sharing inputs and outputs of models as well as processing eco hydrologic models state of the art models germ swat invest brt rf gdm have been selected and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services the main outputs of the project will be new datasets made available to describe swiss rivers hydrology their predicted biodiversity and the related assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services e g water resources regulating services e g nutrient and sediment retention flood protection and cultural services e g biodiversity recreation such integration of models is necessary to be able to run and rerun a set of connected models under different environmental and or socio economic conditions according to different scenarios lehmann et al 2014 2017a furthermore the capacity of rerunning more easily an entire modeling workflow contributes to the replicability of scientific analyses mcnutt 2014 ostermann and grabell 2017 several solutions allow to orchestrate complex workflows connecting several models openmi gregersen et al 2007 moore and tindall 2005 has been developed in hydrology to link together models from different origins with different spatial and temporal scales this approach has recently been proposed for integrated water resources modeling buahin and horsburgh 2018 with web processing services wps models themselves become ogc web services allowing to run workflows on the internet castronova et al 2013 giuliani et al 2012 michaelis and ames 2009 and on different backends giuliani et al 2012 3 3 policy implications by making available new datasets from the outputs of models and scenarios swatch21 is addressing several policy needs in switzerland with a potential to be replicated in other regions at the swiss level the new biodiversity strategy 6 6 https www bafu admin ch bafu en home topics biodiversity publications studies publications swiss biodiversity strategy html integrates among its 10 strategic goals that by 2020 ecosystem services are recorded quantitatively and that sufficient knowledge is available for their consideration in decision making in order to reach this objective on river ecosystems much work is still needed as neither ecosystem services or biodiversity has been assessed and predicted across all rivers the swiss climate strategy for agriculture 7 7 http www fao org 3 a i3084e i3084e24 pdf explores ways to continue to ensure food supplies and provide social economic and ecosystem services agriculture and food production by adapting to climate change this strategy should be a guiding light for agriculture and food production in switzerland in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing conditions agriculture is intimately linked to water resources and to water quality and this relationship is fully integrated in tools like swat another policy relevant topic is the vulnerability of switzerland to flood 8 8 http www climateadaptation eu switzerland river floods which is increasing after a century in which only two major floods happened floods are the most economically damageable natural risk that concerns the most densely populated areas of switzerland swatch21 is bringing to these different policies new ways of assessing simultaneously the outcomes of scenarios on changes in ecosystem services that are themselves related to these policies such as water for hydropower water for agriculture and livestock water for power generation sediment retention nutrient retention flood water retention species diversity environment flow requirements by analyzing the synergies and tradeoffs between these services policy makers will be able to understand the connection between various sectors when making decisions another relevant aspect of swatch21 in the policy domain is related to so called essential water variables ewvs ewvs are being defined by the geo hydrology community as a minimum set of variables that are necessary to describe the water cycle lawford 2013 most of the ewvs are either inputs or outputs of a swat model meaning than when a swat model is calibrated it links together though a hydrological framework almost the entire set of ewvs this is particularly important to fully describe the water system and to inform different policy needs and indicators note that simultaneously essential climate variables ecvs bojinski et al 2014 and essential biodiversity variables ebvs pereira et al 2013 have been defined essential variables are the central concept of the european project geoessential that the first author of this article is coordinating 9 9 http www geoessential eu essential variables can be considered as an intermediate level of information between raw observations and policy indicators as a minimum set of variables necessary to describe a system finally brauman 2015 is demonstrating the concept of eco hydrologic services that are modeled in swatch21 create a link between biophysical processes to human well being and therefore provides the foundation of watershed management assess conservation benefits evaluate management practices prioritize siting account for externalities and perform trade off or cost benefit analysis 3 4 future developments potentially conflicting policy targets exist such as safeguarding the level of biodiversity swiss biodiversity strategy increasing sustainable hydropower energy production federal council s energy strategy is banking primarily on increasing switzerland s hydropower output by at least 10 by 2050 or the strategy for agriculture maintain food security and reduce ghg emissions these policy targets will be confronted to the related changes in estimated es and biodiversity indicators bundles within the different landuse and climate scenarios possible tradeoffs between different bundles or types of services provisioning regulating cultural supporting will be explored as in raudsepp hearne et al 2010 however these policy implications are going beyond the scope of the swatch21 project indeed a second phase of the swatch21 project has already been submitted by four academic swiss partners in 2018 it was given the title forming the science policy interface for switzerland s climate water energy nexus nexswiss with climate change scientists forecast a dramatic impact on the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources before the end of this century in this context water management will increasingly have to rely on an interdisciplinary approach which simultaneously considers climate water energy and landuse the nexswiss project will bring a state of the art integration of predictive modeling and stakeholder engagement it will be the first allowing to weight the relationships between sectors relying on water use and gauging the impact of different scenarios or environmental policies on water resources by building an innovative modeling framework this project will allow to assess and compare the outcomes of existing or planned policies and to explore plausible future scenarios through this nexus approach a stronger integration will be possible between political sciences and scientific dynamic modeling to support decision making the expected changes in climate landuse hydrology and hydropower will undoubtedly impact the eco hydrological services and the nexswiss project will assess and quantify them in terms of biodiversity support agricultural productivity sediment and nutrient retention flood protection and recreational value to give a few examples of concrete outputs the nexswiss project will enhance the implementation of the swiss energy policy considering the context of climate change and reinforced rivalries around rivers ecosystems the operation of existing hydropower plants and planning of new ones could also benefit from the nexswiss project by considering other competing water usages changes in average and extreme climate changes landuse changes and or hydropower market conditions will greatly impact hydrological services depending on their upstream downstream position finally the impacts of changes in water quantity and quality on ecosystem services could be predicted through the nexswiss project in a context of increasing and conflicting demands as a first step we will set up a national policy stakeholder group to guide the nexswiss project and review its progresses this stakeholder group will then guide the construction of a spatial data infrastructure to share the necessary input data sets among partners and identify the most useful outputs of the project the next steps will involve the modeling of the hydropower potential for switzerland considering the european context and market the energy market will in fact be factored in to predict water glaciers dynamics sediment transport and inflow to hydropower reservoirs based on the outputs of this hydrological model eco hydrological services will be assessed and predicted according to different climate landuse and management scenarios finally nexswiss will promote the integration of its tools and outputs in environment policies by analyzing at various decision scales regulatory frameworks horizontal institutional structures and informal agreements 4 conclusions the main innovations proposed by this project are listed below swatch21 will be a first attempt to model the full river network of switzerland with the internationally used and recognized tool swat it will integrate a proper glacier and snow model in the swat code which is greatly needed for all mountainous regions swatch21 will allow to predict species diversity from river conditions across swiss rivers for the first time the project will improve and integrate software solutions apis to bring es into practice by moving more easily from data acquisition modeling assessment and visualization into decision making the project will create a unique database of information on swiss rivers containing variables on species potential distribution and richness hydrological characteristics and ecosystem services swatch21 will bring a solution to test the level of data and model complexity needed to address policy needs the different climate and landuse scenarios will allow to test our capacity to meet multi sectorial policy targets the outputs from the entire project will be shared using a state of the art spatial data infrastructure in order to be freely available for future researches and the project will serve as a first stage of a more interdisciplinary and comprehensive project that will integrate also social political and economic sciences to fully assess multi sectorial policy needs conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the authors are acknowledging

1119,the objective of the swatch21 project is to improve our understanding of eco hydrologic services at the catchment level and biodiversity at the river scale six research questions are proposed i how can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling ii what is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services iii how can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools iv what will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers v can we meet the targets of multi sectorial river related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios vi how detailed do es data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions the above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access share process model and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services state of the art models have been selected and will be compared and improved to

programs swatch21 soil and water assessment tool project for switzerland in the 21st century wcmc world conservation monitoring center 1 introduction the main objective of the swatch21 project is to improve our understanding of and to model hydrologic ecosystem services supplies and demands at the catchment level as well as aquatic biodiversity at the river scale the models are used to explore the outcomes of climate and landuse change forecasting scenarios on multiple policy targets and to explore the correlations between ecosystem services bundles fig 1 in 2016 the national center for climate services and the hydrology division of the federal office of the environment has launched a new focus area climate change and its consequences on hydrology in switzerland hydro ch2018 to establish a platform for knowledge sharing between researchers and end users in the area of climate change and hydrology 1 1 http www bafu admin ch wasser 13472 16405 index html lang en this platform should provide up to date science based information to assist decision makers on determining adaptation policies to climate changes the swatch21 project will contribute to this science policy interface effort by bringing new and original solutions to explore the impact of climate and landuse changes on eco hydrologic services of swiss rivers anticipating on some not all of the conclusions of this synthesis the swatch21 project aims at filling some of the knowledge gaps 1 switzerland is a data rich country but the data needed to assess hydrologic services and biodiversity is in long term time series and difficult to gather 2 the impact of glacier and snow melting on hydrological services is not well understood 3 the provision of hydrologic services from river catchments has not been assessed across switzerland 4 the impacts of expected environmental changes on river species diversity and ecosystem services at the swiss scale has not been explored 5 the capacity to address multi sectorial policy targets is weak and 6 the desired level of model complexity to answer policy needs is unknown theses research gaps led to the six research questions in the first question q1 we explore how the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling can be improved hydrological and ecological modeling rely on accessing a large amount of high quality heterogeneous data e g weather hydrology hydropower species climate landuse and soil data in order to improve the cycle of flow from raw observations to decision making the initial time necessary to access and format the input data is often a limiting factor preparing a standard framework of essential data would greatly facilitate the cycle of decision making in the second question q2 we couple a glacier melt model with swat to better consider the future regime shifts indeed less sustained summer flow and more concentrated spring melt flows might critically reduce the annual hydropower production due to intake of overflow during spring and reduced flow during summer schaefli et al 2016 an increased seasonal melt coupled with rains will bring more intense floods because rain rather than snow falls on mountains in spring river flows will peak earlier in the year leaving summer months with increasingly drier conditions in question three q3 the aim is to assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and modeling tools the assessment of hydrological ecosystem services necessitates the evaluation of both the supply and demand side of the services increasing further the complexity of the data gathering and modeling effort in the fourth question q4 we explore the impacts of climate and landuse changes on species diversity in rivers the question here is to test what the respective impacts of climate and landuse changes could be on species diversity at the river level are these impacts similar across the swiss territory and according to different plausible forecasting scenarios for the fifth question q5 we explore the targets of multi sectorial river related policies e g biodiversity agriculture flood under different climate and landuse scenarios with this question we address the relationship between the value of ecosystems services on one hand and multiple often contradictory policies on the other hand as environmental policies are often segmented it is very difficult to assess whether multi sectorial policy targets can be reached simultaneously by using scenarios we will explore plausible futures of hydrologic es and biodiversity in the last question q6 we explore how detailed do es and species distribution data and models need to be to answer relevant policy needs such as the national water climate and biodiversity strategies this final question concerns the level of details that needs to be obtained when modeling environmental systems providing es in order to address policy relevant questions by comparing several approaches to model the hydrology and biodiversity of swiss rivers under different forecasting scenarios we explore the impact of the related uncertainty on selected policy targets expressed as es indicators it is clear that scientists always try to improve their data and models but this often results in more complexity extra costs and longer analyses exploring the relationship between model complexity and their significance on decision making processes is crucial in order to reduce the gap between these two activities 1 1 soil and water assessment tool soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is a continuous time process based semi distributed hydrologic model running on daily or sub daily time steps although many hydrological models have been used in switzerland such as wasim eth alaoui et al 2014 roessler et al 2014 prevah antonetti et al 2016 sehr echo schaefli et al 2014 hbv finger et al 2015 and topkapi eth foglia et al 2013 most suffer from various sources of limitations these include suitability of application to mountainous regions only lack of time continuity lack of one or more essential components for our study such as water quality crop yield agricultural management and sediment transport etc in the light of anticipated changes stemming from climate landuse change effects we find it timely to build a comprehensive agro hydro meteorological model of the entire switzerland and chose the model swat for the reasons outlined below indeed the swat model has been developed to quantify the impact of land management practices and climate on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds with varying soils landuses and management conditions over long periods of time the program therefore lends itself easily to climate and landuse change analysis swat is a valuable watershed scale management tool and we chose this program for our purposes because i it integrates many components such as hydrology climate nutrient soil sediment crop pesticide bacteria and agricultural management ii it has been successfully applied worldwide in many different climate and landuse situations iii the program is actively maintained and continuously updated with new and up to date knowledge of watershed processes and iv many side programs are written for swat from calibration and uncertainty analysis to graphic packages for visualization and animation of the results hence over time a universal consensus is built around the accuracy and usefulness of the program as there exist over 3000 scientific publications where swat has been used to address numerous watershed issues gassman et al 2007 gassman and wang 2015 in swat the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed is preserved by topographically dividing the basin into multiple subbasins and further into hydrologic response units hru based on soil landuse and slope characteristics these subdivisions enable the model to reflect differences in evapotranspiration for various crops and soils in each hru and on each time step the hydrologic and vegetation growth processes are simulated based on the curve number or green ampt rainfall runoff partitioning and the heat unit phenological development method neitsch et al 2011 the swat model has been applied worldwide and its hydrologic components successfully tested but the applications are mostly in areas where stream flows are predominantly generated from rainfall events arnold et al 1998 faramarzi et al 2009 rouholahnejad et al 2014 schuol et al 2008a b yang and abbaspour 2007 the model has less frequently been applied in mountainous watersheds and a few recent studies have shown model limitations in mountainous regions abbaspour et al 2007 2015 fontaine et al 2002 qi and grunwald 2005 rahman et al 2013 wang and messe 2005 although there have been different experiments with snow glacier melts and swat model there is clearly a lack of formal methods of snow glacier melt models coupled with the swat coupling a formal snow glacier melt model to swat makes it more apt to swiss hydrologic conditions allowing better predictions of river discharges and their impact on hydropower generation this will in general enable us to more accurately use swat s capabilities to study the impacts of climate on water quantity and quality in the alpine regions and other glacier snow dominated watersheds around the world 1 2 ecosystem services assessment and modeling as early as 2005 the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 used the es approach to assess the consequences of ecosystem changes for human well being the aim was also to establish the scientific foundation to enhance the conservation policy and sustainable use of ecosystems at different scales and under different scenarios the mea approach provided strong support for the creation of the intergovernmental science policy platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes larigauderie and mooney 2010 emphasizing the importance of scientific information and its transparency vohland et al 2011 the main challenge of ipbes remains to improve the science based policy interface for bes at the international level at different temporal and spatial scales perrings et al 2011 at the national scale the uk has published a spatially explicit assessment on the impact of landuse change on agricultural production emissions and sequestration of greenhouse gases recreational sites urban green space and biodiversity bateman et al 2013 in switzerland several studies have been published assessing for example the avalanche protection from forests on urban planning grêt regamey et al 2008 2013 or environmental policy in mountainous regions hirschi et al 2013 but only few studies were carried out on hydrologic ecosystem services grêt regamey et al 2011 our project can however be seen as an extension of the pnr61 hydroserv 2 2 http www nrp61 ch en projects project hydroserv project that assess ecosystem services in the emme valley to inform decision makers the impact of spatial scales on the quality of data available to assess es supply and demand burkhard et al 2012 was also investigated suggesting a multi scale approach when making decision based on es as well as the importance of the interface for stakeholder implications klein et al 2015 at a regional scale flanders in belgium has produced a state of the art assessment of es stevens et al 2015 by analyzing the relationships between the supply and demand side of the services as well as on the impact of external drivers such as landuse and climate changes and by presenting the results on very comprehensive dashboards the tradeoffs competition between services and synergies reinforcement of services between supply use and demand sides of services are also analyzed demonstrating the need to assess es cohesively several important eu research projects are building on the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capitals as ways to improve the interface between scientific knowledge on one side and policy decision making on the other side e g opera openness esmeralda mars ecopotential two of these projects are sharing the development of a particularly interesting knowledge hub www oppla eu on nature based solutions that was launched in september 2016 the openness project has reviewed the concept of es bundles berry et al 2016 as co occurring services in space and time tradeoffs and synergies turkelboom et al 2016 as interacting services positively or negatively a service can be used when it coincides between a supply and a demand the eu land and ecosystem accounts eea 2006 2011 weber 2007 provides a 1km2 grid account that can be scaled up to any administrative or ecosystem zoning e g river basins coastal zones or biogeographic regions a more recent data and model driven methodology maes et al 2013 was proposed to respond to action 5 of the eu biodiversity strategy to produce es indicators covering europe another recent european effort proposes to map the potential of ecosystems to supply es under the impact of landuse changes haines young et al 2012 finally several global assessments were proposed including the economic valuation of 17 global es costanza et al 1997 naidoo et al 2008 tallis et al 2012 turner et al 2007 and the assessment of sustainable development goals wood and declerck 2015 the growing interest for es encouraged the development of an international classification cices haines young and potschin 2013 based on the assumption that es should be regarded as fundamentally dependent on living resources e g not abiotic processes and serving human well being either as es ecosystem goods or ecosystem benefits the last version of cices proposes a hierarchical classification from three main branches of services provisioning regulation and maintenance cultural into a 3 4 digits classification several spatially explicit tools have been developed and compared to assess es bagstad et al 2013 the integrative tools encompass all the steps of es assessment from data access to modeling es assessment and valuation bsr 2011 popular applications include for invest kareiva et al 2011 tallis et al 2008 solves sherrouse et al 2011 and aries villa et al 2014 that are relying for the moment on relatively simple ecosystem models more complex existing models can also be used to assess the different es however the scientific and human investments are often too large for the available resources to justify their implementation when assessing several es in parallel in 2015 brauman 2015 reviewed 381 papers on hydrological services and concluded that the direct link from biophysical processes to human well being makes hydrological services an appealing foundation for watershed management leading to new research if we can overcome the interdisciplinary challenges and the conflicts on water needs brauman 2015 offers also a very useful framework linking ecohydrologic processes to hydrologic services in 2016 francesconi et al 2016 reviewed 44 papers on the use of swat to evaluate hydrological services indeed recent papers based on swat outputs have started to establish some links between the evaluation of river es and the nexus approach for instance in the danube catchment karabulut et al 2015 the authors have published a study proposing new standards to estimate water demands from swat outputs within a nexus framework and taking into account upstream downstream relationships in the black sea catchment fasel et al 2016 1 3 species distribution modeling even though landuse is used to assess es es depend rather on the distribution of biodiversity expressed as species and or ecosystems spatial predictions of species and ecosystem distribution have made huge advances in the last two decades by combining geographic information systems with statistical modeling elith et al 2006 several tools have been developed to facilitate these analytical workflows for example grasp lehmann et al 2002 maggini et al 2006 maxent elith et al 2011 biomod thuiller et al 2009 caret kuhn 2008 some of the main challenges have been to model species distribution from presence only data elith et al 2006 phillips et al 2009 zaniewski et al 2002 manage adequately spatial autocorrelation in species data crase et al 2014 interactions between exploratory variables as well as biotic interactions between species de araujo et al 2014 species distribution modeling are being used for informing several biodiversity conservation tools such as the assessment of species red list status fivaz and gonseth 2014 protected areas prioritization lehtomaki and moilanen 2013 species vulnerability to climate change maggini et al 2014 or ecosystem restoration targets gaston et al 2014 while many different statistical approaches exist for species distribution modeling elith et al 2006 e g glm gam mars brt rf the tendency has been to develop tools capable of building ensemble forecasting from several approaches at once e g biomod caret while increasing the complexity and computing time of the statistical analyses and decreasing the understanding of each separate statistical approaches by the user for this reason we suggest to focus on a reduced set of techniques with high predictive performance indeed species distribution modeling is of limited value to conservation assessment when the overall diversity across large region depends more on differences in biological composition amongst locations i e beta diversity than on site level diversity ferrier et al 2007 thus distance approaches like gdm can complement common alpha diversity assessment and offers an insight into beta diversity species distribution modeling in river ecosystems is clearly lagging behind its terrestrial counterpart leathwick et al 2006 with much less studies published a recent example however has been published recently to model family and ept richness at a landscape level across switzerland kaelin and altermatt 2016 one of the challenges in aquatic macroinvertebrate distribution modeling is to consider the upstream downstream relationship and the temporal variation of the hydrologic regimes advanced hydrological models like swat are therefore promising to translate landscape variables into biological conditions several studies have already linked swat and aquatic biodiversity models wu et al 2018 kakouei et al 2017 including some in the context of climate change guse et al 2015 woznicki et al 2016 they used different response variables such as biotic indicators and species abundance different modeling techniques and as we intend to do in our project they included hydrologic indices calculated from swat output time series as model predictors 2 material methods and initial results 2 1 choice of study site and biodiversity groups in order to be able to address several possible contradictory river related policies we decided to concentrate on a single scale approach at a national level as a data rich country switzerland can serve as a laboratory to explore the level of complexity needed to better inform decision makers about ecosystems services worldwide the workable solutions that we hope to find through this project will therefore be more easily generalized in other countries by adapting the policy context from the beginning of the 1970s ecosystem health was seen increasingly as valuable in many societies and multiple approaches based on benthic macroinvertebrates have been developed to assess the ecological status of rivers and streams bonada et al 2006 these organisms offer multiple advantages for biomonitoring as they are ubiquitous they offer a large spectrum of responses to different stressors high taxonomical and functional diversity they are basically sedentary which allow effective spatial analyses they have a relatively long life cycle they can easily be sampled and keys to identification are available for many groups rosenberg and vincent 1993 all macroinvertebrate groups will be considered in our analyses however we will specially focus on the ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept as they are commonly used for assessing river ecosystem and identified at the species level in several nationwide monitoring projects furthermore a relatively recent red list lubini et al 2012 has been published on these groups based on new data collections we also consider a few emblematic fish species as an indication of their recreation use 2 2 analytical workflow the general organization of the work program flows logically from the research gaps and questions starting with 1 the creation of a spatial data infrastructure sdi and an application programming interface api to facilitate the use and reuse of initial condition data 2 into the integration of a glacier and snow melt model with the hydrologic soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 program 3 followed by hydrologic es modeling and 4 river species distribution modeling plus 5 the analyses of the impacts of climate and landuse forecasting scenarios on policy targets linked to specific es and biodiversity indicators backcasting scenarios grêt regamey and brunner 2011 that would explore different pathways to selected policy targets are not considered in the first phase of the project but the proposed modeling framework should allow to explore these types of scenarios as well throughout the project we carry out development of a second api connecting the input data with the different pieces of software to automate the production of the swatch21 outputs fig 2 2 2 1 data spatial data infrastructure and application program interface the aim of this first task is to gather all the necessary data for the project in a geospatial database postgresql with postgis accessible through a spatial data infrastructure sdi and via an application program interface api in order to make them readily available as web services and in different programming environment such as in r for statistics and python for gis lehmann et al 2017a switzerland has several centralized geospatial database the main abiotic data needed for this project is described in table 1 the biotic data will focus on macroinvertebrate species and especially on the ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept groups most of the available data was collected as presence only data but exhaustive standardized samplings were recently carried out within the framework of the swiss biodiversity monitoring program bdm and the national surface water quality monitoring program nawa 2 2 2 glacier evolution runoff model state of the art glacier and snow melt models glacier evolution runoff model germ farinotti et al 2012 huss et al 2008 2014 will be coupled with swat to produce a transient dataset of runoff changes and variability from the recent past to the future using germ glacier surface mass balance and runoff are calculated in daily time steps using a distributed temperature index melt and accumulation model model components account for changes in glacier extent and surface elevation evaporation and runoff routing germ includes components for snow accumulation distribution snow and ice melt 3d glacier geometry change evapotranspiration and runoff routing the performance of the coupled swat germ models will be tested at in the altesch catchment in the rhone watershed 2 2 3 modeling hydrologic ecosystem services supply and demand in this task we will use two different hydrological models swat 3 3 http swat tamu edu invest 4 4 http www naturalcapitalproject org invest html to model water quantity and quality across the swiss river network and to quantify various ecosystem services swat is a complex hydrological model running on a daily basis using input from weather stations rainfall min and max temperature solar radiation wind soil information landuse landcover data digital elevation map and data from agricultural management practices the multiple sensitive parameters of the model are calibrated from observation of water yield sediment and nutrient loads measured at river gauges fig 3 the most commonly used tool for model calibration is swat cup arnold et al 2012 swat has been used in most countries in the world and so far few papers have been published which included swiss hydrology and water quality by the applicants abbaspour et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 once calibrated swat model return tens of output variables on a daily monthly or yearly basis such as water yield sediment loads and nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter concentrations these outputs are prepared at the subcatchment scale defined during the construction of the model and can vary from a few hectares to several thousands of square kilometers depending on the case study needs as swat was not particularly developed for mountainous regions several improvements on its calibration are needed in a country like switzerland fontaine et al 2002 rahman et al 2013 for this reason we introduced the germ model in the previous task to incorporate into swat for more accurate snow and glacier melt inputs barnhart et al 2014 ficklin et al 2012 with the expected swat improvements this project will derive daily outputs at high spatial resolution for about 5000 sub catchments in switzerland for various hydrologic ecosystem services e g water yield for hydropower blue water available for agriculture or domestic uses sediment nutrient and flood water retention other river attributes will be calculated with a geographic information system such as river sinuosity percent of forest and percent of agricultural and urban landcovers to test whether a simpler hydrological model can provide the necessary decision making information we will also use invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs that was develop as a suite of tools to spatially assess provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services haines young and potschin 2013 indeed invest was developed to bring simplified scientific information in the hands of decision makers to assess tradeoffs between policy and management options the suite of tools includes sixteen invest models for terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems the freshwater models presently include water yield necessary for hydropower production and its potential value but also its availability for other water uses agriculture domestic sediment retention and water purification that quantifies nutrient retention compared to swat invest is based on much simpler models that run on a yearly basis and that depend on a reduced number of parameters but the two models produce the same basic hydrological outputs that can be compared dennedy frank et al 2016 the outputs of swat concerns typically water quantity and quality and can be characterized by their spatial and temporal resolution the highest possible temporal and spatial resolution will be selected while building the swat model in function of the tradeoffs between model complexity and the computing time needed to run a model and therefore evaluate new scenarios we typically expect to use swat output on a daily or monthly base with sub catchments of about 10km2 about 5000 sub catchments for switzerland many ecosystem services supplies can be derived relatively simply from swat or invest outputs others will need additional analyses to assess for instance biodiversity support recreational values fishing potential transportation and flood water retention fig 4 below is the list of used services that we intend to model based on the classification proposed by brauman 2015 as the result of the combination of the water services supplies modeled by swat and or invest and the methodology used in fasel et al 2016 to assess water demand in the black sea catchment diverted waters provisioning services agriculture water used by crops will be directly derived from swat outputs irrigation demands are mapped in swat from available national data sources into agriculture management files drinking water the amount of blue water used for drinking will be assessed from the population distribution and statistics on the population water withdrawal intensity livestock blue water used by livestock will be estimated from the distribution of different types of livestocks thermoelectric power generation the amount of blue water used for cooling thermoelectric power plants will be assessed according to the generated electricity type of fuel and cooling system used by the power plants detailed data will be obtained for the nuclear power plants in situ water provisioning services hydropower blue water transformed into energy by hydropower will be estimated using the distribution and size of existing dams evaporation from reservoirs will be estimated by using the swat outputs on potential evapotranspiration transportation the amount of water needed will be derived from navigable section locations on the swiss river network water damage mitigation regulating services flood water retention the critical consecutive days analyzer ccda is a module of climate change toolkit cct which has been developed at eawag vaghefi et al 2017mm it is used to analyze extreme events dry and wet periods and find the occurrences of past flooding patterns in the future data nutrient and sediment retention will be directly derived from swat and invest outputs they will be assessed by comparing the different landuse scenarios spiritual and esthetic cultural services fishing for recreation this service will be assessed by modeling the species distribution of emblematic fish species such as trout using species distribution models recreation the recreational value of river beds will be assessed by a combination of gis analyses of accessibility from roads and walking tracks and the density of photos made available on flickr snow duration for skiing activities will be assessed from historical remote sensing classification of landsat images with the swiss data cube giuliani et al 2017 supporting supporting services biodiversity alpha and beta diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates will be assessed by several modeling techniques based on careful selection of hydrologic topographic climatic geologic and land use explanatory variables derived from swat model and complementary gis analyses at catchment and river reach levels environmental flow requirement for biodiversity flow requirements will be estimated using a defined percentage of naturalized water flow allocated for preserving water ecosystems e g poff et al 2010 pastor et al 2014 overton et al 2014 this task should result in a new methodology to assess hydrologic es in switzerland that could be easily generalized in other countries or catchments the chosen approach will be streamlined by code developed in the python and or r languages and make use of their geospatial and statistical libraries task 6 2 2 4 modeling freshwater biodiversity along river networks and predicting possible future scenarios the aim of task 4 is to model the distribution of species in order to estimate how different climate and landuse scenarios would affect alpha and beta diversity in swiss rivers spatial pattern in aquatic macroinvertebrate will be modeled focusing on 1 discrete entities species or community and on 2 collective properties of biodiversity differentiation diversity ferrier 2002 on one hand we will use species distribution modeling techniques sdm like random forest breiman 2001 or boosted regression trees brt elith et al 2008 according to our preliminary results their predictive performance of these techniques was significantly superior to 6 other techniques fig 5 for our tests we used the r package biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 and allowed level 1 interaction for generalized linear model glm and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and 3 dimensions for the generalized additive model gam smooth term otherwise we used default parametrization fig 5 sdm predictions will provide an assessment of environmental change impacts on individual species fig 6 which can be used further to derive higher level entities as community types on the other hand we will use generalized dissimilarity modeling ferrier et al 2007 for assessing spatial patterns of turnover in community beta diversity this technique accommodates two types of nonlinearity common in ecological datasets 1 the variation in the rate of compositional turnover along environmental gradients and 2 the curvilinear relationship between biological and ecological distance the r package gdm manion et al 2018 allows to make predictions across time to estimate the magnitude of expected change in biological composition in response to environmental change fitzpatrick et al 2011 final sets of predictors will be based on stepwise selection of hydrologic topographic climatic geologic and land use explanatory variables inspired from kuemmerlen et al 2014 both complementary approaches will allow to estimate how different climate and land use scenarios would affect alpha and beta diversity in swiss rivers 2 2 5 evaluating the relationship between ecosystem services bundles and multiple policy targets agriculture flood energy biodiversity based on future plausible climate and landuse scenarios first analyzing the current swiss policies and strategies for hydrology flood energy biodiversity and agriculture will identify key environmental policy targets the value of es services is derived directly from the analyses presented at the end of section 3 on modeling hydrologic ecosystem services supply and demand the es bundle analyses briner et al 2013 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 will explore the combination of different climate ch2018 2018 and three landuse wsl bolliger et al 2007 scenarios on es in relationship to key environmental policy targets grêt regamey and brunner 2011 fig 7 to estimate the impact of climate change on water resources of switzerland we will deploy the new ch2018 scenarios developed by a consortium consisting of meteoswiss eth zurich and the university of bern ch2018 2018 ch2018 data is based on the latest set of european climate model simulations from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex in cordex the global climate model simulations from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 have been downscaled using regional climate models ch2018 is bias corrected for three emission scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the time span 1981 to 2099 in this study we will use the median value of several rcms for each rcp the landuse scenarios bolliger et al 2007 are based on a business as usual scenario that extrapolates trends observed between 1985 and 1997 into the future a liberalization scenario was defined with limited regulation while a lowered agricultural production scenario was created to foster conservation finally in order to assess the impacts of climate and landuse scenarios of es and related policy targets we will follow an experimental design fig 7 that will combine 3 climate scenarios 3 landuse scenarios 2 hydrological models 2 biodiversity models leading to a total of 36 models run with the swatch21 tool api that will be applied on all rivers of switzerland the experimental design will allow calculating the proportion of the 5000 subcatchments that reach the different policy targets in function of the different combination of climate and landuse change it will also allow to compare the outcome of each scenario to the current situation and to evaluate the differences between scenarios fig 7 a generalized linear mixed model glmm will allow also to explore which factor choice of climate scenario landuse scenario hydrologic model and species distribution model of the experimental design is more influencing the es and biodiversity assessment 2 2 6 swatch21 tools api the swatch21 tools api connects different pieces of input data and software swat invest brt rf gdm to automate the workflow for key es variables this allows information to be dynamically generated incorporating changes in or creating entirely new datasets software scenarios or policies and helps to streamline the process of going from data to decision making this approach is reusable and portable creating a process for replicable results and verification and a method that can be used to assess other environmental issues at different scales and locations by changing the input data and software components for swatch21 this is being used to create a large es dataset see table 2 for several scenarios and has great potential for reuse and interpretation as in lehmann et al 2017b this is achieved by creating middleware software to enable the models to interact via the open geospatial consortium ogc web processing service wps e g giuliani et al 2012 which provides an interoperable cloud based protocol for the exchange and processing of data this approach is inherently network based supporting distributed computing and is at the core of our framework for integrating heterogeneous processes this gives the ability to integrate previously disjointed models into a single complex process and better utilize existing resources 3 discussion 3 1 data sharing swatch21 is promoting data sharing through web services as promulgated by the open geospatial consortium ogc nogueras iso et al 2005 indeed policies are evolving toward making environmental data available with for instance the open data policy in switzerland 5 5 https opendata swiss the inspire directive in europe craglia 2010 and the geo data sharing principles at global level giuliani et al 2011 2016 however the access to data needed for eco hydrological modeling meteorological hydrological biological and pedological data remains limited by password protections policy restrictions and cost policies myroshnychenko et al 2015 web services and application programme interface api allow direct exchanges between machines as needed in modern applications over the internet lehmann et al 2017a these web based approach of data sharing in hydrology were reviewed in lehmann et al 2014 and are implemented in this project 3 2 model integration swatch21 will provide an integrated solution for accessing and sharing inputs and outputs of models as well as processing eco hydrologic models state of the art models germ swat invest brt rf gdm have been selected and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services the main outputs of the project will be new datasets made available to describe swiss rivers hydrology their predicted biodiversity and the related assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services e g water resources regulating services e g nutrient and sediment retention flood protection and cultural services e g biodiversity recreation such integration of models is necessary to be able to run and rerun a set of connected models under different environmental and or socio economic conditions according to different scenarios lehmann et al 2014 2017a furthermore the capacity of rerunning more easily an entire modeling workflow contributes to the replicability of scientific analyses mcnutt 2014 ostermann and grabell 2017 several solutions allow to orchestrate complex workflows connecting several models openmi gregersen et al 2007 moore and tindall 2005 has been developed in hydrology to link together models from different origins with different spatial and temporal scales this approach has recently been proposed for integrated water resources modeling buahin and horsburgh 2018 with web processing services wps models themselves become ogc web services allowing to run workflows on the internet castronova et al 2013 giuliani et al 2012 michaelis and ames 2009 and on different backends giuliani et al 2012 3 3 policy implications by making available new datasets from the outputs of models and scenarios swatch21 is addressing several policy needs in switzerland with a potential to be replicated in other regions at the swiss level the new biodiversity strategy 6 6 https www bafu admin ch bafu en home topics biodiversity publications studies publications swiss biodiversity strategy html integrates among its 10 strategic goals that by 2020 ecosystem services are recorded quantitatively and that sufficient knowledge is available for their consideration in decision making in order to reach this objective on river ecosystems much work is still needed as neither ecosystem services or biodiversity has been assessed and predicted across all rivers the swiss climate strategy for agriculture 7 7 http www fao org 3 a i3084e i3084e24 pdf explores ways to continue to ensure food supplies and provide social economic and ecosystem services agriculture and food production by adapting to climate change this strategy should be a guiding light for agriculture and food production in switzerland in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing conditions agriculture is intimately linked to water resources and to water quality and this relationship is fully integrated in tools like swat another policy relevant topic is the vulnerability of switzerland to flood 8 8 http www climateadaptation eu switzerland river floods which is increasing after a century in which only two major floods happened floods are the most economically damageable natural risk that concerns the most densely populated areas of switzerland swatch21 is bringing to these different policies new ways of assessing simultaneously the outcomes of scenarios on changes in ecosystem services that are themselves related to these policies such as water for hydropower water for agriculture and livestock water for power generation sediment retention nutrient retention flood water retention species diversity environment flow requirements by analyzing the synergies and tradeoffs between these services policy makers will be able to understand the connection between various sectors when making decisions another relevant aspect of swatch21 in the policy domain is related to so called essential water variables ewvs ewvs are being defined by the geo hydrology community as a minimum set of variables that are necessary to describe the water cycle lawford 2013 most of the ewvs are either inputs or outputs of a swat model meaning than when a swat model is calibrated it links together though a hydrological framework almost the entire set of ewvs this is particularly important to fully describe the water system and to inform different policy needs and indicators note that simultaneously essential climate variables ecvs bojinski et al 2014 and essential biodiversity variables ebvs pereira et al 2013 have been defined essential variables are the central concept of the european project geoessential that the first author of this article is coordinating 9 9 http www geoessential eu essential variables can be considered as an intermediate level of information between raw observations and policy indicators as a minimum set of variables necessary to describe a system finally brauman 2015 is demonstrating the concept of eco hydrologic services that are modeled in swatch21 create a link between biophysical processes to human well being and therefore provides the foundation of watershed management assess conservation benefits evaluate management practices prioritize siting account for externalities and perform trade off or cost benefit analysis 3 4 future developments potentially conflicting policy targets exist such as safeguarding the level of biodiversity swiss biodiversity strategy increasing sustainable hydropower energy production federal council s energy strategy is banking primarily on increasing switzerland s hydropower output by at least 10 by 2050 or the strategy for agriculture maintain food security and reduce ghg emissions these policy targets will be confronted to the related changes in estimated es and biodiversity indicators bundles within the different landuse and climate scenarios possible tradeoffs between different bundles or types of services provisioning regulating cultural supporting will be explored as in raudsepp hearne et al 2010 however these policy implications are going beyond the scope of the swatch21 project indeed a second phase of the swatch21 project has already been submitted by four academic swiss partners in 2018 it was given the title forming the science policy interface for switzerland s climate water energy nexus nexswiss with climate change scientists forecast a dramatic impact on the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources before the end of this century in this context water management will increasingly have to rely on an interdisciplinary approach which simultaneously considers climate water energy and landuse the nexswiss project will bring a state of the art integration of predictive modeling and stakeholder engagement it will be the first allowing to weight the relationships between sectors relying on water use and gauging the impact of different scenarios or environmental policies on water resources by building an innovative modeling framework this project will allow to assess and compare the outcomes of existing or planned policies and to explore plausible future scenarios through this nexus approach a stronger integration will be possible between political sciences and scientific dynamic modeling to support decision making the expected changes in climate landuse hydrology and hydropower will undoubtedly impact the eco hydrological services and the nexswiss project will assess and quantify them in terms of biodiversity support agricultural productivity sediment and nutrient retention flood protection and recreational value to give a few examples of concrete outputs the nexswiss project will enhance the implementation of the swiss energy policy considering the context of climate change and reinforced rivalries around rivers ecosystems the operation of existing hydropower plants and planning of new ones could also benefit from the nexswiss project by considering other competing water usages changes in average and extreme climate changes landuse changes and or hydropower market conditions will greatly impact hydrological services depending on their upstream downstream position finally the impacts of changes in water quantity and quality on ecosystem services could be predicted through the nexswiss project in a context of increasing and conflicting demands as a first step we will set up a national policy stakeholder group to guide the nexswiss project and review its progresses this stakeholder group will then guide the construction of a spatial data infrastructure to share the necessary input data sets among partners and identify the most useful outputs of the project the next steps will involve the modeling of the hydropower potential for switzerland considering the european context and market the energy market will in fact be factored in to predict water glaciers dynamics sediment transport and inflow to hydropower reservoirs based on the outputs of this hydrological model eco hydrological services will be assessed and predicted according to different climate landuse and management scenarios finally nexswiss will promote the integration of its tools and outputs in environment policies by analyzing at various decision scales regulatory frameworks horizontal institutional structures and informal agreements 4 conclusions the main innovations proposed by this project are listed below swatch21 will be a first attempt to model the full river network of switzerland with the internationally used and recognized tool swat it will integrate a proper glacier and snow model in the swat code which is greatly needed for all mountainous regions swatch21 will allow to predict species diversity from river conditions across swiss rivers for the first time the project will improve and integrate software solutions apis to bring es into practice by moving more easily from data acquisition modeling assessment and visualization into decision making the project will create a unique database of information on swiss rivers containing variables on species potential distribution and richness hydrological characteristics and ecosystem services swatch21 will bring a solution to test the level of data and model complexity needed to address policy needs the different climate and landuse scenarios will allow to test our capacity to meet multi sectorial policy targets the outputs from the entire project will be shared using a state of the art spatial data infrastructure in order to be freely available for future researches and the project will serve as a first stage of a more interdisciplinary and comprehensive project that will integrate also social political and economic sciences to fully assess multi sectorial policy needs conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the authors are acknowledging
