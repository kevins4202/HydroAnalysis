18905,field scale studies of natural colloid mobilization and transport in finely fractured aquifer as well as the source identification of groundwater colloids are of great importance to the safety of shallow groundwater in this study the daily monitoring of fracture flow from a sloping farmland plot and the biweekly monitoring of three lowland shallow wells within the same catchment were carried out simultaneously in 2013 the effects of physicochemical perturbations on groundwater colloid dynamics were explored in detail using partial redundancy analysis structural equation modeling pearson correlation and multi linear regression analyses the characterization and source identification of groundwater colloids were addressed via multiple parameters the daily colloid concentration in the fracture flow varied between 0 54 and 31 90 mg l 1 64 mg l on average unique periods of high colloid concentration 5 59 mg l on average occurred during the initially generated flow following the dry season in comparison a narrower colloid concentration range of 0 24 11 66 mg l was observed in the lowland shallow wells with a smaller temporal variation than that of the fracture flow a low percentage 2 4 7 0 of colloids and a high percentage 47 7 92 0 of coarse particles 2 10 μm were present in the lowland well water hydraulic perturbation by rainwater infiltration in the sloping farmland was the dominant mechanism for colloid mobilization in general this effect retreated to secondary importance behind chemical perturbations ph mg2 and doc at low flow discharges 1 3 l min in contrast water chemistry e g ec cations and doc concentrations exhibited a major effect on colloid dynamics in the water of the lowland wells except for the extremely high salinity water of one well in which water temperature showed a negative dominant influence on colloid stability the combined use of multiple parameters e g mineral composition and organic matter calcium carbonate and δ 13c contents traced groundwater colloids to the shallow soil in the upper farmlands it is strongly advised that in finely fractured aquifers within agricultural catchments not only the small colloids but also the coarse particles in the size range of 2 10 μm should be monitored in case of colloid associated contamination from agricultural wastes e g n p pesticides and or heavy metals especially at the early stages of the rainy seasons graphical abstract image 1 keywords fracture flow groundwater colloid transport source identification 1 introduction mass transfer in the vadose zone has been a major concern in transport studies of different geospheres in general in particular the frequent temporal and spatial variations in physical and chemical conditions in the vadose zone exert a great effect on the fate e g release mobilization and transport of water dispersible colloids colloids include fine particles of several micrometers to macromolecules of several nanometers and are ubiquitous in the subsurface liu et al 2018 the release of colloids from a solid surface is determined mechanically by the interactions of repulsive and attractive forces between the colloid and the solid surface only when the repulsive forces overcome the attractive forces can colloids be detached and mobilized degueldre and benedicto 2012 torkzaban et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 mobilized colloids are susceptible to transport into groundwater during which colloid facilitated transport of various strongly sorbing contaminants e g phosphorus nitrogen pharmaceuticals pesticides heavy metals and radionuclides has been frequently reported delwiche et al 2014 ge et al 2018 judy et al 2018 missong et al 2018 mohanty et al 2014 tran et al 2018 xing et al 2015 in particular pathogens e g viruses and bacteria either occur in groundwater in bio colloid forms zhang et al 2012 as in most cases or are associated with inorganic colloids in wastewater walsge et al 2010 both forms have been demonstrated to move through shallow aquifers with little retention and are present in groundwater due to colloid facilitated transport göppert and goldscheider 2008 maciopinto et al 2008 which may lead to the outbreak of waterborne diseases therefore it is of great importance to explore subsurface colloid transport characteristics which provides a pre requisite for experimental and modeling research on colloid facilitated contaminant transport numerous studies concerning colloid mobilization and subsequent transport as well as the facilitated transport of various contaminants by colloids have been carried out in the laboratory e g in repacked intact columns and fractured cores ge et al 2018 kuno et al 2002 liu et al 2018 mishurov et al 2008 mitropoulou et al 2013 mohanty et al 2014 mondal and sleep 2012 morales et al 2011 tran et al 2018 walshe et al 2010 the flow rate ph ionic strength divalent cations dissolved organic matter etc of a solution have been widely reported to affect colloid mobilization transport and the association of contaminants to colloids in these studies however the ideal or synthetic colloid tracers e g nanoparticles or microspheres of specific sizes shapes densities and surface properties that were frequently used in these studies do not resemble the various natural colloids present in groundwater in addition colloid mobilization and transport in a column core with a relatively homogeneous structure or a steady state of flow may exhibit large discrepancies from those observed in field scenarios seaman et al 2007 demonstrated that colloid mobilization and transport in an aquifer did not follow shear force predictions from well controlled column scale studies this discrepancy leads to the necessity for the field scale study of the mobilization and transport of naturally occurring colloids in groundwater at the field scale water flow and organic carbon were observed to have a profound effect on colloid generation in groundwater kaplan et al 1993 the released colloid load in shallow aquifers was also found to increase with the ph of recharge water especially when it exceeded the phpzc of the inorganic colloids rebacca et al 2002 the authors also reported that the decrease in ionic strength did not facilitate significant colloid mobilization which differs from that observed in many column scale studies e g kuno et al 2002 mitropoulou et al 2013 mondal and sleep 2012 colloid mobilization and transport in response to natural rainfall and artificial irrigation events were also observed in vadose zone lysimeters and were partially attributed to the moving air water interfaces in the unsaturated aquifer liu et al 2018 a similar quick response of natural colloid mobilization and transport in fracture flow due to hydraulic scouring and the movement of the air water interface has been demonstrated in a fractured mudstone zhang et al 2015 2016 and in a fractured karst aquifer pronk et al 2009 in addition the quick mobilization and transport of colloids within the first several hours following flow infiltration as well as the occurrences of lower colloid concentration peaks several days later in fractured chalk have been reported weisbrod et al 2002 these results imply the potential for large load and long distance transport of colloids in groundwater originating from macroporous or fractured media where preferential flow pathways prevail however colloid mobilization in shallow aquifers for example induced by water injection showed significant spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to the local hydrogeologic conditions seaman et al 2007 moreover the complex interplay between physical perturbations of rainfall infiltrations and chemical reactions e g water ph and ionic strength contributed to colloid load in well water in karst aquifers shevenell and mccarthy 2002 however the relative importance of physical and chemical perturbation has not yet been identified nevertheless the existing field scale studies of natural colloid mobilization and transport in the subsurface were based on single events e g natural or artificial rainfall irrigation groundwater recharge the long tails and erratic pulses of colloid concentrations observed during the drainage process in these field scale studies further indicate the importance of the investigation of colloid mobilization and transport over a longer time scale in addition the re mobilization or re suspension of the clogged coagulated colloids and the increased load of small colloids caused by the breakdown of large aggregates may also occur due to the flow regime and the resultant variations in water chemistry induced over time especially under fluctuating natural weather conditions göppert and goldscheider 2008 continuous field scale investigations of natural colloids and groundwater flow dynamics in response to various rainfall events in different geological media are necessary to better understand the temporal and spatial variations of colloid transport in a large field various geological media e g soils weathered rocks sediments till deposits epikarst could act as the sources of natural colloids present in groundwater but contribute different colloid loads albarran et al 2014 degueldre and cloet 2016 mccarthy and mckay 2004 pronk et al 2009 schiperski et al 2016 in addition field studies have indicated that colloid transport in response to water infiltration showed site specific characteristics e g breakthrough time recovery peak colloid concentration göppert and goldscheider 2008 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is also important to trace the sources of natural colloids to more accurately evaluate the potential of colloid facilitated contaminant transport particle size distribution psd was used for the source identification of autochthonous particles inside an aquifer and allochthonous particles derived from the land surface in karst groundwater pronk et al 2007 morphological and mineralogical evidence is also useful for tracking the potential sources of suspended sediments in surface water chanudet and filella 2008 mills et al 2017 and shallow groundwater filella et al 2009 herman et al 2007 however the feasibility of these technologies for groundwater colloid source identification needs to be tested and other technologies are still inadequate 13c stable isotope analysis of organic matter provides information about carbon transfer between different geomedia with distinct carbon isotope signatures engelmann et al 2018 this parameter has been increasingly applied in recent decades in the source identification of sediment from soils of different land uses within a catchment gibbs 2008 guan et al 2017 however no application of 13c in colloid source identification has been conducted the vast 160 000 km2 hilly region of central sichuan in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is characterized by thin purple soil cover and underlying finely fractured mudrock frequent occurrences of preferential flow have been demonstrated in finely fractured aquifer in this region zhao et al 2013 as a result the mobilized colloids in the subsurface were enriched in the fracture flow zhang et al 2015 2016 and could be transported to lowland drinking wells in this study a sloping farmland plot 0 15 hm2 located in a relatively high part of the jieliu catchment and three lowland shallow wells along the streamline to the catchment outlet were selected fracture flow from the hillslope and well water from the lowland wells were investigated simultaneously for a year to investigate the mechanisms regarding the mobilization and transport of natural colloids daily and biweekly monitoring were carried out for the fracture flow and the well water respectively the relationship between the dynamics of colloid concentration and the dynamics of physiochemical perturbations in the shallow groundwater was analyzed and discussed thoroughly using partial redundancy analysis prda structural equation modeling sem pearson correlation and multi linear regression analysis in addition the characterization and source identification of groundwater colloids were carried out by multi parameter comparisons between the colloids and nearby geological samples soils and weathered mudrocks from the upper farmlands and or forests to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to quantitatively characterize the interplay of physical and chemical factors in natural colloid dynamics for different shallow groundwater patterns e g fracture flow and lowland well water by a combination of prda and sem in addition exploring the reliability and validity of coupling 13c stable isotope with other chemical parameters e g mineral composition organic matter and calcium carbonate to identify groundwater colloid sources is expected to provide new insights regarding colloid source identification the in situ investigation results presented in this study may provide theoretical and modeling information regarding natural colloid mobilization and transport in large fields e g catchment scale and may also help protect shallow groundwater from potential contamination by colloids and colloid associated agricultural wastes in not only finely fractured media but also karst aquifers elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study site is located in the small jieliu catchment fig 1 which has an area of 0 35 km2 and is located in hilly central sichuan province southwest china the annual mean temperature and rainfall from 1981 to 2006 in this area were 17 3 c and 826 mm respectively the cumulative rainfall from may to september accounted for 85 of the annual precipitation sloping farmland is the major land use type a proportion of 44 in the catchment with an average slope of approximately 6 the typical soil in the catchment is a readily erodible purple soil with abundant macropores which could contribute over 87 of the flow wang et al 2015 the soil thickness on the slopes varies from 25 cm to 60 cm mudrock with visible fine fractures lies beneath the shallow purple soil and overlies an impermeable sandstone other land use types of the catchment include forests woods 35 paddy fields 11 and residential areas 10 considering the application of agricultural chemicals to farmlands and their potential rapid transport via preferential flow in dissolved and colloid associated forms the subsurface transport of colloids from a sloping farmland plot on the upper slope and the dynamics of colloid concentrations in three lowland shallow wells were investigated in this study 2 2 methods 2 2 1 monitoring of the sloping farmland plot a farmland plot 0 15 hm2 with an average slope of 6 was constructed on the upper slope in the catchment fig 1 details on the experimental plot can be found in zhang et al 2015 briefly rainfall was recorded automatically at 15 min intervals by a tipping bucket a conflux groove was constructed in a trench at the lower end of the profile of the plot to collect the fracture flow from the interface of the fractured mudrock and the impermeable sandstone fracture flow discharge was measured by a customized tipping bucket gauge at 15 min intervals almost no fracture flow occurs during the dry season from early december to the following april during the rainy season from may to november fracture flow is the dominant flow type zhao et al 2016 in this system fracture flow was sampled daily with a syringe pump at the outlet of the conflux groove as the flow occurred at the beginning of the rainy season in 2013 in cases of large rainfall events sampling of the fracture flow was carried out twice per day at 08 00 a m and 20 00 p m the whole sampling period lasted for eight months from may through december until fracture flow ceased all the flow samples were stored in glass bottles prior to analysis after the flow sampling period surface sediment 5 cm in a small settling pond 200 cm long 100 cm wide and 150 cm deep receiving fracture flow was collected manually in january 2014 the sediment was dispersed in the fracture flow water and sonicated in a water bath sonicator kq 3000vde huqin equipement co ltd shanghai china for 30 min before settling the suspension with colloids 2 μm was recovered by the pipette method according to stokes law and was subsequently oven dried 60 c in addition soil and rock samples were collected in the plot the sampling depth was 0 15 cm plough layer for the soil samples and 5 cm below the interface between the soil layer and the weathered mudrock for the rock samples three upper locations near the trench were sampled the samples were air dried and sieved through 150 μm for analysis 2 2 2 monitoring of the well system five wells were constructed and are used as the only sources of drinking water for the local residents in the lower part of the catchment three of these wells were selected and monitored for water and colloid dynamics fig 1 two wells i e the zhaoxingqiang well and zhangfei well that exhibit different perturbations were chosen the zhaoxingqiang well is located at the footslope and the water is extracted only via bailing the zhangfei well is located in the valley close to the outlet of the catchment and the water is extracted via pump withdrawal in addition a third well the xinjing well that experiences no human perturbations and that is located in the woods on the mid slope below the sloping farmland plot was also selected as a monitoring well given the much lower fluctuations of the well water compared with the fluctuations of fracture flow in the sloping farmland plot water was sampled biweekly from the three wells the water level recorded as the depth below the ground and temperature were measured manually while sampling water samples from the wells were collected by a low flow rate syringe pump at 30 50 cm below the water surface the sampling period lasted for one year starting in january 2013 after the last water sampling surface sediments 5 cm at the bottoms of the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells were collected through core sampling in january 2014 the collected sediment samples were dispersed in the well water and colloid fractions were recovered using the same method that was described for the sloping farmland plot similarly soil and rock samples from the farmland and or forestland at the mid slope and foot slope close to each well approximately 5 m away were collected each with three replicates the soil sampling depths were 0 15 cm and 35 40 cm for the farmland and 0 10 cm for the forest the sampling depth for the rock layer was 5 cm below the soil rock interface the samples were treated in the same way as the soil and rock samples collected from the sloping farmland plot 2 2 3 sample analysis fracture flow and well water samples were analyzed for water chemistry and colloid concentrations ph electrical conductivity ec and colloid concentration were determined within 12 h after sampling ph and ec were measured by a ph and ec meter sension mm150 hach company loveland co usa the psd of the groundwater samples was measured by a laser scattering psd analyzer la950 horiba ltd kyoto japan detailed information on this process can be found in zhang et al 2016 colloid numbers in the groundwater samples were calculated by eq 1 supporting information colloid absorbency in all the water samples was determined for colloid concentration by a spectrophotometer tu 1810 purkinje general instrument co beijing china at a wavelength of 400 nm using a calibration curve of the colloid mass concentration mg l against absorbance additional absorbance and psd measurements were carried out on the water samples after ultrasound treatment 2 min 100 w in a water bath sonicator then the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and used for the determination of the dissolved organic carbon doc and divalent cation ca2 and mg2 concentrations the doc concentration was measured by a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal analytical norderstedt germany cation concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics 900 dionex sunnyvale ca usa the colloids that were separated from the surface sediments collected at the fracture flow outlet and well bottoms as well as the soil and rock samples from the two systems were analyzed for organic matter oc content carbonate content mineral composition and δ 13c content the oc and carbonate contents were measured by the potassium dichromate method and titration method respectively the mineral composition was determined by x ray diffraction d max 2500 rigaku corporation japan the δ 13c content was determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus thermo scientific usa coupled to an elemental analyzer 1112 flash ea thermo scientific usa 2 3 statistical analysis partial redundancy analysis prda performed by variation partitioning analysis vpa using vegan in r was conducted to identify the quantitative variation in the contribution of flow discharge well depth and the physicochemical groundwater parameters to colloid dynamics prda has already been used in water quality studies by other researchers buffam et al 2016 heier et al 2010 moreover structural equation modeling sem performed by lavaan in r rosseel 2012 was conducted to further test the relationships between colloid dynamics in the fracture flow and the rainfall hydraulics and flow chemistries multiple goodness of fit criteria including the χ2 test p 0 05 the goodness of fit index gfi 0 90 and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 08 were used in the sem in addition pearson correlation and multi linear regression stepwise method analyses were used in combination to evaluate the relationship between colloid concentration dynamics and flow water physicochemical properties moreover one way anova snk test for post hoc multiple comparisons p 0 05 was applied in the significance difference tests for the oc carbonate and δ 13c contents of the environmental samples the software package spss 17 0 and origin 8 0 for windows were used for these statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of fracture flow and well water in 2013 fracture flow did not occur until the onset of a rain event on 1 may rainfall 17 6 mm i max 5 6 mm h fig 2 afterwards fracture flow lasted throughout the course of the rainy season and ceased in december generally distinct peaks of fracture flow discharge occurred following the perturbations caused by rain events specifically sharp peaks of fracture flow discharge occurred during heavy storms only e g on 18 july 22 july and 19 september descriptive statistics of the hydraulic and physicochemical parameters of the fracture flow are presented in table 1 the fracture flow discharge showed the largest variation cv 1 87 between 0 089 and 67 22 l min and the corresponding daily flow depth varied between 0 004 and 14 64 mm day cv 1 31 the well developed preferential pathways i e soil macropores and mudrock fractures facilitated rapid rainwater infiltration and subsurface flow recession resulting in a substantial variation in flow discharge within a short time in response to a rain event the fracture flow was chemically neutral to alkaline flow ph showed little variation cv 0 05 between 6 75 and 8 81 which could be ascribed to the buffering capacity of the calcareous purple soil in this region the ec of the fracture flow varied between 441 and 769 μs cm the mixing of the dilute rainwater ec 30 μs cm with the mobile soil pore water was responsible for the decrease in fracture flow ec divalent cation ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the fracture flow showed moderate variations the average ca2 and mg2 concentrations were 83 36 mg l and 15 70 mg l respectively and were in a similar range as those of the fracture flow from the karst limestone aquifers atteia et al 1998 yang et al 2013 the doc concentrations of the fracture flow showed greater variation cv 0 46 between 0 28 and 3 82 mg l higher doc concentrations were generally observed in the summer from june to september when the intensive dry wet cycles facilitated the release of soil organic carbon into the soil pore water and subsequently appeared in the fracture flow the water levels in the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells gradually decreased to the lowest levels at the end of the dry season april 2013 figs s1 s2 supporting information in contrast the water level in the zhangfei well which is located near the catchment outlet showed obvious fluctuations fig s3 that could have been caused by the frequent pumping of drinking water with the arrival of the rainy season in early may the water levels of the three wells gradually increased and exhibited the first peaks in late june while other distinct peaks also occurred after heavy storms in comparison to the distinct peaks of fracture flow discharge observed in the sloping farmland plot the three wells exhibited fewer water level peaks but with much longer durations indicating the slower and lagged response of the shallow well water to rain events the water temperature of the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells varied between 10 1 and 25 1 c table s1 with an obvious peak occurring in august figs s1 s2 the water temperature of the zhangfei well remained at a plateau of approximately 19 c from early august to early november fig s3 which is much lower than those of the other two wells the smallest variation in water temperature in this well cv 0 07 table s1 was due to its largest depth below ground 4 m as compared to the depths of the other two wells so that the deeper groundwater was less affected by air temperature the ph of the well water was in the same range as that of the fracture flow but the ec of the well water was significantly higher p 0 01 than that of the fracture flow both the ec and the major divalent cation concentrations ca2 and mg2 of water from the zhangfei well were significantly higher than those from the other two wells p 0 01 probably due to the release of cations from thicker soil and rock layers into the groundwater the doc concentration of the xinjing well water increased rapidly in early may and reached a maximum 11 8 mg l in mid june fig s1 the increase in the doc concentration was mainly ascribed to the early leaching of the organic carbon pool in the shallow soil which was supplied by decaying wood litter that had accumulated in the dry season a lower average doc concentration was observed in the zhaoxingqiang well fig s2 and the lowest level was found in the zhangfei well fig s3 indicating the retention of doc by the soil during its downward transport 3 2 dynamics of colloids in shallow groundwater the daily colloid concentration of the fracture flow varied from 0 54 to 31 90 mg l with an average concentration of 1 64 mg l table 1 a high colloid concentration lasted approximately 1 week with an average concentration of 5 59 mg l observed after the commencement of the fracture flow on 1 may fig 2 this phenomenon was unique and specific to the very beginning of the rainy season following a long dry period during which the differential capillary stresses might lead to soil matrix and or soil pores weakening and further colloid generation michel et al 2010 the abundant mobilized colloids were continuously transported to the fracture flow due to the advancement of the wetting front of the newly infiltrated rainwater which was responsible for the clustering of high colloid concentration this finding is consistent with other findings from column studies majdalini et al 2008 mohanty et al 2015b afterwards the colloid concentration generally stayed at a lower base level 1 15 mg l during the non rainy days except for a few peaks that were several or even tens of times the base level in response to heavy storms the highest colloid concentration was 31 90 mg l and was observed during the storm on 19 september rainfall 92 2 mm fig 2 the second highest colloid concentration was 27 50 mg l and was observed during the storm on 22 july rainfall 120 1 mm fig 2 the durations of elevated colloid levels less than one day were shorter than those of elevated flow discharges several days which is consistent with the reported faster increases in colloid concentration compared to those of the subsurface flow discharge during rain events in a number of field studies el farhan et al 2000 mckay et al 2000 schiperski et al 2016 toran et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 in the three lowland wells the colloid mass concentration varied between 0 20 and 11 66 mg l and the corresponding number concentration varied between 1 62 107 and 1 07 109 colloids l table 2 the colloid populations observed in this study were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in the granitic groundwater from the grimsel test site degueldre et al 1989 and in coastal groundwater rani and sasidhar 2011 colloid concentrations of the groundwater in the wells varied in a much smaller range and exhibited much lower peak concentrations and less temporal variations than those of the fracture flow from the sloping farmland in addition decreasing trend of the average colloid concentration from 2 72 mg l in the xinjing well to 1 42 mg l in the zhangfei well close to the catchment outlet was observed which could be attributed partially to the increased retention of subsurface colloid transported along the streamline a similar colloid concentration decline with distance in the down gradient wells was previously reported mckay et al 2000 however the temporal dynamics of the colloid concentration showed different patterns among the three wells in the xinjing well which was not subjected to human activity the colloid mass concentration increased gradually from less than 2 00 mg l at the end of the dry season to a peak of 7 62 mg l in mid june followed by a rapid decrease to below 2 00 mg l fig s1 this observation is similar to observations from the sloping farmland plot in which colloid concentration increased to a plateau in response to rain events at the early rainy season however this is not the case for the other two wells in the zhaoxingqiang well a distinct colloid concentration peak 11 66 mg l occurred on 2 july in response to the previous consecutive storms 30 june to 1 july cumulative rainfall of 203 2 mm fig s2 a much smaller response of the colloid concentration to these storms was observed in the zhangfei well fig s3 however a secondary colloid concentration peak in the zhaoxingqiang well and major peaks in the zhangfei well appeared during the dry season by the end of april when water levels were very low and continuously declined in both wells these peaks were mainly the result of perturbations related to water extraction the frequent bailing from the zhaoxingqiang well and pump withdrawal of water from the zhangfei well at low water levels facilitated the re suspension of previously deposited colloids at the well bottoms similarly rani and sasidhar 2011 reported that the physical perturbations of water extraction led to the artifact of increased colloid concentrations in the wells in addition sediment re suspension has been reported to contribute up to 55 of the natural colloids suspended in the water column in a lake xu et al 2018 the effects of the ultrasound treatment of the water bath on the colloid concentration of the groundwater samples are presented in figs s4 s5 the c us c ratios were all higher than 1 1 the dotted line regardless of the fracture flow samples or well water samples indicating that the colloids in the shallow groundwater existed as aggregates in the present study the high electrical conductivities and particularly high ca2 concentrations 57 04 107 03 mg l for the fracture flow and 77 00 207 03 mg l for the well water that far exceeded the critical coagulation concentration ccc of purple soil 24 mg l and mudrock 16 mg l particles zhang et al 2016 would have extensively neutralized the negative charges in the diffuse electric double layer edl of the colloids the resulting compression of the edl further promoted the colloid coagulation similar findings of divalent cation induced colloid coagulation were reported by other studies kuno et al 2002 shiyan et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the psd of fracture flow samples from the hillslope has been explored in our previous single event based studies zhang et al 2015 2016 suspended particles in the fracture flow ranging in size from submicron to more than 100 μm were observed while the colloid 2 μm presence was lower than 1 however the psd of the well water exhibited a different pattern from that of the fracture flow as shown in fig 3 a smaller size range from submicron up to 40 μm a slightly higher colloid percentage 2 4 7 0 and smaller median sizes 4 2 10 0 μm were observed table 3 low percentages of colloid in the fracture flow and lowland wells were ascribed to colloid diffusion into dead end voids such as the soil matrix or fracture apertures during the subsurface transport process this matched the observations from other studies e g alonso et al 2007 mondal and sleep 2012 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 the much smaller maximum size of suspended particles and the higher cumulative particle percentage from colloids to coarse particles 2 10 μm in the well water relative to the fracture flow implies a greater retardation of large particles 10 μm during their transport in the catchment gravity sedimentation acts as the main cause of immobilization of large particles especially in horizontal flow conduits and or when the flow rate decreases however the gravity effect of colloids exhibited an insignificant influence on colloid mobilization and transport in finely fractured aquifer in the present study considering the intense driving force of macropore flow and or fracture flow that enabled the transport and enrichment of coarse particles in the well water monhanty et al 2015a also reported the irrelevance of gravity sedimentation on colloid transport as the 1 8 μm colloids recovered to a greater extent than the 0 5 μm colloids during transport in a macroporous soil the environmental implications of the psd results for regions characterized by finely fractured aquifers are that particle investigation of the groundwater in these areas should include but not be limited to colloids coarse particles up to 10 μm should also be taken into account apparent shifts towards smaller groundwater psds following ultrasound treatment are also shown in fig 3 the colloid percentage increased by a factor of 3 0 2 5 and 13 8 in the xinjing well zhaoxingqiang well and zhangfei well respectively breakage of the coagulated colloids especially in the high salinity zhangfei well led to the increase in the colloid presence following the ultrasound treatment 3 3 physicochemical perturbations of colloid dynamics in the fracture flow and shallow groundwater due to the large temporal variation in the fracture flow discharge cv 1 87 table 1 it is reasonable to separate the flow discharge into high and low ranges according to the median flow discharge 1 3 l min for further detailed analyses via prda pearson correlation and multi linear regression analysis according to the prda a total of 67 84 and 84 28 of the variations in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow could be explained for the general cases and the high flow discharge cases respectively to which flow discharge contributed more than 45 fig 4 this finding indicates the dominance of flow discharge instead of flow chemistry on colloid mobilization and transport in the fracture flow from the hillslope sem was employed to explore the routes and extensions of the physicochemical factors on colloid dynamics in the fracture flow our model explained 60 of the variance in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow fig 5 flow discharge can impact colloid dynamics directly λ 0 70 p 0 001 and can also impose an indirect effect on colloid dynamics by affecting flow chemistry λ 0 25 p 0 01 in contrast flow chemistry showed a half less importance of direct impact λ 0 31 p 0 001 on colloid dynamics this is in accordance with prda in which flow discharge acted as the primary and positive factor influencing colloid dynamics in addition the colloid concentration was significantly positively correlated with the fracture flow discharge with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 756 which is much greater than that of the chemical parameters table 4 similarly flow discharge showed the largest influence 53 27 on colloid mobilization and transport dynamics among all the physicochemical parameters according to the multi linear regression analysis table 4 for the fracture flow samples taken at high discharges 1 3 l min an increased correlation 0 885 of colloid dynamics with flow discharge and a slightly larger effect 58 09 of flow discharge on colloid transport was observed this result agrees with the results of the prda and sem analyses the fracture flow derived shear force which corresponds to flow discharge and possibly coupled with the air water interface especially following the dry period is the main mechanism for colloid scoring mobilization and transport in the fracture flow hydraulic shearing has also been reported as the dominant force controlling colloid dynamics in fractured geologic media elsewhere in response to rainfall mohanty et al 2015a shevenell and mccarthy 2002 weisbrod et al 2002 in contrast for the low flow discharge cases only 20 73 of the variation in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow was explained and was due nearly exclusively to flow chemistry fig 4 the colloid concentration showed insignificant correlations with flow discharge in this situation table 4 the influence of the fracture flow discharge decreased by half more from 50 to 21 67 table 4 and became the secondary factor for colloid mobilization and transport unlike in the two aforementioned situations therefore the physical perturbation of hydraulic infiltration exhibits a primary effect on colloid mobilization and transport dynamics in the fracture flow from the hillslope in general in particular this effect retreats to secondary importance behind flow chemistry ph mg2 and doc when the fracture flow discharge is low 1 3 l min increased hydraulic retention of fracture flow occurs at low flow discharges facilitating the interactions of colloids with groundwater the ph 7 21 8 81 8 10 on average of fracture flow at low discharges was significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the general fracture flow 6 75 8 81 7 96 on average and flow at high discharges 6 75 8 74 7 82 on average according to the calculations from zhou et al 2011 the surface potential ζ potential of soil colloids increased from 49 mv to 68 mv more negative when the solution ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 therefore the significantly increased flow ph at low discharges leads to the increase in electrostatic repulsion between colloids and the solid surfaces and further favors colloid mobilization into fracture flow the depth variations in the well water which were directly affected by subsurface flow discharge offered almost no explanations for colloid dynamics in the lowland wells fig 4 water chemistry accounted for 21 73 70 11 of the explained variations 24 35 77 03 indicating the dominant role of water chemistry on colloid dynamics in the lowland wells with respect to water chemistry ec and mg2 in most cases as well as ca2 in certain cases tables 4 5 showed a significant negative effect on colloid dynamics in both the well water and fracture flow this phenomenon agrees with the dlvo theory with the remarkable decrease in ec or divalent cation concentrations in groundwater for example due to the incorporation of dilute rainwater irrigation and or recharge water an increased repulsive energy barrier could develop between the dispersed colloids and the solid surfaces soil matrix and or pore fracture surfaces and thus favor the dispersion and mobilization of colloids ryan and gschwend 1994 zhang et al 2012 many researchers have reported a negative correlation between the stability of colloids and solution ionic strength in column scale studies albarran et al 2014 masciopinto and visino 2017 morales et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 and in stream water in a small watershed mills et al 2017 in contrast the doc exhibits a general positive correlation with groundwater colloid concentration and a dominant effect on colloid dynamics in the xinjing well the sorption of doc molecules to natural colloids has been widely recognized leading to the modified surface negative charges of colloids in most cases xu et al 2018 this modification would promote the electric repulsions between colloids and solid surfaces and further increase the chances of colloid mobilization other researchers have reported the promotion of colloid stability by dissolved organic matter in natural groundwater as well as improved colloid transport in the presence of doc cheng and sailers 2015 morales et al 2011 shiyan et al 2014 moreover the adsorbed doc could also block the deposition sites especially at a high flow rate yang et al 2015 leading to the enhanced mobility of colloids in groundwater however no significant correlations between the colloid concentration and water chemistries were found for the zhangfei well instead there was a distinct negative correlation between the water temperature and the colloid concentration in this well table 5 a trend that was not observed in the fracture flow or the other two wells this observation implies that provided the highest ec and cation concentrations which are favorable for colloid coagulation in this well the small increases in water temperature 3 3 c from may to october could lead to the enhanced brownian motion of the coagulated colloids the improved collision of the inter coagulated colloids potentially promotes the formation of large particles that could easily settle to the well bottom due to gravity sedimentation resulting in fewer colloids present in the well water this hypothesis is in agreement with a laboratory study in which a decrease of the stability of the latex colloidal system with increasing of solution temperature was observed garcia garcia et al 2006 this relationship does not exist for the other two wells or the fracture flow attributable to the much lower salinities in these cases 3 4 groundwater colloid characteristics and source identification mineral composition and calcium carbonate organic matter oc and δ 13c abundance were used to characterize groundwater colloids and soil and rock samples from upper geological media for the identification of colloid sources a number of minerals quartz plagioclase feldspar calcite hematite montmorillonite illite chlorite etc were detected in all three categories of solids but in different proportions fig s6 quartz and illite were the two major minerals in the soil and underlying mudrock in the sloping farmland plot while quartz was the dominant mineral in both the soil and mudrock samples collected from the farmlands and forestlands near the wells at both the sloping farmland site and the well sites the lowest content of quartz and the highest content of illite were observed in the groundwater colloids and not the soil or mudrock samples this observation is consistent with the findings of lei et al 2004 who also found a higher proportion of illite in the mineral colloids than in the purple soil itself this is also the case for the colloids in the subsurface water from the adit of an abandoned mine filella et al 2009 in addition an increase in the percentage of illite in colloids in a river was ascribed to the high load of soil colloids in the watershed during the snow melting period chanudet and filella 2008 as presented in fig s7 groundwater colloids in both the fracture flow and well water had a significantly p 0 05 higher calcium carbonate content 25 than the soils or mudrocks of the nearby geological media the enriched carbonate content in the groundwater colloids could be explained by the precipitation of calcium carbonates facilitating the physical inter and intra cementing of colloids during the process of colloid dispersion and generation zhao et al 2012 in addition the hematite could also act as the cementing material as shown in the inset graphs in fig s6 groundwater colloids had the highest proportion of hematite whose presence can facilitate the chemical bonding of organic substances to mineral particles schulten and leinweber 2000 therefore groundwater colloid complexation by dissolved organic matter potentially increases the oc content of colloids in the sloping farmland plot the oc content of the colloids 0 91 0 06 in the fracture flow showed an insignificant difference p 0 05 to that of the soil 0 71 0 13 while both of them were significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the rock 0 2 0 02 fig s7 groundwater colloids from both the xinjing well and zhaoxingqiang well had significantly higher p 0 05 oc contents 1 02 0 11 and 0 96 0 08 respectively than the rocks 0 21 of the upper farmlands or forestlands fig s7 these findings might exclude the possibility that fractured rocks in the hillslope or the upper farmlands and forestlands of the lowland wells are the source of the groundwater colloids in addition the oc content of the groundwater colloids was slightly higher than that of the shallow soil of the upper farmlands considering the increased oc content of colloids due to the complexation of dissolved organic matter in the groundwater shallow soil from the upper farmland rather than the forest soil may act as the major source of groundwater colloids in the present study in addition to the above parameters δ 13c was also used to help identify the source of the groundwater colloids in the sloping farmland plot the δ 13c abundance of the colloids 15 13 0 24 in the fracture flow was not significantly different p 0 05 from that of the soil 14 45 0 46 but both of them were significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the underlying mudrock 9 24 0 27 fig 6 this result indicates that the colloids in the fracture flow originate from the shallow soil of the sloping farmland which agrees with the results of the source identification based on the mineral composition organic matter and calcium carbonate in the xinjing well the δ 13c abundance of colloids 14 61 0 18 was slightly lower p 0 05 than that of the shallow soil 14 34 0 33 from the upper farmland these results were markedly different from those of the other geological samples in the zhaoxingqiang well groundwater colloids showed a similar δ 13c abundance 14 61 0 18 as that of the shallow soil 15 27 0 07 and underlying mudrock 14 90 0 43 of the upper farmland while all of these samples had markedly lower p 0 05 δ 13c abundances than those of the deep farmland soil and forest soil and rocks this phenomenon implies little contributions from nearby forestlands to the groundwater colloids in the well as mudrock has been demonstrated to be an unlikely source of the groundwater colloids the δ 13c abundances also suggest that shallow farmland soil is the major source of colloids present in the lowland wells this is the first attempt to identify groundwater colloid origination by using δ 13c however the incorporation of δ 13c in colloid source tracing should be combined with other characteristic parameters e g mineral composition and calcium carbonate and organic matter content for better reliability 4 conclusion our study provides quantitative evidence indicating that different mechanisms dominate colloid dynamics in different groundwater patterns hydraulic perturbations of rainwater infiltration exhibit a large and direct effect on colloid mobilization and transport via the fracture flow from the upper hillslope subsequently the variations in physicochemical properties of flow water along subsurface transport pathways exert a major effect on colloid dynamics in the lowland wells these understandings of colloid mobilization and transport mechanisms are crucial to prioritizing the monitoring of flow water parameters which may govern colloid dynamics in shallow groundwater in addition to the high concentrations of colloids maximums of 31 90 mg l and 11 66 mg l in the facture flow and well water respectively which exist in coagulated forms a high percentage 47 7 92 0 of coarse particles 2 10 μm indicate the importance of including coarse particles in the monitoring scheme of shallow groundwater especially in finely fractured aquifers and or karst aquifers moreover the new approach proposed in this study for source identification of groundwater colloids by simultaneous analyses of δ 13c and mineral composition organic matter and carbonate content in groundwater colloids and the upper geological samples would be useful for colloid facilitated contaminant transport studies in large catchments with spatially varying geological media acknowledgements this study was

18905,field scale studies of natural colloid mobilization and transport in finely fractured aquifer as well as the source identification of groundwater colloids are of great importance to the safety of shallow groundwater in this study the daily monitoring of fracture flow from a sloping farmland plot and the biweekly monitoring of three lowland shallow wells within the same catchment were carried out simultaneously in 2013 the effects of physicochemical perturbations on groundwater colloid dynamics were explored in detail using partial redundancy analysis structural equation modeling pearson correlation and multi linear regression analyses the characterization and source identification of groundwater colloids were addressed via multiple parameters the daily colloid concentration in the fracture flow varied between 0 54 and 31 90 mg l 1 64 mg l on average unique periods of high colloid concentration 5 59 mg l on average occurred during the initially generated flow following the dry season in comparison a narrower colloid concentration range of 0 24 11 66 mg l was observed in the lowland shallow wells with a smaller temporal variation than that of the fracture flow a low percentage 2 4 7 0 of colloids and a high percentage 47 7 92 0 of coarse particles 2 10 μm were present in the lowland well water hydraulic perturbation by rainwater infiltration in the sloping farmland was the dominant mechanism for colloid mobilization in general this effect retreated to secondary importance behind chemical perturbations ph mg2 and doc at low flow discharges 1 3 l min in contrast water chemistry e g ec cations and doc concentrations exhibited a major effect on colloid dynamics in the water of the lowland wells except for the extremely high salinity water of one well in which water temperature showed a negative dominant influence on colloid stability the combined use of multiple parameters e g mineral composition and organic matter calcium carbonate and δ 13c contents traced groundwater colloids to the shallow soil in the upper farmlands it is strongly advised that in finely fractured aquifers within agricultural catchments not only the small colloids but also the coarse particles in the size range of 2 10 μm should be monitored in case of colloid associated contamination from agricultural wastes e g n p pesticides and or heavy metals especially at the early stages of the rainy seasons graphical abstract image 1 keywords fracture flow groundwater colloid transport source identification 1 introduction mass transfer in the vadose zone has been a major concern in transport studies of different geospheres in general in particular the frequent temporal and spatial variations in physical and chemical conditions in the vadose zone exert a great effect on the fate e g release mobilization and transport of water dispersible colloids colloids include fine particles of several micrometers to macromolecules of several nanometers and are ubiquitous in the subsurface liu et al 2018 the release of colloids from a solid surface is determined mechanically by the interactions of repulsive and attractive forces between the colloid and the solid surface only when the repulsive forces overcome the attractive forces can colloids be detached and mobilized degueldre and benedicto 2012 torkzaban et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 mobilized colloids are susceptible to transport into groundwater during which colloid facilitated transport of various strongly sorbing contaminants e g phosphorus nitrogen pharmaceuticals pesticides heavy metals and radionuclides has been frequently reported delwiche et al 2014 ge et al 2018 judy et al 2018 missong et al 2018 mohanty et al 2014 tran et al 2018 xing et al 2015 in particular pathogens e g viruses and bacteria either occur in groundwater in bio colloid forms zhang et al 2012 as in most cases or are associated with inorganic colloids in wastewater walsge et al 2010 both forms have been demonstrated to move through shallow aquifers with little retention and are present in groundwater due to colloid facilitated transport göppert and goldscheider 2008 maciopinto et al 2008 which may lead to the outbreak of waterborne diseases therefore it is of great importance to explore subsurface colloid transport characteristics which provides a pre requisite for experimental and modeling research on colloid facilitated contaminant transport numerous studies concerning colloid mobilization and subsequent transport as well as the facilitated transport of various contaminants by colloids have been carried out in the laboratory e g in repacked intact columns and fractured cores ge et al 2018 kuno et al 2002 liu et al 2018 mishurov et al 2008 mitropoulou et al 2013 mohanty et al 2014 mondal and sleep 2012 morales et al 2011 tran et al 2018 walshe et al 2010 the flow rate ph ionic strength divalent cations dissolved organic matter etc of a solution have been widely reported to affect colloid mobilization transport and the association of contaminants to colloids in these studies however the ideal or synthetic colloid tracers e g nanoparticles or microspheres of specific sizes shapes densities and surface properties that were frequently used in these studies do not resemble the various natural colloids present in groundwater in addition colloid mobilization and transport in a column core with a relatively homogeneous structure or a steady state of flow may exhibit large discrepancies from those observed in field scenarios seaman et al 2007 demonstrated that colloid mobilization and transport in an aquifer did not follow shear force predictions from well controlled column scale studies this discrepancy leads to the necessity for the field scale study of the mobilization and transport of naturally occurring colloids in groundwater at the field scale water flow and organic carbon were observed to have a profound effect on colloid generation in groundwater kaplan et al 1993 the released colloid load in shallow aquifers was also found to increase with the ph of recharge water especially when it exceeded the phpzc of the inorganic colloids rebacca et al 2002 the authors also reported that the decrease in ionic strength did not facilitate significant colloid mobilization which differs from that observed in many column scale studies e g kuno et al 2002 mitropoulou et al 2013 mondal and sleep 2012 colloid mobilization and transport in response to natural rainfall and artificial irrigation events were also observed in vadose zone lysimeters and were partially attributed to the moving air water interfaces in the unsaturated aquifer liu et al 2018 a similar quick response of natural colloid mobilization and transport in fracture flow due to hydraulic scouring and the movement of the air water interface has been demonstrated in a fractured mudstone zhang et al 2015 2016 and in a fractured karst aquifer pronk et al 2009 in addition the quick mobilization and transport of colloids within the first several hours following flow infiltration as well as the occurrences of lower colloid concentration peaks several days later in fractured chalk have been reported weisbrod et al 2002 these results imply the potential for large load and long distance transport of colloids in groundwater originating from macroporous or fractured media where preferential flow pathways prevail however colloid mobilization in shallow aquifers for example induced by water injection showed significant spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to the local hydrogeologic conditions seaman et al 2007 moreover the complex interplay between physical perturbations of rainfall infiltrations and chemical reactions e g water ph and ionic strength contributed to colloid load in well water in karst aquifers shevenell and mccarthy 2002 however the relative importance of physical and chemical perturbation has not yet been identified nevertheless the existing field scale studies of natural colloid mobilization and transport in the subsurface were based on single events e g natural or artificial rainfall irrigation groundwater recharge the long tails and erratic pulses of colloid concentrations observed during the drainage process in these field scale studies further indicate the importance of the investigation of colloid mobilization and transport over a longer time scale in addition the re mobilization or re suspension of the clogged coagulated colloids and the increased load of small colloids caused by the breakdown of large aggregates may also occur due to the flow regime and the resultant variations in water chemistry induced over time especially under fluctuating natural weather conditions göppert and goldscheider 2008 continuous field scale investigations of natural colloids and groundwater flow dynamics in response to various rainfall events in different geological media are necessary to better understand the temporal and spatial variations of colloid transport in a large field various geological media e g soils weathered rocks sediments till deposits epikarst could act as the sources of natural colloids present in groundwater but contribute different colloid loads albarran et al 2014 degueldre and cloet 2016 mccarthy and mckay 2004 pronk et al 2009 schiperski et al 2016 in addition field studies have indicated that colloid transport in response to water infiltration showed site specific characteristics e g breakthrough time recovery peak colloid concentration göppert and goldscheider 2008 zhang et al 2016 therefore it is also important to trace the sources of natural colloids to more accurately evaluate the potential of colloid facilitated contaminant transport particle size distribution psd was used for the source identification of autochthonous particles inside an aquifer and allochthonous particles derived from the land surface in karst groundwater pronk et al 2007 morphological and mineralogical evidence is also useful for tracking the potential sources of suspended sediments in surface water chanudet and filella 2008 mills et al 2017 and shallow groundwater filella et al 2009 herman et al 2007 however the feasibility of these technologies for groundwater colloid source identification needs to be tested and other technologies are still inadequate 13c stable isotope analysis of organic matter provides information about carbon transfer between different geomedia with distinct carbon isotope signatures engelmann et al 2018 this parameter has been increasingly applied in recent decades in the source identification of sediment from soils of different land uses within a catchment gibbs 2008 guan et al 2017 however no application of 13c in colloid source identification has been conducted the vast 160 000 km2 hilly region of central sichuan in the upper reaches of the yangtze river is characterized by thin purple soil cover and underlying finely fractured mudrock frequent occurrences of preferential flow have been demonstrated in finely fractured aquifer in this region zhao et al 2013 as a result the mobilized colloids in the subsurface were enriched in the fracture flow zhang et al 2015 2016 and could be transported to lowland drinking wells in this study a sloping farmland plot 0 15 hm2 located in a relatively high part of the jieliu catchment and three lowland shallow wells along the streamline to the catchment outlet were selected fracture flow from the hillslope and well water from the lowland wells were investigated simultaneously for a year to investigate the mechanisms regarding the mobilization and transport of natural colloids daily and biweekly monitoring were carried out for the fracture flow and the well water respectively the relationship between the dynamics of colloid concentration and the dynamics of physiochemical perturbations in the shallow groundwater was analyzed and discussed thoroughly using partial redundancy analysis prda structural equation modeling sem pearson correlation and multi linear regression analysis in addition the characterization and source identification of groundwater colloids were carried out by multi parameter comparisons between the colloids and nearby geological samples soils and weathered mudrocks from the upper farmlands and or forests to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to quantitatively characterize the interplay of physical and chemical factors in natural colloid dynamics for different shallow groundwater

mineral composition organic matter and calcium carbonate to identify groundwater colloid sources is expected to provide new insights regarding colloid source identification the in situ investigation results presented in this study may provide theoretical and modeling information regarding natural colloid mobilization and transport in large fields e g catchment scale and may also help protect shallow groundwater from potential contamination by colloids and colloid associated agricultural wastes in not only finely fractured media but also karst aquifers elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study site is located in the small jieliu catchment fig 1 which has an area of 0 35 km2 and is located in hilly central sichuan province southwest china the annual mean temperature and rainfall from 1981 to 2006 in this area were 17 3 c and 826 mm respectively the cumulative rainfall from may to september accounted for 85 of the annual precipitation sloping farmland is the major land use type a proportion of 44 in the catchment with an average slope of approximately 6 the typical soil in the catchment is a readily erodible purple soil with abundant macropores which could contribute over 87 of the flow wang et al 2015 the soil thickness on the slopes varies from 25 cm to 60 cm mudrock with visible fine fractures lies beneath the shallow purple soil and overlies an impermeable sandstone other land use types of the catchment include forests woods 35 paddy fields 11 and residential areas 10 considering the application of agricultural chemicals to farmlands and their potential rapid transport via preferential flow in dissolved and colloid associated forms the subsurface transport of colloids from a sloping farmland plot on the upper slope and the dynamics of colloid concentrations in three lowland shallow wells were investigated in this study 2 2 methods 2 2 1 monitoring of the sloping farmland plot a farmland plot 0 15 hm2 with an average slope of 6 was constructed on the upper slope in the catchment fig 1 details on the experimental plot can be found in zhang et al 2015 briefly rainfall was recorded automatically at 15 min intervals by a tipping bucket a conflux groove was constructed in a trench at the lower end of the profile of the plot to collect the fracture flow from the interface of the fractured mudrock and the impermeable sandstone fracture flow discharge was measured by a customized tipping bucket gauge at 15 min intervals almost no fracture flow occurs during the dry season from early december to the following april during the rainy season from may to november fracture flow is the dominant flow type zhao et al 2016 in this system fracture flow was sampled daily with a syringe pump at the outlet of the conflux groove as the flow occurred at the beginning of the rainy season in 2013 in cases of large rainfall events sampling of the fracture flow was carried out twice per day at 08 00 a m and 20 00 p m the whole sampling period lasted for eight months from may through december until fracture flow ceased all the flow samples were stored in glass bottles prior to analysis after the flow sampling period surface sediment 5 cm in a small settling pond 200 cm long 100 cm wide and 150 cm deep receiving fracture flow was collected manually in january 2014 the sediment was dispersed in the fracture flow water and sonicated in a water bath sonicator kq 3000vde huqin equipement co ltd shanghai china for 30 min before settling the suspension with colloids 2 μm was recovered by the pipette method according to stokes law and was subsequently oven dried 60 c in addition soil and rock samples were collected in the plot the sampling depth was 0 15 cm plough layer for the soil samples and 5 cm below the interface between the soil layer and the weathered mudrock for the rock samples three upper locations near the trench were sampled the samples were air dried and sieved through 150 μm for analysis 2 2 2 monitoring of the well system five wells were constructed and are used as the only sources of drinking water for the local residents in the lower part of the catchment three of these wells were selected and monitored for water and colloid dynamics fig 1 two wells i e the zhaoxingqiang well and zhangfei well that exhibit different perturbations were chosen the zhaoxingqiang well is located at the footslope and the water is extracted only via bailing the zhangfei well is located in the valley close to the outlet of the catchment and the water is extracted via pump withdrawal in addition a third well the xinjing well that experiences no human perturbations and that is located in the woods on the mid slope below the sloping farmland plot was also selected as a monitoring well given the much lower fluctuations of the well water compared with the fluctuations of fracture flow in the sloping farmland plot water was sampled biweekly from the three wells the water level recorded as the depth below the ground and temperature were measured manually while sampling water samples from the wells were collected by a low flow rate syringe pump at 30 50 cm below the water surface the sampling period lasted for one year starting in january 2013 after the last water sampling surface sediments 5 cm at the bottoms of the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells were collected through core sampling in january 2014 the collected sediment samples were dispersed in the well water and colloid fractions were recovered using the same method that was described for the sloping farmland plot similarly soil and rock samples from the farmland and or forestland at the mid slope and foot slope close to each well approximately 5 m away were collected each with three replicates the soil sampling depths were 0 15 cm and 35 40 cm for the farmland and 0 10 cm for the forest the sampling depth for the rock layer was 5 cm below the soil rock interface the samples were treated in the same way as the soil and rock samples collected from the sloping farmland plot 2 2 3 sample analysis fracture flow and well water samples were analyzed for water chemistry and colloid concentrations ph electrical conductivity ec and colloid concentration were determined within 12 h after sampling ph and ec were measured by a ph and ec meter sension mm150 hach company loveland co usa the psd of the groundwater samples was measured by a laser scattering psd analyzer la950 horiba ltd kyoto japan detailed information on this process can be found in zhang et al 2016 colloid numbers in the groundwater samples were calculated by eq 1 supporting information colloid absorbency in all the water samples was determined for colloid concentration by a spectrophotometer tu 1810 purkinje general instrument co beijing china at a wavelength of 400 nm using a calibration curve of the colloid mass concentration mg l against absorbance additional absorbance and psd measurements were carried out on the water samples after ultrasound treatment 2 min 100 w in a water bath sonicator then the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters and used for the determination of the dissolved organic carbon doc and divalent cation ca2 and mg2 concentrations the doc concentration was measured by a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal analytical norderstedt germany cation concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics 900 dionex sunnyvale ca usa the colloids that were separated from the surface sediments collected at the fracture flow outlet and well bottoms as well as the soil and rock samples from the two systems were analyzed for organic matter oc content carbonate content mineral composition and δ 13c content the oc and carbonate contents were measured by the potassium dichromate method and titration method respectively the mineral composition was determined by x ray diffraction d max 2500 rigaku corporation japan the δ 13c content was determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus thermo scientific usa coupled to an elemental analyzer 1112 flash ea thermo scientific usa 2 3 statistical analysis partial redundancy analysis prda performed by variation partitioning analysis vpa using vegan in r was conducted to identify the quantitative variation in the contribution of flow discharge well depth and the physicochemical groundwater parameters to colloid dynamics prda has already been used in water quality studies by other researchers buffam et al 2016 heier et al 2010 moreover structural equation modeling sem performed by lavaan in r rosseel 2012 was conducted to further test the relationships between colloid dynamics in the fracture flow and the rainfall hydraulics and flow chemistries multiple goodness of fit criteria including the χ2 test p 0 05 the goodness of fit index gfi 0 90 and the root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 08 were used in the sem in addition pearson correlation and multi linear regression stepwise method analyses were used in combination to evaluate the relationship between colloid concentration dynamics and flow water physicochemical properties moreover one way anova snk test for post hoc multiple comparisons p 0 05 was applied in the significance difference tests for the oc carbonate and δ 13c contents of the environmental samples the software package spss 17 0 and origin 8 0 for windows were used for these statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of fracture flow and well water in 2013 fracture flow did not occur until the onset of a rain event on 1 may rainfall 17 6 mm i max 5 6 mm h fig 2 afterwards fracture flow lasted throughout the course of the rainy season and ceased in december generally distinct peaks of fracture flow discharge occurred following the perturbations caused by rain events specifically sharp peaks of fracture flow discharge occurred during heavy storms only e g on 18 july 22 july and 19 september descriptive statistics of the hydraulic and physicochemical parameters of the fracture flow are presented in table 1 the fracture flow discharge showed the largest variation cv 1 87 between 0 089 and 67 22 l min and the corresponding daily flow depth varied between 0 004 and 14 64 mm day cv 1 31 the well developed preferential pathways i e soil macropores and mudrock fractures facilitated rapid rainwater infiltration and subsurface flow recession resulting in a substantial variation in flow discharge within a short time in response to a rain event the fracture flow was chemically neutral to alkaline flow ph showed little variation cv 0 05 between 6 75 and 8 81 which could be ascribed to the buffering capacity of the calcareous purple soil in this region the ec of the fracture flow varied between 441 and 769 μs cm the mixing of the dilute rainwater ec 30 μs cm with the mobile soil pore water was responsible for the decrease in fracture flow ec divalent cation ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the fracture flow showed moderate variations the average ca2 and mg2 concentrations were 83 36 mg l and 15 70 mg l respectively and were in a similar range as those of the fracture flow from the karst limestone aquifers atteia et al 1998 yang et al 2013 the doc concentrations of the fracture flow showed greater variation cv 0 46 between 0 28 and 3 82 mg l higher doc concentrations were generally observed in the summer from june to september when the intensive dry wet cycles facilitated the release of soil organic carbon into the soil pore water and subsequently appeared in the fracture flow the water levels in the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells gradually decreased to the lowest levels at the end of the dry season april 2013 figs s1 s2 supporting information in contrast the water level in the zhangfei well which is located near the catchment outlet showed obvious fluctuations fig s3 that could have been caused by the frequent pumping of drinking water with the arrival of the rainy season in early may the water levels of the three wells gradually increased and exhibited the first peaks in late june while other distinct peaks also occurred after heavy storms in comparison to the distinct peaks of fracture flow discharge observed in the sloping farmland plot the three wells exhibited fewer water level peaks but with much longer durations indicating the slower and lagged response of the shallow well water to rain events the water temperature of the xinjing and zhaoxingqiang wells varied between 10 1 and 25 1 c table s1 with an obvious peak occurring in august figs s1 s2 the water temperature of the zhangfei well remained at a plateau of approximately 19 c from early august to early november fig s3 which is much lower than those of the other two wells the smallest variation in water temperature in this well cv 0 07 table s1 was due to its largest depth below ground 4 m as compared to the depths of the other two wells so that the deeper groundwater was less affected by air temperature the ph of the well water was in the same range as that of the fracture flow but the ec of the well water was significantly higher p 0 01 than that of the fracture flow both the ec and the major divalent cation concentrations ca2 and mg2 of water from the zhangfei well were significantly higher than those from the other two wells p 0 01 probably due to the release of cations from thicker soil and rock layers into the groundwater the doc concentration of the xinjing well water increased rapidly in early may and reached a maximum 11 8 mg l in mid june fig s1 the increase in the doc concentration was mainly ascribed to the early leaching of the organic carbon pool in the shallow soil which was supplied by decaying wood litter that had accumulated in the dry season a lower average doc concentration was observed in the zhaoxingqiang well fig s2 and the lowest level was found in the zhangfei well fig s3 indicating the retention of doc by the soil during its downward transport 3 2 dynamics of colloids in shallow groundwater the daily colloid concentration of the fracture flow varied from 0 54 to 31 90 mg l with an average concentration of 1 64 mg l table 1 a high colloid concentration lasted approximately 1 week with an average concentration of 5 59 mg l observed after the commencement of the fracture flow on 1 may fig 2 this phenomenon was unique and specific to the very beginning of the rainy season following a long dry period during which the differential capillary stresses might lead to soil matrix and or soil pores weakening and further colloid generation michel et al 2010 the abundant mobilized colloids were continuously transported to the fracture flow due to the advancement of the wetting front of the newly infiltrated rainwater which was responsible for the clustering of high colloid concentration this finding is consistent with other findings from column studies majdalini et al 2008 mohanty et al 2015b afterwards the colloid concentration generally stayed at a lower base level 1 15 mg l during the non rainy days except for a few peaks that were several or even tens of times the base level in response to heavy storms the highest colloid concentration was 31 90 mg l and was observed during the storm on 19 september rainfall 92 2 mm fig 2 the second highest colloid concentration was 27 50 mg l and was observed during the storm on 22 july rainfall 120 1 mm fig 2 the durations of elevated colloid levels less than one day were shorter than those of elevated flow discharges several days which is consistent with the reported faster increases in colloid concentration compared to those of the subsurface flow discharge during rain events in a number of field studies el farhan et al 2000 mckay et al 2000 schiperski et al 2016 toran et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 in the three lowland wells the colloid mass concentration varied between 0 20 and 11 66 mg l and the corresponding number concentration varied between 1 62 107 and 1 07 109 colloids l table 2 the colloid populations observed in this study were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those in the granitic groundwater from the grimsel test site degueldre et al 1989 and in coastal groundwater rani and sasidhar 2011 colloid concentrations of the groundwater in the wells varied in a much smaller range and exhibited much lower peak concentrations and less temporal variations than those of the fracture flow from the sloping farmland in addition decreasing trend of the average colloid concentration from 2 72 mg l in the xinjing well to 1 42 mg l in the zhangfei well close to the catchment outlet was observed which could be attributed partially to the increased retention of subsurface colloid transported along the streamline a similar colloid concentration decline with distance in the down gradient wells was previously reported mckay et al 2000 however the temporal dynamics of the colloid concentration showed different patterns among the three wells in the xinjing well which was not subjected to human activity the colloid mass concentration increased gradually from less than 2 00 mg l at the end of the dry season to a peak of 7 62 mg l in mid june followed by a rapid decrease to below 2 00 mg l fig s1 this observation is similar to observations from the sloping farmland plot in which colloid concentration increased to a plateau in response to rain events at the early rainy season however this is not the case for the other two wells in the zhaoxingqiang well a distinct colloid concentration peak 11 66 mg l occurred on 2 july in response to the previous consecutive storms 30 june to 1 july cumulative rainfall of 203 2 mm fig s2 a much smaller response of the colloid concentration to these storms was observed in the zhangfei well fig s3 however a secondary colloid concentration peak in the zhaoxingqiang well and major peaks in the zhangfei well appeared during the dry season by the end of april when water levels were very low and continuously declined in both wells these peaks were mainly the result of perturbations related to water extraction the frequent bailing from the zhaoxingqiang well and pump withdrawal of water from the zhangfei well at low water levels facilitated the re suspension of previously deposited colloids at the well bottoms similarly rani and sasidhar 2011 reported that the physical perturbations of water extraction led to the artifact of increased colloid concentrations in the wells in addition sediment re suspension has been reported to contribute up to 55 of the natural colloids suspended in the water column in a lake xu et al 2018 the effects of the ultrasound treatment of the water bath on the colloid concentration of the groundwater samples are presented in figs s4 s5 the c us c ratios were all higher than 1 1 the dotted line regardless of the fracture flow samples or well water samples indicating that the colloids in the shallow groundwater existed as aggregates in the present study the high electrical conductivities and particularly high ca2 concentrations 57 04 107 03 mg l for the fracture flow and 77 00 207 03 mg l for the well water that far exceeded the critical coagulation concentration ccc of purple soil 24 mg l and mudrock 16 mg l particles zhang et al 2016 would have extensively neutralized the negative charges in the diffuse electric double layer edl of the colloids the resulting compression of the edl further promoted the colloid coagulation similar findings of divalent cation induced colloid coagulation were reported by other studies kuno et al 2002 shiyan et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the psd of fracture flow samples from the hillslope has been explored in our previous single event based studies zhang et al 2015 2016 suspended particles in the fracture flow ranging in size from submicron to more than 100 μm were observed while the colloid 2 μm presence was lower than 1 however the psd of the well water exhibited a different pattern from that of the fracture flow as shown in fig 3 a smaller size range from submicron up to 40 μm a slightly higher colloid percentage 2 4 7 0 and smaller median sizes 4 2 10 0 μm were observed table 3 low percentages of colloid in the fracture flow and lowland wells were ascribed to colloid diffusion into dead end voids such as the soil matrix or fracture apertures during the subsurface transport process this matched the observations from other studies e g alonso et al 2007 mondal and sleep 2012 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 the much smaller maximum size of suspended particles and the higher cumulative particle percentage from colloids to coarse particles 2 10 μm in the well water relative to the fracture flow implies a greater retardation of large particles 10 μm during their transport in the catchment gravity sedimentation acts as the main cause of immobilization of large particles especially in horizontal flow conduits and or when the flow rate decreases however the gravity effect of colloids exhibited an insignificant influence on colloid mobilization and transport in finely fractured aquifer in the present study considering the intense driving force of macropore flow and or fracture flow that enabled the transport and enrichment of coarse particles in the well water monhanty et al 2015a also reported the irrelevance of gravity sedimentation on colloid transport as the 1 8 μm colloids recovered to a greater extent than the 0 5 μm colloids during transport in a macroporous soil the environmental implications of the psd results for regions characterized by finely fractured aquifers are that particle investigation of the groundwater in these areas should include but not be limited to colloids coarse particles up to 10 μm should also be taken into account apparent shifts towards smaller groundwater psds following ultrasound treatment are also shown in fig 3 the colloid percentage increased by a factor of 3 0 2 5 and 13 8 in the xinjing well zhaoxingqiang well and zhangfei well respectively breakage of the coagulated colloids especially in the high salinity zhangfei well led to the increase in the colloid presence following the ultrasound treatment 3 3 physicochemical perturbations of colloid dynamics in the fracture flow and shallow groundwater due to the large temporal variation in the fracture flow discharge cv 1 87 table 1 it is reasonable to separate the flow discharge into high and low ranges according to the median flow discharge 1 3 l min for further detailed analyses via prda pearson correlation and multi linear regression analysis according to the prda a total of 67 84 and 84 28 of the variations in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow could be explained for the general cases and the high flow discharge cases respectively to which flow discharge contributed more than 45 fig 4 this finding indicates the dominance of flow discharge instead of flow chemistry on colloid mobilization and transport in the fracture flow from the hillslope sem was employed to explore the routes and extensions of the physicochemical factors on colloid dynamics in the fracture flow our model explained 60 of the variance in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow fig 5 flow discharge can impact colloid dynamics directly λ 0 70 p 0 001 and can also impose an indirect effect on colloid dynamics by affecting flow chemistry λ 0 25 p 0 01 in contrast flow chemistry showed a half less importance of direct impact λ 0 31 p 0 001 on colloid dynamics this is in accordance with prda in which flow discharge acted as the primary and positive factor influencing colloid dynamics in addition the colloid concentration was significantly positively correlated with the fracture flow discharge with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 756 which is much greater than that of the chemical parameters table 4 similarly flow discharge showed the largest influence 53 27 on colloid mobilization and transport dynamics among all the physicochemical parameters according to the multi linear regression analysis table 4 for the fracture flow samples taken at high discharges 1 3 l min an increased correlation 0 885 of colloid dynamics with flow discharge and a slightly larger effect 58 09 of flow discharge on colloid transport was observed this result agrees with the results of the prda and sem analyses the fracture flow derived shear force which corresponds to flow discharge and possibly coupled with the air water interface especially following the dry period is the main mechanism for colloid scoring mobilization and transport in the fracture flow hydraulic shearing has also been reported as the dominant force controlling colloid dynamics in fractured geologic media elsewhere in response to rainfall mohanty et al 2015a shevenell and mccarthy 2002 weisbrod et al 2002 in contrast for the low flow discharge cases only 20 73 of the variation in colloid dynamics in the fracture flow was explained and was due nearly exclusively to flow chemistry fig 4 the colloid concentration showed insignificant correlations with flow discharge in this situation table 4 the influence of the fracture flow discharge decreased by half more from 50 to 21 67 table 4 and became the secondary factor for colloid mobilization and transport unlike in the two aforementioned situations therefore the physical perturbation of hydraulic infiltration exhibits a primary effect on colloid mobilization and transport dynamics in the fracture flow from the hillslope in general in particular this effect retreats to secondary importance behind flow chemistry ph mg2 and doc when the fracture flow discharge is low 1 3 l min increased hydraulic retention of fracture flow occurs at low flow discharges facilitating the interactions of colloids with groundwater the ph 7 21 8 81 8 10 on average of fracture flow at low discharges was significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the general fracture flow 6 75 8 81 7 96 on average and flow at high discharges 6 75 8 74 7 82 on average according to the calculations from zhou et al 2011 the surface potential ζ potential of soil colloids increased from 49 mv to 68 mv more negative when the solution ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 therefore the significantly increased flow ph at low discharges leads to the increase in electrostatic repulsion between colloids and the solid surfaces and further favors colloid mobilization into fracture flow the depth variations in the well water which were directly affected by subsurface flow discharge offered almost no explanations for colloid dynamics in the lowland wells fig 4 water chemistry accounted for 21 73 70 11 of the explained variations 24 35 77 03 indicating the dominant role of water chemistry on colloid dynamics in the lowland wells with respect to water chemistry ec and mg2 in most cases as well as ca2 in certain cases tables 4 5 showed a significant negative effect on colloid dynamics in both the well water and fracture flow this phenomenon agrees with the dlvo theory with the remarkable decrease in ec or divalent cation concentrations in groundwater for example due to the incorporation of dilute rainwater irrigation and or recharge water an increased repulsive energy barrier could develop between the dispersed colloids and the solid surfaces soil matrix and or pore fracture surfaces and thus favor the dispersion and mobilization of colloids ryan and gschwend 1994 zhang et al 2012 many researchers have reported a negative correlation between the stability of colloids and solution ionic strength in column scale studies albarran et al 2014 masciopinto and visino 2017 morales et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 and in stream water in a small watershed mills et al 2017 in contrast the doc exhibits a general positive correlation with groundwater colloid concentration and a dominant effect on colloid dynamics in the xinjing well the sorption of doc molecules to natural colloids has been widely recognized leading to the modified surface negative charges of colloids in most cases xu et al 2018 this modification would promote the electric repulsions between colloids and solid surfaces and further increase the chances of colloid mobilization other researchers have reported the promotion of colloid stability by dissolved organic matter in natural groundwater as well as improved colloid transport in the presence of doc cheng and sailers 2015 morales et al 2011 shiyan et al 2014 moreover the adsorbed doc could also block the deposition sites especially at a high flow rate yang et al 2015 leading to the enhanced mobility of colloids in groundwater however no significant correlations between the colloid concentration and water chemistries were found for the zhangfei well instead there was a distinct negative correlation between the water temperature and the colloid concentration in this well table 5 a trend that was not observed in the fracture flow or the other two wells this observation implies that provided the highest ec and cation concentrations which are favorable for colloid coagulation in this well the small increases in water temperature 3 3 c from may to october could lead to the enhanced brownian motion of the coagulated colloids the improved collision of the inter coagulated colloids potentially promotes the formation of large particles that could easily settle to the well bottom due to gravity sedimentation resulting in fewer colloids present in the well water this hypothesis is in agreement with a laboratory study in which a decrease of the stability of the latex colloidal system with increasing of solution temperature was observed garcia garcia et al 2006 this relationship does not exist for the other two wells or the fracture flow attributable to the much lower salinities in these cases 3 4 groundwater colloid characteristics and source identification mineral composition and calcium carbonate organic matter oc and δ 13c abundance were used to characterize groundwater colloids and soil and rock samples from upper geological media for the identification of colloid sources a number of minerals quartz plagioclase feldspar calcite hematite montmorillonite illite chlorite etc were detected in all three categories of solids but in different proportions fig s6 quartz and illite were the two major minerals in the soil and underlying mudrock in the sloping farmland plot while quartz was the dominant mineral in both the soil and mudrock samples collected from the farmlands and forestlands near the wells at both the sloping farmland site and the well sites the lowest content of quartz and the highest content of illite were observed in the groundwater colloids and not the soil or mudrock samples this observation is consistent with the findings of lei et al 2004 who also found a higher proportion of illite in the mineral colloids than in the purple soil itself this is also the case for the colloids in the subsurface water from the adit of an abandoned mine filella et al 2009 in addition an increase in the percentage of illite in colloids in a river was ascribed to the high load of soil colloids in the watershed during the snow melting period chanudet and filella 2008 as presented in fig s7 groundwater colloids in both the fracture flow and well water had a significantly p 0 05 higher calcium carbonate content 25 than the soils or mudrocks of the nearby geological media the enriched carbonate content in the groundwater colloids could be explained by the precipitation of calcium carbonates facilitating the physical inter and intra cementing of colloids during the process of colloid dispersion and generation zhao et al 2012 in addition the hematite could also act as the cementing material as shown in the inset graphs in fig s6 groundwater colloids had the highest proportion of hematite whose presence can facilitate the chemical bonding of organic substances to mineral particles schulten and leinweber 2000 therefore groundwater colloid complexation by dissolved organic matter potentially increases the oc content of colloids in the sloping farmland plot the oc content of the colloids 0 91 0 06 in the fracture flow showed an insignificant difference p 0 05 to that of the soil 0 71 0 13 while both of them were significantly higher p 0 05 than that of the rock 0 2 0 02 fig s7 groundwater colloids from both the xinjing well and zhaoxingqiang well had significantly higher p 0 05 oc contents 1 02 0 11 and 0 96 0 08 respectively than the rocks 0 21 of the upper farmlands or forestlands fig s7 these findings might exclude the possibility that fractured rocks in the hillslope or the upper farmlands and forestlands of the lowland wells are the source of the groundwater colloids in addition the oc content of the groundwater colloids was slightly higher than that of the shallow soil of the upper farmlands considering the increased oc content of colloids due to the complexation of dissolved organic matter in the groundwater shallow soil from the upper farmland rather than the forest soil may act as the major source of groundwater colloids in the present study in addition to the above parameters δ 13c was also used to help identify the source of the groundwater colloids in the sloping farmland plot the δ 13c abundance of the colloids 15 13 0 24 in the fracture flow was not significantly different p 0 05 from that of the soil 14 45 0 46 but both of them were significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the underlying mudrock 9 24 0 27 fig 6 this result indicates that the colloids in the fracture flow originate from the shallow soil of the sloping farmland which agrees with the results of the source identification based on the mineral composition organic matter and calcium carbonate in the xinjing well the δ 13c abundance of colloids 14 61 0 18 was slightly lower p 0 05 than that of the shallow soil 14 34 0 33 from the upper farmland these results were markedly different from those of the other geological samples in the zhaoxingqiang well groundwater colloids showed a similar δ 13c abundance 14 61 0 18 as that of the shallow soil 15 27 0 07 and underlying mudrock 14 90 0 43 of the upper farmland while all of these samples had markedly lower p 0 05 δ 13c abundances than those of the deep farmland soil and forest soil and rocks this phenomenon implies little contributions from nearby forestlands to the groundwater colloids in the well as mudrock has been demonstrated to be an unlikely source of the groundwater colloids the δ 13c abundances also suggest that shallow farmland soil is the major source of colloids present in the lowland wells this is the first attempt to identify groundwater colloid origination by using δ 13c however the incorporation of δ 13c in colloid source tracing should be combined with other characteristic parameters e g mineral composition and calcium carbonate and organic matter content for better reliability 4 conclusion our study provides quantitative evidence indicating that different mechanisms dominate colloid dynamics in different groundwater patterns hydraulic perturbations of rainwater infiltration exhibit a large and direct effect on colloid mobilization and transport via the fracture flow from the upper hillslope subsequently the variations in physicochemical properties of flow water along subsurface transport pathways exert a major effect on colloid dynamics in the lowland wells these understandings of colloid mobilization and transport mechanisms are crucial to prioritizing the monitoring of flow water parameters which may govern colloid dynamics in shallow groundwater in addition to the high concentrations of colloids maximums of 31 90 mg l and 11 66 mg l in the facture flow and well water respectively which exist in coagulated forms a high percentage 47 7 92 0 of coarse particles 2 10 μm indicate the importance of including coarse particles in the monitoring scheme of shallow groundwater especially in finely fractured aquifers and or karst aquifers moreover the new approach proposed in this study for source identification of groundwater colloids by simultaneous analyses of δ 13c and mineral composition organic matter and carbonate content in groundwater colloids and the upper geological samples would be useful for colloid facilitated contaminant transport studies in large catchments with spatially varying geological media acknowledgements this study was

provide a sustainable and economic approach to treat high strength domestic and industrial wastewaters batstone et al 2015 these systems can 1 substantially reduce the organic load to be in accordance with the effluent discharge limits 2 produce biogas that can be converted to energy heat electricity to reduce the power demands within the treatment facility and 3 handle a high volumetric load with a small spatial footprint van lier 2015 nevertheless the effluent of uasb digesters may contain high quantities of nitrogen sulfide and methane chen et al 2016a b nitrogen plays an important role in the eutrophication of the urban catchment and can be toxic for aquatic life tchobanoglous et al 2003 sulfide causes pipe corrosion health hazards and odour nuisance zhang et al 2008 methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 34 times stronger than that of carbon dioxide over a 100 year horizon ipcc 2013 the transformation destruction capture of nitrogen sulfide and methane in different forms and qualities should be achieved by adding downstream processes when designing wastewater treatment systems wwts vela et al 2015 mathematical models are currently applied in normal water engineering practice to evaluate competing design treatment options flores alsina et al 2012 benedetti et al 2010 in addition models can also be used for benchmarking copp 2002 jeppsson et al 2007 diagnosing rodriguez roda et al 2002 and optimizing rivas et al 2008 feldman et al 2018 water systems as well as for teaching purposes hug et al 2009 since the publication of the international water association iwa activated sludge models asm1 2d 3 henze et al 2000 and the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 the field has been rapidly expanding special efforts have been devoted to plant wide modelling pwm in recent years the main idea in pwm is that the wwts should be considered as an integrated process where the different units comprising the flow diagram are linked together and need to be operated and controlled not as individual unit operations but taking into account all the interactions amongst the processes skogestad 2000 jeppsson et al 2013 one of the most difficult aspects in plant wide modelling is prediction and interaction of aquatic chemistry states which are not normally considered in an efficient way in biological models recent advances by the iwa task group on physico chemical modelling pcm batstone et al 2012 have boosted this field of research particularly because considering pcm in addition to biological process models allows predicting the close interactions between the phosphorus p sulphur s and iron fe cycles solon et al 2017 special aspects such as model interfacing have to be taken into account batstone et al 2015 unless integrated modelling methodologies are used barker and dold 1997 grau et al 2007 ekama 2009 barat et al 2013 fernández arévalo et al 2017 pwm requires elemental mass balance verification and continuity checking for all the components comprising the model volcke et al 2006a zaher et al 2007 nopens et al 2009 therefore cod c n p fe and s need to be balanced across the interface flores alsina et al 2016 the main advantage of using an interface based approach with respect to other integrated methodologies is that the original model structure can be used thus there is no need to consider all the state variables for each simulated unit process with a reduction of the required computational power and better overall model transparency grau et al 2009 in this paper we present a model based feasibility study of different anaerobic digestion post treatment options in a biotechnology company using a pwm the main motivation of the study is to analyse how the selected technologies may affect the fate of nitrogen methane and sulfide compounds leaving an industrial ad system special aspects such as energy expenditures and potential energy recovery through the entire flow diagram will be accounted for this will be done using a previously published multi scale mathematical model approach describing the competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens the addition of ethanol as a separate model component the effect of ionic strength activity corrections and the formation of multiple mineral precipitates feldman et al 2017 the above is linked to two different reactor designs activated sludge granular representing two post treatment options where a new model is developed this model describes nitrification denitrification autotrophic heterotrophic and the main bio chemical processes involving methane and sulphur transformations the entire system ad post treatment is simulated simultaneously the main novelties of this contribution can be summarized as follows 1 a plant wide model incorporating a uasb reactor two post treatment alternatives within an industrial context published studies considering plant wide aspects have focused on virtual case studies volcke et al 2006b flores alsina et al 2014 when full scale facilities were modelled the type of wastewater was urban kazadi mbama et al 2016 indeed industrial wastewater has some drivers and challenges including elevated sulfide high strength inputs and very different system configurations which make state of the art models for municipal wastewater systems less suitable and often additional extensions are needed feldman et al 2017 2 simultaneous simulation of two types of biofilm systems anaerobic aerobic previous investigations have often been focused on studying process units ad post treatment separately batstone et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b winkler et al 2014 castro barros et al 2018 but never combined 3 a biofilm model implementation allowing the consideration of control aspects this has been a particular drawback when analysing aerobic anaerobic granular systems in the past volcke et al 2010 2012 ni et al 2009 where the state of the art software used for these studies reichert 2001 did not allow for the inclusion of sophisticated process control elements rosen et al 2008 4 integration of physico chemical aspects within aerobic biofilms systems previous works have been focused on granular microbial composition pérez et al 2014 poot et al 2016 but there is no study where rigorous aqueous phase chemistry has been included when modelling aerobic biofilms vangsgaard et al 2013 5 a holistic evaluation approach using net energy balances uasb recovery post treatment energy demand that are applied under different operational conditions this is closely linked to the first point where there is a lack of full scale studies using integrated models and global criteria solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 the paper details the development of the new pwm developed for this study by presenting sequentially the elements of which it is comprised as well as highlighting the integration interfacing aspects the capabilities potentials of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of several simulated scenario analyses lastly opportunities and limitations that arise from utilization of the new models are discussed in detail 2 methods sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 describe the processes and state variables included in both the anaerobic digestion adm and the activated sludge asm models respectively additional aspects with special emphasis on linking the adm and asm with a physico chemical model pcm section 2 2 are described in section 2 3 model integration implementation details for different types of reactor designs uasb activated sludge and aerobic granular are detailed in sections 2 4 2 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 2 1 biological models 2 1 1 anaerobic digestion model adm the adm1 version implemented in the plant wide context provided by the benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 batstone et al 2002 rosen et al 2006 is extended with p s and fe interactions flores alsina et al 2016 it also includes ethanol s etoh degradation which is modelled assuming a specific group of microorganisms x etoh which ends up producing hydrogen s h 2 and acetate s ac batstone et al 2004 mass balances stoichiometry coefficients and continuity verification of the model can be found supplemental information section xls files 2 1 2 activated sludge model asm reaction rates describing organic carbon c and nitrogen n removal are described as in vangsgaard et al 2012 the model accounts for ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria x aob x nob anammox bacteria x anx and ordinary heterotrophic bacteria x oho the default implementation is upgraded to include methane s ch 4 and sulphur species s h x s x s 0 s so x conversion processes hence methane oxidation bacteria x mob denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea x damo 1 and bacteria x damo 2 are the main responsible organisms for biological s ch 4 removal winkler et al 2014 daelman et al 2014 biological conversion of s h x s x s 0 s so

can also be oxidized chemically using a two step reaction from s h x s to x s 0 and finally to s so x as described in gutierrez et al 2010 mass balances stoichiometry coefficients and continuity verification of this part of the model can also be found in the supplemental information section 2 2 physico chemical models pcm 2 2 1 aqueous phase chemistry precipitation model a common physico chemical framework is implemented to both adm and asm the model simulates the acid base system and is thereby able to predict ph solon et al 2015 it also corrects for ionic strength i via the davies approach to consider chemical activities instead of molar concentrations and hence perform all the calculations under non ideal conditions flores alsina et al 2015 multiple mineral precipitation potential is based on saturation index calculations si as described in kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b 2 2 2 gas liquid transfer mass transfer between the liquid and the gas phase is accounted for selected compounds i s o 2 s n 2 z co 2 z h 2 s z nh 3 s ch 4 and s h 2 the transport rates are formulated as a function of the difference between the saturation concentration and the actual concentration of the gas dissolved in the liquid batstone et al 2012 the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid is given by henry s law of dissolution which states that the saturation concentration is equal to the product of henry s constant kh multiplied by the partial pressure of the gas pi the latter will be different in closed uasb and open n dn and pn anx reactors rosen et al 2006 the mass transfer rate constant klai is calculated for each gaseous component as described in musvoto et al 2000 2 3 model interfacing 2 3 1 adm to asm interface in this study the continuous based interface methodology cbim is used to ensure continuity in the mass balances and avoid component leaks volcke et al 2006a nopens et al 2009 all the adm organic states such as carbohydrates proteins and lipids x pr x li x ch sugars amino acids and fatty acids s aa s fa s su and volatile fatty acids s ac s pro s bu s va are converted into asm general lumped biodegradable organic soluble s s and particulate x s materials in addition immediate decay of the ad biomass x bio to x s and organic inert compounds x i is assumed there is no variation of cations anions before and after the interface a comprehensive description with detailed explanation of the involved processes conversions and mass balance verification can be found in flores alsina et al 2016 2 3 2 asm adm to pcm interface the outputs of the asm adm interface at each integration step are used as inputs for the pcm module to estimate ph and ion speciation pairing pmc module works as a sub routine the precipitation stripping inhibition equations are embedded within the ad as ordinary differential equation ode model structure and are therefore included in the overall mass balance this is especially complicated in granular systems uasb pn anx option where this communication is established for each discretized layer within the biofilm see sections 2 4 2 and 2 4 4 for example the pcm predicts the quantity of free ammonia z nh 3 and free nitrous acid z hno 2 used by x aob and x nob as substrates for growth in the asm implementation in a similar way calculated hydrogen sulfide z h 2 s and ammonia z nh 3 concentrations are used for calculating both stripping rates and inhibition functions in both the adm and asm approaches according to batstone et al 2002 and kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1998 finally the calculation of the si is the driving force to trigger the precipitation reactions which in turn are based on activities kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b 2 4 additional elements 2 4 1 data measuring campaign and influent generation the influent flow rate mass loadings into the industrial ad are 144 m3 h 1 1600 kg cod h 1 80 kg n h 1 and 9 kg p h 1 the influent s cod ratio is 0 025 kg s kg cod 1 it is important to highlight that the influent to be treated is industrial wastewater not waste activated sludge samples were taken at the outlet of the pre acidification tank pread a unit that is located before the studied anaerobic granular bioreactor to promote the formation of vfa data on influent effluent cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions cl so4 2 concentrations are available analyses were done using standard methods apha 2012 using 1 day composite samples influent fractionation and generation of additional influent dynamics were carried out as stated in feldman et al 2017 interested readers are referred to the supplemental information section where specific information about the influent characteristics can be found 2 4 2 usab reactor model the plant under study is located in kalundborg in the north western part of zealand denmark and treats the wastewater not sludge from novo nordisk and novozymes two of the biggest biotechnology industries in denmark reactor design is based on the biopaq ic technology paques the netherlands an advanced high rate granular anaerobic digester the reactor is comprised of four parts 1 a mixing section m 2 an expanded sludge bed r1 3 a polishing section r2 and 4 a gas liquid separator g l see fig 1 for details the multi scale approach described in feldman et al 2017 is used to describe reactor hydrodynamics using multiple continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs a granule size distribution and biofilm growth more specifically the biofilm model is based on the one dimensional approach reported in wanner et al 2006 the model contains both soluble s and particulate x state variables the mass balance assumes that the transport of soluble compounds is governed solely by homogenous diffusion whereas movement of particulate compounds takes place by convection saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 biofilm thickness l is given as the radial distance z from the centre to the surface of the granule and varies due to two phenomena 1 the net growth of the particulate species and 2 detachment from the biofilm surface lackner et al 2008 the resulting system of partial differential equations pdes is solved using the method of lines press et al 2007 2 4 3 conventional n dn reactor model the first configuration a1 is based on a modified ludzack ettinger mle design the plant is described as 5 cstrs in series and one secondary sedimentation tank sec see fig 1 for details the behaviour of the sec is approximated by using the double exponential settling function proposed in takács et al 1991 tanks 1 and 2 are anoxic anox1 2 tanks 3 4 and 5 aer1 2 and 3 are aerobic all reactors are assumed to have the same volume aer3 and anox1 are linked by means of an internal recycle qintr literature values were used to determine the hydraulic retention time hrt and tssop tchobanoglous et al 2003 a pi controller regulating the airflow qair to maintain a constant dissolved oxygen do concentration set point 2 g cod m 3 is implemented in aer2 proportional controllers are used to determine qair in aer1 and aer3 see gernaey et al 2014 according to aer2 the do sensor response time 1 min sensor delay and white noise are included in the sensor actuator models in order to avoid creating a simulation of unrealistic ideal control applications finally the aeration system qair is defined with significant dynamics assuming a response time of 4 min for the blowers more info about sensor and actuator models can be found elsewhere rieger et al 2003 rosen et al 2008 2 4 4 aerobic granular sludge reactor model a similar approach as described in section 2 4 2 is used to describe the aerobic granular sludge reactor a2 for simplicity purposes the reac is modelled by assuming one single cstr and one single granule size zmax type additional information in vansgaard et al 2012 the exact same strategy as described above predicts competition for substrate space within the biofilm by the different microorganisms accounted for by the asm an ideal separator sep avoids that the granules leave reac an aerated tank pre and a splitting unit split are added before reac and act as a pre treatment using the asm as in the conventional n dn reactor jeppsson et al 2007 see fig 1 for details the objective of pre is to adjust cod n ratios ph as well get rid of potentially troublesome compounds h2s that can hinder anammox biomass activity literature values were used to determine the hydraulic retention time hrt and tssop lackner et al 2014 a default strategy based on a simple pi do loop with similar sensor actuator characteristics noise delay response time as described in section 2 4 3 is implemented set point 0 25 g cod m 3 note the difference between reac physical unit where pn anx takes place and a2 alternative comprising both pre reac 2 4 5 evaluation criteria to assess the performance of the different treatment options a set of evaluation criteria is necessary jeppsson et al 2013 different effluent quality criteria such as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total nitrogen tn are calculated from asm state variables henze et al 2000 to assess the pollution removal efficiency of the system energy recovery erecovery in the uasb is calculated by using the energy content of the methane gas 50 014 mj kg ch4 1 and assuming a 43 efficiency for electricity generation aeration energy eaeration is calculated imposing an energy expenditure equal to 1 8 kg cod kwh 1 pumping energy epumping is calculated as the weighted averaged sum of internal qintr and external recycle qr and waste flow qw epumping also quantifies the quantity of particulate material removed in pre for alternative a2 via underflow the heating energy eheating is calculated from the quantity of water entering into the uasb the net energy heating demand eheating net is met by the heat generated from the assumed gas used for electricity production from biogas 1 kg ch4 produces 7 kwh of heat the difference between erecovery eaeration epumping eheating net is the net energy generated enet further information can be found in gernaey et al 2014 2 5 simulation scenarios three different scenarios are considered in this work see table 1 the conditions for the first scenario sc1 are selected to study two potential options to treat the pollution loads from the uasb effluent the first technology a1 is a conventional activated sludge configuration where traditional nitrification n denitrification dn processes take place the alternative configuration a2 includes a granular aerobic reactor based on the partial nitritation pn anammox anx process in this particular scenario the compromise between energy recovery in the uasb and denitrification potential is also studied in both post treatment cases by conducting integrated simulations i e uasb model and post treatment configuration model are solved simultaneously the second scenario sc2 explores the effect of pre on a2 special emphasis is placed on evaluation of influent characteristics process performance biofilm microbial distribution and the risk of intra granule precipitation the third scenario sc3 explores variations on the overall process performance n removal eairation enet when selected operational design loading conditions for the uasb a2 treatment train pn anx pre treatment are modified do vssop erecovery all dynamic simulations start from steady state conditions 1000 days to eliminate bias due to the selection of initial conditions gernaey et al 2014 the sensor and actuator models are only used during dynamic simulations 3 results 3 1 post anaerobic digestion treated water options evaluation 3 1 1 default operational conditions table 2 shows steady state uasb influent data model predictions for the proposed post digestion treatment options a1 a2 the multi scale approach parameter values and full scale data reported in feldman et al 2017 are used to obtain the anaerobic digester results represented in columns i and ii see sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 model interfaces and the asm implementation in the aerobic granular reactor yield columns iii and iv see sections 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 more information about model interfaces and how cod c n and p are maintained when leaving the uasb reactor and entering the subsequent post treatment options for subsequent post treatment evaluation are provided in the supplemental information section simulation results displayed in table 2 indicate substantial differences regarding n removal efficiencies between a1 and a2 74 and 90 respectively while cod ch4 and s removal are almost the same these differences are attributed to the fact that scenario a1 fails to complete s no 3 s no 2 denitrification due to insufficient carbon source s s option a2 can reduce s no 2 to s n 2 since this process is done autotrophically by x anx and s alk is not a limiting factor the surplus heat that may be produced during electricity generation is for heating the anaerobic digester therefore eheating net is zero regarding erecovery table 2 shows that at default operational conditions of the uasb reactor it is possible to recover 149 2 mwh d 1 this corresponds to 10 800 m3d 1 of ch4 78 of the total produced biogas when it comes to eaeration a1 would require 5652 kwh d 1 or 3 95 kwh kg nremoved these estimations are close to the values reported in lackner et al 2014 additionally around 102 kwh d 1 is necessary to reach the required pumping rates of typical mle configurations qintr qr and qw this leads to an enet of 143 5 mwh d 1 on the other hand in a2 partial nitrification occurs and the required airflow is much lower 2700 kwh d 1 or 1 75 kwh kg nremoved compared to a1 even though a2 includes ae in both pre and reac these values correspond again to literature references where reported aeration energy values for pn anx range from 1 05 to 4 7 kwh kg nremoved lackner et al 2014 this makes the operation of a1 significantly more expensive compared to a2 enet is up to 146 5 mwh d 1 dynamic simulations show again the differences in n removal performance and how option a1 is not capable to remove s no 3 s no 2 due to insufficient available carbon source see fig 2 row ii there are substantial differences in s o 2 levels for both options in option a1 all s nh x has to be transformed to s no 3 therefore the s o 2 demand is very high in option a2 only a part of the incoming s nh x is oxidized to s no 2 thereby reducing the aeration requirements substantially see eaeration in table 2 it is important to notice the effect of the defined noise delay level in the sensor and actuator model these model additions e g the sensor models provide a more realistic pi response and hence contribute to avoiding having unrealistic ideal control actions in the simulation see fig 2 row i both a1 and a2 options achieve almost complete removal of s ch 4 and s h x s at the end of the treatment 99 removal see rows 4 and 5 stripping is the main mechanism for s ch 4 removal in the two evaluated options stripping in a1 takes place in the aer section while in a2 it is in the pre section the predicted activity of x mob is zero for a1 and a2 nevertheless there is a minor contribution of x damo 1 x damo 2 in s ch 4 conversion for a2 similar results were reported in daelman et al 2014 and winkler et al 2014 regarding s h x s this compound is bio chemically re oxidated to x s 0 s so x see row 6 in both a1 and a2 the relatively high operational ph see table 1 ensures a relatively low z h 2 s stripping i e the equilibrium is moved towards z hs stumm and morgan 1996 3 1 2 modification of the uasb reactor conversion efficiency in this section the balance between organics conversion within the uasb reactor versus energy consumption and n removal in both aerobic reactors a1 a2 is studied in more detail in order to do this an increase decrease of conversion efficiency is imposed by changing the uasb reactor volume a ph control ensured the same acid base conditions this modified conversion efficiency combined with alternatives a1 and a2 respectively is simulated using the pwm presented in this paper see table 1 fig 3 a and b shows the changes in the quantity of s s leaving the reactor from 240 to 100 kg h 1 and the quantity of methane produced from 9500 to 11 400 m3 d 1 the latter is used to calculate the potential erecovery see section 2 4 5 fig 3c and d shows the nitrogen removal efficiency for the two evaluated options considering the different uasb reactor capacities it is important to highlight that in all cases the total quantity of nitrogen to treat is the same 80 kg n h 1 when the uasb reactor volume is lowered higher n removal rates were achieved in the option a1 up to 67 of the total incoming n this is attributed to the higher quantity of organics arriving from the ad to the mle plant and therefore more carbon source is available for the traditional denitrification process as a direct result there is a decrease of 11 in the erecovery when the uasb reactor conversion is higher up to 5 in erecovery by increasing its volume it has negative effects not sufficient electron donor on nitrogen removal due to denitrification failure down to 34 n removal using the numbers generated in this case study we can conclude that each additional kg of nitrogen removed in the post treatment will require a decrease in the digester performance equivalent to 95 kwh kg n 1 more details are provided in fig 3c regarding option a2 simulation results show that a higher destruction of organics in the uasb reactor brings many benefits to the overall plant performance firstly the quantity of energy recovery is higher up to 5 in erecovery secondly eaeration in reac is slightly lower due to a minor decrease of the oxygen demand required to remove the arriving cod eaeration changes from 1200 to 1100 kwh d 1 cao et al 2017 as a result enet is more favourable from 146 5 to 153 9 mwh d 1 thirdly the quantity of nitrogen removed is slightly increased from 80 to 84 due to a lower competition with x oho giving advantage to x anx ni et al 2009 more details are provided in fig 3d 3 2 effect of pre treatment on pn anx performance 3 2 1 pn anx influent characteristics this section describes the effect on the overall process performance when the aerated pre treatment pre unit is utilised or not before the pn anx reactor options a2 1 and a2 2 see section 2 4 the pre consists of a cstr with a residence time of 8 h which is aerated see table 1 fig 4 shows the uasb influent see section 2 4 1 the effluent see section 2 4 2 and the pre see section 2 2 4 model predictions as well as the measured data when these were available computer simulations show that adding the pre promoted a cod decrease organic matter and h2s oxidation in the uasb effluent ch4 co2 stripping and a ph increase up to ph 8 5 high ph also promotes the formation of inorganic precipitates x caco 3 and x ca 3 po 4 2 which decreases the quantity of soluble ca and p in the effluent since compounds containing mg are present in under saturated conditions no precipitates of mg compounds are formed reflected as struvite in fig 4 3 2 2 p anx effluent characteristics and granule structure properties fig 5 reveals that the most immediate effect of pre is a substantial reduction of the h2s inhibition and consequently s nh x conversion both a2 1 and a2 2 show that the centre of the granule is inactive due to the high concentration of inert material x i resulting from biomass death the biomass x bio and organics x org concentrations increase for an increasing radial distance z i e the closer to the surface the higher the biomass concentration more specifically a high portion of x anx is placed in the inner zone and this fraction decreases as the radius of the granule increases the presence of x aob and x oho is comparatively higher in the outer layers of the biofilm this distribution corresponds to the degree of s o 2 penetration within the biofilm the main differences between a2 1 and a2 2 rely on the relative presence of x oho x damo and x sob this is attributed to the fact that part of the cod h2s and ch4 is removed in the pre finally pre has an effect on the weak acid base chemistry of both the bulk and the granule as a consequence of including the pre the risk of having intra granular precipitation for calcite sicalc and calcium phosphate sicap is reduced in both cases the system is under saturated for struvite surprisingly no ph gradient between the biofilm and the bulk phase is predicted while some authors observed otherwise lemaire et al 2009 other simulation studies have shown that ph gradients are increased as function of the granule size feldman et al 2017 in this particular case the flat ph profiles can be justified due to the relatively low s no 2 concentrations and the high buffer capacity of the system 3 3 variation in loading operational conditions 3 3 1 do set point tssop and erecovery response surfaces depicted in fig 6 show the effect of changing the operational conditions on 1 n removal effluent s nh x n denitrified 2 aeration energy eaeration and 3 net energy balance enet when both uasb reactor a2 pn anx pre treatment are simulated simultaneously computer results show that optimal do levels for n removal ranges from 0 25 do 0 5 g m 3 at lower values do 0 25 g m 3 there is a failure in nitritation efficiency and there is no conversion of s nh x to s no 2 fig 6b and f at higher do values x nob have a competitive advantage compared to x anx as a result there is a decrease in the overall n removal efficiency due to the substantial amount of s no 3 that is formed in the aqueous phase this can be compensated by increasing the tssop and thereby the ratio of vbiofilm to vreactor or increasing the quantity of organics coming from the digester nevertheless this practice has a negative effect on the entire energy balance in the plant eaeration erecovery and enet 3 3 2 importance of plant wide approaches to avoid suboptimal outcomes the potential n removal and enet maximization in reac by modifying tssop and do setpoint is a clear example of sub optimization for example it was possible to get better enet values when the uasb and reac where modified together see fig 6 second row instead of making local changes in reac up to 155 mwh d 1 compared to 148 mwh d 1 while n removal efficiency is maintained the mass and energy balances provided by the pwm can be very useful to suggest ways of better managing the different industrial streams within the factory and achieving better operational process solutions in addition the optimization examples depicted in fig 6 could be combined with other approaches such as ph and sulfide production control in the ad in this regard previous studies feldman et al 2018 have demonstrated that a good ph control could reduce the operational cost of the digester by up to 45 without risking the overall process performance another interesting example is reported in irizar et al 2018 where advanced software sensors are applied to a similar type of uasb reactor to ensure stable operating conditions 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of realistic control strategies in biofilm systems the pn anx model developed during this study will allow multiple possibilities thus opening a new field of research as mentioned in the introduction previous studies including biofilm reactors did not include sophisticated control elements mainly due to software limitations of the platform on which these simulations were executed reichert 2001 the biofilm model presented here while carrying a high development overhead offers a number of advantages over classic lumped parameter implementations which normally rely on increased solids retention time batstone et al 2002 this includes inherent incorporation of diffusional limitations consideration of how specific gaps will be selectively retained and in biofilm interactions many of these factors are quite important to short term dynamics which in turn impact control strategies the implementation presented in this paper has shown that the computational demand is manageable this implementation which will be freely distributed will allow users to develop simulate control strategies using the most common on line sensors such as ph do nh4 no3 no2 and conductivity lackner et al 2014 implementation of ph has been especially challenging due to the numerical problems that this variable causes batstone et al 2012 some of these implemented sensors might have considerable noise response time and delay rieger et al 2003 the same applies for actuators therefore such elements should be included in order to evaluate controllers realistically rosen et al 2008 the special numerical routines implemented in these models allowed simulating these elements without problems flores alsina et al 2015 feldman et al 2017 4 2 generation of alternatives the options evaluated in this case study have been systematically generated but they are based on general process knowledge the combination of plant wide models ekama 2009 barat et al 2013 solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 with environmental decision support systems edss for suggesting process flow sheets poch et al 2004 garrido baserba et al 2012 castillo et al 2016 is a promising line of research indeed the combination of process heuristics with mixed integer non linear programming could yield a good set of technologies to be further evaluated using dynamic process models there is a bright future if both tools go hand in hand when retrofitting an existing plant during the transition from wwtps to water resource recovery facilities daigger 2011 4 3 outlook limitations and future research directions it is important to highlight that only the adm section of the integrated approach presented in this study has been validated experimentally with full scale data process equations and kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the asm part have been extracted from literature based on validated case studies the n removal part using a granular system has been tested in vangsgaard et al 2013 methane and sulfide process equations were taken from previous studies dealing with a similar type of wastewater winkler et al 2014 chen et al 2016a b ph predictions and precipitation equations are validated in kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b therefore the results from the simulation study seem to be correct and reliable within the normal uncertainty range of simulation studies of wastewater treatment systems it is interesting to note that as a result of this study the company involved will implement alternative pre pn anx at full scale as a post digestion treatment technology the potential better results in enet were the key issue to tip the scale towards selection of this option last but not least the reader should be aware that the pwm presented in this case study shows a good compromise between model complexity and prediction capabilities nevertheless the list of relevant processes is far from being complete pn processes or systems in general where there is no2 accumulation are well known for producing relatively high quantities of n2o emissions n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas that is 300 times stronger than co2 ipcc 2013 ch4 stripping is an important contribution to greenhouse gas formation as well as a consequence a more integrated assessment should include a compromise between effluent quality operational cost and greenhouse gas emissions flores alsina et al 2014 ni and yuan 2015 other important factors not included in this study when evaluating pn anx systems is the variation of the size of the granular sludge volcke et al 2010 2012 and the effects of intra granular precipitation johansson et al 2017 feldman et al 2018 sulfide inhibition should also be better represented in the model in this study an arbitrarily high value was defined to account for the s effect on biomass growth nevertheless there are numerous studies that report quite complex interactions between x anx and x srb jin et al 2012 2013 the present study could be complemented with more thorough energy balances fernández arévalo et al 2017 longo et al 2018 or life cycle assessment corominas et al 2013 uncertainty risk analysis a central concept for model based evaluation of alternatives belia et al 2009 is an important issue that should be considered as well the consideration of uncertainty risk factors within the evaluation procedure can substantially change the evaluation results and preliminary selected technologies might come up as less desirable while other options retain a higher chance of success under uncertainty 5 conclusions the main findings of this study can be summarized in the following points a plant wide model pwm was presented consisting of a uasb reactor based on an adm type model two post treatment options based on an asm type model special features to interface both models had to be developed the asm approach was implemented in two reactor designs activated sludge aerobic granular sludge sensor and actuator models were included to avoid unrealistic control actions and allow future control possibilities the pwm was simulated and the performance of the different flow diagrams evaluated in terms of pollution removal nitrogen ch4 h2s energy production erecovery energy consumption eaeration epumping and net energy balance enet model based evaluation revealed that pn anx option a2 demanded lower aeration rates eaeration 1 75 kwh kg nremoved and potentially allowed more energy recovery in the uasb reactor erecovery up to 156 7 mwh d 1 since the anammox bacteria in charge of denitrification did not need organics as electron donor as a result the enet 153 9 mwh d 1 was potentially higher conventional n dn option a1 as post treatment of uasb effluent required higher aeration rates eaeration epumping 3 95 kwh kg nremoved to convert the nh4 all the way to no3 and lower conversion in the ad erecovery is down to 132 8 mwh d 1 to allow denitrification i e resulting in a considerably lower net energy production enet 127 1 mwh d 1 calculations show that 95 kwh d 1 is lost in terms of energy production per extra kg n d 1 removed these results are in agreement with the well known advantages of pn anx process over the conventional nitrification denitrification process the addition of an aeration pre treatment tank pre before the pn anx reactor increases cod h2s oxidation ch4 co2 stripping ca precipitation and increases ph these processes change the wastewater influent composition and due to the presence of x damo and x srb this ends up changing the granule microbial distribution ph variation and risk of precipitation are also predicted by the model the modification of the uasb conversion efficiency do set point in the pn anx reactor rendered better results enet than the local tssop do set point optimization of the pn anx operational settings in this way it was possible to take full advantage of the interactions amongst the different units and hence avoid sub optimal outcomes the study has shown the potential of using simulations for virtually evaluating competing options before full scale implementation relevant information about the general mass and energy balances will yield additional information that will help the process engineer to take the right decision in terms of treatment option to be selected 6 software availability the matlab simulink

18906,the objective of this paper is to present the main results of an engineering research project dealing with model based evaluation of waste streams treatment from a biotech company this has been extensively done in domestic treatment systems but is equally important and with different challenges in industrial wastewater treatment a new set of biological activated sludge anaerobic digestion physicochemical aqueous phase precipitation mass transfer process models and model interfaces are required to describe removal of organics in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor plus either traditional nitrification denitrification a1 or partial nitritation pn anammox anx a2 processes model based analysis shows that option a1 requires a decrease in digestion energy recovery erecovery in order to have enough organic substrate for subsequent post no3 reduction treatment 95 kwh kg n 1 in contrast a2 in an aerobic granular sludge reactor allows for higher uasb conversion since n removal is carried out autotrophically the study also reveals that the addition of an aerated pre treatment unit prior to the pn anx a2 reactor promotes cod and h2s oxidation co2 and ch4 stripping a ph increase up to 8 5 and a reduction of the risk of intra granular precipitation as well as sulfide inhibition simulations indicate clear differences regarding the microbial distribution abundance within the biofilm in a2 when comparing the two operational modes final results show the effects of different loading and operational conditions dissolved oxygen do total suspended solids tssop energy recovery erecovery on the overall process performance n removal aeration energy eaeration net energy production erecovery using response surfaces highlighting the need of integrated

provide a sustainable and economic approach to treat high strength domestic and industrial wastewaters batstone et al 2015 these systems can 1 substantially reduce the organic load to be in accordance with the effluent discharge limits 2 produce biogas that can be converted to energy heat electricity to reduce the power demands within the treatment facility and 3 handle a high volumetric load with a small spatial footprint van lier 2015 nevertheless the effluent of uasb digesters may contain high quantities of nitrogen sulfide and methane chen et al 2016a b nitrogen plays an important role in the eutrophication of the urban catchment and can be toxic for aquatic life tchobanoglous et al 2003 sulfide causes pipe corrosion health hazards and odour nuisance zhang et al 2008 methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 34 times stronger than that of carbon dioxide over a 100 year horizon ipcc 2013 the transformation destruction capture of nitrogen sulfide and methane in different forms and qualities should be achieved by adding downstream processes when designing wastewater treatment systems wwts vela et al 2015 mathematical models are currently applied in normal water engineering practice to evaluate competing design treatment options flores alsina et al 2012 benedetti et al 2010 in addition models can also be used for benchmarking copp 2002 jeppsson et al 2007 diagnosing rodriguez roda et al 2002 and optimizing rivas et al 2008 feldman et al 2018 water systems as well as for teaching purposes hug et al 2009 since the publication of the international water association iwa activated sludge models asm1 2d 3 henze et al 2000 and the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 the field has been rapidly expanding special efforts have been devoted to plant wide modelling pwm in recent years the main idea in pwm is that the wwts should be considered as an integrated process where the different units comprising the flow diagram are linked together and need to be operated and controlled not as individual unit operations but taking into account all the interactions amongst the processes skogestad 2000 jeppsson et al 2013 one of the most difficult aspects in plant wide modelling is prediction and interaction of aquatic chemistry states which are not normally considered in an efficient way in biological models recent advances by the iwa task group on physico chemical modelling pcm batstone et al 2012 have boosted this field of research particularly because considering pcm in addition to biological process models allows predicting the close interactions between the phosphorus p sulphur s and iron fe cycles solon et al 2017 special aspects such as model interfacing have to be taken into account batstone et al 2015 unless integrated modelling methodologies are used barker and dold 1997 grau et al 2007 ekama 2009 barat et al 2013 fernández arévalo et al 2017 pwm requires elemental mass balance verification and continuity checking for all the components comprising the model volcke et al 2006a zaher et al 2007 nopens et al 2009 therefore cod c n p fe and s need to be balanced across the interface flores alsina et al 2016 the main advantage of using an interface based approach with respect to other integrated methodologies is that the original model structure can be used thus there is no need to consider all the state variables for each simulated unit process with a reduction of the required computational power and better overall model transparency grau et al 2009 in this paper we present a model based feasibility study of different anaerobic digestion post treatment options in a biotechnology company using a pwm the main motivation of the study is to analyse how the selected technologies may affect the fate of nitrogen methane and sulfide compounds leaving an industrial ad system special aspects such as energy expenditures and potential energy recovery through the entire flow diagram will be accounted for this will be done using a previously published multi scale mathematical model approach describing the competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens the addition of ethanol as a separate model component the effect of ionic strength activity corrections and the formation of multiple mineral precipitates feldman et al 2017 the above is linked to two different reactor designs activated sludge granular representing two post treatment options where a new model is developed this model describes nitrification denitrification autotrophic heterotrophic and the main bio chemical processes involving methane and sulphur transformations the entire system ad post treatment is simulated simultaneously the main novelties of this contribution can be summarized as follows 1 a plant wide model incorporating a uasb reactor two post treatment alternatives within an industrial context published studies considering plant wide aspects have focused on virtual case studies volcke et al 2006b flores alsina et al 2014 when full scale facilities were modelled the type of wastewater was urban kazadi mbama et al 2016 indeed industrial wastewater has some drivers and challenges including elevated sulfide high strength inputs and very different system configurations which make state of the art models for municipal wastewater systems less suitable and often additional extensions are needed feldman et al 2017 2 simultaneous simulation of two types of biofilm systems anaerobic aerobic previous investigations have often been focused on studying process units ad post treatment separately batstone et al 2015 chen et al 2016a b winkler et al 2014 castro barros et al 2018 but never combined 3 a biofilm model implementation allowing the consideration of control aspects this has been a particular drawback when analysing aerobic anaerobic granular systems in the past volcke et al 2010 2012 ni et al 2009 where the state of the art software used for these studies reichert 2001 did not allow for the inclusion of sophisticated process control elements rosen et al 2008 4 integration of physico chemical aspects within aerobic biofilms systems previous works have been focused on granular microbial composition pérez et al 2014 poot et al 2016 but there is no study where rigorous aqueous phase chemistry has been included when modelling aerobic biofilms vangsgaard et al 2013 5 a holistic evaluation approach using net energy balances uasb recovery post treatment energy demand that are applied under different operational conditions this is closely linked to the first point where there is a lack of full scale studies using integrated models and global criteria solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 the paper details the development of the new pwm developed for this study by presenting sequentially the elements of which it is comprised as well as highlighting the integration interfacing aspects the capabilities potentials of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of several simulated scenario analyses lastly opportunities and limitations that arise from utilization of the new models are discussed in detail 2 methods sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 describe the processes and state variables included in both the anaerobic digestion adm and the activated sludge asm models respectively additional aspects with special emphasis on linking the adm and asm with a physico chemical model pcm section 2 2 are described in section 2 3 model integration implementation details for different types of reactor designs uasb activated sludge and aerobic granular are detailed in sections 2 4 2 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 2 1 biological models 2 1 1 anaerobic digestion model adm the adm1 version implemented in the plant wide context provided by the benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 batstone et al 2002 rosen et al 2006 is extended with p s and fe interactions flores alsina et al 2016 it also includes ethanol s etoh degradation which is modelled assuming a specific group of microorganisms x etoh which ends up producing hydrogen s h 2 and acetate s ac batstone et al 2004 mass balances stoichiometry coefficients and continuity verification of the model can be found supplemental information section xls files 2 1 2 activated sludge model asm reaction rates describing organic carbon c and nitrogen n removal are described as in vangsgaard et al 2012 the model accounts for ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria x aob x nob anammox bacteria x anx and ordinary heterotrophic bacteria x oho the default implementation is upgraded to include methane s ch 4 and sulphur species s h x s x s 0 s so x conversion processes hence methane oxidation bacteria x mob denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea x damo 1 and bacteria x damo 2 are the main responsible organisms for biological s ch 4 removal winkler et al 2014 daelman et al 2014 biological conversion of s h x s x s 0 s so x is carried out by sulphur oxidation bacteria x sob involving different electron acceptors s o 2 s no 3 s no 2 further information can be found in chen et al 2016a b the compounds s h x s and x s 0 can also be oxidized chemically using a two step reaction from s h x s to x s 0 and finally to s so x as described in gutierrez et al 2010 mass balances stoichiometry coefficients and continuity verification of this part of the model can also be found in the supplemental information section 2 2 physico chemical models pcm 2 2 1 aqueous phase chemistry precipitation model a common physico chemical framework is implemented to both adm and asm the model simulates the acid base system and is thereby able to predict ph solon et al 2015 it also corrects for ionic strength i via the davies approach to consider chemical activities instead of molar concentrations and hence perform all the calculations under non ideal conditions flores alsina et al 2015 multiple mineral precipitation potential is based on saturation index calculations si as described in kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b 2 2 2 gas liquid transfer mass transfer between the liquid and the gas phase is accounted for selected compounds i s o 2 s n 2 z co 2 z h 2 s z nh 3 s ch 4 and s h 2 the transport rates are formulated as a function of the difference between the saturation concentration and the actual concentration of the gas dissolved in the liquid batstone et al 2012 the saturation concentration of the gas in the liquid is given by henry s law of dissolution which states that the saturation concentration is equal to the product of henry s constant kh multiplied by the partial pressure of the gas pi the latter will be different in closed uasb and open n dn and pn anx reactors rosen et al 2006 the mass transfer rate constant klai is calculated for each gaseous component as described in musvoto et al 2000 2 3 model interfacing 2 3 1 adm to asm interface in this study the continuous based interface methodology cbim is used to ensure continuity in the mass balances and avoid component leaks volcke et al 2006a nopens et al 2009 all the adm organic states such as carbohydrates proteins and lipids x pr x li x ch sugars amino acids and fatty acids s aa s fa s su and volatile fatty acids s ac s pro s bu s va are converted into asm general lumped biodegradable organic soluble s s and particulate x s materials in addition immediate decay of the ad biomass x bio to x s and organic inert compounds x i is assumed there is no variation of cations anions before and after the interface a comprehensive description with detailed explanation of the involved processes conversions and mass balance verification can be found in flores alsina et al 2016 2 3 2 asm adm to pcm interface the outputs of the asm adm interface at each integration step are used as inputs for the pcm module to estimate ph and ion speciation pairing pmc module works as a sub routine the precipitation stripping inhibition equations are embedded within the ad as ordinary differential equation ode model structure and are therefore included in the overall mass balance this is especially complicated in granular systems uasb pn anx option where this communication is established for each discretized layer within the biofilm see sections 2 4 2 and 2 4 4 for example the pcm predicts the quantity of free ammonia z nh 3 and free nitrous acid z hno 2 used by x aob and x nob as substrates for growth in the asm implementation in a similar way calculated hydrogen sulfide z h 2 s and ammonia z nh 3 concentrations are used for calculating both stripping rates and inhibition functions in both the adm and asm approaches according to batstone et al 2002 and kalyuzhnyi and fedorovich 1998 finally the calculation of the si is the driving force to trigger the precipitation reactions which in turn are based on activities kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b 2 4 additional elements 2 4 1 data measuring campaign and influent generation the influent flow rate mass loadings into the industrial ad are 144 m3 h 1 1600 kg cod h 1 80 kg n h 1 and 9 kg p h 1 the influent s cod ratio is 0 025 kg s kg cod 1 it is important to highlight that the influent to be treated is industrial wastewater not waste activated sludge samples were taken at the outlet of the pre acidification tank pread a unit that is located before the studied anaerobic granular bioreactor to promote the formation of vfa data on influent effluent cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions cl so4 2 concentrations are available analyses were done using standard methods apha 2012 using 1 day composite samples influent fractionation and generation of additional influent dynamics were carried out as stated in feldman et al 2017 interested readers are referred to the supplemental information section where specific information about the influent characteristics can be found 2 4 2 usab reactor model the plant under study is located in kalundborg in the north western part of zealand denmark and treats the wastewater not sludge from novo nordisk and novozymes two of the biggest biotechnology industries in denmark reactor design is based on the biopaq ic technology paques the netherlands an advanced high rate granular anaerobic digester the reactor is comprised of four parts 1 a mixing section m 2 an expanded sludge bed r1 3 a polishing section r2 and 4 a gas liquid separator g l see fig 1 for details the multi scale approach described in feldman et al 2017 is used to describe reactor hydrodynamics using multiple continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs a granule size distribution and biofilm growth more specifically the biofilm model is based on the one dimensional approach reported in wanner et al 2006 the model contains both soluble s and particulate x state variables the mass balance assumes that the transport of soluble compounds is governed solely by homogenous diffusion whereas movement of particulate compounds takes place by convection saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 biofilm thickness l is given as the radial distance z from the centre to the surface of the granule and varies due to two phenomena 1 the net growth of the particulate species and 2 detachment from the biofilm surface lackner et al 2008 the resulting system of partial differential equations pdes is solved using the method of lines press et al 2007 2 4 3 conventional n dn reactor model the first configuration a1 is based on a modified ludzack ettinger mle design the plant is described as 5 cstrs in series and one secondary sedimentation tank sec see fig 1 for details the behaviour of the sec is approximated by using the double exponential settling function proposed in takács et al 1991 tanks 1 and 2 are anoxic anox1 2 tanks 3 4 and 5 aer1 2 and 3 are aerobic all reactors are assumed to have the same volume aer3 and anox1 are linked by means of an internal recycle qintr literature values were used to determine the hydraulic retention time hrt and tssop tchobanoglous et al 2003 a pi controller regulating the airflow qair to maintain a constant dissolved oxygen do concentration set point 2 g cod m 3 is implemented in aer2 proportional controllers are used to determine qair in aer1 and aer3 see gernaey et al 2014 according to aer2 the do sensor response time 1 min sensor delay and white noise are included in the sensor actuator models in order to avoid creating a simulation of unrealistic ideal control applications finally the aeration system qair is defined with significant dynamics assuming a response time of 4 min for the blowers more info about sensor and actuator models can be found elsewhere rieger et al 2003 rosen et al 2008 2 4 4 aerobic granular sludge reactor model a similar approach as described in section 2 4 2 is used to describe the aerobic granular sludge reactor a2 for simplicity purposes the reac is modelled by assuming one single cstr and one single granule size zmax type additional information in vansgaard et al 2012 the exact same strategy as described above predicts competition for substrate space within the biofilm by the different microorganisms accounted for by the asm an ideal separator sep avoids that the granules leave reac an aerated tank pre and a splitting unit split are added before reac and act as a pre treatment using the asm as in the conventional n dn reactor jeppsson et al 2007 see fig 1 for details the objective of pre is to adjust cod n ratios ph as well get rid of potentially troublesome compounds h2s that can hinder anammox biomass activity literature values were used to determine the hydraulic retention time hrt and tssop lackner et al 2014 a default strategy based on a simple pi do loop with similar sensor actuator characteristics noise delay response time as described in section 2 4 3 is implemented set point 0 25 g cod m 3 note the difference between reac physical unit where pn anx takes place and a2 alternative comprising both pre reac 2 4 5 evaluation criteria to assess the performance of the different treatment options a set of evaluation criteria is necessary jeppsson et al 2013 different effluent quality criteria such as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total nitrogen tn are calculated from asm state variables henze et al 2000 to assess the pollution removal efficiency of the system energy recovery erecovery in the uasb is calculated by using the energy content of the methane gas 50 014 mj kg ch4 1 and assuming a 43 efficiency for electricity generation aeration energy eaeration is calculated imposing an energy expenditure equal to 1 8 kg cod kwh 1 pumping energy epumping is calculated as the weighted averaged sum of internal qintr and external recycle qr and waste flow qw epumping also quantifies the quantity of particulate material removed in pre for alternative a2 via underflow the heating energy eheating is calculated from the quantity of water entering into the uasb the net energy heating demand eheating net is met by the heat generated from the assumed gas used for electricity production from biogas 1 kg ch4 produces 7 kwh of heat the difference between erecovery eaeration epumping eheating net is the net energy generated enet further information can be found in gernaey et al 2014 2 5 simulation scenarios three different scenarios are considered in this work see table 1 the conditions for the first scenario sc1 are selected to study two potential options to treat the pollution loads from the uasb effluent the first technology a1 is a conventional activated sludge configuration where traditional nitrification n denitrification dn processes take place the alternative configuration a2 includes a granular aerobic reactor based on the partial nitritation pn anammox anx process in this particular scenario the compromise between energy recovery in the uasb and denitrification potential is also studied in both post treatment cases by conducting integrated simulations i e uasb model and post treatment configuration model are solved simultaneously the second scenario sc2 explores the effect of pre on a2 special emphasis is placed on evaluation of influent characteristics process performance biofilm microbial distribution and the risk of intra granule precipitation the third scenario sc3 explores variations on the overall process performance n removal eairation enet when selected operational design loading conditions for the uasb a2 treatment train pn anx pre treatment are modified do vssop erecovery all dynamic simulations start from steady state conditions 1000 days to eliminate bias due to the selection of initial conditions gernaey et al 2014 the sensor and actuator models are only used during dynamic simulations 3 results 3 1 post anaerobic digestion treated water options evaluation 3 1 1 default operational conditions table 2 shows steady state uasb influent data model predictions for the proposed post digestion treatment options a1 a2 the multi scale approach parameter values and full scale data reported in feldman et al 2017 are used to obtain the anaerobic digester results represented in columns i and ii see sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 model interfaces and the asm implementation in the aerobic granular reactor yield columns iii and iv see sections 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 more information about model interfaces and how cod c n and p are maintained when leaving the uasb reactor and entering the subsequent post treatment options for subsequent post treatment evaluation are provided in the supplemental information section simulation results displayed in table 2 indicate substantial differences regarding n removal efficiencies between a1 and a2 74 and 90 respectively while cod ch4 and s removal are almost the same these differences are attributed to the fact that scenario a1 fails to complete s no 3 s no 2 denitrification due to insufficient carbon source s s option a2 can reduce s no 2 to s n 2 since this process is done autotrophically by x anx and s alk is not a limiting factor the surplus heat that may be produced during electricity generation is for heating the anaerobic digester therefore eheating net is zero regarding erecovery table 2 shows that at default operational conditions of the uasb reactor it is possible to recover 149 2 mwh d 1 this corresponds to 10 800 m3d 1 of ch4 78 of the total produced biogas when it comes to eaeration a1 would require 5652 kwh d 1 or 3 95 kwh kg nremoved these estimations are close to the values reported in lackner et al 2014 additionally around 102 kwh d 1 is necessary to reach the required pumping rates of typical mle configurations qintr qr and qw this leads to an enet of 143 5 mwh d 1 on the other hand in a2 partial nitrification occurs and the required airflow is much lower 2700 kwh d 1 or 1 75 kwh kg nremoved compared to a1 even though a2 includes ae in both pre and reac these values correspond again to literature references where reported aeration energy values for pn anx range from 1 05 to 4 7 kwh kg nremoved lackner et al 2014 this makes the operation of a1 significantly more expensive compared to a2 enet is up to 146 5 mwh d 1 dynamic simulations show again the differences in n removal performance and how option a1 is not capable to remove s no 3 s no 2 due to insufficient available carbon source see fig 2 row ii there are substantial differences in s o 2 levels for both options in option a1 all s nh x has to be transformed to s no 3 therefore the s o 2 demand is very high in option a2 only a part of the incoming s nh x is oxidized to s no 2 thereby reducing the aeration requirements substantially see eaeration in table 2 it is important to notice the effect of the defined noise delay level in the sensor and actuator model these model additions e g the sensor models provide a more realistic pi response and hence contribute to avoiding having unrealistic ideal control actions in the simulation see fig 2 row i both a1 and a2 options achieve almost complete removal of s ch 4 and s h x s at the end of the treatment 99 removal see rows 4 and 5 stripping is the main mechanism for s ch 4 removal in the two evaluated options stripping in a1 takes place in the aer section while in a2 it is in the pre section the predicted activity of x mob is zero for a1 and a2 nevertheless there is a minor contribution of x damo 1 x damo 2 in s ch 4 conversion for a2 similar results were reported in daelman et al 2014 and winkler et al 2014 regarding s h x s this compound is bio chemically re oxidated to x s 0 s so x see row 6 in both a1 and a2 the relatively high operational ph see table 1 ensures a relatively low z h 2 s stripping i e the equilibrium is moved towards z hs stumm and morgan 1996 3 1 2 modification of the uasb reactor conversion efficiency in this section the balance between organics conversion within the uasb reactor versus energy consumption and n removal in both aerobic reactors a1 a2 is studied in more detail in order to do this an increase decrease of conversion efficiency is imposed by changing the uasb reactor volume a ph control ensured the same acid base conditions this modified conversion efficiency combined with alternatives a1 and a2 respectively is simulated using the pwm presented in this paper see table 1 fig 3 a and b shows the changes in the quantity of s s leaving the reactor from 240 to 100 kg h 1 and the quantity of methane produced from 9500 to 11 400 m3 d 1 the latter is used to calculate the potential erecovery see section 2 4 5 fig 3c and d shows the nitrogen removal efficiency for the two evaluated options considering the different uasb reactor capacities it is important to highlight that in all cases the total quantity of nitrogen to treat is the same 80 kg n h 1 when the uasb reactor volume is lowered higher n removal rates were achieved in the option a1 up to 67 of the total incoming n this is attributed to the higher quantity of organics arriving from the ad to the mle plant and therefore more carbon source is available for the traditional denitrification process as a direct result there is a decrease of 11 in the erecovery when the uasb reactor conversion is higher up to 5 in erecovery by increasing its volume it has negative effects not sufficient electron donor on nitrogen removal due to denitrification failure down to 34 n removal using the numbers generated in this case study we can conclude that each additional kg of nitrogen removed in the post treatment will require a decrease in the digester performance equivalent to 95 kwh kg n 1 more details are provided in fig 3c regarding option a2 simulation results show that a higher destruction of organics in the uasb reactor brings many benefits to the overall plant performance firstly the quantity of energy recovery is higher up to 5 in erecovery secondly eaeration in reac is slightly lower due to a minor decrease of the oxygen demand required to remove the arriving cod eaeration changes from 1200 to 1100 kwh d 1 cao et al 2017 as a result enet is more favourable from 146 5 to 153 9 mwh d 1 thirdly the quantity of nitrogen removed is slightly increased from 80 to 84 due to a lower competition with x oho giving advantage to x anx ni et al 2009 more details are provided in fig 3d 3 2 effect of pre treatment on pn anx performance 3 2 1 pn anx influent characteristics this section describes the effect on the overall process performance when the aerated pre treatment pre unit is utilised or not before the pn anx reactor options a2 1 and a2 2 see section 2 4 the pre consists of a cstr with a residence time of 8 h which is aerated see table 1 fig 4 shows the uasb influent see section 2 4 1 the effluent see section 2 4 2 and the pre see section 2 2 4 model predictions as well as the measured data when these were available computer simulations show that adding the pre promoted a cod decrease organic matter and h2s oxidation in the uasb effluent ch4 co2 stripping and a ph increase up to ph 8 5 high ph also promotes the formation of inorganic precipitates x caco 3 and x ca 3 po 4 2 which decreases the quantity of soluble ca and p in the effluent since compounds containing mg are present in under saturated conditions no precipitates of mg compounds are formed reflected as struvite in fig 4 3 2 2 p anx effluent characteristics and granule structure properties fig 5 reveals that the most immediate effect of pre is a substantial reduction of the h2s inhibition and consequently s nh x conversion both a2 1 and a2 2 show that the centre of the granule is inactive due to the high concentration of inert material x i resulting from biomass death the biomass x bio and organics x org concentrations increase for an increasing radial distance z i e the closer to the surface the higher the biomass concentration more specifically a high portion of x anx is placed in the inner zone and this fraction decreases as the radius of the granule increases the presence of x aob and x oho is comparatively higher in the outer layers of the biofilm this distribution corresponds to the degree of s o 2 penetration within the biofilm the main differences between a2 1 and a2 2 rely on the relative presence of x oho x damo and x sob this is attributed to the fact that part of the cod h2s and ch4 is removed in the pre finally pre has an effect on the weak acid base chemistry of both the bulk and the granule as a consequence of including the pre the risk of having intra granular precipitation for calcite sicalc and calcium phosphate sicap is reduced in both cases the system is under saturated for struvite surprisingly no ph gradient between the biofilm and the bulk phase is predicted while some authors observed otherwise lemaire et al 2009 other simulation studies have shown that ph gradients are increased as function of the granule size feldman et al 2017 in this particular case the flat ph profiles can be justified due to the relatively low s no 2 concentrations and the high buffer capacity of the system 3 3 variation in loading operational conditions 3 3 1 do set point tssop and erecovery response surfaces depicted in fig 6 show the effect of changing the operational conditions on 1 n removal effluent s nh x n denitrified 2 aeration energy eaeration and 3 net energy balance enet when both uasb reactor a2 pn anx pre treatment are simulated simultaneously computer results show that optimal do levels for n removal ranges from 0 25 do 0 5 g m 3 at lower values do 0 25 g m 3 there is a failure in nitritation efficiency and there is no conversion of s nh x to s no 2 fig 6b and f at higher do values x nob have a competitive advantage compared to x anx as a result there is a decrease in the overall n removal efficiency due to the substantial amount of s no 3 that is formed in the aqueous phase this can be compensated by increasing the tssop and thereby the ratio of vbiofilm to vreactor or increasing the quantity of organics coming from the digester nevertheless this practice has a negative effect on the entire energy balance in the plant eaeration erecovery and enet 3 3 2 importance of plant wide approaches to avoid suboptimal outcomes the potential n removal and enet maximization in reac by modifying tssop and do setpoint is a clear example of sub optimization for example it was possible to get better enet values when the uasb and reac where modified together see fig 6 second row instead of making local changes in reac up to 155 mwh d 1 compared to 148 mwh d 1 while n removal efficiency is maintained the mass and energy balances provided by the pwm can be very useful to suggest ways of better managing the different industrial streams within the factory and achieving better operational process solutions in addition the optimization examples depicted in fig 6 could be combined with other approaches such as ph and sulfide production control in the ad in this regard previous studies feldman et al 2018 have demonstrated that a good ph control could reduce the operational cost of the digester by up to 45 without risking the overall process performance another interesting example is reported in irizar et al 2018 where advanced software sensors are applied to a similar type of uasb reactor to ensure stable operating conditions 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of realistic control strategies in biofilm systems the pn anx model developed during this study will allow multiple possibilities thus opening a new field of research as mentioned in the introduction previous studies including biofilm reactors did not include sophisticated control elements mainly due to software limitations of the platform on which these simulations were executed reichert 2001 the biofilm model presented here while carrying a high development overhead offers a number of advantages over classic lumped parameter implementations which normally rely on increased solids retention time batstone et al 2002 this includes inherent incorporation of diffusional limitations consideration of how specific gaps will be selectively retained and in biofilm interactions many of these factors are quite important to short term dynamics which in turn impact control strategies the implementation presented in this paper has shown that the computational demand is manageable this implementation which will be freely distributed will allow users to develop simulate control strategies using the most common on line sensors such as ph do nh4 no3 no2 and conductivity lackner et al 2014 implementation of ph has been especially challenging due to the numerical problems that this variable causes batstone et al 2012 some of these implemented sensors might have considerable noise response time and delay rieger et al 2003 the same applies for actuators therefore such elements should be included in order to evaluate controllers realistically rosen et al 2008 the special numerical routines implemented in these models allowed simulating these elements without problems flores alsina et al 2015 feldman et al 2017 4 2 generation of alternatives the options evaluated in this case study have been systematically generated but they are based on general process knowledge the combination of plant wide models ekama 2009 barat et al 2013 solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 with environmental decision support systems edss for suggesting process flow sheets poch et al 2004 garrido baserba et al 2012 castillo et al 2016 is a promising line of research indeed the combination of process heuristics with mixed integer non linear programming could yield a good set of technologies to be further evaluated using dynamic process models there is a bright future if both tools go hand in hand when retrofitting an existing plant during the transition from wwtps to water resource recovery facilities daigger 2011 4 3 outlook limitations and future research directions it is important to highlight that only the adm section of the integrated approach presented in this study has been validated experimentally with full scale data process equations and kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for the asm part have been extracted from literature based on validated case studies the n removal part using a granular system has been tested in vangsgaard et al 2013 methane and sulfide process equations were taken from previous studies dealing with a similar type of wastewater winkler et al 2014 chen et al 2016a b ph predictions and precipitation equations are validated in kazadi mbamba et al 2015a b therefore the results from the simulation study seem to be correct and reliable within the normal uncertainty range of simulation studies of wastewater treatment systems it is interesting to note that as a result of this study the company involved will implement alternative pre pn anx at full scale as a post digestion treatment technology the potential better results in enet were the key issue to tip the scale towards selection of this option last but not least the reader should be aware that the pwm presented in this case study shows a good compromise between model complexity and prediction capabilities nevertheless the list of relevant processes is far from being complete pn processes or systems in general where there is no2 accumulation are well known for producing relatively high quantities of n2o emissions n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas that is 300 times stronger than co2 ipcc 2013 ch4 stripping is an important contribution to greenhouse gas formation as well as a consequence a more integrated assessment should include a compromise between effluent quality operational cost and greenhouse gas emissions flores alsina et al 2014 ni and yuan 2015 other important factors not included in this study when evaluating pn anx systems is the variation of the size of the granular sludge volcke et al 2010 2012 and the effects of intra granular precipitation johansson et al 2017 feldman et al 2018 sulfide inhibition should also be better represented in the model in this study an arbitrarily high value was defined to account for the s effect on biomass growth nevertheless there are numerous studies that report quite complex interactions between x anx and x srb jin et al 2012 2013 the present study could be complemented with more thorough energy balances fernández arévalo et al 2017 longo et al 2018 or life cycle assessment corominas et al 2013 uncertainty risk analysis a central concept for model based evaluation of alternatives belia et al 2009 is an important issue that should be considered as well the consideration of uncertainty risk factors within the evaluation procedure can substantially change the evaluation results and preliminary selected technologies might come up as less desirable while other options retain a higher chance of success under uncertainty 5 conclusions the main findings of this study can be summarized in the following points a plant wide model pwm was presented consisting of a uasb reactor based on an adm type model two post treatment options based on an asm type model special features to interface both models had to be developed the asm approach was implemented in two reactor designs activated sludge aerobic granular sludge sensor and actuator models were included to avoid unrealistic control actions and allow future control possibilities the pwm was simulated and the performance of the different flow diagrams evaluated in terms of pollution removal nitrogen ch4 h2s energy production erecovery energy consumption eaeration epumping and net energy balance enet model based evaluation revealed that pn anx option a2 demanded lower aeration rates eaeration 1 75 kwh kg nremoved and potentially allowed more energy recovery in the uasb reactor erecovery up to 156 7 mwh d 1 since the anammox bacteria in charge of denitrification did not need organics as electron donor as a result the enet 153 9 mwh d 1 was potentially higher conventional n dn option a1 as post treatment of uasb effluent required higher aeration rates eaeration epumping 3 95 kwh kg nremoved to convert the nh4 all the way to no3 and lower conversion in the ad erecovery is down to 132 8 mwh d 1 to allow denitrification i e resulting in a considerably lower net energy production enet 127 1 mwh d 1 calculations show that 95 kwh d 1 is lost in terms of energy production per extra kg n d 1 removed these results are in agreement with the well known advantages of pn anx process over the conventional nitrification denitrification process the addition of an aeration pre treatment tank pre before the pn anx reactor increases cod h2s oxidation ch4 co2 stripping ca precipitation and increases ph these processes change the wastewater influent composition and due to the presence of x damo and x srb this ends up changing the granule microbial distribution ph variation and risk of precipitation are also predicted by the model the modification of the uasb conversion efficiency do set point in the pn anx reactor rendered better results enet than the local tssop do set point optimization of the pn anx operational settings in this way it was possible to take full advantage of the interactions amongst the different units and hence avoid sub optimal outcomes the study has shown the potential of using simulations for virtually evaluating competing options before full scale implementation relevant information about the general mass and energy balances will yield additional information that will help the process engineer to take the right decision in terms of treatment option to be selected 6 software availability the matlab simulink

18907,recent studies have reported increased levels of legionella pneumophila lp at points of use compared to levels in primary and secondary components of hot water systems suggesting possible selection by environmental conditions in this study concentrations of lp in a hospital hot water system were evaluated by profile sampling collecting successive water samples to determine the prevalence at the faucet distal and upstream piping before and after a system intervention to increase temperature lp strain diversity was compared between different points of use and different areas of the hot water system i e tap intermediate piping and main upflow piping in total 47 isolates were recovered from 32 positive hot water samples collected from designated taps showers and recirculation loops these isolates were subsequently analyzed by sequence based typing sbt lp levels were comparable between first draw 500 ml and flushed 2 and 5 min samples whereas a decrease was observed in the amount of culturable cells 1 log two sequence types sts were identified throughout the system st378 sg4 10 was present in 91 of samples while st154 like sg1 was present in 41 both sts were simultaneously recovered in 34 of samples isolated sts displayed comparable tolerance to copper 0 8 5 mg l and temperature 55 c 1 h exposure the ability to replicate within thp1 cells and acanthamoeba castellanii was similar between the two sts and a comparative environmental outbreak strain the low lp diversity and the detection of both lp sequence types in repeated subsequent samples collected from positive faucets in a hospital wing suggest a minimal impact of the distal conditions on strain selection for the sampled points as well as a possible adaptation to stressors present in the system leading to the predominance of a few strains graphical abstract image 1 keywords hot water system legionella pneumophila strain dominance sequence based typing bacterial load profiles building plumbing hospital 1 introduction a marked increase in legionella pneumophila infections has been reported over the last decade as shown by the 286 increase in cases of legionellosis observed in the us between 2000 and 2014 garrison et al 2016 similarly the number of legionnaires disease cases in europe steadily increased between 2011 and 2016 with 81 of these due to l pneumophila european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2017 an estimated mortality rate of 8 has been associated with legionellosis centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2017 european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2017 reaching as high as 25 in healthcare associated outbreaks soda et al 2017 in the united states legionella was the most reported cause of outbreaks associated with drinking water from 2013 to 2014 causing the majority of hospitalizations 88 and all deaths associated with drinking water outbreaks benedict et al 2017 legionella is known to proliferate in engineered water systems such as cooling towers and large building water distribution systems buse et al 2012 although cooling tower associated outbreaks generally result in larger case clusters potable water is nevertheless the most frequent reported source of exposure resulting in an infection by l pneumophila garrison et al 2016 opportunistic microbial pathogens are present and can be amplified in the plumbing system of large buildings posing a health risk for vulnerable individuals conditions present in the plumbing of large buildings such as elevated stagnation sporadic water use variable hydraulic regimes large surface to volume ratios biofilm formation and variable temperatures can provide favorable conditions for l pneumophila flemming and bendinger 2014 in healthcare facilities hot water systems feeding taps and showers are reported to have a higher prevalence of l pneumophila relative to other legionella species bargellini et al 2011 boppe et al 2016 marchesi et al 2011 high levels of contamination measured at the point of utilization suggests a distal amplification of l pneumophila of up to 100 fold compared to levels in the hot water system boppe et al 2016 cristina et al 2014 similarly heterotrophic plate counts hpcs can increase 1 to 3 log fold in distal volume samples compared to levels found in 2 5 min flushed water depending on the system configuration and prior stagnation bagh et al 2004 bédard et al 2018 cristina et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2010 the source of legionella at distal points of the system such as the faucet and its immediate connecting pipes is primarily the hot water system bédard et al 2016b cristina et al 2014 and possibly the cold water system donohue et al 2014 marciano cabral et al 2010 pryor et al 2004 several potential causes of l pneumophila amplification in hot water systems have been identified including materials favorable to biofilm growth lu et al 2014 moritz et al 2010 stagnation lu et al 2017 rhoads et al 2015 and most frequently temperature and copper concentrations boppe et al 2016 dai et al 2018 lu et al 2014 in a large building hot water system these factors generally vary across the system especially environmental factors like residual oxidants copper concentrations and temperature which often closely reflect stagnation furthermore the selective amplification of distinct l pneumophila strains between the faucet its connection piping and the hot water system has not been established additionally it is not known whether different l pneumophila sequence types can be recovered in distal vs flushed samples or if strain selection varies from one faucet to another municipal and building water systems can be colonized by multiple l pneumophila sequence types sts several studies have reported a low number of dominant environmental strains within a system byrne et al 2018 david et al 2017 levesque et al 2014 oberdorfer et al 2008 qin et al 2014 the prevalence of one st can be driven by its superior adaptation to the specific conditions within its environment adaptation to new man made environmental niches may be responsible for the recent independent geographical emergence of a few dominant disease causing sts david et al 2016 strains exposed to drinking water stressors such as nutrient poor conditions high temperatures and high copper and chlorine levels may adapt to these conditions and thrive in this environment over time al bana et al 2014 allegra et al 2011 boppe et al 2016 cervero arago et al 2015 the infectivity of such environmental strains is often unknown especially in the absence of detected clinical cases sharaby et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 conversely the presence of host cells and the capacity of l pneumophila strains to multiply within these cells may increase levels of contamination and risk of infection the main objective of this study was to compare l pneumophila levels of contamination and strain diversity between the faucet and the hot water system in a hospital wing with elevated l pneumophila contamination understanding the distribution of l pneumophila contamination from faucets to system piping and if certain sequence types are specific to the faucet volume will allow the optimization of corrective measures the secondary objectives were to 1 quantify the presence of l pneumophila in various sections of the hot water system using profile sampling 2 evaluate the impact of a system intervention to increase temperature on the sts recovered in distal and flushed samples 3 evaluate the tolerance of prevalent sts to copper and control temperature exposure and 4 verify the potential for infectivity of the prevalent sts 2 methods 2 1 environmental sampling this study was performed in the summer of 2016 in a ten story 450 bed hospital fed by chlorinated surface filtered drinking water the mean incoming municipal water temperature was 26 2 c with a measured residual chlorine level of 0 4 mg cl2 l an average heterotrophic plate count of 9 5 cfu ml and 1 8 103 viable cells ml the mean water temperature directly out of the boiler feeding into the hot water system was 61 6 c with very low residual chlorine concentrations 0 1 mg cl2 l hot water was produced by a flash water heater fed to the main horizontal flow and return loops distributed to each wing through horizontal secondary flow and return loops and fed to the point of use through 9 to 21 vertical risers per wing as previously described boppe et al 2016 fig 1 following an environmental investigation of the hot water system a high incidence of l pneumophila was detected in wing 3 in this wing the mean maximum hot water temperature measured at the point of use 49 6 c was below the required 55 c boppe et al 2016 rbq 2014 all 18 sampled points of use were positive for l pneumophila as a result an intervention was conducted on the system to improve hydraulics and increase temperature at the faucet boppe et al 2016 briefly the main recirculating pump efficiency was improved and flow restriction was implemented on hydraulically advantaged wings resulting in an increased water recirculation velocity in wing 3 three positive faucets located in wing 3 with the highest l pneumophila contamination were selected for in depth investigation to understand whether the l pneumophila contamination was distal or systemic initial positivity was assessed via 500 ml first draw hot water samples the first faucet f1 was fed by riser a located close to the entrance of wing 3 on the 6th floor fig 1 the second and third faucets were each fed by riser b located further into wing 3 on the 2nd and 7th floor respectively fig 1 sampling events were conducted before april 26th to 28th 2016 and after may 2nd to 9th 2016 the system intervention after an overnight stagnation for each sampling at a faucet three successive separate volumes were sampled immediately after opening the faucet in sterile propylene bottles 1st volume of 500 ml a 2nd volume of 500 ml and a 3rd volume of 1 l two additional 1 l samples were collected after 2 min and 5 min of flow sampling flow rates were between 3 and 5 l min a total of 30 water samples were collected and analyzed sample volumes and flush times were selected based on the studied system architecture in order to be representative of different sections within the building plumbing fig 1 the first volume 500 ml corresponds to the faucet and the section of plumbing specific to that faucet the second 500 ml and third 1 l volumes represent water from the vertical flow and return loop adjacent to the sampled faucet the fourth volume 2 min flush represents the water in the vertical flow and return loop and the last sample 5 min flush is representative of the main horizontal pipe water temperature maximum hot water temperature ph turbidity and residual chlorine levels were also measured after 2 l and after 5 min for each sampling event at faucets and after 0 5 l in the additional locations ph was measured using a hach multi parameter hq40d tool with a ph probe phc301 turbidity was measured with a hach 2100q hach loveland co usa and residual chlorine levels were measured using a pocket colorimeter ii hach love land co usa 2 2 microbiological detection methods all samples were analyzed within 24 h of sampling heterotrophic plate counts hpcs were performed according to method 9215 d on r2a agar plates at 22 c with 7 days of incubation american public health association apha 2005 viable and total cell counts were determined by fluorescence microscopy following staining with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular probes eugene usa boulos et al 1999 this kit differentiates intact viable cells from damaged

cells were defined as the sum of intact green and damaged red cells when the cell count was too numerous to count a dilution of the sample was performed in 0 85 sterile saline solution water samples were cultured according to the quantitative method afnor nf t90 431 legionella procedure as previously described boppe et al 2016 with a detection limit of 10 cfu l briefly volumes of water were filtered through sterile 0 45 μm membranes millipore germany treated with acid ph 2 5 min and plated on glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc selective agar biokar diagnostics france an untreated sample volume of 0 2 ml was plated directly all plates were then incubated at 36 c for up to 10 days typical colonies that developed after 4 10 days were sub cultured on confirmation plates for 2 4 days at 36 c resulting colonies that developed on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar but not on bcye without cysteine were considered legionella spp the legionella latex test m45 microgen bioproducts was used for l pneumophila confirmation confirmed l pneumophila colonies were stored in 15 glycerol at 80 c 2 3 sequence based typing in total 41 l pneumophila isolates recovered from the three studied faucets and six other isolates recovered from three first draw 500 ml shower water samples and the hot water recirculation system boppe et al 2016 were sequenced the showers were located in different wings of the hospital i e wings 1 2 and 6 all isolates were genotyped using sequence based typing sbt according to the european working group for legionella infections ewgli protocol gaia et al 2005 briefly genomic dna was extracted from isolated colonies amplification of seven reference genes flaa pile asd mip momps proa neua was performed by pcr using primers as previously described mentasti and fry 2012 amplicons were purified and sequenced by genome québec resulting sequences obtained via sanger sequencing were trimmed and compared to previously assigned allele numbers using the ewgli legionella pneumophila sequence based typing module a 7 digit allelic profile was defined for each isolate and sequence type st was assigned using the ewgli database an isolate representative of each identified st was serotyped using the agglutination test for serogroups other than 1 further testing was performed in collaboration with the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg canada to determine the serogroup via agglutination test and direct fluorescence assay prolab richmond hill on 2 4 copper and temperature resistance of l pneumophila isolates the tolerance of each representative st strain to copper and temperature exposure was evaluated briefly cells cultured in cye were washed three times and starved for one week in synthetic water prior to inoculation in 20 ml of sterile synthetic water at ph 7 8 estimated final concentration 1 108 cfu ml various copper concentrations i e 0 0 8 1 3 2 and 5 mg l were evaluated using copper chloride as the source of copper a sample without copper was treated for 1 h at 55 c to assess the impact of recirculating loop temperatures on these l pneumophila strains samples were maintained at 36 c after heat treatment or copper addition to simulate water temperatures at the faucet or in a shower the survival of l pneumophila isolates exposed to stress was monitored over time at 1 h 6 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 168 h and 336 h on bcye plates water without cells was used as a negative control 2 5 intracellular replication intracellular replication of different strains of l pneumophila was evaluated using thp1 derived human macrophages atcc tib 202 and the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii atcc 30234 the laboratory wild type strain jr32 derived from l pneumophila strain philadelphia 1 and a dota mutant served as positive and negative controls respectively thp1 monocytes were cultured in 25 ml of rpmi gibco supplemented with l glutamine and 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 c with 5 co2 for two weeks thp 1 cells were seeded in 24 well plates at a concentration of 5 105 cells ml and differentiated into macrophages with 10 7 mol l phorbol myristate acetate after 48 h the cells were washed and fresh medium was added before infection amoeba were grown in 25 ml of peptone yeast glucose pyg broth at 30 c in t75 flasks and seeded in 24 well plates at a concentration of 2 5 105 cells ml cells were infected after 24 h macrophages and amoeba were infected with 5 104 l pneumophila cells ml multiplicity of infection 0 1 and incubated in the same conditions as previously described l pneumophila levels were measured every day for four days using cfu counts on bcye buffered charcoal yeast extract agar 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was assessed using the mann whitney test and the wilcoxon matched paired test statistica 13 3 and graphpad prism 7 04 were used for statistical calculations the results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microbial characterization of investigated faucets levels of viable and total cells were not significantly different between the different consecutive volumes sampled from the different faucets fig 2 in general hpc values in the first 2 l sampled were significantly different than those obtained after 2 and 5 min flushing p 0 03 fig 3 hpc levels and profiles were comparable before and after the system intervention for faucets f1 and f2 however the hpc level was significantly different between f1 and f2 p 0 005 suggesting a source of contamination specific to the faucet in faucet f3 hpc levels were significantly different between sampling events p 0 008 fig 3a faucet f3 had the largest temperature increase after the 5 min flush 10 c compared to a temperature increase of 2 and 4 c for faucets f1 and f2 respectively as opposed to hpc l pneumophila levels were not significantly higher in the distal volume compared to the flushed samples fig 3b no l pneumophila was detected in faucet f1 after the system intervention for the 2 and 5 min flushed samples faucet f1 was fed by a separate vertical flow and return loop than faucets f2 and f3 fig 1 in general levels of l pneumophila at each faucet were significantly lower p 0 0001 after the intervention fig 4 following these sampling campaigns the hot water system temperature and hydraulics were further optimized leading to a substantial reduction in l pneumophila positivity and concentration in hot water boppe et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution of recovered l pneumophila sts the sequence type was determined for 41 isolates from the three studied faucets and 6 isolates from the shower and recirculation system samples table 1 the latter was performed to investigate the distribution of the sequence type found in wing 3 thirty one isolates were identified as st378 and one isolate was identified as st378 like since flaa could not be amplified these 32 isolates were serotyped as sg4 10 it was impossible to amplify the flaa gene with previously reported primers gaia et al 2005 for the 15 other isolates table 1 they were identified as st154 like based on a 6 allele profile according to the ewgli database 43 of 51 entries harboring the same 6 allele profile were associated with st154 the st154 like isolates were serotyped as sg1 based on agglutination test results st378 isolates were recovered from 90 6 of positive water samples compared to 40 6 for st154 like isolates in addition st378 was the lone isolate recovered in 56 3 of water samples compared to 6 3 for st154 like isolates although st378 sg4 10 was dominant both sts were shown to be detected in at least one sample from each of the 3 faucets and in shower s1 fig 5 table 1 there was no difference in st distribution between first water volume of 500 ml and subsequent volumes for the studied faucets fig 5 suggesting that the local conditions present within the faucet did not impact the presence or ratio of the sts established within the wing 3 hot water system main horizontal pipe in addition the intervention did not change the prevalence of the sts fig 5 the presence of both sts in showers located in three other wings of the building suggest that those sts were not limited to the studied wing furthermore despite a low positivity rate 250 ufc l an isolate identified as st154 like was recovered from water sampled directly from the main recirculation loop 3 3 adaptation of isolated strains to drinking water stressors and their capacity to replicate within host cells the prevalence of the two sts suggests that they are the best sequence type able to thrive in the environmental conditions present in this building the copper piping within the hot water distribution system led to high levels of copper in the water after stagnation with an average level of 478 μg l and a maximum value of 743 μg l measured at a tap in comparison an average value of 175 μg l was measured after 5 min flushing exposure of representative strains from both sts to copper levels between 0 8 and 5 mg l had a low impact on the ability to culture representative isolates from each st fig 6 after two weeks less than one log fold reduction was observed for both strains fig 6 the tolerance of both sts to the recommended hot water recirculation temperature 55 c was also evaluated to assess whether an increase in temperature within the system could cause a shift in the prevalence of the sts the examined isolates showed approximately 2 log fold reductions after exposure to 55 c temperatures for 1 h fig 6 of note the reduction observed immediately after exposure was maintained over the two following weeks these results suggest that the particular strains present in a hot water system may depend on the stress factors present and the ability of the strains present in the in feed water to survive those conditions finally the ability to survive and replicate within thp1 cells and a castellanii was determined representative isolates for both sts were compared against an environmental epidemic strain id120292 st62 associated with a previous legionellosis outbreak levesque et al 2014 isolates from both sts were not significantly different from the outbreak strain in their capacity to infect and survive in macrophages and host cells fig 7 4 discussion distal amplification was observed for hpc and viable cells in the investigated faucets as previously reported bédard et al 2018 cristina et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2010 the higher contamination of the distal point is generally attributable to prolonged stagnation at the point of use between usages a large surface to volume ratio promoting biofilm growth and nonoptimal water temperatures bédard et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 in the principal and secondary recirculation loops cold and hot water piping feed multiple points of use and therefore experience less stagnation and higher temperatures in addition materials used in the last few meters before the tap often include elastomeric materials which are known to promote biofilm growth moritz et al 2010 distal amplification was therefore also expected for l pneumophila as previously reported by cristina et al 2014 where mean l pneumophila concentrations were significantly higher at the outlet point compared to the hot water systems cristina et al 2014 this was particularly true for l pneumophila sg1 which had a 6 fold increase in percent positivity and 2 log fold increase in levels at the point of use compared to the overall system cristina et al 2014 in the present study only faucet f1 displayed a decreasing profile as a function of flushed volume and time fig 3b although l pneumophila levels were not significantly lower after flushing compared to the first draw volume the comparable profiles detected in all five subsequent water samples from faucets f2 and f3 suggest that the secondary vertical flow and return loop water was also contaminated by l pneumophila fig 1 this is supported by the fact that both of these faucets were fed by the same vertical flow and return loop these results suggest that in certain cases the level of l pneumophila contamination can be relatively homogeneous within the hot water system if it is operated at suboptimal temperatures consistent with prior observations bédard et al 2016a the systemic contamination in the primary and secondary piping of this non optimized hot water system may have acted as a reservoir to seed distal sites the system intervention performed to increase temperature and therefore reduce l pneumophila contamination in the hot water system had a moderate impact on culturable cells hpc for faucets f1 and f2 conversely faucet f3 showed significantly lower hpc levels after intervention fig 3a it can be hypothesized that the larger increase in temperature observed in faucet f3 had an impact on culturable cells which were adapted to a mean temperature of 41 c prior to the intervention the level of l pneumophila contamination was greatly reduced by the temperature increase resulting from the system intervention figs 2 and 3 consistent with previous reports arvand et al 2011 barna et al 2016 boppe et al 2016 völker and kistemann 2015 culturable l pneumophila levels measured from the water samples collected after 5 min flush were found to be inversely correlated with the water temperature r2 0 90 although the correlation was not as strong after the first 2 l r2 0 69 this is in line with previous observations by dai et al who concluded that an increase in hot water temperature had a greater impact on the recirculating system than on distal points of use dai et al 2017 despite the reduced levels of l pneumophila after the system intervention i e temperature increase no change was observed in the st378 ratio fig 5 and the same sts were isolated table 1 these results together with the observed ability of both sts to equally survive exposure to temperature and copper concentrations suggest that both sts are well adapted to the environmental stressors present in this system these factors likely do not fully explain the dominance of st378 the lower prevalence of sg1 observed is in line with the lower prevalence of sg1 previously reported in uk environmental samples 42 7 compared to its widespread clinical presence 88 harrison et al 2007 only two distinct sts st378 and st154 like were recovered through the culture method used low l pneumophila diversity was previously observed in hospital hot water systems following an outbreak investigation bédard et al 2016b david et al 2017 oberdorfer et al 2008 in canada an environmental investigation revealed that 46 isolates recovered from clinical and environmental sources e g water and biofilm from the hot water system were 85 similar by pfge profiling and a subset of 12 isolates analyzed by sequence based typing were associated with st1427 bédard et al 2016b in germany a study conducted in six hospitals over 10 years concluded that each hospital had one to four dominant pfge types that were stable over time oberdorfer et al 2008 recently following a legionnaires disease outbreak in south michigan 18 environmental strains from plumbing and 33 clinical strains were analyzed by sequence based typing byrne et al 2018 two dominant sts from one clonal complex were identified in premise plumbing samples whereas four clonal complexes including 10 sts were recovered from clinical samples byrne et al 2018 finally the use of whole genome sequencing in a broad study of 229 st1 or st1 derived sequence types isolated from environmental and clinical samples from 17 hospitals revealed a long term persistence of highly similar or identical strains in several hospitals david et al 2017 however david et al also observed an important level of diversity in other hospitals showing evidence of microevolution within wards david et al 2017 despite the low diversity reported in the present study environmental samples may still harbor more than one strain at very low prevalence rates which may not be recovered by culture during a single sampling event or by single colony picking in contrast to clinical investigations showing that one colony pick for patient samples is sufficient due to low sample diversity recovered david et al 2018 the identification of all sts within a system is particularly relevant when considering environmental investigations and matching with clinical isolates despite a reported higher pathogenicity of sg1 isolates garcia nunez et al 2009 no significant differences were observed concerning the ability of st378 sg4 10 to replicate within macrophages and amoeba cells compared to st154 like sg1 isolates the two environmental sts isolated have previously been associated with clinical cases in canada suggesting their capacity to infect humans levesque et al 2016 reimer et al 2010 four sporadic cases in québec were associated with st378 two of which were associated with an environmental source levesque et al 2016 however the ewgli database shows a majority of environmental isolates are associated with this st primarily identified as sg 4 or sg10 reimer et al identified a water distribution system in québec as a source of st378 sg4 reimer et al 2010 sequence type st154 is among the most frequent environmental sequence types isolated in the united states in association with outbreaks kozak muiznieks et al 2014 eight sporadic legionellosis cases in québec were associated with st154 between 1993 and 2015 levesque et al 2016 reimer et al 2010 therefore the infectious potential of the two sts suggested by our intracellular replication results is consistent with the documented reports of clinical cases associated with those sts our study presents certain limitations first since the study focused on the in depth investigation of highly contaminated l pneumophila faucets in a problematic hospital wing to understand the prevalence of l pneumophila in different sections of the upflow system it was not possible to make a definitive determination regarding the dominance of these two sts throughout the hospital however the recovery of the same two sts and no new st in the showers sampled in the three other wings and in the main recirculation loop indicate that they are not only present in wing 3 second isolates were collected from water samples since it was not possible to collect biofilm from different sections of piping within the context of the study despite these limitations these results show evidence of water contamination by l pneumophila from faucets to the main pipe in deficient building system understanding the relative importance of the faucet in promoting high levels of l pneumophila in hot water systems is important for the identification of effective corrective actions the recovery of the same sts independent of the pipe section or the faucet sampled suggest that those sts are best adapted to this specific plumbing system environment the low diversity within a building and the differences in predominant sts from building to building could be linked to specific stressors water quality water usage pattern and operating conditions for each building selecting for the sts that are the best suited to survive in the specific environment 5 conclusions l pneumophila contamination was detected at similar concentrations throughout the hot water system of the examined hospital wing from the faucet to the main horizontal flow and return loop contamination was not only distal but also associated with secondary flow and return loops reflecting deficient temperature control across this wing only two sts st378 and st154 like were recovered from the study samples the dominance of the non sg1 st378 was observed consistently between faucet and system samples and from one faucet to another suggesting minimal impact of the local conditions on strain selection and st distribution recirculation or stagnation did not influence the dominant sts present hot water temperature increase as a result of the system intervention was a determining factor for l pneumophila levels measured in water however it did not affect the presence and the ratio of the two sts already present within the system in the short term the comparable ability of both sts to tolerate copper and high temperature exposure and to multiply within host cells rule out these factors as determinants of the dominance of the non sg1 st378 type declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal

18907,recent studies have reported increased levels of legionella pneumophila lp at points of use compared to levels in primary and secondary components of hot water systems suggesting possible selection by environmental conditions in this study concentrations of lp in a hospital hot water system were evaluated by profile sampling collecting successive water samples to determine the prevalence at the faucet distal and upstream piping before and after a system intervention to increase temperature lp strain diversity was compared between different points of use and different areas of the hot water system i e tap intermediate piping and main upflow piping in total 47 isolates were recovered from 32 positive hot water samples collected from designated taps showers and recirculation loops these isolates were subsequently analyzed by sequence based typing sbt lp levels were comparable between first draw 500 ml and flushed 2 and 5 min samples whereas a decrease was observed in the amount of culturable cells 1 log two sequence types sts were identified throughout the system st378 sg4 10 was present in 91 of samples while st154 like sg1 was present in 41 both sts were simultaneously recovered in 34 of samples isolated sts displayed comparable tolerance to copper 0 8 5 mg l and temperature 55 c 1 h exposure the ability to replicate within thp1 cells and acanthamoeba castellanii was similar between the two sts and a comparative environmental outbreak strain the low lp diversity and the detection of both lp sequence types in repeated subsequent samples collected from positive faucets in a hospital wing suggest a minimal impact of the distal conditions on strain selection for the sampled points as well as a possible adaptation to stressors present in the system leading to the predominance of a few strains graphical abstract image 1 keywords hot water system legionella pneumophila strain dominance sequence based typing bacterial load profiles building plumbing hospital 1 introduction a marked increase in legionella pneumophila infections has been reported over the last decade as shown by the 286 increase in cases of legionellosis observed in the us between 2000 and 2014 garrison et al 2016 similarly the number of legionnaires disease cases in europe steadily increased between 2011 and 2016 with 81 of these due to l pneumophila european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2017 an estimated mortality rate of 8 has been associated with legionellosis centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2017 european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2017 reaching as high as 25 in healthcare associated outbreaks soda et al 2017 in the united states legionella was the most reported cause of outbreaks associated with drinking water from 2013 to 2014 causing the majority of hospitalizations 88 and all deaths associated with drinking water outbreaks benedict et al 2017 legionella is known to proliferate in engineered water systems such as cooling towers and large building water distribution systems buse et al 2012 although cooling tower associated outbreaks generally result in larger case clusters potable water is nevertheless the most frequent reported source of exposure resulting in an infection by l pneumophila garrison et al 2016 opportunistic microbial pathogens are present and can be amplified in the plumbing system of large buildings posing a health risk for vulnerable individuals conditions present in the plumbing of large buildings such as elevated stagnation sporadic water use variable hydraulic regimes large surface to volume ratios biofilm formation and variable temperatures can provide favorable conditions for l pneumophila flemming and bendinger 2014 in healthcare facilities hot water systems feeding taps and showers are reported to have a higher prevalence of l pneumophila relative to other legionella species bargellini et al 2011 boppe et al 2016 marchesi et al 2011 high levels of contamination measured at the point of utilization suggests a distal amplification of l pneumophila of up to 100 fold compared to levels in the hot water system boppe et al 2016 cristina et al 2014 similarly heterotrophic plate counts hpcs can increase 1 to 3 log fold in distal volume samples compared to levels found in 2 5 min flushed water depending on the system configuration and prior stagnation bagh et al 2004 bédard et al 2018 cristina et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2010 the source of legionella at distal points of the system such as the faucet and its immediate connecting pipes is primarily the hot water system bédard et al 2016b cristina et al 2014 and possibly the cold water system donohue et al 2014 marciano cabral et al 2010 pryor et al 2004 several potential causes of l pneumophila amplification in hot water systems have been identified including materials favorable to biofilm growth lu et al 2014 moritz et al 2010 stagnation lu et al 2017 rhoads et al 2015 and most frequently temperature and copper concentrations boppe et al 2016 dai et al 2018 lu et al 2014 in a large building hot water system these factors generally vary across the system especially environmental factors like residual oxidants copper concentrations and temperature which often closely reflect stagnation furthermore the selective amplification of distinct l pneumophila strains between the faucet its connection piping and the hot water system has not been established additionally it is not known whether different l pneumophila sequence types can be recovered in distal vs flushed samples or if strain selection varies from one faucet to another municipal and building water systems can be colonized by multiple l pneumophila sequence types sts several studies have reported a low number of dominant environmental strains within a system byrne et al 2018 david et al 2017 levesque et al 2014 oberdorfer et al 2008 qin et al 2014 the prevalence of one st can be driven by its superior adaptation to the specific conditions within its environment adaptation to new man made environmental niches may be responsible for the recent independent geographical emergence of a few dominant disease causing sts david et al 2016 strains exposed to drinking water stressors such as nutrient poor conditions high temperatures and high copper and chlorine levels may adapt to these conditions and thrive in this environment over time al bana et al 2014 allegra et al 2011 boppe et al 2016 cervero arago et al 2015 the infectivity of such environmental strains is often unknown especially in the absence of detected clinical cases sharaby et al 2018 sousa et al 2018 conversely the presence of host cells and the capacity of l pneumophila strains to multiply within these cells may increase levels of contamination and risk of infection the main objective of this study was to compare l pneumophila levels of contamination and strain diversity between the faucet and the hot water system in a hospital wing with elevated l pneumophila contamination understanding the distribution of l pneumophila contamination from faucets to system piping and if certain sequence types are specific to the faucet volume will allow the optimization of corrective measures the secondary objectives were to 1 quantify the presence of l pneumophila in various sections of the hot water system using profile sampling 2 evaluate the impact of a system intervention to increase temperature on the sts recovered in distal and flushed samples 3 evaluate the tolerance of prevalent sts to copper and control temperature exposure and 4 verify the potential for infectivity of the prevalent sts 2 methods 2 1 environmental sampling this study was performed in the summer of 2016 in a ten story 450 bed hospital fed by chlorinated surface filtered drinking water the mean incoming municipal water temperature was 26 2 c with a measured residual chlorine level of 0 4 mg cl2 l an average heterotrophic plate count of 9 5 cfu ml and 1 8 103 viable cells ml the mean water temperature directly out of the boiler feeding into the hot water system was 61 6 c with very low residual chlorine concentrations 0 1 mg cl2 l hot water was produced by a flash water heater fed to the main horizontal flow and return loops distributed to each wing through horizontal secondary flow and return loops and fed to the point of use through 9 to 21 vertical risers per wing as previously described boppe et al 2016 fig 1 following an environmental investigation of the hot water system a high incidence of l pneumophila was detected in wing 3 in this wing the mean maximum hot water temperature measured at the point of use 49 6 c was below the required 55 c boppe et al 2016 rbq 2014 all 18 sampled points of use were positive for l pneumophila as a result an intervention was conducted on the system to improve hydraulics and increase temperature at the faucet boppe et al 2016 briefly the main recirculating pump efficiency was improved and flow restriction was implemented on hydraulically advantaged wings resulting in an increased water recirculation velocity in wing 3 three positive faucets located in wing 3 with the highest l pneumophila contamination were selected for in depth investigation to understand whether the l pneumophila contamination was distal or systemic initial positivity was assessed via 500 ml first draw hot water samples the first faucet f1 was fed by riser a located close to the entrance of wing 3 on the 6th floor fig 1 the second and third faucets were each fed by riser b located further into wing 3 on the 2nd and 7th floor respectively fig 1 sampling events were conducted before april 26th to 28th 2016 and after may 2nd to 9th 2016 the system intervention after an overnight stagnation for each sampling at a faucet three successive separate volumes were sampled immediately after opening the faucet in sterile propylene bottles 1st volume of 500 ml a 2nd volume of 500 ml and a 3rd volume of 1 l two additional 1 l samples were collected after 2 min and 5 min of flow sampling flow rates were between 3 and 5 l min a total of 30 water samples were collected and analyzed sample volumes and flush times were selected based on the studied system architecture in order to be representative of different sections within the building plumbing fig 1 the first volume 500 ml corresponds to the faucet and the section of plumbing specific to that faucet the second 500 ml and third 1 l volumes represent water from the vertical flow and return loop adjacent to the sampled faucet the fourth volume 2 min flush represents the water in the vertical flow and return loop and the last sample 5 min flush is representative of the main horizontal pipe water temperature maximum hot water temperature ph turbidity and residual chlorine levels were also measured after 2 l and after 5 min for each sampling event at faucets and after 0 5 l in the additional locations ph was measured using a hach multi parameter hq40d tool with a ph probe phc301 turbidity was measured with a hach 2100q hach loveland co usa and residual chlorine levels were measured using a pocket colorimeter ii hach love land co usa 2 2 microbiological detection methods all samples were analyzed within 24 h of sampling heterotrophic plate counts hpcs were performed according to method 9215 d on r2a agar plates at 22 c with 7 days of incubation american public health association apha 2005 viable and total cell counts were determined by fluorescence microscopy following staining with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular probes eugene usa boulos et al 1999 this kit differentiates intact viable cells from damaged

were cultured according to the quantitative method afnor nf t90 431 legionella procedure as previously described boppe et al 2016 with a detection limit of 10 cfu l briefly volumes of water were filtered through sterile 0 45 μm membranes millipore germany treated with acid ph 2 5 min and plated on glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc selective agar biokar diagnostics france an untreated sample volume of 0 2 ml was plated directly all plates were then incubated at 36 c for up to 10 days typical colonies that developed after 4 10 days were sub cultured on confirmation plates for 2 4 days at 36 c resulting colonies that developed on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar but not on bcye without cysteine were considered legionella spp the legionella latex test m45 microgen bioproducts was used for l pneumophila confirmation confirmed l pneumophila colonies were stored in 15 glycerol at 80 c 2 3 sequence based typing in total 41 l pneumophila isolates recovered from the three studied faucets and six other isolates recovered from three first draw 500 ml shower water samples and the hot water recirculation system boppe et al 2016 were sequenced the showers were located in different wings of the hospital i e wings 1 2 and 6 all isolates were genotyped using sequence based typing sbt according to the european working group for legionella infections ewgli protocol gaia et al 2005 briefly genomic dna was extracted from isolated colonies amplification of seven reference genes flaa pile asd mip momps proa neua was performed by pcr using primers as previously described mentasti and fry 2012 amplicons were purified and sequenced by genome québec resulting sequences obtained via sanger sequencing were trimmed and compared to previously assigned allele numbers using the ewgli legionella pneumophila sequence based typing module a 7 digit allelic profile was defined for each isolate and sequence type st was assigned using the ewgli database an isolate representative of each identified st was serotyped using the agglutination test for serogroups other than 1 further testing was performed in collaboration with the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg canada to determine the serogroup via agglutination test and direct fluorescence assay prolab richmond hill on 2 4 copper and temperature resistance of l pneumophila isolates the tolerance of each representative st strain to copper and temperature exposure was evaluated briefly cells cultured in cye were washed three times and starved for one week in synthetic water prior to inoculation in 20 ml of sterile synthetic water at ph 7 8 estimated final concentration 1 108 cfu ml various copper concentrations i e 0 0 8 1 3 2 and 5 mg l were evaluated using copper chloride as the source of copper a sample without copper was treated for 1 h at 55 c to assess the impact of recirculating loop temperatures on these l pneumophila strains samples were maintained at 36 c after heat treatment or copper addition to simulate water temperatures at the faucet or in a shower the survival of l pneumophila isolates exposed to stress was monitored over time at 1 h 6 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 168 h and 336 h on bcye plates water without cells was used as a negative control 2 5 intracellular replication intracellular replication of different strains of l pneumophila was evaluated using thp1 derived human macrophages atcc tib 202 and the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii atcc 30234 the laboratory wild type strain jr32 derived from l pneumophila strain philadelphia 1 and a dota mutant served as positive and negative controls respectively thp1 monocytes were cultured in 25 ml of rpmi gibco supplemented with l glutamine and 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 c with 5 co2 for two weeks thp 1 cells were seeded in 24 well plates at a concentration of 5 105 cells ml and differentiated into macrophages with 10 7 mol l phorbol myristate acetate after 48 h the cells were washed and fresh medium was added before infection amoeba were grown in 25 ml of peptone yeast glucose pyg broth at 30 c in t75 flasks and seeded in 24 well plates at a concentration of 2 5 105 cells ml cells were infected after 24 h macrophages and amoeba were infected with 5 104 l pneumophila cells ml multiplicity of infection 0 1 and incubated in the same conditions as previously described l pneumophila levels were measured every day for four days using cfu counts on bcye buffered charcoal yeast extract agar 2 6 statistical analysis statistical significance was assessed using the mann whitney test and the wilcoxon matched paired test statistica 13 3 and graphpad prism 7 04 were used for statistical calculations the results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microbial characterization of investigated faucets levels of viable and total cells were not significantly different between the different consecutive volumes sampled from the different faucets fig 2 in general hpc values in the first 2 l sampled were significantly different than those obtained after 2 and 5 min flushing p 0 03 fig 3 hpc levels and profiles were comparable before and after the system intervention for faucets f1 and f2 however the hpc level was significantly different between f1 and f2 p 0 005 suggesting a source of contamination specific to the faucet in faucet f3 hpc levels were significantly different between sampling events p 0 008 fig 3a faucet f3 had the largest temperature increase after the 5 min flush 10 c compared to a temperature increase of 2 and 4 c for faucets f1 and f2 respectively as opposed to hpc l pneumophila levels were not significantly higher in the distal volume compared to the flushed samples fig 3b no l pneumophila was detected in faucet f1 after the system intervention for the 2 and 5 min flushed samples faucet f1 was fed by a separate vertical flow and return loop than faucets f2 and f3 fig 1 in general levels of l pneumophila at each faucet were significantly lower p 0 0001 after the intervention fig 4 following these sampling campaigns the hot water system temperature and hydraulics were further optimized leading to a substantial reduction in l pneumophila positivity and concentration in hot water boppe et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution of recovered l pneumophila sts the sequence type was determined for 41 isolates from the three studied faucets and 6 isolates from the shower and recirculation system samples table 1 the latter was performed to investigate the distribution of the sequence type found in wing 3 thirty one isolates were identified as st378 and one isolate was identified as st378 like since flaa could not be amplified these 32 isolates were serotyped as sg4 10 it was impossible to amplify the flaa gene with previously reported primers gaia et al 2005 for the 15 other isolates table 1 they were identified as st154 like based on a 6 allele profile according to the ewgli database 43 of 51 entries harboring the same 6 allele profile were associated with st154 the st154 like isolates were serotyped as sg1 based on agglutination test results st378 isolates were recovered from 90 6 of positive water samples compared to 40 6 for st154 like isolates in addition st378 was the lone isolate recovered in 56 3 of water samples compared to 6 3 for st154 like isolates although st378 sg4 10 was dominant both sts were shown to be detected in at least one sample from each of the 3 faucets and in shower s1 fig 5 table 1 there was no difference in st distribution between first water volume of 500 ml and subsequent volumes for the studied faucets fig 5 suggesting that the local conditions present within the faucet did not impact the presence or ratio of the sts established within the wing 3 hot water system main horizontal pipe in addition the intervention did not change the prevalence of the sts fig 5 the presence of both sts in showers located in three other wings of the building suggest that those sts were not limited to the studied wing furthermore despite a low positivity rate 250 ufc l an isolate identified as st154 like was recovered from water sampled directly from the main recirculation loop 3 3 adaptation of isolated strains to drinking water stressors and their capacity to replicate within host cells the prevalence of the two sts suggests that they are the best sequence type able to thrive in the environmental conditions present in this building the copper piping within the hot water distribution system led to high levels of copper in the water after stagnation with an average level of 478 μg l and a maximum value of 743 μg l measured at a tap in comparison an average value of 175 μg l was measured after 5 min flushing exposure of representative strains from both sts to copper levels between 0 8 and 5 mg l had a low impact on the ability to culture representative isolates from each st fig 6 after two weeks less than one log fold reduction was observed for both strains fig 6 the tolerance of both sts to the recommended hot water recirculation temperature 55 c was also evaluated to assess whether an increase in temperature within the system could cause a shift in the prevalence of the sts the examined isolates showed approximately 2 log fold reductions after exposure to 55 c temperatures for 1 h fig 6 of note the reduction observed immediately after exposure was maintained over the two following weeks these results suggest that the particular strains present in a hot water system may depend on the stress factors present and the ability of the strains present in the in feed water to survive those conditions finally the ability to survive and replicate within thp1 cells and a castellanii was determined representative isolates for both sts were compared against an environmental epidemic strain id120292 st62 associated with a previous legionellosis outbreak levesque et al 2014 isolates from both sts were not significantly different from the outbreak strain in their capacity to infect and survive in macrophages and host cells fig 7 4 discussion distal amplification was observed for hpc and viable cells in the investigated faucets as previously reported bédard et al 2018 cristina et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2010 the higher contamination of the distal point is generally attributable to prolonged stagnation at the point of use between usages a large surface to volume ratio promoting biofilm growth and nonoptimal water temperatures bédard et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 in the principal and secondary recirculation loops cold and hot water piping feed multiple points of use and therefore experience less stagnation and higher temperatures in addition materials used in the last few meters before the tap often include elastomeric materials which are known to promote biofilm growth moritz et al 2010 distal amplification was therefore also expected for l pneumophila as previously reported by cristina et al 2014 where mean l pneumophila concentrations were significantly higher at the outlet point compared to the hot water systems cristina et al 2014 this was particularly true for l pneumophila sg1 which had a 6 fold increase in percent positivity and 2 log fold increase in levels at the point of use compared to the overall system cristina et al 2014 in the present study only faucet f1 displayed a decreasing profile as a function of flushed volume and time fig 3b although l pneumophila levels were not significantly lower after flushing compared to the first draw volume the comparable profiles detected in all five subsequent water samples from faucets f2 and f3 suggest that the secondary vertical flow and return loop water was also contaminated by l pneumophila fig 1 this is supported by the fact that both of these faucets were fed by the same vertical flow and return loop these results suggest that in certain cases the level of l pneumophila contamination can be relatively homogeneous within the hot water system if it is operated at suboptimal temperatures consistent with prior observations bédard et al 2016a the systemic contamination in the primary and secondary piping of this non optimized hot water system may have acted as a reservoir to seed distal sites the system intervention performed to increase temperature and therefore reduce l pneumophila contamination in the hot water system had a moderate impact on culturable cells hpc for faucets f1 and f2 conversely faucet f3 showed significantly lower hpc levels after intervention fig 3a it can be hypothesized that the larger increase in temperature observed in faucet f3 had an impact on culturable cells which were adapted to a mean temperature of 41 c prior to the intervention the level of l pneumophila contamination was greatly reduced by the temperature increase resulting from the system intervention figs 2 and 3 consistent with previous reports arvand et al 2011 barna et al 2016 boppe et al 2016 völker and kistemann 2015 culturable l pneumophila levels measured from the water samples collected after 5 min flush were found to be inversely correlated with the water temperature r2 0 90 although the correlation was not as strong after the first 2 l r2 0 69 this is in line with previous observations by dai et al who concluded that an increase in hot water temperature had a greater impact on the recirculating system than on distal points of use dai et al 2017 despite the reduced levels of l pneumophila after the system intervention i e temperature increase no change was observed in the st378 ratio fig 5 and the same sts were isolated table 1 these results together with the observed ability of both sts to equally survive exposure to temperature and copper concentrations suggest that both sts are well adapted to the environmental stressors present in this system these factors likely do not fully explain the dominance of st378 the lower prevalence of sg1 observed is in line with the lower prevalence of sg1 previously reported in uk environmental samples 42 7 compared to its widespread clinical presence 88 harrison et al 2007 only two distinct sts st378 and st154 like were recovered through the culture method used low l pneumophila diversity was previously observed in hospital hot water systems following an outbreak investigation bédard et al 2016b david et al 2017 oberdorfer et al 2008 in canada an environmental investigation revealed that 46 isolates recovered from clinical and environmental sources e g water and biofilm from the hot water system were 85 similar by pfge profiling and a subset of 12 isolates analyzed by sequence based typing were associated with st1427 bédard et al 2016b in germany a study conducted in six hospitals over 10 years concluded that each hospital had one to four dominant pfge types that were stable over time oberdorfer et al 2008 recently following a legionnaires disease outbreak in south michigan 18 environmental strains from plumbing and 33 clinical strains were analyzed by sequence based typing byrne et al 2018 two dominant sts from one clonal complex were identified in premise plumbing samples whereas four clonal complexes including 10 sts were recovered from clinical samples byrne et al 2018 finally the use of whole genome sequencing in a broad study of 229 st1 or st1 derived sequence types isolated from environmental and clinical samples from 17 hospitals revealed a long term persistence of highly similar or identical strains in several hospitals david et al 2017 however david et al also observed an important level of diversity in other hospitals showing evidence of microevolution within wards david et al 2017 despite the low diversity reported in the present study environmental samples may still harbor more than one strain at very low prevalence rates which may not be recovered by culture during a single sampling event or by single colony picking in contrast to clinical investigations showing that one colony pick for patient samples is sufficient due to low sample diversity recovered david et al 2018 the identification of all sts within a system is particularly relevant when considering environmental investigations and matching with clinical isolates despite a reported higher pathogenicity of sg1 isolates garcia nunez et al 2009 no significant differences were observed concerning the ability of st378 sg4 10 to replicate within macrophages and amoeba cells compared to st154 like sg1 isolates the two environmental sts isolated have previously been associated with clinical cases in canada suggesting their capacity to infect humans levesque et al 2016 reimer et al 2010 four sporadic cases in québec were associated with st378 two of which were associated with an environmental source levesque et al 2016 however the ewgli database shows a majority of environmental isolates are associated with this st primarily identified as sg 4 or sg10 reimer et al identified a water distribution system in québec as a source of st378 sg4 reimer et al 2010 sequence type st154 is among the most frequent environmental sequence types isolated in the united states in association with outbreaks kozak muiznieks et al 2014 eight sporadic legionellosis cases in québec were associated with st154 between 1993 and 2015 levesque et al 2016 reimer et al 2010 therefore the infectious potential of the two sts suggested by our intracellular replication results is consistent with the documented reports of clinical cases associated with those sts our study presents certain limitations first since the study focused on the in depth investigation of highly contaminated l pneumophila faucets in a problematic hospital wing to understand the prevalence of l pneumophila in different sections of the upflow system it was not possible to make a definitive determination regarding the dominance of these two sts throughout the hospital however the recovery of the same two sts and no new st in the showers sampled in the three other wings and in the main recirculation loop indicate that they are not only present in wing 3 second isolates were collected from water samples since it was not possible to collect biofilm from different sections of piping within the context of the study despite these limitations these results show evidence of water contamination by l pneumophila from faucets to the main pipe in deficient building system understanding the relative importance of the faucet in promoting high levels of l pneumophila in hot water systems is important for the identification of effective corrective actions the recovery of the same sts independent of the pipe section or the faucet sampled suggest that those sts are best adapted to this specific plumbing system environment the low diversity within a building and the differences in predominant sts from building to building could be linked to specific stressors water quality water usage pattern and operating conditions for each building selecting for the sts that are the best suited to survive in the specific environment 5 conclusions l pneumophila contamination was detected at similar concentrations throughout the hot water system of the examined hospital wing from the faucet to the main horizontal flow and return loop contamination was not only distal but also associated with secondary flow and return loops reflecting deficient temperature control across this wing only two sts st378 and st154 like were recovered from the study samples the dominance of the non sg1 st378 was observed consistently between faucet and system samples and from one faucet to another suggesting minimal impact of the local conditions on strain selection and st distribution recirculation or stagnation did not influence the dominant sts present hot water temperature increase as a result of the system intervention was a determining factor for l pneumophila levels measured in water however it did not affect the presence and the ratio of the two sts already present within the system in the short term the comparable ability of both sts to tolerate copper and high temperature exposure and to multiply within host cells rule out these factors as determinants of the dominance of the non sg1 st378 type declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

18908,chlorine is not effective in the oxidative removal of soluble manganese ii ions at neutral ph powdered activated carbon pac also has a very limited capacity for mn ii removal through adsorption in drinking water treatment practice this study explored the combined use of pac and chlorine for mn ii removal and found that pac dramatically catalyzed mn ii oxidation by chlorine under diverse conditions at a dose as low as 5 0 mg l two different commercial pacs increased mn ii oxidation rate by two orders of magnitude respectively and reduced mn ii concentration from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in tens of minutes first order kinetics with respect to aqueous mn ii concentration were observed typically homogeneous mn ii oxidation by chlorine depends strongly on alkaline ph in the presence of pac however the reaction was still rather fast at ph 6 0 increasing pac doses linearly increased mn ii oxidation rate indicating that the reaction was highly pac surface active sites dependent the efficacy of pac was further corroborated in removing mn ii from natural water sem eds and xps demonstrated that a mno2 coating was formed on pac surface after reaction which resulted from heterogeneous oxidation of mn ii on pac surface rather than the precipitation of mn oxides formed through homogeneous oxidation in solution adsorption of free mn ii ions onto pac surface was proved to directly correlate with mn ii oxidation rate two kinds of electron transfer pathways from adsorbed mn ii species to chlorine enhanced by surface complexation and electrically conductive carbon surface respectively were hypothesized graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese ii oxidation powdered activated carbon chlorine adsorption surface complexation electrical conductivity 1 introduction manganese mn exists in a wide range of natural environments including various kinds of water bodies used as drinking water sources mn that is not sufficiently removed by a water treatment plant enters drinking water distribution systems and undergoes further oxidation deposition and release processes leading to discoloration of tap water li et al 2018 sly et al 1990 compared to particulate mn oxides that could be easily separated from liquids by the water treatment plant the removal of soluble mn ii ions in reduced forms is much more difficult hamilton et al 2013 the application of an oxidant for mn ii oxidation prior to the sedimentation and filtration process is a typical approach to control soluble mn tobiason et al 2016 mn ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen is rather slow and has a half life of years although this process can be accelerated by metal oxides such as hematite lepidocrocite and goethite diem and stumm 1984 kessick and morgan 1975 morgan 2005 due to its low cost easy operation and high security chlorine often dosed in the form of sodium hypochlorite is most frequently used in pre oxidation and disinfection processes for the control of algae ammonia iron manganese and biological growth deborde and von gunten 2008 oliver and shindler 1980 sontheimer 1979 wong 1984 however the slow reaction between mn ii and chlorine makes chlorine inefficient for mn ii oxidation mn ii can be oxidized efficiently by chlorine only under alkaline ph conditions allard et al 2013 knocke et al 1987 without sufficient removal of mn yellow water or black water incidents occur in distribution systems even when effluent mn concentration was as low as 20 μg l sly et al 1990 as can also be supported by the discoloration problems that occurred in several chinese cities when effluent mn concentration was as low as 20 μg l activated carbon has porous structures and large internal surface areas and is often used as an adsorbent pelekani and snoeyink 1999 it has a relatively strong adsorption capacity for heavy metals including pb ii cu ii cd ii hg ii ni ii as iv anirudhan and sreekumari 2011 kadirvelu et al 2001 lorenzen et al 1995 netzer and hughes 1984 the carbon surface has an abundant oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl and lactones groups10 11 that affect its adsorption performance fanning and vannice 1993 pereira et al 2003 rodriguezreinoso et al 1992 moreover activated carbon exhibits catalytic activity for diverse reactions including hydrogenation oxidation polymerization and halogenation chen et al 2014a stüber et al 2005 voudrias et al 1983 1985 the surface oxygen groups of carbon materials act as active sites and play an important role in catalytic reactions figueiredo et al 2007 rodríguez reinoso 1998 for example carbon materials containing carbonyl quinone groups liu et al 2011 and ketonic co groups zhang et al 2008 were reported to serve as metal free catalysts in direct dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen and in oxidative dehydrogenation respectively however the carbon materials received little attention as the redox catalyst for the removal of metals including mn to the best of our knowledge only samblebe 2003 has reported that mn ii oxidation via pre chlorination for 27 min followed by a dose of pac during the flocculation stage can achieve high mn removal rates however the role of pac in the mn removal process was not studied it seemed that pac acted similarly to flocculants because in that case pac was added simultaneously with polyaluminum chloride for the flocculation of the oxidized mn species in this work two different commercial pacs coal based pac and coconut shell pac were used with chlorine for mn ii removal the present study aims to develop a new technique for oxidative removal of mn ii and investigate the role of pac in mn ii oxidation by chlorine and to determine the key aqueous factors that affect mn ii oxidation rate in the presence of pac for practical application all of the aquatic chemical conditions were chosen to simulate the water quality parameters typically encountered in natural mn containing water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents commercially available coal based pac and coconut shell pac used in this research were purchased from ningxia guanghua pac co ltd china the general characteristics of these two pacs are listed in table 1 after the pacs were obtained from the supplier they were purified by washing with deionized water di water with a resistivity 18 2 mω cm until the pac ph was nearly neutral dried at 100 c for 4 h and then made into pac stock suspensions with a concentration of 1 g l with the exception of the pacs all of the reagents used in this research were of analytical grade or higher di water was used to prepare all of the solutions unless otherwise noted the mn ii stock solution with a concentration of 0 5 g l was prepared from mnso4 and it was acidified with h2so4 so that mn ii would be stable during the storage period sodium hypochlorite naclo was used for the preparation of the chlorine stock solution with a concentration of 1 0 g l as cl2 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 mn ii adsorption by pac the experiment was started by mixing a certain amount of pac 5 10 and 20 mg l with mn ii solution in a glass beaker and agitating with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 3 h when adsorption equilibrium was achieved an initial dose of mn ii of 200 μg l was adopted in all the experiments except where otherwise stated this concentration was selected mainly because it is generally close to or higher than the soluble mn ii concentrations most commonly encountered in the source waters causing discoloration issues and is a representative challenging concentration for treatment other experimental conditions included ph 7 7 0 1 nano3 nahco3 0 5 mm t 22 0 5 c o2 open to air 7 8 mg l the amount of adsorbed mn ii was quantified by measuring free mn ii concentration in the filtered solutions oxidation of mn ii by dissolved oxygen was ignored in the adsorption experiments because the experimental time periods were significantly shorter than the half life for the oxidation of mn ii by oxygen 2 2 2 mn ii oxidation experiments all of the mn ii oxidation experiments were conducted in glass beakers open to the room air in duplicate or more nano3 0 5 mm and nahco3 0 5 mm were added to provide a suitable ionic strength and a buffer against a significant change of ph dilute naoh and h2so4 solutions were used to adjust the ph at the start of the experiments under rapid agitation to avoid the sudden increase of local micro area ph additionally the ph was monitored throughout the duration of the experiment and was adjusted with naoh and h2so4 carefully if the deviation from the target ph 7 0 7 7 or 8 5 exceeded 0 1 the temperature was maintained at 22 0 5 c during all of the experiments unless it was adjusted for testing the effect of temperature the chlorine stock solution was dosed slowly into solutions to obtain desired chlorine concentrations 1 0 2 0 or 4 0 mg l and to start the oxidation of mn ii in the ph range 6 9 hocl and clo are the main chlorine species deborde and von gunten 2008 then the mixed solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm and a small aliquot of water sample was withdrawn at an appropriate interval of time in the presence of pac mn ii oxidation was started by the dose of chlorine 20 min after the addition of pac to the mn ii containing solutions when adsorption equilibrium was achieved as shown in fig s1 and the adsorptive removal of mn ii was completed the soluble mn ii concentration measured immediately prior to the addition of chlorine was regarded as the starting concentration of mn ii oxidation by chlorine the initial doses of mn ii were 205 μg l 215 μg l and 230 μg l when the doses of pac were 5 mg l 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively which was designed to achieve a residual mn ii concentration in solution of approximately 200 μg l after the adsorption by pac as chlorine may corrode pac the effect of chlorine on dissolved organic carbon doc release from pac was estimated by comparing doc concentrations before and after the dose of chlorine into pac containing solutions 2 2 3 natural water experiments to test the efficacy of pac for promoting mn oxidation by chlorine mn ii adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted by preparing solutions with the untreated source water surface water of beijing china after being filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filter the general water quality parameters are listed in table s2 mnso4 and sodium hypochlorite stock solutions were dosed separately to achieve 200 μg l of mn ii and 1 0 mg l of chlorine respectively and ph was adjusted carefully to 7 70 at 22 c the doses of two pacs were both 5 mg l 2 2 4 mn colloid adsorption by pac this experiment the details of which are presented in the supporting information si was designed to examine whether pac would have the ability to adsorb flocculate or precipitate pre formed mn colloids in solution briefly the solution containing mn colloids was prepared by the oxidation of mn ii with chlorine of high concentration then pac was added and the concentration change of colloidal mn was measured to assess whether the colloidal mn was adsorbed or precipitated on pac surface if the precipitation occurred then colloidal mn concentration would decrease because the particle size of pac was much larger than 0 22 μm 2 3 analytical methods to quantify the oxidation or adsorption of mn ii ions the concentration of mn in filtered solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo icap q icp ms after acidized with nitric acid davies and morgan 1989 kessick and morgan 1975 van genuchten and peña 2017 a 10 kda ultrafiltration millipore filter was used to define truly soluble mn ii ions mn colloids were operationally defined as mn oxides that pass through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter but are retained by 10 kda filter pan et al 2017 in the presence of pac and chlorine there was no significant difference found between mn concentrations in the samples filtered using 10 kda and 0 22 μm filters indicating the absence of mn colloids in the pac system thus it is feasible to use a 0 22 μm filter instead of a 10 kda filter when the filtration efficiency is taken into account however colloidal mn oxides were formed by mn ii oxidation in the absence of pac making ultrafiltration necessary to distinguish the mn colloids from soluble mn ii in the experiment of mn ii adsorption the 0 22 μm filtration was adopted to measure free mn ii ions in the solution because the pac particle sizes were much greater than 0 22 μm the dpd method was used to measure residual free chlorine in the solution with results presented in mg l as cl2 hach pocket colorimeter ii the ph was measured with a ph meter hach hq 40d after calibration with standard solutions prior to use dissolved organic carbon was measured by a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the bet method was used to determine the surface area and pore size of the raw pac bohem titration was used for the quantification of the oxygen containing functional groups of pac boehm 2002 electrical conductivity measurement was performed on pac using a four point probe fpp method armes et al 1991 wang et al 2019 the fpp device yaos china with four electrodes arranged in linear form in contact with sample surface is connected to a computer allowing rapid and automatic testing of conductivity calculated electrical conductivity was finally displayed by computer because it is possible that the physicochemical properties of pac surface could be changed during chlorination to determine the effect of chlorine on pac surface both the raw pac and the pac treated by chlorine with a ratio of 5 mg l pac to 1 0 mg l chlorine were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir using a kbr pellet transmission method with a bruker vertex 70 spectrometer and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps vg scientific escalab220i xl using the binding energies data in the c1s and o1s regions terzyk 2001 scanning electron microscopy zeiss merlin field emission sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used to observe the surface microstructures of mn ii oxidation products formed in the presence of pac details are presented in the si the chemical states of mn ii oxidation products were determined by xps using the binding energy data in mn3p region to obtain the reference of mn3p peaks three monovalent mn oxides were used as standards for xps analysis cerrato et al 2010 2011 99 pure mno purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 99 9 pure mn2o3 purchased from sigma aldrich co st louis usa and 99 9 pure mno2 purchased from alfa aesar co ltd shanghai china the binding energies were referenced to the carbon c1s line at 284 6 ev the xpspeak software was used for spectrum fitting the fitting parameters including peak positions and full width at half maximum fwhm of the standard samples are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorptive removal of mn ii by pac in the absence of chlorine as shown in fig s1 most of the adsorption of mn ii from aqueous solutions by either coal based or coconut shell pac occurred in the first 10 min and equilibrium was reached within 30 min with increasing amounts of pac 5 10 and 20 mg l adsorptive removal of mn ii was increased accordingly coconut shell pac exhibited relatively higher adsorption capacity for mn ii than coal based pac coal based pac with the concentration of 5 mg l achieved 5 removal of aqueous mn ii by adsorption while coconut shell pac achieved 10 under the same conditions even when the pac doses increased to 20 mg l coal based pac achieved less than 10 and coconut shell pac achieved less than 30 removal of mn ii the physical characteristics including the surface area and pore size did not vary significantly between the two kinds of pac table 1 but instead the number of functional groups did vary significantly between the two pacs the major mechanisms involved in the adsorption of metal ions including mn ii were proposed to be ion exchange and surface complexation akl et al 2013 marzal et al 1996 meena et al 2005 mondal et al 2007 üçer et al 2006 functional groups especially the polar groups such as carboxyl group lactone group and phenolic hydroxyl group on pac surface can serve as binding sites for mn ii and affect mn ii adsorption akl et al 2013 bin jusoh et al 2005 leyva ramos et al 2002 shim et al 2001 wang et al 2010 the less functional groups on coal based pac was thought to be responsible for its lower mn ii adsorption capacity 3 2 pac enhanced oxidative removal of mn ii by chlorine as expected homogeneous mn ii oxidation by chlorine with a concentration of 1 0 mg l within 1 h was almost negligible 2 fig 1 a however the removal of mn ii from the aqueous solutions sharply increased when either coal based pac or coconut shell pac of 5 mg l was added mn ii was almost completely removed from solution with a residual mn concentration less than 5 μg l since the contribution of adsorptive removal of pac had been deducted by starting the chlorine oxidation after the adsorption equilibrium the transformation of mn ii into insoluble mn oxides should have been the main mechanism responsible for the rapid mn ii removal rather than acting as the adsorbent the main role of pac was to accelerate the oxidation of mn ii this oxidation process was assumed to occur heterogeneously on pac surface knocke et al 1991 reported a similar finding in the removal of mn ii by mnox s coated filter media the presence of oxide coating surface could continuously enhance the oxidative removal of mn ii in the presence of chlorine the experimental data revealed that pac played a great enhancement role in mn ii oxidation it could be induced that certain interaction between pac and free manganous ions in aqueous solutions occurred first it was reasonable to hypothesize that soluble mn ii ions were first adsorbed onto the activated carbon and then underwent an oxidation process on pac surface the first adsorption step was critical for starting mn ii oxidation crerar and barnes 1974 coconut shell pac had stronger adsorption capacity for mn ii than coal based pac as shown in fig 1a coconut based pac also exhibited a much better performance than coal based pac in promoting mn ii oxidation thus the adsorption process may play a favorable role in promoting the oxidation process of mn ii in addition mn ii oxidation by chlorine in the presence of coal based and coconut shell pac followed first order kinetics with respect to residual mn ii concentration in the solution with r squared values of 0 990 and 0 985 respectively fig 1b therefore a linear fitting of the natural logarithm of mn ii was used for the description of mn ii oxidation kinetics in this study based on the kinetic data a first order rate law could be simply proposed as 1 d mn ii dt k 1 mn ii where mn ii is the measured concentration of soluble mn ii ions in aqueous solutions k 1 is the observed rate constant for heterogeneous mn ii oxidation on pac surface while homogeneous mn ii oxidation within the duration of this study was negligible according to fig 1 the pac doses no less than 5 mg l of pac to 200 μg l of mn ii in this experiment were assumed to provide sufficient surface sites for mn ii adsorption so that the mn ii oxidation rate was only a function of the soluble mn ii concentration yang et al 2010a investigated the oxidation of multi walled carbon nanotubes by 1 7 naclo and found that oxidized carbon nanotubes had more functional groups on surface in addition there is a possibility that dissolved organic carbon might be released into the liquid phase as a by product during mn ii removal due to carbon oxidation however in this study the ft ir results fig s2 show that compared with the raw pac neither the intensities nor positions of characteristic peaks of pac exhibited an obvious change after treated by chlorine c1s and o1s xps spectra further verified the ft ir results as shown in fig 2 a graphitic carbon indicated by the peak at 284 8 ev and co phenolic alcoholic etheric functional groups indicated by the peaks 285 5 ev and 285 3 ev polovina et al 1997 terzyk 2001 kept the same after the chlorination process as shown in fig 2b oxygens in co at 533 4 ev and 533 1 ev and co in aromatic rings at 531 9 ev and 533 7 ev have no apparent difference between pacs before and after chlorine treatment thus it could be concluded that chlorine dosed in this study could not cause a significant change in the surface characteristics of pac on the other hand the monitoring results of doc see fig s3 showed that the doc release from two kinds of pac either in the absence or in the presence of 1 mg l chlorine was less than 0 5 mg l though an increase of doc concentration was observed in the coconut shell pac system when chlorine was added 3 3 effect of chlorine chlorine was essential electron acceptor for mn ii oxidation in the presence of pac and the effect of its concentration was investigated to reveal whether an increase in the chlorine dose would further accelerate the rate of mn ii oxidation fig 3 for coal based pac the half life of mn ii decreased from 13 26 min to 8 70 min with the increase of the initial chlorine concentration from 1 0 mg l to 2 0 mg l no further increase in mn ii oxidation rate was observed when the chlorine dose was increased to 4 0 mg l for coconut shell pac there was no significant difference in the reaction rate when chlorine concentrations were in the range of 1 0 mg l to 4 0 mg l that is 1 0 mg l of chlorine was sufficient to quickly reduce mn ii ions from 200 μg l to 10 μg l a low chlorine demand will minimize the production of disinfection byproducts gopal et al 2007 as well as the cost of chemicals according to the following equation the stoichiometric requirement for chlorine to transform mn ii to mn iv is 1 29 mass ratio 2 cl2 mn2 2h2o mno2 s 2cl 4h because besides mn ii the consumption of chlorine by other substances such as fe2 and organic matters in natural water was almost unavoidable in the water containing mn ii chlorine doses in this study were in excess of the stoichiometric requirements the effect of pac on chlorine decay was also examined and the results in fig s4 show that compared with the chlorine decay in di water the presence of pac caused much more chlorine consumption this could be caused by the adsorption of free chlorine by pac from liquid phase the oxidation of activated carbon by chlorine can also consume chlorine suidan et al 1977 however as discussed in section 3 2 chlorine did not result in a significant release of doc from pac table s3 shows the chlorine decay during the oxidation of 0 2 mg l mn ii in the presence of pac from fig s4 and table s3 it could be found that chlorine adsorbed by pac was not completely consumed by pac itself instead the adsorbed chlorine was also utilized by mn ii oxidation for mn ii ions adsorbed by pac their oxidation on pac surface required the uptake of free chlorine from liquid phase the consumption of both chlorine and mn ii by pac partly explained why the presence of pac accelerated mn ii oxidation by chlorine 3 4 effect of pac doses the effect of pac doses was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 oxidative removal of aqueous mn ii was greatly increased when the doses of either coal based pac or coconut shell pac were increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l the half life of mn ii dropped to 3 04 min as the coconut shell pac dose increased from 5 to 20 mg l furthermore a good linear relationship between the mn ii oxidation rate and the dose of the two kinds of pac was observed by plotting and fitting the apparent rate constant k obs vs pac doses fig s5 indicating that mn ii oxidation also followed first order kinetics with respect to the pac doses in fact pac concentration is a linear reflection of its surface active site concentration denoted as soh consequently taking into account the impact of pac concentration the rate law 1 would be rewritten as 3 d mn ii dt k 2 soh mn ii 4 k 1 k 2 soh where soh varies from different kinds of pacs it is reasonable to hypothesize that mn ii absorbed by surface site was proportional to surface site concentration and free mn ii ions concentration in solution davies and morgan 1989 thus the concentration of surface mn ii species denoted as smn ii could be described by the following formula when a coefficient k was introduced 5 smn ii k soh mn ii in the absence of chlorine the adsorptive removal of mn ii ions from liquid phase was limited to adsorption equilibrium when adsorption and desorption rate is equal however if chlorine was present it would continuously oxidize mn ii adsorbed on pac surface combining 5 with 3 yields equation 6 revealing that mn ii oxidation rate was essentially determined by the mn ii adsorbed onto pac surface sites 6 d mn ii dt k 2 smn ii k 3 5 effect of temperature a wide range of water temperatures can be encountered in the engineering practice of soluble mn ii removal three typical temperatures 15 c 22 c and 30 c were chosen for the investigation of the effect of solution temperature on the mn ii oxidation rate it is evident from fig 5 that at the lower temperature of 15 c pac together with chlorine still exhibited high efficiency for mn ii removal 3 6 effect of ph the ph of solution has been found to be one of the most important factors influencing mn ii oxidation increasing ph typically greatly increases mn ii oxidation rate hao et al 1991 kessick and morgan 1975 morgan 2005 wilson 1980 however as shown in fig 6 it is intuitively obvious that ph exerted a rather limited effect on mn ii oxidation for both pac systems under weak alkaline conditions ph 7 0 8 5 in weak acidic solutions the influence of ph was somewhat different with a drop in ph from 7 0 to 6 0 the mn ii oxidation rate decreased substantially by 40 for coal based pac while no significant change was observed for coconut shell pac as discussed previously mn ii oxidation rate was directly correlated with pac adsorption capacity for mn ii ions mn ii adsorbed by activated carbon could increase with ph due to the increase of surface complexation sites for free mn ii ions koshima and onishi 1986 however with the same ph change the varying extent of adsorption capacity may differ from different activated carbons koshima and onishi 1986 mondal et al 2007 üçer et al 2006 the adsorption results obtained from the present study see fig s6 showed that when ph decreased from 7 7 to 6 0 the amount of mn ii adsorbed by coal based pac also declined about 25 while the reduction was slight regarding to coconut shell pac which well explained the different effects of ph on different pac mn ii reaction systems 3 7 natural water experiments fig 7 shows the enhancement role of pac in mn ii removal by chlorine under natural water condition mn ii oxidation rate decreased in solutions prepared with natural water compared to that with di water refer to fig 1 it is important to note that there was no significant increase less than 0 1 mg l in chlorine consumption in natural water solutions thus other factors were responsible for the retarding effect of natural water in natural water either coal based pac or coconut shell pac exhibited weaker absorption ability for mn ii fig s7 than in di water this phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of other cations and organics hindering mn ii adsorption by competing for the adsorption sites and chlorine faur brasquet et al 2002 netzer and hughes 1984 for the natural water containing higher concentration of fe ii ions and organics that could also consume chlorine ensuring the removal efficiency of mn ii may require more chlorine dose in water treatment practice 3 8 characterization of mn ii oxidation products fig 8 shows the sem images of pac surface before and after mn ii oxidation in the di water reaction system after chlorine oxidation an apparent coating was formed on pac surface eds elemental analysis fig s8 and fig s9 demonstrated the surface distribution of mn xps fitting results fig 9 a and b show that the mn ii oxidation product formed in the presence of pac was mainly mno2 only a small fraction of mn ii was found in the products with coconut pac added see fig 9b which might result from the adsorption of mn2 ions by mno2 and pac on the other hand the ability of pac to adsorb freshly synthesized colloidal mn oxides from liquid phase was proved to be negligible as shown in fig s8 it was evident that the addition of neither coal based pac nor coconut shell pac led to a significant decrease in colloidal mn concentration suggesting that both kinds of pac were incapable of adsorbing colloidal mn oxides these findings demonstrated that the surface coating of mn oxides was formed from the oxidation of mn ii occurring on pac surface rather than from the precipitation of mno2 that had already formed in homogeneous solutions on pac surface it also explained why the mn oxides formed in the presence of pac could also be completely retained by filter with a diameter as large as 5 0 μm fig s11 because the particle size of pac is typically large as shown in table 1 the formation of mn oxidation products on pac surface made mn more readily be removed by either the sedimentation or filtration process in the water treatment plant 3 9 mechanism discussion according to the frontier molecular orbital theory direct contact and electron transfer between mn ii and o2 are difficult in solutions luther 1990 mn ii oxidation by o2 requires the complexation of mn ii by ligands such as hydroxyl and organic chelates to remove the octahedral structure of aqueous mn ii complex junta and hochella 1994 luther 1990 wilson 1980 the functional groups including hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on pac surface could combine mn ii in liquid phase through complexation mechanism change the original structure of free mn ii ions and activate mn ii pac with more functional groups were found to exhibit higher capacity to complex mn ii ions and accelerate mn ii oxidation through the direct electron transfer pathway in addition the chlorine adsorbed by pac further promoted the electron transfer from mn ii ions to chlorine increasing the solution ph from 6 0 to 8 5 could provide more hydroxyl ligands of 10 5 5 mol l much higher than the amount of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on pac surface however simply increasing ph did not create a similar accelerating effect on mn ii oxidation as adding pac to the solution although not shown here mn ii oxidized in homogeneous solution in 40 min was less than 10 even at ph 8 5 indicating that pac had stronger ability to enhance mn ii oxidation than simply increasing hydroxyl concentration by increasing solution ph this phenomenon also verified the importance of surface complexation of mn ii by functional groups on pac on the other hand carbon and mineral materials were reported to facilitate biological reaction owing to increased electrical conductivity cai and chen 2004 kato et al 2012 the electrical properties of activated carbon allows them to be able to act as an effective mediator in redox reactions to promote interspecies electron transfer chen et al 2014b liu et al 2012 van der zee et al 2003 these studies may help further explain why pac had an excellent performance in catalyzing mn ii oxidation the four probe electrical conductivity of coal based pac and coconut shell pac were measured to be 0 68 and 1 48 s cm respectively proving that pac was a semiconductor yakuphanoglu et al 2008 consistent with other reports that carbon materials including activated carbon were electrically conductive chen et al 2014a elazari et al 2011 kastening et al 1997 liu et al 2012 stüber et al 2005 the semiconductor property of materials provide an interfacial electron transfer channel which requires no direct contact of two reactants yang et al 2010b in solution it was difficult for free mn ii ions and chlorine at low concentrations to contact and exchange electrons with each other however once they were synchronously anchored onto pac surface despite their lack of direct contact the carbon material with electrical conductivity could transfer the electrons released from mn ii the electron donor to the adsorbed chlorine as the terminal electron acceptor this indirect electron transfer pathway was different from the surface complexation aided electron transfer occurring directly between mn ii and oxidants it was shown in this study that coconut shell pac with a higher electrical conductivity than coal based pac exhibited a much better performance in catalyzing mn ii oxidation similarly due to better conductivity iron minerals were reported to have a stronger catalytic effect on mn ii oxidation by oxygen than insulators such as montmorillonite lan et al 2017 based on the two possible mechanisms discussed the interactions between mn ii and chlorine tended to proceed much more rapidly in the presence of pac according to fig 1 the mn oxides formed in the absence of pac was almost negligible when pac was present chlorine and mn ii were both concentrated on pac surface with less reactant residual in homogeneous solutions mn ii oxidation in liquid phase is supposed to be even more insignificant since mno2 coating can be formed on pac surface it could be inferred that the in situ formed mno2 would continue to catalyze the oxidative removal of mn ii junta rosso et al 1997 sung and morgan 1981 if only pac surface is active to catalyze mn ii oxidation then there should form a thin layer of mno2 on pac surface however from the sem images in fig 8 mno2 clusters with certain thickness could be clearly observed which suggests that mn ii oxidation also occurred on mno2 surface the autocatalysis of freshly formed mno2 is beneficial to the continuous removal of mn ii it is interesting to further investigate the difference of catalytic activities between raw pac and pac with surface coated by mno2 regardless of the electron transfer pathways mn ii adsorption onto pac was always necessary for rapid mn ii oxidation which was at least in part influenced by oxygenated functional groups via surface complexation however the properties of specific chemical groups on pac surface were not quantitatively linked with the oxidation rate of mn ii in this study further research is needed to address this issue and to further reveal the mechanisms that determine the catalytic activities of different activated carbon materials 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of two kinds of pacs on mn ii removal efficiency by chlorine oxidation and demonstrated that they dramatically enhanced mn ii removal by catalyzing mn ii oxidation into particulate mn oxides rather than simply through an adsorption mechanism the results showed that the application of only 5 mg l pac and 1 0 mg l chlorine could rapidly reduce mn ii ions from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in tens of minutes first order kinetics were observed with respect to mn ii concentration and pac dose respectively among several potential factors that might influence mn ii oxidation rate the dose of pac had the most significant effect while temperature and ph in the range commonly encountered in natural water bodies did not greatly change mn ii oxidation rate allowing pac highly

18908,chlorine is not effective in the oxidative removal of soluble manganese ii ions at neutral ph powdered activated carbon pac also has a very limited capacity for mn ii removal through adsorption in drinking water treatment practice this study explored the combined use of pac and chlorine for mn ii removal and found that pac dramatically catalyzed mn ii oxidation by chlorine under diverse conditions at a dose as low as 5 0 mg l two different commercial pacs increased mn ii oxidation rate by two orders of magnitude respectively and reduced mn ii concentration from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in tens of minutes first order kinetics with respect to aqueous mn ii concentration were observed typically homogeneous mn ii oxidation by chlorine depends strongly on alkaline ph in the presence of pac however the reaction was still rather fast at ph 6 0 increasing pac doses linearly increased mn ii oxidation rate indicating that the reaction was highly pac surface active sites dependent the efficacy of pac was further corroborated in removing mn ii from natural water sem eds and xps demonstrated that a mno2 coating was formed on pac surface after reaction which resulted from heterogeneous oxidation of mn ii on pac surface rather than the precipitation of mn oxides formed through homogeneous oxidation in solution adsorption of free mn ii ions onto pac surface was proved to directly correlate with mn ii oxidation rate two kinds of electron transfer pathways from adsorbed mn ii species to chlorine enhanced by surface complexation and electrically conductive carbon surface respectively were hypothesized graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese ii oxidation powdered activated carbon chlorine adsorption surface complexation electrical conductivity 1 introduction manganese mn exists in a wide range of natural environments including various kinds of water bodies used as drinking water sources mn that is not sufficiently removed by a water treatment plant enters drinking water distribution systems and undergoes further oxidation deposition and release processes leading to discoloration of tap water li et al 2018 sly et al 1990 compared to particulate mn oxides that could be easily separated from liquids by the water treatment plant the removal of soluble mn ii ions in reduced forms is much more difficult hamilton et al 2013 the application of an oxidant for mn ii oxidation prior to the sedimentation and filtration process is a typical approach to control soluble mn tobiason et al 2016 mn ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen is rather slow and has a half life of years although this process can be accelerated by metal oxides such as hematite lepidocrocite and goethite diem and stumm 1984 kessick and morgan 1975 morgan 2005 due to its low cost easy operation and high security chlorine often dosed in the form of sodium hypochlorite is most frequently used in pre oxidation and disinfection processes for the control of algae ammonia iron manganese and biological growth deborde and von gunten 2008 oliver and shindler 1980 sontheimer 1979 wong 1984 however the slow reaction between mn ii and chlorine makes chlorine inefficient for mn ii oxidation mn ii can be oxidized efficiently by chlorine only under alkaline ph conditions allard et al 2013 knocke et al 1987 without sufficient removal of mn yellow water or black water incidents occur in distribution systems even when effluent mn concentration was as low as 20 μg l sly et al 1990 as can also be supported by the discoloration problems that occurred in several chinese cities when effluent mn concentration was as low as 20 μg l activated carbon has porous structures and large internal surface areas and is often used as an adsorbent pelekani and snoeyink 1999 it has a relatively strong adsorption capacity for heavy metals including pb ii cu ii cd ii hg ii ni ii as iv anirudhan and sreekumari 2011 kadirvelu et al 2001 lorenzen et al 1995 netzer and hughes 1984 the carbon surface has an abundant oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl and lactones groups10 11 that affect its adsorption performance fanning and vannice 1993 pereira et al 2003 rodriguezreinoso et al 1992 moreover activated carbon exhibits catalytic activity for diverse reactions including hydrogenation oxidation polymerization and halogenation chen et al 2014a stüber et al 2005 voudrias et al 1983 1985 the surface oxygen groups of carbon materials act as active sites and play an important role in catalytic reactions figueiredo et al 2007 rodríguez reinoso 1998 for example carbon materials containing carbonyl quinone groups liu et al 2011 and ketonic co groups zhang et al 2008 were reported to serve as metal free catalysts in direct dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen and in oxidative dehydrogenation respectively however the carbon materials received little attention as the redox catalyst for the removal of metals including mn to the best of our knowledge only samblebe 2003 has reported that mn ii oxidation via pre chlorination for 27 min followed by a dose of pac during the flocculation stage can achieve high mn removal rates however the role of pac in the mn removal process was not studied it seemed that pac acted similarly to flocculants because in that case pac was added simultaneously with polyaluminum chloride for the flocculation of the oxidized mn species in this work two different commercial pacs coal based pac and coconut shell pac were used with chlorine for mn ii removal the present study aims to develop a new technique for oxidative removal of mn ii and investigate the role of pac in mn ii oxidation by chlorine and to determine the key aqueous factors that affect mn ii oxidation rate in the presence of pac for practical application all of the aquatic chemical conditions were chosen to simulate the water quality parameters typically encountered in natural mn containing water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents commercially available coal based pac and coconut shell pac used in this research were purchased from ningxia guanghua pac co ltd china the general characteristics of these two pacs are listed in table 1 after the pacs were obtained from the supplier they were purified by washing with deionized water di water with a resistivity 18 2 mω cm until the pac ph was nearly neutral dried at 100 c for 4 h and then made into pac stock suspensions with a concentration of 1 g l with the exception of the pacs all of the reagents used in this research were of analytical grade or higher di water was used to prepare all of the solutions unless otherwise noted the mn ii stock solution with a concentration of 0 5 g l was prepared from mnso4 and it was acidified with h2so4 so that mn ii would be stable during the storage period sodium hypochlorite naclo was used for the preparation of the chlorine stock solution with a concentration of 1 0 g l as cl2 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 mn ii adsorption by pac the experiment was started by mixing a certain amount of pac 5 10 and 20 mg l with mn ii solution in a glass beaker and agitating with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 3 h when adsorption equilibrium was achieved an initial dose of mn ii of 200 μg l was adopted in all the experiments except where otherwise stated this concentration was selected mainly because it is generally close to or higher than the soluble mn ii concentrations most commonly encountered in the source waters causing discoloration issues and is a representative challenging concentration for treatment other experimental conditions included ph 7 7 0 1 nano3 nahco3 0 5 mm t 22 0 5 c o2 open to air 7 8 mg l the amount of adsorbed mn ii was quantified by measuring free mn ii concentration in the filtered solutions oxidation of mn ii by dissolved oxygen was ignored in the adsorption experiments because the experimental time periods were significantly shorter than the half life for the oxidation of mn ii by oxygen 2 2 2 mn ii oxidation experiments all of the mn ii oxidation experiments were conducted in glass beakers open to the room air in duplicate or more nano3 0 5 mm and nahco3 0 5 mm were added to provide a suitable ionic strength and a buffer against a significant change of ph dilute naoh and h2so4 solutions were used to adjust the ph at the start of the experiments under rapid agitation to avoid the sudden increase of local micro area ph additionally the ph was monitored throughout the duration of the experiment and was adjusted with naoh and h2so4 carefully if the deviation from the target ph 7 0 7 7 or 8 5 exceeded 0 1 the temperature was maintained at 22 0 5 c during all of the experiments unless it was adjusted for testing the effect of temperature the chlorine stock solution was dosed slowly into solutions to obtain desired chlorine concentrations 1 0 2 0 or 4 0 mg l and to start the oxidation of mn ii in the ph range 6 9 hocl and clo are the main chlorine species deborde and von gunten 2008 then the mixed solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm and a small aliquot of water sample was withdrawn at an appropriate interval of time in the presence of pac mn ii oxidation was started by the dose of chlorine 20 min after the addition of pac to the mn ii containing solutions when adsorption equilibrium was achieved as shown in fig s1 and the adsorptive removal of mn ii was completed the soluble mn ii concentration measured immediately prior to the addition of chlorine was regarded as the starting concentration of mn ii oxidation by chlorine the initial doses of mn ii were 205 μg l 215 μg l and 230 μg l when the doses of pac were 5 mg l 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively which was designed to achieve a residual mn ii concentration in solution of approximately 200 μg l after the adsorption by pac as chlorine may corrode pac the effect of chlorine on dissolved organic carbon doc release from pac was estimated by comparing doc concentrations before and after the dose of chlorine into pac containing solutions 2 2 3 natural water experiments to test the efficacy of pac for promoting mn oxidation by chlorine mn ii adsorption and oxidation experiments were conducted by preparing solutions with the untreated source water surface water of beijing china after being filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filter the general water quality parameters are listed in table s2 mnso4 and sodium hypochlorite stock solutions were dosed separately to achieve 200 μg l of mn ii and 1 0 mg l of chlorine respectively and ph was adjusted carefully to 7 70 at 22 c the doses of two pacs were both 5 mg l 2 2 4 mn colloid adsorption by pac this experiment the details of which are presented in the supporting information si was designed to examine whether pac would have the ability to adsorb flocculate or precipitate pre formed mn colloids in solution briefly the solution containing mn colloids was prepared by the oxidation of mn ii with chlorine of high concentration then pac was added and the concentration change of colloidal mn was measured to assess whether the colloidal mn was adsorbed or precipitated on pac surface if the precipitation occurred then colloidal mn concentration would decrease because the particle size of pac was much larger than 0 22 μm 2 3 analytical methods to quantify the oxidation or adsorption of mn ii ions the concentration of mn in filtered solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo icap q icp ms after acidized with nitric acid davies and morgan 1989 kessick and morgan 1975 van genuchten and peña 2017 a 10 kda ultrafiltration millipore filter was used to define truly soluble mn ii ions mn colloids were operationally defined as mn oxides that pass through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone filter but are retained by 10 kda filter pan et al 2017 in the presence of pac and chlorine there was no significant difference found between mn concentrations in the samples filtered using 10 kda and 0 22 μm filters indicating the absence of mn colloids in the pac system thus it is feasible to use a 0 22 μm filter instead of a 10 kda filter when the filtration efficiency is taken into account however colloidal mn oxides were formed by mn ii oxidation in the absence of pac making ultrafiltration necessary to distinguish the mn colloids from soluble mn ii in the experiment of mn ii adsorption the 0 22 μm filtration was adopted to measure free mn ii ions in the solution because the pac particle sizes were much greater than 0 22 μm the dpd method was used to measure residual free chlorine in the solution with results presented in mg l as cl2 hach pocket colorimeter ii the ph was measured with a ph meter hach hq 40d after calibration with standard solutions prior to use dissolved organic carbon was measured by a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the bet method was used to determine the surface area and pore size of the raw pac bohem titration was used for the quantification of the oxygen containing functional groups of pac boehm 2002 electrical conductivity measurement was performed on pac using a four point probe fpp method armes et al 1991 wang et al 2019 the fpp device yaos china with four electrodes arranged in linear form in contact with sample surface is connected to a computer allowing rapid and automatic testing of conductivity calculated electrical conductivity was finally displayed by computer because it is possible that the physicochemical properties of pac surface could be changed during chlorination to determine the effect of chlorine on pac surface both the raw pac and the pac treated by chlorine with a ratio of 5 mg l pac to 1 0 mg l chlorine were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir using a kbr pellet transmission method with a bruker vertex 70 spectrometer and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps vg scientific escalab220i xl using the binding energies data in the c1s and o1s regions terzyk 2001 scanning electron microscopy zeiss merlin field emission sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used to observe the surface microstructures of mn ii oxidation products formed in the presence of pac details are presented in the si the chemical states of mn ii oxidation products were determined by xps using the binding energy data in mn3p region to obtain the reference of mn3p peaks three monovalent mn oxides were used as standards for xps analysis cerrato et al 2010 2011 99 pure mno purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china 99 9 pure mn2o3 purchased from sigma aldrich co st louis usa and 99 9 pure mno2 purchased from alfa aesar co ltd shanghai china the binding energies were referenced to the carbon c1s line at 284 6 ev the xpspeak software was used for spectrum fitting the fitting parameters including peak positions and full width at half maximum fwhm of the standard samples are listed in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorptive removal of mn ii by pac in the absence of chlorine as shown in fig s1 most of the adsorption of mn ii from aqueous solutions by either coal based or coconut shell pac occurred in the first 10 min and equilibrium was reached within 30 min with increasing amounts of pac 5 10 and 20 mg l adsorptive removal of mn ii was increased accordingly coconut shell pac exhibited relatively higher adsorption capacity for mn ii than coal based pac coal based pac with the concentration of 5 mg l achieved 5 removal of aqueous mn ii by adsorption while coconut shell pac achieved 10 under the same conditions even when the pac doses increased to 20 mg l coal based pac achieved less than 10 and coconut shell pac achieved less than 30 removal of mn ii the physical characteristics including the surface area and pore size did not vary significantly between the two kinds of pac table 1 but instead the number of functional groups did vary significantly between the two pacs the major mechanisms involved in the adsorption of metal ions including mn ii were proposed to be ion exchange and surface complexation akl et al 2013 marzal et al 1996 meena et al 2005 mondal et al 2007 üçer et al 2006 functional groups especially the polar groups such as carboxyl group lactone group and phenolic hydroxyl group on pac surface can serve as binding sites for mn ii and affect mn ii adsorption akl et al 2013 bin jusoh et al 2005 leyva ramos et al 2002 shim et al 2001 wang et al 2010 the less functional groups on coal based pac was thought to be responsible for its lower mn ii adsorption capacity 3 2 pac enhanced oxidative removal of mn ii by chlorine as expected homogeneous mn ii oxidation by chlorine with a concentration of 1 0 mg l within 1 h was almost negligible 2 fig 1 a however the removal of mn ii from the aqueous solutions sharply increased when either coal based pac or coconut shell pac of 5 mg l was added mn ii was almost completely removed from solution with a residual mn concentration less than 5 μg l since the contribution of adsorptive removal of pac had been deducted by starting the chlorine oxidation after the adsorption equilibrium the transformation of mn ii into insoluble mn oxides should have been the main mechanism responsible for the rapid mn ii removal rather than acting as the adsorbent the main role of pac was to accelerate the oxidation of mn ii this oxidation process was assumed to occur heterogeneously on pac surface knocke et al 1991 reported a similar finding in the removal of mn ii by mnox s coated filter media the presence of oxide coating surface could continuously enhance the oxidative removal of mn ii in the presence of chlorine the experimental data revealed that pac played a great enhancement role in mn ii oxidation it could be induced that certain interaction between pac and free manganous ions in aqueous solutions occurred first it was reasonable to hypothesize that soluble mn ii ions were first adsorbed onto the activated carbon and then underwent an oxidation process on pac surface the first adsorption step was critical for starting mn ii oxidation crerar and barnes 1974 coconut shell pac had stronger adsorption capacity for mn ii than coal based pac as shown in fig 1a coconut based pac also exhibited a much better performance than coal based pac in promoting mn ii oxidation thus the adsorption process may play a favorable role in promoting the oxidation process of mn ii in addition mn ii oxidation by chlorine in the presence of coal based and coconut shell pac followed first order kinetics with respect to residual mn ii concentration in the solution with r squared values of 0 990 and 0 985 respectively fig 1b therefore a linear fitting of the natural logarithm of mn ii was used for the description of mn ii oxidation kinetics in this study based on the kinetic data a first order rate law could be simply proposed as 1 d mn ii dt k 1 mn ii where mn ii is the measured concentration of soluble mn ii ions in aqueous solutions k 1 is the observed rate constant for heterogeneous mn ii oxidation on pac surface while homogeneous mn ii oxidation within the duration of this study was negligible according to fig 1 the pac doses no less than 5 mg l of pac to 200 μg l of mn ii in this experiment were assumed to provide sufficient surface sites for mn ii adsorption so that the mn ii oxidation rate was only a function of the soluble mn ii concentration yang et al 2010a investigated the oxidation of multi walled carbon nanotubes by 1 7 naclo and found that oxidized carbon nanotubes had more functional groups on surface in addition there is a possibility that dissolved organic carbon might be released into the liquid phase as a by product during mn ii removal due to carbon oxidation however in this study the ft ir results fig s2 show that compared with the raw pac neither the intensities nor positions of characteristic peaks of pac exhibited an obvious change after treated by chlorine c1s and o1s xps spectra further verified the ft ir results as shown in fig 2 a graphitic carbon indicated by the peak at 284 8 ev and co phenolic alcoholic etheric functional groups indicated by the peaks 285 5 ev and 285 3 ev polovina et al 1997 terzyk 2001 kept the same after the chlorination process as shown in fig 2b oxygens in co at 533 4 ev and 533 1 ev and co in aromatic rings at 531 9 ev and 533 7 ev have no apparent difference between pacs before and after chlorine treatment thus it could be concluded that chlorine dosed in this study could not cause a significant change in the surface characteristics of pac on the other hand the monitoring results of doc see fig s3 showed that the doc release from two kinds of pac either in the absence or in the presence of 1 mg l chlorine was less than 0 5 mg l though an increase of doc concentration was observed in the coconut shell pac system when chlorine was added 3 3 effect of chlorine chlorine was essential electron acceptor for mn ii oxidation in the presence of pac and the effect of its concentration was investigated to reveal whether an increase in the chlorine dose would further accelerate the rate of mn ii oxidation fig 3 for coal based pac the half life of mn ii decreased from 13 26 min to 8 70 min with the increase of the initial chlorine concentration from 1 0 mg l to 2 0 mg l no further increase in mn ii oxidation rate was observed when the chlorine dose was increased to 4 0 mg l for coconut shell pac there was no significant difference in the reaction rate when chlorine concentrations were in the range of 1 0 mg l to 4 0 mg l that is 1 0 mg l of chlorine was sufficient to quickly reduce mn ii ions from 200 μg l to 10 μg l a low chlorine demand will minimize the production of disinfection byproducts gopal et al 2007 as well as the cost of chemicals according to the following equation the stoichiometric requirement for chlorine to transform mn ii to mn iv is 1 29 mass ratio 2 cl2 mn2 2h2o mno2 s 2cl 4h because besides mn ii the consumption of chlorine by other substances such as fe2 and organic matters in natural water was almost unavoidable in the water containing mn ii chlorine doses in this study were in excess of the stoichiometric requirements the effect of pac on chlorine decay was also examined and the results in fig s4 show that compared with the chlorine decay in di water the presence of pac caused much more chlorine consumption this could be caused by the adsorption of free chlorine by pac from liquid phase the oxidation of activated carbon by chlorine can also consume chlorine suidan et al 1977 however as discussed in section 3 2 chlorine did not result in a significant release of doc from pac table s3 shows the chlorine decay during the oxidation of 0 2 mg l mn ii in the presence of pac from fig s4 and table s3 it could be found that chlorine adsorbed by pac was not completely consumed by pac itself instead the adsorbed chlorine was also utilized by mn ii oxidation for mn ii ions adsorbed by pac their oxidation on pac surface required the uptake of free chlorine from liquid phase the consumption of both chlorine and mn ii by pac partly explained why the presence of pac accelerated mn ii oxidation by chlorine 3 4 effect of pac doses the effect of pac doses was investigated and the results are shown in fig 4 oxidative removal of aqueous mn ii was greatly increased when the doses of either coal based pac or coconut shell pac were increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l the half life of mn ii dropped to 3 04 min as the coconut shell pac dose increased from 5 to 20 mg l furthermore a good linear relationship between the mn ii oxidation rate and the dose of the two kinds of pac was observed by plotting and fitting the apparent rate constant k obs vs pac doses fig s5 indicating that mn ii oxidation also followed first order kinetics with respect to the pac doses in fact pac concentration is a linear reflection of its surface active site concentration denoted as soh consequently taking into account the impact of pac concentration the rate law 1 would be rewritten as 3 d mn ii dt k 2 soh mn ii 4 k 1 k 2 soh where soh varies from different kinds of pacs it is reasonable to hypothesize that mn ii absorbed by surface site was proportional to surface site concentration and free mn ii ions concentration in solution davies and morgan 1989 thus the concentration of surface mn ii species denoted as smn ii could be described by the following formula when a coefficient k was introduced 5 smn ii k soh mn ii in the absence of chlorine the adsorptive removal of mn ii ions from liquid phase was limited to adsorption equilibrium when adsorption and desorption rate is equal however if chlorine was present it would continuously oxidize mn ii adsorbed on pac surface combining 5 with 3 yields equation 6 revealing that mn ii oxidation rate was essentially determined by the mn ii adsorbed onto pac surface sites 6 d mn ii dt k 2 smn ii k 3 5 effect of temperature a wide range of water temperatures can be encountered in the engineering practice of soluble mn ii removal three typical temperatures 15 c 22 c and 30 c were chosen for the investigation of the effect of solution temperature on the mn ii oxidation rate it is evident from fig 5 that at the lower temperature of 15 c pac together with chlorine still exhibited high efficiency for mn ii removal 3 6 effect of ph the ph of solution has been found to be one of the most important factors influencing mn ii oxidation increasing ph typically greatly increases mn ii oxidation rate hao et al 1991 kessick and morgan 1975 morgan 2005 wilson 1980 however as shown in fig 6 it is intuitively obvious that ph exerted a rather limited effect on mn ii oxidation for both pac systems under weak alkaline conditions ph 7 0 8 5 in weak acidic solutions the influence of ph was somewhat different with a drop in ph from 7 0 to 6 0 the mn ii oxidation rate decreased substantially by 40 for coal based pac while no significant change was observed for coconut shell pac as discussed previously mn ii oxidation rate was directly correlated with pac adsorption capacity for mn ii ions mn ii adsorbed by activated carbon could increase with ph due to the increase of surface complexation sites for free mn ii ions koshima and onishi 1986 however with the same ph change the varying extent of adsorption capacity may differ from different activated carbons koshima and onishi 1986 mondal et al 2007 üçer et al 2006 the adsorption results obtained from the present study see fig s6 showed that when ph decreased from 7 7 to 6 0 the amount of mn ii adsorbed by coal based pac also declined about 25 while the reduction was slight regarding to coconut shell pac which well explained the different effects of ph on different pac mn ii reaction systems 3 7 natural water experiments fig 7 shows the enhancement role of pac in mn ii removal by chlorine under natural water condition mn ii oxidation rate decreased in solutions prepared with natural water compared to that with di water refer to fig 1 it is important to note that there was no significant increase less than 0 1 mg l in chlorine consumption in natural water solutions thus other factors were responsible for the retarding effect of natural water in natural water either coal based pac or coconut shell pac exhibited weaker absorption ability for mn ii fig s7 than in di water this phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of other cations and organics hindering mn ii adsorption by competing for the adsorption sites and chlorine faur brasquet et al 2002 netzer and hughes 1984 for the natural water containing higher concentration of fe ii ions and organics that could also consume chlorine ensuring the removal efficiency of mn ii may require more chlorine dose in water treatment practice 3 8 characterization of mn ii oxidation products fig 8 shows the sem images of pac surface before and after mn ii oxidation in the di water reaction system after chlorine oxidation an apparent coating was formed on pac surface eds elemental analysis fig s8 and fig s9 demonstrated the surface distribution of mn xps fitting results fig 9 a and b show that the mn ii oxidation product formed in the presence of pac was mainly mno2 only a small fraction of mn ii was found in the products with coconut pac added see fig 9b which might result from the adsorption of mn2 ions by mno2 and pac on the other hand the ability of pac to adsorb freshly synthesized colloidal mn oxides from liquid phase was proved to be negligible as shown in fig s8 it was evident that the addition of neither coal based pac nor coconut shell pac led to a significant decrease in colloidal mn concentration suggesting that both kinds of pac were incapable of adsorbing colloidal mn oxides these findings demonstrated that the surface coating of mn oxides was formed from the oxidation of mn ii occurring on pac surface rather than from the precipitation of mno2 that had already formed in homogeneous solutions on pac surface it also explained why the mn oxides formed in the presence of pac could also be completely retained by filter with a diameter as large as 5 0 μm fig s11 because the particle size of pac is typically large as shown in table 1 the formation of mn oxidation products on pac surface made mn more readily be removed by either the sedimentation or filtration process in the water treatment plant 3 9 mechanism discussion according to the frontier molecular orbital theory direct contact and electron transfer between mn ii and o2 are difficult in solutions luther 1990 mn ii oxidation by o2 requires the complexation of mn ii by ligands such as hydroxyl and organic chelates to remove the octahedral structure of aqueous mn ii complex junta and hochella 1994 luther 1990 wilson 1980 the functional groups including hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on pac surface could combine mn ii in liquid phase through complexation mechanism change the original structure of free mn ii ions and activate mn ii pac with more functional groups were found to exhibit higher capacity to complex mn ii ions and accelerate mn ii oxidation through the direct electron transfer pathway in addition the chlorine adsorbed by pac further promoted the electron transfer from mn ii ions to chlorine increasing the solution ph from 6 0 to 8 5 could provide more hydroxyl ligands of 10 5 5 mol l much higher than the amount of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on pac surface however simply increasing ph did not create a similar accelerating effect on mn ii oxidation as adding pac to the solution although not shown here mn ii oxidized in homogeneous solution in 40 min was less than 10 even at ph 8 5 indicating that pac had stronger ability to enhance mn ii oxidation than simply increasing hydroxyl concentration by increasing solution ph this phenomenon also verified the importance of surface complexation of mn ii by functional groups on pac on the other hand carbon and mineral materials were reported to facilitate biological reaction owing to increased electrical conductivity cai and chen 2004 kato et al 2012 the electrical properties of activated carbon allows them to be able to act as an effective mediator in redox reactions to promote interspecies electron transfer chen et al 2014b liu et al 2012 van der zee et al 2003 these studies may help further explain why pac had an excellent performance in catalyzing mn ii oxidation the four probe electrical conductivity of coal based pac and coconut shell pac were measured to be 0 68 and 1 48 s cm respectively proving that pac was a semiconductor yakuphanoglu et al 2008 consistent with other reports that carbon materials including activated carbon were electrically conductive chen et al 2014a elazari et al 2011 kastening et al 1997 liu et al 2012 stüber et al 2005 the semiconductor property of materials provide an interfacial electron transfer channel which requires no direct contact of two reactants yang et al 2010b in solution it was difficult for free mn ii ions and chlorine at low concentrations to contact and exchange electrons with each other however once they were synchronously anchored onto pac surface despite their lack of direct contact the carbon material with electrical conductivity could transfer the electrons released from mn ii the electron donor to the adsorbed chlorine as the terminal electron acceptor this indirect electron transfer pathway was different from the surface complexation aided electron transfer occurring directly between mn ii and oxidants it was shown in this study that coconut shell pac with a higher electrical conductivity than coal based pac exhibited a much better performance in catalyzing mn ii oxidation similarly due to better conductivity iron minerals were reported to have a stronger catalytic effect on mn ii oxidation by oxygen than insulators such as montmorillonite lan et al 2017 based on the two possible mechanisms discussed the interactions between mn ii and chlorine tended to proceed much more rapidly in the presence of pac according to fig 1 the mn oxides formed in the absence of pac was almost negligible when pac was present chlorine and mn ii were both concentrated on pac surface with less reactant residual in homogeneous solutions mn ii oxidation in liquid phase is supposed to be even more insignificant since mno2 coating can be formed on pac surface it could be inferred that the in situ formed mno2 would continue to catalyze the oxidative removal of mn ii junta rosso et al 1997 sung and morgan 1981 if only pac surface is active to catalyze mn ii oxidation then there should form a thin layer of mno2 on pac surface however from the sem images in fig 8 mno2 clusters with certain thickness could be clearly observed which suggests that mn ii oxidation also occurred on mno2 surface the autocatalysis of freshly formed mno2 is beneficial to the continuous removal of mn ii it is interesting to further investigate the difference of catalytic activities between raw pac and pac with surface coated by mno2 regardless of the electron transfer pathways mn ii adsorption onto pac was always necessary for rapid mn ii oxidation which was at least in part influenced by oxygenated functional groups via surface complexation however the properties of specific chemical groups on pac surface were not quantitatively linked with the oxidation rate of mn ii in this study further research is needed to address this issue and to further reveal the mechanisms that determine the catalytic activities of different activated carbon materials 4 conclusions this study investigated the effect of two kinds of pacs on mn ii removal efficiency by chlorine oxidation and demonstrated that they dramatically enhanced mn ii removal by catalyzing mn ii oxidation into particulate mn oxides rather than simply through an adsorption mechanism the results showed that the application of only 5 mg l pac and 1 0 mg l chlorine could rapidly reduce mn ii ions from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in tens of minutes first order kinetics were observed with respect to mn ii concentration and pac dose respectively among several potential factors that might influence mn ii oxidation rate

anammox activities in the past especially in regions that were strongly affected by human activities evidenced by eutrophication and hypoxia which promote anammox bacteria growth in this study ladderanes have been measured in a sediment core and suspended particulate matter spm in the east china sea ecs to reconstruct the anammox record and to evaluate its responses to eutrophication and

phytoplankton hypoxia 1 introduction nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for primary biological production in the ocean and its cycle is closely related to biological co2 sequestration by a series of feedback loops arrigo 2005 denitrification processes have been considered the predominant pathway for nitrogen loss n loss in the marine nitrogen circle however in past decades studies have shown that anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria which oxidize nitrite in ammonium into dinitrogen have also played an important role in the marine nitrogen cycle especially in anoxic basins and oxygen minimum zones omzs dagmar et al 2008 galán et al 2009 kuypers et al 2003 2005 lam et al 2009 stewart et al 2012 in fact anammox was proposed to be the dominant process of n loss in some omzs hamersley et al 2007 kuypers et al 2005 hypoxia zones in coastal oceans have increased recently because of the enhanced nutrient loading which leads to eutrophication as a result of population growth and land use changes diaz and rosenberg 2008 coastal hypoxia has altered natural redox conditions of the marine environment and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles bianchi and allison 2009 turner et al 2008 coastal oceans are important sites of nitrogen biogeochemical cycling dahnke et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 and hypothesized to be hot spots for anammox processes as oxygen depletion or low oxygen levels are deemed to be key environmental factors for anammox jaeschke et al 2009a 2009b rush et al 2012 frequent hypoxia in coastal areas as a result of excessive input of anthropogenic nutrients is proposed to lead to an increase in anammox activity changes in anammox activities can be studied using ladderanes as they are membrane lipids unique to anammox bacteria with 3 5 concatenated cyclobutane moieties as the core structures fig 1 sinninghe damsté et al 2002 they have been proven to be useful indicators for the presence of anammox bacteria in the water columns hamersley et al 2007 brandsma et al

biomarkers for reflecting the presence and past variations in anammox bacteria jaeschke et al 2009a the east china sea ecs is a river dominated shelf sea fig 2 with major discharge from the changjiang river which is the world s fourth largest river owing to large amounts of terrestrial organic matter om inputs and high primary productivity the ecs is an important reservoir of sedimentary om burial both terrestrial and marine om have been mainly trapped in the inner shelf of the ecs as a result of the net effects of shear forces from shelf currents e g china coastal current the taiwan warm current and the kuroshio current liu et al 2007 high primary production and hydrographic conditions e g stratification are the main contributing factors to low oxygen levels in near bottom water in this region wei et al 2007 li et al 2002 one of the largest coastal hypoxia zones in the world 2 4 104 km2 is located in the changjiang river yangtze estuary and its adjacent shelf area chen et al 2007 gu 1980 tian et al 1993 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 li et al 2002 large amounts of nutrients and om from the terrestrial environment are transported into the ecs through the changjiang river nutrient inputs have doubled in the past three decades partly due to the low oxygen conditions in the changjiang estuary region wei et al 2007 zhang et al 1999 2007 and have altered the nitrogen cycle recently the distribution biodiversity and abundance of anammox bacteria communities in the water column and sediments around the changjiang estuary have been reported using molecular methods hou et al 2013 based on 15n tracer experiments it has been estimated that anammox processes have contributed 6 6 12 9 of the total n loss hou et al 2013 much lower than those from other omzs but higher than that from the pearl river estuary 0 5 7 0 wang et al 2012b ladderanes have also been used to study anammox processes in the changjiang estuary and the ecs first the close relationship between high ladderane contents in suspended particles and low dissolved oxygen hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 have indicated that anammox bacteria and ladderanes in the changjiang estuary were mainly produced in situ in the water column and not transported from terrestrial environments or through sediment re suspension hu et al 2016 secondly these studies all showed that ladderanes are potential proxies for studying hypoxia history in this region hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 finally the ubiquity of anammox and the corresponding ladderanes in the ecs in both suspended particles and surface sediments also proved the important role of anammox in the nitrogen cycle hou et al 2013 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 but little is known about the past anammox activity and its relation with eutrophication in this region in this study ladderane lipids were measured in suspended particulate matter spm from three locations and in a sediment core spanning the last century from the inner shelf of the ecs in conjunction with marine and terrestrial biomarkers of brassicasterol b dinosterol d c37 alkenones a and archaea and bacteria biomarkers crenarchaeol and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers gdgts ladderane records are used to reconstruct changes in past anammox activities to establish the relationship between eutrophication hypoxia and anammox and to evaluate the potential of using ladderane records to reconstruct hypoxia events or oxygen levels in the ecs 2 materials and methods 2 1 oceanographic setting and core location box core t06 122 40 248 e 29 29 975 n water depth 48 8 m fig 2 was recovered in the spring of 2011 during a 973 program cruise on r v dongfanghong2 of the ocean university of china ouc the core is 56 cm in length and the sediment generally consisted of homogeneous dark greenish to light greenish gray hemipelagic muds the core was stored upright at 4 c during transport to the laboratory and then it was sectioned at 1 cm intervals all sections were then freeze dried homogenized and stored at 20 c until analysis spm of three sites 22 32 44 in the inner shelf of the ecs were collected in august 2011 during a cruise to the zhejiang fujian mud area on r v yunjiang1 fig 2 for each site three samples were obtained from the surface intermediate and bottom waters respectively all spm samples were collected by pumping seawater to large bottles onboard and the water was subsequently filtered with glass fiber filters 0 45 μm after collection the samples were stored at 4 c during transport to the laboratory then they were freeze dried homogenized and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 2 sediment core dating the sediment dating method was adopted from huh and su 1999 the method uses alpha spectrometry and assumes an equilibrium between 210pb and 210po about 0 5 g of each sediment sample was weighed and placed in a teflon beaker then 209po with known activity was spiked into the sediment sample in the presence of 209po as a yield monitor 210po was extracted from the sediment with hot hno3 and hclo4 the sediment sample was dissolved by the acids on a hot plate overnight if the solution contained tiny solids mainly quartz then it was transferred into a centrifuge tube to separate the solids and then the solids were discarded the supernatant containing 210po and 209po was placed into the teflon beaker and evaporated to dryness then the residue was converted into a chloride salt with 6 ml concentrated hcl and the solution was evaporated to dryness again to remove any hno3 afterwards the residue was dissolved by 10 ml 1n hcl and transferred into a centrifuge tube ascorbic acid was added into the solution to combine fe ions po was self plated onto silver discs overnight at room temperature the silver disc was placed into the vacuum chamber of the alpha counter which is an ortec system for po counting below 40 cm depth the 210pb activity was relatively constant which means that below this depth 226ra and 210pb reached secular equilibrium the average 210pb activity below this depth is considered as the supported 210pb activity the unsupported excess 210pb activity was calculated by subtracting the supported 210pb activity from total 210pb activity the exponential fitting of the excess 210pb activity with the sediment depth provides an average linear sedimentation rate of 0 5 cm yr based on the sampling time in 2011 the sedimentary history spanned from 1898 ce to 2011 ce although 1 cm sampling interval has an average resolution of 0 5 years the 210pb dating assumed a linear constant accumulation rate with about 5 uncertainty therefore the accuracy of the chronology of the core is less than the annual scale 2 3 analysis of ladderane lipids the method of ladderane analysis is adapted from a previous study hopmans et al 2006 typically 10 g of sediments were ultrasonically extracted using dichloromethane dcm methanol 3 1 v v the elemental sulfur in the extracts was removed using activated copper powder overnight after saponification the neutral lipids were directly collected under basic conditions ph 13 using hexane the remaining fatty acids were collected using hexane after adjusting the residue to acidic conditions ph 3 and then converted to fatty acid methyl esters fames using a bf3 methanol 20 solution then the two fractions were combined transferred into methanol solutions and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter 0 45 μm pore size 4 mm diameter prior to instrumental analysis all the extracts were spiked with an internal standard is of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone both qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer tandem mass spectrometer hplc ms ms since ladderane lipid standards are not available commercially all ladderane contents data were normalized and are given here as relative amounts normalization was accomplished by comparing the signals of ladderanes with the internal standards 2 4 analysis of phytoplankton biomarkers and gdgts analysis of phytoplankton biomarkers follows procedures previously established in our laboratory xing et al 2011a approximately 2 g of samples spiked with an is mixture containing c19 n alkanol and c24 deuterium substituted n alkane were ultrasonically extracted with dcm methanol 3 1 v v after hydrolysis with 6 koh in methanol the solutions containing biomarkers were extracted with n hexane and fractionated using a silica gel column the neutral fraction eluted with dcm methanol 95 5 v v was derived using n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa and then used for analyzing brassicasterol dinosterol and alkenones quantification was performed on gas chromatography gc with flame ionization detection gc fid agilent 6890n coupled with an hp 1 capillary column 50 m 0 32 mm i d 0 17 mm film thickness j w scientific all these three biomarkers were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms branched gdgts and creanarchaeol analysis follows a previous protocol xing et al 2014 which was adopted from a published method schouten et al 2007 and was also inter calibrated with other laboratories schouten et al 2013 about 5 g of samples spiked with c46gdgt were ultrasonically extracted with methanol twice with dcm methanol 1 1 v v twice and finally with dcm twice then the combined extracts were dehydrated and fractionated with anhydrous na2so4 and alumina respectively the polar fractions eluted with dcm methanol 1 1 v v were concentrated for further analysis on an agilent 1200 series hplc agilent technologies palo alto ca coupled with a waters quattro ultima ms waters corp new jersey us a prevail cyano column 150 mm 2 1 mm and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci were employed for separation and mass spectrometric detection respectively the identified ions were m h with m z of 1292 for creanarchaeol 1050 1036 and 1022 for branched gdgts and 744 for c46gdgt 2 5 calculation of synthesis temperature of ladderanes in core t06 according to rattray s reports rattray et al 2010 the membrane composition of anammox bacteria is temperature dependent i e ratio of shorter chain ladderanes relative to that of longer chain increases at lower temperatures and the change mainly takes place between 12 and 20 c while there is no significant change beyond this temperature range the variation between the membrane composition and the synthesis temperature can be expressed with the following two equations containing nl5 index 1 n l 5 c 20 5 fatty acid c 18 5 fatty acid c 20 5 fatty acid 2 n l 5 0 2 0 7 1 e temp 16 0 1 6 where c20 5 fatty acid and c18 5 fatty acid are the contents of these two ladderanes and temp is the temperature when ladderanes are synthesized by anammox bacteria this relationship between nl5 and temperature has not been well calibrated here we use it to estimate a range of temperature in order to evaluate ladderane origins 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and origins of ladderanes in the ecs all known ladderanes except monoether v have been detected in the samples from core t06 fig 3 their summed contents σ i ii iii iv ranged from 11 to 300 ng g dw mean 59 ng g dw fig 4 b higher than those in sediments from the irish sea 7 5 53 ng g sediment the celtic sea 1 33 ng g sediment jaeschke et al 2009b and the arabian sea 0 3 5 3 ng g jaeschke et al 2009c and continental shelf and slope sediments off northwest africa 0 3 97 ng g sediment jaeschke et al 2010 the dominant ladderane lipid in our samples was c20 5 ladderane fame iii 5 150 ng g dw followed by c20 3 ladderane fame iv 0 9 110 ng g dw c18 3 ladderane fame ii 0 9 32 ng g dw and c18 5 ladderane fame i 3 11 ng g dw fig 3 in comparison with other reports of predominant ladderanes there are obvious regional differences for example it was c18 5 ladderane fame i in shelf and slope sediments off northwest africa jaeschke et al 2010 c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c18 5 ladderane fame i in the arabian sea rush et al 2012 c20 3 monoether in the celtic and irish sea jaeschke et al 2009b c18 3 ladderane fame ii in an enriched peat soil hu et al 2011 and c20 5 ladderane fame iii in the upper sediments soils from a riparian zone of the seine estuary france naeher et al 2015 however the dominance of c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c20 3 ladderane fame iv in the sediments from the ecs is in accordance with their distributions in spm from the changjiang estuary 46 58 and 16 30 respectively hu et al 2016 the ladderanes in spm from the changjiang estuary are proposed to be produced in the water column and not from terrestrial environments or from sediment re suspension by correction analysis with marine and terrestrial biomarkers hu et al 2016 based on this result it can be concluded that the sediment ladderanes in the ecs were also likely from water column production by anammox bacteria in order to further identify the origins of sediment ladderanes spm samples from the bottom intermediate and surface water depth at sites of 22 32 and 44 were also analyzed table 1 c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c20 3 ladderane fame iv are the two predominant compounds broadly similar to previous results from the changjiang estuary in both spring and summer where these two ladderanes showed the highest contents in almost all the samples hu et al 2016 at site 22 and 32 higher contents of ladderanes mainly appeared in the surface and bottom water while higher values appeared in the intermediate layer at site 44 these spatial and depth variations do not provide sufficient evidence for water column production as the only source of ladderanes but they do suggest water column production as a major source based on the spm samples from the changjiang estuary and the ecs we cautiously suggested that ladderanes in the ecs were mostly from water column production beyond that synthesis temperatures 16 22 c from the nl5 index 0 52 0 95 of sedimental ladderanes in core t06 fig 3e were comparable to the mean water temperatures in this sea region 16 c in winter and 21 c in summer wang et al 2012a providing additional evidence that sediment ladderanes were produced in the water column based on the results using the nl5 index a previous study also proposed that surface sediment ladderanes near the changjiang estuary were mainly from the water column zhao et al 2013 therein both the frequent detections of large amounts of ladderanes in spm and the comparable calculated synthesis temperatures suggested that ladderanes at core t06 are to a large extent derived from the water column hu et al 2016 jaeschke et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 3 2 variation of past anammox activities reflected by ladderanes the summed contents of ladderanes fluctuated at relatively low levels before the 1960s and then began to increase significantly up to 2011 fig 4b overall the increasing period can be divided into three intervals namely 1960 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 generally recently deposited ladderanes in sediment top layers can undergo further degradation than those buried in the lower layers thus it would lead to overestimation of anammox activities in the top layers by using σ i ii iii iv contents mainly owing to higher oxygen content in the shadow sediment layers the rate and degree of om degradation are much higher than that in the slightly deeper sediment layers zimmerman and canuel 2000 correspondingly total organic carbon toc content often presents a gradual attenuation from top to bottom layers to minimize the digenetic effect toc normalized σ i ii iii iv contents have also been presented in this study compared with the slow increment trend of toc fig 4a in the last century the pattern of toc normalized σ i ii iii iv fig 4b still presented a very similar tendency to σ i ii iii iv content this indicated that ladderane variations were not dominated by preservation but likely reflected input changes from the water column which showed an increasing trend over the last 50 years the detection of ladderanes in sediments presented the ubiquity of past anammox in the ecs during the last century before the 1960s the intensity of anammox was relatively stable at low levels after 1960 anammox presented a rapidly increasing trend especially since 1980 the period of enhanced anammox activity corresponded to the rapid economic development in china during this period large amounts of nutrients have been discharged into the ecs and led to eutrophication as well as hypoxia near the changjiang estuary the recent trend of rising σ i ii iii iv implies that anammox might have been further enhanced and that hypoxia has increased in the ecs as for nitrogen cycle implications previous investigations using 15n tracer techniques have revealed that anammox only contributed 6 6 12 9 of the total fixed nitrogen loss in the ecs hou et al 2013 much lower than that in other omzs over the world nevertheless our results still indicated that n loss via anammox has increased several fold during the last century and could play a more important role in coastal ocean nitrogen circle in the future 3 3 linkage between anammox eutrophication and hypoxia major controlling factors for anammox intensities include nutrient supplies nh4 and no2 rush et al 2012 primary productivity jaeschke et al 2009c and the extent of dissolved oxygen depletion jaeschke et al 2009c rush et al 2012 recently the changjiang estuary and its adjacent regions have been characterized by increased eutrophication with large amounts of nutrient and om inputs increasing primary productivities and enhanced oxygen depletion wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 thus eutrophication should be closely related to anammox in the ecs brassicasterol b dinosterol d and c37 alkenones a are often used to reflect the biomass productivity of diatoms dinoflagellates and coccolithophorids respectively in the euphotic layer schubert et al 1998 xing et al 2011b zhao et al 2006 it should be pointed out that brassicasterol is not a good biomarker for diatoms as this compound only occurs in a selected group of diatoms rampen et al 2010 but it can be produced by other phytoplankton however in diatom dominated ecosystems such as upwelling regions and coastal oceans brassicasterol could still be used for diatom productivity reconstruction wu et al 2016 or it can be used as a general phytoplankton lipid rather than a diatom specific marker thus the total contents of these three biomarkers σ b d a have been used as an indicator of primary productivity because of the domination of the three phytoplankton in the ecs fan et al 2014 guo et al 2011 yang et al 2004 here σ b d a is also used to partly reflect eutrophication as a result of the close relationship between enhanced eutrophication and increasing primary productivities in the ecs wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 loliolide a diagenetic product of pigment fucoxanthin is a more specific biomarker for diatoms schefuβ et al 2004 but this compound was not measured in our samples future studies should include loliolide as a diatom productivity indicator to evaluate the relationship between productivity and eutrophication the down core variations of both σ i ii iii iv and σ b d a presented a similar trend with small fluctuations before 1960 and then a rapid increase especially after 1980 fig 4b and c their increasing trends are also consistent with the increasing trends of phytoplankton pigments and nutrient loads in the changjiang river in the past decades li et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 the significant positive correlation between σ i ii iii iv and σ b d a r 0 928 p 0 01 indicated that enhanced anammox processes can be partly attributed to the increased primary productivities jaeschke et al 2009c as the oxidation of om from marine productivity is the primary chemical reaction for dissolved oxygen consumption and an important source of anammox substrates of nh4 and no2 in the marine environment planktonic archaea thaumarchaeota ubiquitously distributed in marine environments delong 1998 fuhrman et al 1992 massana et al 2000 as well as in lakes casamayor and borrego 2009 keough et al 2003 schleper et al 1997 can not only oxidize ammonium to nitrite and thus compete for ammonium but also supplies anammox bacteria with nitrite coolen et al 2007 lam et al 2007 its major membrane lipid of crenarchaeol is specific for nitrifying archaea belonging to thaumarchaeota sinninghe damsté et al 2002 de la torre et al 2008 pitcher et al 2010 branched gdgts are another important class of biomarkers for heterotrophic microorganisms living in an anoxic environment especially in terrestrial environments liu et al 2010 weijers et al 2006 2009 both crenarchaeol and branched gdgts presented similar trends to that of σ i ii iii iv fluctuating in the early part of the 20th century followed by a rapid increase since the 1950s fig 4d and e the significant correlations between the three indicators r 0 894 p 0 01 suggested that there were close relationships among anammox bacteria thaumarchaeota and heterotrophic microorganisms living in an anoxic environment the co variation of crenarchaeol and branched gdgts r 0 997 p 0 01 was consistent with most of the previous results from globally distributed marine and freshwater archives fietz et al 2012 branched gdgts are not exclusively from terrestrial origin but can also be produced in situ in marine environments sinninghe damsté et al 2016 though thaumarchaeota and anammox bacteria may occupy different niches in the water column pitcher et al 2011 sollai et al 2015 therefore our co variation results indicated that quite a few of these lipids may be from the possible autochthonous production by thaumarchaeota and anoxic heterotrophic microorganisms the possible co existence of thaumarchaeota and anammox bacteria has also been revealed by their co variation in other regions such as in the omzs off northern chile galán et al 2009 off peru lam et al 2009 the benguela upwelling system kuypers et al 2005 and the suboxic zone of the black sea lam et al 2007 in the changjiang estuary and its adjacent region frequent occurrences of eutrophication often lead to algal blooms low dissolved oxygen and the sufficient supply of ammonium and nitrite for the growth of anammox bacteria and thaumarchaeota hence these results indicated that the enhanced anammox in the past century was likely to be the microbial community response to increased eutrophication recent field surveys have revealed dramatic increases in hypoxic events in the near bottom water off the changjiang estuary zhu et al 2011 li et al 2002 but the long term record of hypoxia near the changjiang estuary was not available due to the lack of continuous data however the historical trends of hypoxia have been reconstructed using microfossils in sediment cores li et al 2011 the increase of low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossils revealed an increase in the number of hypoxic events over the past 60 years recently the abundance of anammox bacteria has also been proposed to be closely related to lower dissolved oxygen content engström et al 2005 jaeschke et al 2007 2009b thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and this novel method was also applied to the changjiang estuary zhao et al 2013 generally the low oxygen content is considered to favor the growth of anammox bacteria and can thus lead to enhanced anammox activities however there were reports of the existence of anammox bacteria abundances in surface waters which could be interpreted by the formation of microaerophilic and anaerobic microenvironments which could support the growth of anammox pitcher et al 2011 podlaska et al 2012 this could be one possible explanation for the detection of ladderanes in surface waters of the changjiang estuary alternatively vertical mixing in this shallow environment could have brought some ladderanes from deeper water to the surface both hypotheses can be studied and verified in future studies in order to study the linkage between ladderane and hypoxia our ladderane record fig 4b was compared with that of the density of low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossils from core 2006 122 711 e 30 937 n and core 2007 122 689 e 31 357 n fig 4f li et al 2011 and the summer hypoxia area by modern surveys fig 4g chen et al 2007 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 office of integrated oceanographic survey of china 1961 li et al 2002 both σ i ii iii iv fig 4b and foraminiferal density fig 4f presented a dramatically increasing trend after the 1940s coincident with frequent hypoxia events such as in 1959 the 1980s and after 2000 fig 4g these positive correlations suggested that ladderanes should be a useful indicator for reflecting hypoxia or oxygen depletion zhao et al 2013 the lower levels of σ i ii iii iv during the early 20th century before the 1950s indicated that there was weaker oxygen depletion or low frequency of hypoxia events since the 1950s the frequency and extent of hypoxia in the ecs continued to increase corresponding to intensified human activities and eutrophication 4 conclusions the distributions of ladderanes in spm at three different depths at three sites provided additional evidence that ladderanes were mostly produced in the water column and could reflect anammox activities the detection of ladderanes in core t06 near the changjiang estuary provided evidence for the existence of anammox activity in the ecs over the past century and the increased content since the 1960s revealed enhanced anammox activities during the last few decades co variations of summed ladderanes marine productivity biomarkers of σ b d a and crenarchaeol and terrestrial biomarkers of branched gdgts suggested that recent coastal eutrophication resulted in primary productivity and hypoxia with both processes favoring anammox bacteria growth comparison of our sedimentary ladderane record with reconstructed low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossil and modern surveys for the hypoxia area over the past 60 years indicated that ladderanes are useful indicators for reflecting hypoxia in the ecs thus sedimentary ladderanes can be used indirectly to reconstruct eutrophication records for coastal oceans however more research is needed for better understanding the anammox growth in the water column and for quantifying the roles of anammox in the marine nitrogen cycle in the present past and future conflicts of interest the authors declare no

18909,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox an important process for converting fixed nitrogen to n2 plays an important role in the present day marine nitrogen cycle however little is known about anammox activities in the past especially in regions that were strongly affected by human activities evidenced by eutrophication and hypoxia which promote anammox bacteria growth in this study ladderanes have been measured in a sediment core and suspended particulate matter spm in the east china sea ecs to reconstruct the anammox record and to evaluate its responses to eutrophication and hypoxia the detection and distribution of different ladderane lipids in spm provide additional evidence that ladderanes were mostly produced in the water column and could reflect anammox activities summed ladderane content from the core varied between 11 and 300 ng g dry weight dw sediment with c20 5 ladderane fatty acid methyl esters fame as the predominant compound 5 150 ng g dw followed by c20 3 ladderane fame 1 110 ng g dw c18 3 ladderane fame 1 32 ng g dw and c18 5 ladderane fame 3 11 ng g dw the detection of ladderanes over the last century indicate the existence of anammox in the

phytoplankton hypoxia 1 introduction nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for primary biological production in the ocean and its cycle is closely related to biological co2 sequestration by a series of feedback loops arrigo 2005 denitrification processes have been considered the predominant pathway for nitrogen loss n loss in the marine nitrogen circle however in past decades studies have shown that anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria which oxidize nitrite in ammonium into dinitrogen have also played an important role in the marine nitrogen cycle especially in anoxic basins and oxygen minimum zones omzs dagmar et al 2008 galán et al 2009 kuypers et al 2003 2005 lam et al 2009 stewart et al 2012 in fact anammox was proposed to be the dominant process of n loss in some omzs hamersley et al 2007 kuypers et al 2005 hypoxia zones in coastal oceans have increased recently because of the enhanced nutrient loading which leads to eutrophication as a result of population growth and land use changes diaz and rosenberg 2008 coastal hypoxia has altered natural redox conditions of the marine environment and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles bianchi and allison 2009 turner et al 2008 coastal oceans are important sites of nitrogen biogeochemical cycling dahnke et al 2008 mcclain et al 2003 and hypothesized to be hot spots for anammox processes as oxygen depletion or low oxygen levels are deemed to be key environmental factors for anammox jaeschke et al 2009a 2009b rush et al 2012 frequent hypoxia in coastal areas as a result of excessive input of anthropogenic nutrients is proposed to lead to an increase in anammox activity changes in anammox activities can be studied using ladderanes as they are membrane lipids unique to anammox bacteria with 3 5 concatenated cyclobutane moieties as the core structures fig 1 sinninghe damsté et al 2002 they have been proven to be useful indicators for the presence of anammox bacteria in the water columns hamersley et al 2007 brandsma et al 2011 jaeschke et al 2007 2010 kuypers et al 2003 2005 pitcher et al 2011 rush et al 2012 wakeham et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 sedimental ladderanes have also been proven to be fossil molecular biomarkers for reflecting the presence and past variations in anammox bacteria jaeschke et al 2009a the east china sea ecs is a river dominated shelf sea fig 2 with major discharge from the changjiang river which is the world s fourth largest river owing to large amounts of terrestrial organic matter om inputs and high primary productivity the ecs is an important reservoir of sedimentary om burial both terrestrial and marine om have been mainly trapped in the inner shelf of the ecs as a result of the net effects of shear forces from shelf currents e g china coastal current the taiwan warm current and the kuroshio current liu et al 2007 high primary production and hydrographic conditions e g stratification are the main contributing factors to low oxygen levels in near bottom water in this region wei et al 2007 li et al 2002 one of the largest coastal hypoxia zones in the world 2 4 104 km2 is located in the changjiang river yangtze estuary and its adjacent shelf area chen et al 2007 gu 1980 tian et al 1993 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 li et al 2002 large amounts of nutrients and om from the terrestrial environment are transported into the ecs through the changjiang river nutrient inputs have doubled in the past three decades partly due to the low oxygen conditions in the changjiang estuary region wei et al 2007 zhang et al 1999 2007 and have altered the nitrogen cycle recently the distribution biodiversity and abundance of anammox bacteria communities in the water column and sediments around the changjiang estuary have been reported using molecular methods hou et al 2013 based on 15n tracer experiments it has been estimated that anammox processes have contributed 6 6 12 9 of the total n loss hou et al 2013 much lower than those from other omzs but higher than that from the pearl river estuary 0 5 7 0 wang et al 2012b ladderanes have also been used to study anammox processes in the changjiang estuary and the ecs first the close relationship between high ladderane contents in suspended particles and low dissolved oxygen hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 have indicated that anammox bacteria and ladderanes in the changjiang estuary were mainly produced in situ in the water column and not transported from terrestrial environments or through sediment re suspension hu et al 2016 secondly these studies all showed that ladderanes are potential proxies for studying hypoxia history in this region hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 finally the ubiquity of anammox and the corresponding ladderanes in the ecs in both suspended particles and surface sediments also proved the important role of anammox in the nitrogen cycle hou et al 2013 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 but little is known about the past anammox activity and its relation with eutrophication in this region in this study ladderane lipids were measured in suspended particulate matter spm from three locations and in a sediment core spanning the last century from the inner shelf of the ecs in conjunction with marine and terrestrial biomarkers of brassicasterol b dinosterol d c37 alkenones a and archaea and bacteria biomarkers crenarchaeol and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers gdgts ladderane records are used to reconstruct changes in past anammox activities to establish the relationship between eutrophication hypoxia and anammox and to evaluate the potential of using ladderane records to reconstruct hypoxia events or oxygen levels in the ecs 2 materials and methods 2 1 oceanographic setting and core location box core t06 122 40 248 e 29 29 975 n water depth 48 8 m fig 2 was recovered in the spring of 2011 during a 973 program cruise on r v dongfanghong2 of the ocean university of china ouc the core is 56 cm in length and the sediment generally consisted of homogeneous dark greenish to light greenish gray hemipelagic muds the core was stored upright at 4 c during transport to the laboratory and then it was sectioned at 1 cm intervals all sections were then freeze dried homogenized and stored at 20 c until analysis spm of three sites 22 32 44 in the inner shelf of the ecs were collected in august 2011 during a cruise to the zhejiang fujian mud area on r v yunjiang1 fig 2 for each site three samples were obtained from the surface intermediate and bottom waters respectively all spm samples were collected by pumping seawater to large bottles onboard and the water was subsequently filtered with glass fiber filters 0 45 μm after collection the samples were stored at 4 c during transport to the laboratory then they were freeze dried homogenized and stored at 20 c until analysis 2 2 sediment core dating the sediment dating method was adopted from huh and su 1999 the method uses alpha spectrometry and assumes an equilibrium between 210pb and 210po about 0 5 g of each sediment sample was weighed and placed in a teflon beaker then 209po with known activity was spiked into the sediment sample in the presence of 209po as a yield monitor 210po was extracted from the sediment with hot hno3 and hclo4 the sediment sample was dissolved by the acids on a hot plate overnight if the solution contained tiny solids mainly quartz then it was transferred into a centrifuge tube to separate the solids and then the solids were discarded the supernatant containing 210po and 209po was placed into the teflon beaker and evaporated to dryness then the residue was converted into a chloride salt with 6 ml concentrated hcl and the solution was evaporated to dryness again to remove any hno3 afterwards the residue was dissolved by 10 ml 1n hcl and transferred into a centrifuge tube ascorbic acid was added into the solution to combine fe ions po was self plated onto silver discs overnight at room temperature the silver disc was placed into the vacuum chamber of the alpha counter which is an ortec system for po counting below 40 cm depth the 210pb activity was relatively constant which means that below this depth 226ra and 210pb reached secular equilibrium the average 210pb activity below this depth is considered as the supported 210pb activity the unsupported excess 210pb activity was calculated by subtracting the supported 210pb activity from total 210pb activity the exponential fitting of the excess 210pb activity with the sediment depth provides an average linear sedimentation rate of 0 5 cm yr based on the sampling time in 2011 the sedimentary history spanned from 1898 ce to 2011 ce although 1 cm sampling interval has an average resolution of 0 5 years the 210pb dating assumed a linear constant accumulation rate with about 5 uncertainty therefore the accuracy of the chronology of the core is less than the annual scale 2 3 analysis of ladderane lipids the method of ladderane analysis is adapted from a previous study hopmans et al 2006 typically 10 g of sediments were ultrasonically extracted using dichloromethane dcm methanol 3 1 v v the elemental sulfur in the extracts was removed using activated copper powder overnight after saponification the neutral lipids were directly collected under basic conditions ph 13 using hexane the remaining fatty acids were collected using hexane after adjusting the residue to acidic conditions ph 3 and then converted to fatty acid methyl esters fames using a bf3 methanol 20 solution then the two fractions were combined transferred into methanol solutions and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter 0 45 μm pore size 4 mm diameter prior to instrumental analysis all the extracts were spiked with an internal standard is of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone both qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed by a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer tandem mass spectrometer hplc ms ms since ladderane lipid standards are not available commercially all ladderane contents data were normalized and are given here as relative amounts normalization was accomplished by comparing the signals of ladderanes with the internal standards 2 4 analysis of phytoplankton biomarkers and gdgts analysis of phytoplankton biomarkers follows procedures previously established in our laboratory xing et al 2011a approximately 2 g of samples spiked with an is mixture containing c19 n alkanol and c24 deuterium substituted n alkane were ultrasonically extracted with dcm methanol 3 1 v v after hydrolysis with 6 koh in methanol the solutions containing biomarkers were extracted with n hexane and fractionated using a silica gel column the neutral fraction eluted with dcm methanol 95 5 v v was derived using n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa and then used for analyzing brassicasterol dinosterol and alkenones quantification was performed on gas chromatography gc with flame ionization detection gc fid agilent 6890n coupled with an hp 1 capillary column 50 m 0 32 mm i d 0 17 mm film thickness j w scientific all these three biomarkers were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms branched gdgts and creanarchaeol analysis follows a previous protocol xing et al 2014 which was adopted from a published method schouten et al 2007 and was also inter calibrated with other laboratories schouten et al 2013 about 5 g of samples spiked with c46gdgt were ultrasonically extracted with methanol twice with dcm methanol 1 1 v v twice and finally with dcm twice then the combined extracts were dehydrated and fractionated with anhydrous na2so4 and alumina respectively the polar fractions eluted with dcm methanol 1 1 v v were concentrated for further analysis on an agilent 1200 series hplc agilent technologies palo alto ca coupled with a waters quattro ultima ms waters corp new jersey us a prevail cyano column 150 mm 2 1 mm and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci were employed for separation and mass spectrometric detection respectively the identified ions were m h with m z of 1292 for creanarchaeol 1050 1036 and 1022 for branched gdgts and 744 for c46gdgt 2 5 calculation of synthesis temperature of ladderanes in core t06 according to rattray s reports rattray et al 2010 the membrane composition of anammox bacteria is temperature dependent i e ratio of shorter chain ladderanes relative to that of longer chain increases at lower temperatures and the change mainly takes place between 12 and 20 c while there is no significant change beyond this temperature range the variation between the membrane composition and the synthesis temperature can be expressed with the following two equations containing nl5 index 1 n l 5 c 20 5 fatty acid c 18 5 fatty acid c 20 5 fatty acid 2 n l 5 0 2 0 7 1 e temp 16 0 1 6 where c20 5 fatty acid and c18 5 fatty acid are the contents of these two ladderanes and temp is the temperature when ladderanes are synthesized by anammox bacteria this relationship between nl5 and temperature has not been well calibrated here we use it to estimate a range of temperature in order to evaluate ladderane origins 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and origins of ladderanes in the ecs all known ladderanes except monoether v have been detected in the samples from core t06 fig 3 their summed contents σ i ii iii iv ranged from 11 to 300 ng g dw mean 59 ng g dw fig 4 b higher than those in sediments from the irish sea 7 5 53 ng g sediment the celtic sea 1 33 ng g sediment jaeschke et al 2009b and the arabian sea 0 3 5 3 ng g jaeschke et al 2009c and continental shelf and slope sediments off northwest africa 0 3 97 ng g sediment jaeschke et al 2010 the dominant ladderane lipid in our samples was c20 5 ladderane fame iii 5 150 ng g dw followed by c20 3 ladderane fame iv 0 9 110 ng g dw c18 3 ladderane fame ii 0 9 32 ng g dw and c18 5 ladderane fame i 3 11 ng g dw fig 3 in comparison with other reports of predominant ladderanes there are obvious regional differences for example it was c18 5 ladderane fame i in shelf and slope sediments off northwest africa jaeschke et al 2010 c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c18 5 ladderane fame i in the arabian sea rush et al 2012 c20 3 monoether in the celtic and irish sea jaeschke et al 2009b c18 3 ladderane fame ii in an enriched peat soil hu et al 2011 and c20 5 ladderane fame iii in the upper sediments soils from a riparian zone of the seine estuary france naeher et al 2015 however the dominance of c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c20 3 ladderane fame iv in the sediments from the ecs is in accordance with their distributions in spm from the changjiang estuary 46 58 and 16 30 respectively hu et al 2016 the ladderanes in spm from the changjiang estuary are proposed to be produced in the water column and not from terrestrial environments or from sediment re suspension by correction analysis with marine and terrestrial biomarkers hu et al 2016 based on this result it can be concluded that the sediment ladderanes in the ecs were also likely from water column production by anammox bacteria in order to further identify the origins of sediment ladderanes spm samples from the bottom intermediate and surface water depth at sites of 22 32 and 44 were also analyzed table 1 c20 5 ladderane fame iii and c20 3 ladderane fame iv are the two predominant compounds broadly similar to previous results from the changjiang estuary in both spring and summer where these two ladderanes showed the highest contents in almost all the samples hu et al 2016 at site 22 and 32 higher contents of ladderanes mainly appeared in the surface and bottom water while higher values appeared in the intermediate layer at site 44 these spatial and depth variations do not provide sufficient evidence for water column production as the only source of ladderanes but they do suggest water column production as a major source based on the spm samples from the changjiang estuary and the ecs we cautiously suggested that ladderanes in the ecs were mostly from water column production beyond that synthesis temperatures 16 22 c from the nl5 index 0 52 0 95 of sedimental ladderanes in core t06 fig 3e were comparable to the mean water temperatures in this sea region 16 c in winter and 21 c in summer wang et al 2012a providing additional evidence that sediment ladderanes were produced in the water column based on the results using the nl5 index a previous study also proposed that surface sediment ladderanes near the changjiang estuary were mainly from the water column zhao et al 2013 therein both the frequent detections of large amounts of ladderanes in spm and the comparable calculated synthesis temperatures suggested that ladderanes at core t06 are to a large extent derived from the water column hu et al 2016 jaeschke et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 3 2 variation of past anammox activities reflected by ladderanes the summed contents of ladderanes fluctuated at relatively low levels before the 1960s and then began to increase significantly up to 2011 fig 4b overall the increasing period can be divided into three intervals namely 1960 1980 1980 2000 and post 2000 generally recently deposited ladderanes in sediment top layers can undergo further degradation than those buried in the lower layers thus it would lead to overestimation of anammox activities in the top layers by using σ i ii iii iv contents mainly owing to higher oxygen content in the shadow sediment layers the rate and degree of om degradation are much higher than that in the slightly deeper sediment layers zimmerman and canuel 2000 correspondingly total organic carbon toc content often presents a gradual attenuation from top to bottom layers to minimize the digenetic effect toc normalized σ i ii iii iv contents have also been presented in this study compared with the slow increment trend of toc fig 4a in the last century the pattern of toc normalized σ i ii iii iv fig 4b still presented a very similar tendency to σ i ii iii iv content this indicated that ladderane variations were not dominated by preservation but likely reflected input changes from the water column which showed an increasing trend over the last 50 years the detection of ladderanes in sediments presented the ubiquity of past anammox in the ecs during the last century before the 1960s the intensity of anammox was relatively stable at low levels after 1960 anammox presented a rapidly increasing trend especially since 1980 the period of enhanced anammox activity corresponded to the rapid economic development in china during this period large amounts of nutrients have been discharged into the ecs and led to eutrophication as well as hypoxia near the changjiang estuary the recent trend of rising σ i ii iii iv implies that anammox might have been further enhanced and that hypoxia has increased in the ecs as for nitrogen cycle implications previous investigations using 15n tracer techniques have revealed that anammox only contributed 6 6 12 9 of the total fixed nitrogen loss in the ecs hou et al 2013 much lower than that in other omzs over the world nevertheless our results still indicated that n loss via anammox has increased several fold during the last century and could play a more important role in coastal ocean nitrogen circle in the future 3 3 linkage between anammox eutrophication and hypoxia major controlling factors for anammox intensities include nutrient supplies nh4 and no2 rush et al 2012 primary productivity jaeschke et al 2009c and the extent of dissolved oxygen depletion jaeschke et al 2009c rush et al 2012 recently the changjiang estuary and its adjacent regions have been characterized by increased eutrophication with large amounts of nutrient and om inputs increasing primary productivities and enhanced oxygen depletion wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 thus eutrophication should be closely related to anammox in the ecs brassicasterol b dinosterol d and c37 alkenones a are often used to reflect the biomass productivity of diatoms dinoflagellates and coccolithophorids respectively in the euphotic layer schubert et al 1998 xing et al 2011b zhao et al 2006 it should be pointed out that brassicasterol is not a good biomarker for diatoms as this compound only occurs in a selected group of diatoms rampen et al 2010 but it can be produced by other phytoplankton however in diatom dominated ecosystems such as upwelling regions and coastal oceans brassicasterol could still be used for diatom productivity reconstruction wu et al 2016 or it can be used as a general phytoplankton lipid rather than a diatom specific marker thus the total contents of these three biomarkers σ b d a have been used as an indicator of primary productivity because of the domination of the three phytoplankton in the ecs fan et al 2014 guo et al 2011 yang et al 2004 here σ b d a is also used to partly reflect eutrophication as a result of the close relationship between enhanced eutrophication and increasing primary productivities in the ecs wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 loliolide a diagenetic product of pigment fucoxanthin is a more specific biomarker for diatoms schefuβ et al 2004 but this compound was not measured in our samples future studies should include loliolide as a diatom productivity indicator to evaluate the relationship between productivity and eutrophication the down core variations of both σ i ii iii iv and σ b d a presented a similar trend with small fluctuations before 1960 and then a rapid increase especially after 1980 fig 4b and c their increasing trends are also consistent with the increasing trends of phytoplankton pigments and nutrient loads in the changjiang river in the past decades li et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 the significant positive correlation between σ i ii iii iv and σ b d a r 0 928 p 0 01 indicated that enhanced anammox processes can be partly attributed to the increased primary productivities jaeschke et al 2009c as the oxidation of om from marine productivity is the primary chemical reaction for dissolved oxygen consumption and an important source of anammox substrates of nh4 and no2 in the marine environment planktonic archaea thaumarchaeota ubiquitously distributed in marine environments delong 1998 fuhrman et al 1992 massana et al 2000 as well as in lakes casamayor and borrego 2009 keough et al 2003 schleper et al 1997 can not only oxidize ammonium to nitrite and thus compete for ammonium but also supplies anammox bacteria with nitrite coolen et al 2007 lam et al 2007 its major membrane lipid of crenarchaeol is specific for nitrifying archaea belonging to thaumarchaeota sinninghe damsté et al 2002 de la torre et al 2008 pitcher et al 2010 branched gdgts are another important class of biomarkers for heterotrophic microorganisms living in an anoxic environment especially in terrestrial environments liu et al 2010 weijers et al 2006 2009 both crenarchaeol and branched gdgts presented similar trends to that of σ i ii iii iv fluctuating in the early part of the 20th century followed by a rapid increase since the 1950s fig 4d and e the significant correlations between the three indicators r 0 894 p 0 01 suggested that there were close relationships among anammox bacteria thaumarchaeota and heterotrophic microorganisms living in an anoxic environment the co variation of crenarchaeol and branched gdgts r 0 997 p 0 01 was consistent with most of the previous results from globally distributed marine and freshwater archives fietz et al 2012 branched gdgts are not exclusively from terrestrial origin but can also be produced in situ in marine environments sinninghe damsté et al 2016 though thaumarchaeota and anammox bacteria may occupy different niches in the water column pitcher et al 2011 sollai et al 2015 therefore our co variation results indicated that quite a few of these lipids may be from the possible autochthonous production by thaumarchaeota and anoxic heterotrophic microorganisms the possible co existence of thaumarchaeota and anammox bacteria has also been revealed by their co variation in other regions such as in the omzs off northern chile galán et al 2009 off peru lam et al 2009 the benguela upwelling system kuypers et al 2005 and the suboxic zone of the black sea lam et al 2007 in the changjiang estuary and its adjacent region frequent occurrences of eutrophication often lead to algal blooms low dissolved oxygen and the sufficient supply of ammonium and nitrite for the growth of anammox bacteria and thaumarchaeota hence these results indicated that the enhanced anammox in the past century was likely to be the microbial community response to increased eutrophication recent field surveys have revealed dramatic increases in hypoxic events in the near bottom water off the changjiang estuary zhu et al 2011 li et al 2002 but the long term record of hypoxia near the changjiang estuary was not available due to the lack of continuous data however the historical trends of hypoxia have been reconstructed using microfossils in sediment cores li et al 2011 the increase of low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossils revealed an increase in the number of hypoxic events over the past 60 years recently the abundance of anammox bacteria has also been proposed to be closely related to lower dissolved oxygen content engström et al 2005 jaeschke et al 2007 2009b thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and this novel method was also applied to the changjiang estuary zhao et al 2013 generally the low oxygen content is considered to favor the growth of anammox bacteria and can thus lead to enhanced anammox activities however there were reports of the existence of anammox bacteria abundances in surface waters which could be interpreted by the formation of microaerophilic and anaerobic microenvironments which could support the growth of anammox pitcher et al 2011 podlaska et al 2012 this could be one possible explanation for the detection of ladderanes in surface waters of the changjiang estuary alternatively vertical mixing in this shallow environment could have brought some ladderanes from deeper water to the surface both hypotheses can be studied and verified in future studies in order to study the linkage between ladderane and hypoxia our ladderane record fig 4b was compared with that of the density of low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossils from core 2006 122 711 e 30 937 n and core 2007 122 689 e 31 357 n fig 4f li et al 2011 and the summer hypoxia area by modern surveys fig 4g chen et al 2007 wei et al 2007 zhu et al 2011 office of integrated oceanographic survey of china 1961 li et al 2002 both σ i ii iii iv fig 4b and foraminiferal density fig 4f presented a dramatically increasing trend after the 1940s coincident with frequent hypoxia events such as in 1959 the 1980s and after 2000 fig 4g these positive correlations suggested that ladderanes should be a useful indicator for reflecting hypoxia or oxygen depletion zhao et al 2013 the lower levels of σ i ii iii iv during the early 20th century before the 1950s indicated that there was weaker oxygen depletion or low frequency of hypoxia events since the 1950s the frequency and extent of hypoxia in the ecs continued to increase corresponding to intensified human activities and eutrophication 4 conclusions the distributions of ladderanes in spm at three different depths at three sites provided additional evidence that ladderanes were mostly produced in the water column and could reflect anammox activities the detection of ladderanes in core t06 near the changjiang estuary provided evidence for the existence of anammox activity in the ecs over the past century and the increased content since the 1960s revealed enhanced anammox activities during the last few decades co variations of summed ladderanes marine productivity biomarkers of σ b d a and crenarchaeol and terrestrial biomarkers of branched gdgts suggested that recent coastal eutrophication resulted in primary productivity and hypoxia with both processes favoring anammox bacteria growth comparison of our sedimentary ladderane record with reconstructed low oxygen tolerant foraminiferal microfossil and modern surveys for the hypoxia area over the past 60 years indicated that ladderanes are useful indicators for reflecting hypoxia in the ecs thus sedimentary ladderanes can be used indirectly to reconstruct eutrophication records for coastal oceans however more research is needed for better understanding the anammox growth in the water column and for quantifying the roles of anammox in the marine nitrogen cycle in the present past and future conflicts of interest the authors declare no
