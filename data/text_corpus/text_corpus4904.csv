24520,examining marine ecosystems in a distinct way can produce new ecological theoretical and applied insights the common s and hockey stick shaped curves which result from examining the cumulative biomass and trophic level and the cumulative production and cumulative biomass curves of marine ecosystems have strong potential to elucidate the mechanisms of marine food webs these curves are based on the cumulative trophic theory which can be summarized as the integration of biomass and production across trophic level that results from the relatively simple trophic transfer equation here we test the behavior of this theory via modeled simulations of the transfer equation under a variety of common mechanisms that can influence marine ecosystems the simulated scenarios we present and evaluate here explore bottom up driven changes production growth internal dynamics transfer efficiency or top down driven changes mortality selectivity as well as multi mechanism scenarios overfishing and eutrophication that are commonly experienced in marine ecosystems we explore these scenarios at high medium or low levels of change for each feature to ascertain how they can result in major changes to the realized trophodynamics of a marine ecosystem our results lend credence to the generality of the cumulative trophic theory by predicting the empirically observed s and hockey stick shaped curves under a wide range of possible mechanisms given that common repeatable and predictable dynamics is a key hallmark of increasingly robust theories the application of cumulative trophic theory in managing marine ecosystems enables more repeatable and predictable responses across a wide range of conditions keywords food web food chain s shaped curve hockey stick transfer efficiency cumulative biomass cumulative production trophic level marine ecosystems 1 introduction the need for robust ecological theory is needed for both inherent understanding and use in applied situations peters 1991 the many pressures facing ecosystems necessitate understanding of common repeatable and predictable dynamics such that these dynamics indicate degrees of ecosystem perturbation as well as recovery link et al 2002 2015 jennings 2005 link 2005 shin et al 2010 tam et al 2017 this is especially true for marine ecosystems whose distinctiveness from terrestrial ecosystems is well documented i e scale different fluid dynamics difficulty of observations scope and speed of species movement etc steele 1985 link 2002 carr et al 2003 and whose difference from terrestrial and smaller scale aquatic ecosystems often results in a lag of ecological theory being developed for and applied to them steele 1985 townsend et al 2018 here we describe how a relatively simple equation that arises from an ecological theory based on cumulative evaluations of ecosystem properties can be useful for understanding marine ecosystem responses to a wide range of changes the understanding of cumulative patterns such that they can detect and predict major common pressures could suggest potential interventions sainsbury and sumaila 2003 jennings 2005 link 2005 2010 2018 link et al 2011 2015 tam et al 2017 via common mechanisms ecological theory that enables one to address the pervasive perturbations facing marine ecosystems via a general mechanism with a clear and robust pattern potentially has global implications one such theory is the cumulative trophic theory with its emergent features link et al 2015 this theory posits that the cumulative biomass across trophic level and the cumulative production across cumulative biomass behaves in a repeatable consistent fundamental manner that is readily predicted the studies on this topic to date have demonstrated that there are consistent fundamental emergent properties common to all marine ecosystems and that these cumulative biomass trophic level cumb tl and cumulative production cumulative biomass cumb cump curve patterns are observed in every ecosystem that has been examined albeit with nuanced curve properties across the range of types of ecosystems link et al 2015 pranovi et al 2020 the cumb tl curve results in a s shaped curve whereas the cump cumb curve results in a hockey stick shape the curve shapes have been observed across multiple ecosystems types of data etc in over 200 different marine ecosystems that span over 70 years of data pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 fig 1 furthermore these curves respond to perturbation and recovery in known repeatable predicable ways with associated curve parameters being useful to delineate perturbed or recovered ecosystems link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 these dynamics have led to globally proposed thresholds that may be useful for better management of marine ecosystems link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 the cumulative trophic theory and associated curve parameters have had a largely empirical emphasis on pattern detection and replication which is understandable as the first step in development of theoretical explanation simulating these cumulative theory curves as an emergent property of ecosystems from a simple understanding of trophodynamics lindeman 1942 libralato et al 2014 link et al 2015 would also be valuable here we aim to explore a suite of simulations across a range of scenarios and factors common to many marine ecosystems 1 1 a primer on cumulative trophic theory with an emphasis on emergent properties of cumulative curves cumulative trophic curves are the emergent ecosystem properties of examining cumulative biomass cumb and cumulative production cump across trophic levels tls link et al 2015 notably such emergent properties are based on a clear theoretical background of biomass accumulation that is log normally distributed across trophic level fig 1c which when examined cumulatively results in a sigmoidal cumulative biomass trophic level curve cumb tl discussed further below fig 1e subsequent transfers of production and biomass are efficiency limited across trophic level and up through a food chain fig 1b as in the simple trophic transfer equation eq 1 1 c u m p m a x 1 1 t l p p t e i t l 1 where cumpmax is the cumulative production of the system pp is net primary production often expressed as net primary production pp tl is trophic level and te is the average tl transfer efficiency libralato et al 2008 thus production at different trophic levels always results in pyramids because the transfer efficiency is always much lower than 1 and usually close to 0 1 may 1976 pauly and christensen 1995 and hence cumulative curves of production are monotonically asymptotic tending to plateau near the sum of all system productivity i e cumpmax fundamental trophodynamic features are represented by overall system limits based on primary production fig 1a turnover of populations average growth or transfer efficiency and growth in size are the overall system limits that influence the production curve cf link et al 2015 additionally classical biomasses across trophic levels are not necessarily pyramidal in marine systems see fath and killian 2007 pranovi and link 2009 but are more often rhomboidal due to high standing biomass at tl 2 i e benthos and plankton that can derive energy from dead organic matter and or from primary producers i e herbivores and detritivores fig 1b the cumulative biomass curve across trophic levels cumb tl is thus a sigmoidal curve i e a curve fig 1e with an inflection point reflective of this rhomboidal nature fig 1b and unimodal approximately normal log distribution of biomass across tl fig 1c the cumb tl curves exhibit a typical s shaped pattern that seems to hold regardless of type of ecosystem or type of data used to construct them pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2014 the cumb cump curves also tend to consistently exhibit a hockey stick shaped curve fig 1f broader examination has confirmed the existence and commonality of these curves from over 200 different marine ecosystems around the planet and demonstrated repeatable consistent and predictable changes in curve shapes due to perturbations that can modify trophodynamic features of large marine ecosystems lmes pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 in this context we note that perturbations do not modify the fundamental shape of cumulative curves but rather their key features fig 1g 1h in a stylized example of the cumb tl curve fig 1g link et al 2015 perturbations result in changes in the s shaped curve over time that become less steep and move toward low tls for example fishing causes depletion of biomass of upper trophic levels and prevalence of lower trophic levels as highlighted by the fishing down the food web phenomenon pauly et al 1998 in the cumulative theory this would be hypothesized to result in the flattening and shrinking of the s shaped cumb tl curve fig 1g eutrophication similarly increases the proportion of lower tl biomasses micheli 1999 and species invasions also produce overgrowth of selected lower tl species libralato et al 2015 both hypothesized to result in similar responses in the cumb tl curve fig 1g conversely ecosystem recovery results in increased steepness and movement toward upper tls of these curves fig 1g 1h these situations imply measurable changes on the major curve parameters primarily determinants of the s curve such as the biomass inflection point tl inflection point and steepness or slope which can be tracked over time to determine major shifts in condition of an ecosystem see pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 libralto et al 2020 they thus correspond to and detect changes from many instances of known marine ecosystem perturbation for example the gulf of mexico large marine ecosystem has experienced notable perturbations due to the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill which has resulted in numerous changes to trophic structure and ecosystem function ainsworth et al 2021 woodstock et al 2021 those changes have also been detected in cumb tl curves for the gulf of mexico libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 these three simple curve parameters represent emergent properties of lmes with a surprising degree of insight into ecosystem structure and functioning thus the cumulative curves hold some promise in delineating regions of ecosystem state that require management action more so the behavior of these curves under a varying set of conditions warrants further examination there are major mechanisms whereby marine populations their resulting food webs and ultimately the resulting trophodynamics of marine ecosystems can be perturbed or recovered these mechanisms group largely into changes to production or growth on the one hand versus changes to mortality or removals on the other with perhaps some rewiring of the efficiency of internal transfer dynamics here we explore this in further detail for a simulated food chain with seven trophic levels using deconstructed features of the simple trophic transfer equation eq 1 2 methods 2 1 model taking eq 1 in discretized form for distinct i e integer trophic levels one can back calculate production and biomass for each tl the production p at any given trophic level tl is effectively obtained by the transfer efficiency declination of primary production pp 2 p t l p p t e t l 1 c f lindeman 1942 as described further in libralato et al 2008 2014 as estimates of biomass are often harder to obtain across all taxa in an ecosystem one can use common ranges of production to biomass ratios p b shannon and jarre teichmann 1999 heymans and baird 2000 heymans et al 2004 from the p b ratio one can obtain biomass b at a given tl as 3 b t l p t l p b t l for some scenarios we wanted to harvest i e some form of removal some of the taxa or at least use a variable form of mortality m as a placeholder this removal r e g fisheries catch other mortality etc was estimated as 4 r t l p t l 1 e m s e l e c t i v i t y t l where ptl is as before and the selectivity is the amount the production at the trophic level subject to mortality and which leads to the realized production accounting for any such mortality pr as 5 p r p t l r t l and then the realized biomass accounting for catch or other sources of mortality that is removed br as 6 b r t l p r t l p b t l 2 2 curves and scenarios the preceding values i e b p and pr were calculated for all steps of the food chain up to tl 7 these were based on the initial pp level and assumptions of realistic values for te and p b then the values particularly p and b were summed across tl to obtain cumulative biomass cumb and cumulative production cump the cumb discrete data was plotted against each tl and cump was plotted against cumb for each of the scenarios evaluated see below c f fig 1e f there are many potential curve features one can estimate from the s and hockey stick shaped curves respectively pranovi et al 2014 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 but we do not present all of these here as our primary focus was to examine the shape size and magnitude of the s and hockey stick shaped curves we present these basic s curve and hockey stick shaped plots for each set of scenarios we explored these two distinct curves across a range of simulated conditions these are loosely grouped into bottom up driven features that include changes in production base of the entire ecosystem as seen modified via pp in growth as modified via p b ratios across various tls and top down driven features such as mortality as modified by m and selectivity a type of tl based evaluation of mortality across various tls furthermore scenarios exploring changes in overarching internal ecosystem properties i e the efficiency of the food web as modified by te were explored a special set of scenarios representing two common major pressures facing marine ecosystems overfishing and eutrophication as modified via a combination of parameters were also examined table 1 for eutrophication the parameters were set to initially mimic increased production but then as higher levels of eutrophication occurred less production and increases in non fishing mortality were parameterized to reflect the dynamics of eutrophication the overfishing scenarios were parameterized to reflect not only fishing mortality but also increases of selectivity for various trophic levels the full suite of scenarios aimed to answer the following questions are these pressures resulting in major changes to the realized trophodynamics of a marine ecosystem how much do different pressures affect the cumulative curves and does the cumulative curve theory explain observed results for each set of scenarios except the special mixed scenarios we held all parameters constant as in the base scenario except the variable under examination table 1 the levels of changes in each scenario were intended to cover a range of plausible ecosystem conditions that represent perturbed or recovered states as realized via the various common mechanisms that can impact marine ecosystems we present each set of resulting cumb and cump curves for the range of scenarios and also key curve parameters and features relative to the base scenario to demonstrate the magnitude of the scenario response 3 results overall we ran 35 different scenarios in addition to the base case to explore the many possible ways in which marine food webs can respond to different pressures effectively these were in the very high high medium low very low categories of each of the possible top down or bottom up mechanisms that can influence marine ecosystem trophodynamics when examining the results of these various model runs it is helpful to compare them to the base case scenario for each particular suite of scenarios table 2 it is also helpful to compare them more broadly to fig 1g and 1h when ascertaining whether the magnitude and direction a particular scenario result was positive or negative one can see the stretching and growing of the curves to indicate positive or recovery dynamics whereas a shrinking and moving towards the origin can indicate negative or perturbation dynamics fig 2 7 table 2 for the production scenarios fig 2 the response is as one would expect from cumulative trophic theory with lower basal production the s shaped curve flattens out and loses both its steepness and clear inflection point at lower to mid trophic levels as well as lowering the amount of total cumulative biomass observed fig 2a table 2 conversely as production increases the s shaped curve becomes more pronounced and heightens the s shape with ultimately a higher cumulative biomass observed fig 2a table 2 the cump cumb curve shows the classical very expected pattern of a shrinking hockey stick fig 1h with the curve becoming smaller and closer to the origin as production declines fig 2b table 2 among all the sets of scenarios these production scenarios tended to show the largest departure from the baseline table 2 with changes much greater than 100 in many cases larger than 200 from the base scenario in another bottom up set of scenarios changing the growth at various tls has some seemingly counterintuitive results fig 3 the s shaped curve shows that an increase in growth for tl 1 3 or across all tls the curve actually shrinks and flattens fig 3a similar to a lower production situation fig 2a table 2 the opposite occurs for an increase in those tls with the s shaped curve enlarging fig 3a the cump cumb curve effectively maintained the same shape but the blade of the hockey stick begins at higher biomass levels with an actual decrease growth at tl 1 3 or across all tls fig 3b table 2 conversely the blade shifts to lower cumulative biomass with higher growth rates at these various tls fig 3b table 2 the results for changing growth for tl 5 or any higher tl not shown are effectively the same on both curves and don t fundamentally differ from the base case scenario fig 3 why lower or slower growth leads to an increase in the curves and opposite of what would be expected fig 1 is likely deduced from the growth term i e p b being in the denominator eq 6 when calculating biomass from production at each tl and hence when integrated results in cumb being higher the production and cump do not fundamentally differ in these scenarios fig 3b we best understand this to be that faster higher growth rates tend to result in lower standing biomass due to higher turnover rates of said biomass odum and barrett 1971 gasol et al 1997 these scenarios had very few instances that were greater than 40 difference from the base scenario except when changing growth at all tls i e the all tl scenarios results from exploring transfer efficiency were as expected fig 1g h albeit with an important nuance from either production or growth fig 4 lower tes resulted in a flattened s shaped curve fig 4a table 2 and shorter closer to the origin cump cumb hockey stick curves fig 4b table 2 and the opposite held higher tes results in larger hockey sticks fig 4b table 2 and more pronounced s shaped curves fig 4a the s shaped curves in all three of these bottom up figs 2b 4b scenarios could be effectively interchangeable but the cump cumb curves in these scenarios are more distinct with the curves at lower tes shrinking and being both closer to the origin and with much less cumulative biomass i e the handle of the hockey stick is shorter both the te fig 4b and production fig 2b cump cumb curves shrink and have smaller cumulative production at lower levels whereas the growth cump cumb curve fig 3b has the same amount of cumulative production and a much less pronounced decline in cumulative biomass in the te scenarios with higher te there is more production transferring to upper trophic levels and the effect on the handle of the hockey stick is more noticeable fig 4b table 2 with the highest level of cumulative biomass among all of the scenarios explored all the moderate high or higher te scenarios showed notable changes from the base scenario for the cumb tl curve but effectively no changes to the cump cumb curve table 2 shifting emphasis to more top down considerations the mortality scenarios fig 5 match what would be expected with an increase in perturbation fig 1g h l k the s shaped curves are more pronounced at lower mortality levels and flatten out at higher mortality levels fig 5a table 2 although opposite in mechanism and hence sign i e here the highest levels are the lowest curves the s shaped curves in these mortality scenarios fig 5a are qualitatively similar to the prior s shaped curves noted fig 2a 4a that is lowering mortality has the same response as increasing production or te the same holds true for the cump cumb curves fig 5b the hockey stick similarly enlarges or shrinks and moves toward the origin at lower and higher mortality levels respectively fig 5b table 2 the cump cumb curves do not fundamentally exceed a cumulative production but those values do decline with higher mortalities fig 5b table 2 the cumulative biomasses similarly decline with increased mortality fig 5b table 2 these mortality scenarios show moderate changes from the base scenario for the cumb tl curve and very minor changes for the cump cumb curve table 2 the selectivity scenarios show similar but less pronounced responses fig 6 as the mortality scenario curves fig 5 there is less difference in the s shaped curves fig 6a table 2 and the scenarios that essentially test how much of a tl that is available for removal e g mortality fishing etc has less of an impact again higher effects across various tls resulted in a shallower s shape and vice versa fig 6a table 2 the cump cumb curves fig 6b table 2 similarly exhibited the same type of responses seen in the mortality scenario curves fig 5b but again were less pronounced the difference in cumulative production across most of these scenarios was less than 5 the exception is the highest selectivity effect which had notably lower cumulative production this effect resulted from allowing for availability to potential removal of both tl 1 and 2 in that particular scenario similar to the mortality scenarios these selectivity scenarios had relatively minor differences to the base scenario table 2 the final set of scenarios were meant to exemplify two common pressures facing marine ecosystems i e overfishing and eutrophication both overfishing scenarios show a flattening and shrinking of the s shaped curve relative to the baseline fig 7 a table 2 as would be expected fig 1g k the cump cumb curves similarly show a shrinking and shortening of the hockey stick though the starting overfishing scenario i e mild impacts are relatively close to the base case scenario fig 7b table 2 the full overfishing scenario had significantly eroded cumulative biomass almost by a factor of two the eutrophication scenarios are more nuanced as eutrophication initiates the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and cump cumb curve fig 7b shows an increase and even extension of cumulative biomass consistent with an increase in production scenarios fig 2 as eutrophication sets in it actually flattens the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and though it raises the cump cumb curve does not increase available cumulative biomass fig 7b table 2 at strong eutrophication both the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and cump cumb curves fig 7b table 2 exhibit patterns consistent with severe declines in production fig 2 or increases in mortality fig 5 reflective of the combined effects of severe eutrophication 4 discussion our model simulation results demonstrate that cumulative trophic theory can predict consistent and repeatable patterns in response to a range of common pressures facing marine ecosystems these generally conform to a broad set of empirical observations pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 and confirm the expected responses to positive i e recovery or negative i e perturbation conditions link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 that they arise from a relatively simple trophic transfer equation has high utility across all these simulated scenarios a few observations emerge first is that the s and hockey stick shaped curves are repeated across the various impacting mechanisms for this generic marine ecosystem although they did change shapes no one scenario entirely obliterated these curve shapes as expected from cumulative trophic theory fig 1e f that the s and hockey stick shaped curves were generally retained may be further evidence for the widespread utility of these patterns and the possible benefits of approaches that consider them second the response of increasing top down pressures or decreasing bottom up factors generally resulted in responses on these curves consistent with perturbation fig 1g k that the general responses shrunk decreased and moved toward the origin regardless of specific mechanism of change demonstrates the common directional responses to perturbation as well as the validity of the cumulative trophic theory the converse holds as well the response of increasing bottom up factors and decreasing top down pressures generally resulted in responses consistent with recovery of marine ecosystems another observation is that these scenarios demonstrate that they can accommodate nuances to a suite of conditions as seen in the growth or eutrophication scenarios that these curves are able to detect and present these nuances in eutrophication is useful being able to address non linear or at least non obvious responses is requisite for a theoretical approach to be flexible enough to meet and survive real world situations even if they are simulated these simulations resulted in predictable repeatable common and consistent patterns that observation is not trivial flattening the s curve and shrinking the hockey stick under degrading scenarios and vice versa are in line with what one would expect from the cumulative trophic theory link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 that these patterns repeat under a wide range of simulated conditions and possible mechanisms is further evidence that this theory truly does describe major emergent features of marine ecosystem dynamics most pressures are relatively straightforward to understand as are the cumulative curve responses increasing top down or decreasing bottom up factors micheli 1999 collie and delong 2001 lotze and milewski 2004 frank 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 results in readily observable perturbations to marine ecosystems conversely increasing bottom up and decreasing top down factors lotze and milewski 2004 myers and worm 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 lynam et al 2017 results in relaxation of these pressures and even potential recovery of marine ecosystems changes in bottom up drivers responded as expected as did changes in top down pressures but what about more specific cases selected tl removals that mimic apex predator reduction libralato et al 2008 or fishing through the food web at lower to mid tls essington et al 2006 also had responses that would be expected given that the cumulative trophic theory was able to accommodate two examples of common pressures facing marine ecosystems overfishing and eutrophication that have more multi faceted mechanisms is also not trivial and a valuable outcome e g piroddi et al 2021 other common pressures that warrant testing in future studies include changing thermal conditions with particular temperature links to growth or production libralato et al 2015 bentley et al 2017 serpetti et al 2017 changes in acidification ph and related chemical responses linked to mortality or growth zunino et al 2021 changes in multiple ocean uses across many sectors douvere and ehler 2009 white et al 2012 efficacy of certain marine ecosystem management measures including marine protected areas walters 2000 wood et al 2008 food web biomagnification of toxins plastics and other chemicals kelly et al 2007 diepens and koelmans 2018 or even siting of offshore energy and impacts on ecological functioning gill 2005 among others collectively this suite of scenarios demonstrates that the cumulative trophic theory and the cumb tl and cump cumb curves can capture and predict the dynamics of marine ecosystems one seemingly counterintuitive response that warrants further exploration is the results seen from increasing growth as treated here we represented growth as p b ratios shannon and jarre teichmann 1999 heymans and baird 2000 heymans et al 2004 as a result of that term being in the denominator of some core equations to back calculate biomass eq 6 increased growth resulted in a decline in overall standing biomass though this did not ultimately impact production and cumulative production it did alter the accumulation of biomass along the trophic chain and thus the cumulative biomass again we understand this to be indicative that faster higher growth rates tend to result in lower standing biomass due to higher turnover rates of said biomass odum and barrett 1971 gasol et al 1997 others have postulated that higher growth leads to higher standing biomass dortch and packard 1989 gasol et al 1997 and we understand that argument as well here we also accounted for removals of said biomass so we suspect that is why our results align with those associated with the turnover rate explanation given that there is high standing biomass at intermediate trophic levels in marine ecosystems deyoung et al 2004 link et al 2015 could also give undue weight to changes in growth for those organisms at least in terms of cumulative responses this is an area that merits further examination an important aspect of trophodynamics is the concept of trophic level lindeman 1942 libralato et al 2014 shannon et al 2014 here we treat tl as an integer for simplicity in calculations certainly there is debate about what a non integer tl means odum and heald 1975 christensen and pauly 1992 pauly and watson 2005 shannon et al 2014 and we appreciate that for a given taxa of marine species that the tl is not fixed across size life history seasonality geographic location etc polis and strong 1996 woodward and hildrew 2002 layman et al 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 fort et al 2010 costalago et al 2012 we suspect that integrating a more continuous treatment of tl that also considers the pathways of interactions among species e g o gorman and emmerson 2009 and pressures e g agnetta et al 2019 in the food web that are more complicated than in a linear food chain will result in broadly comparable results and preliminary examinations tend to confirm that suspicion future work examining a continuous treatment of tl beyond the discrete approach presented here is warranted as well as the analysis using complex ecosystem models that might detect potential counterintuitive effects and also might provide further support to the cumulative theory link et al 2015 they could also be used as tools to test thresholds libralato et al 2019 one intriguing aspect of the core trophic transfer equation eq 1 is the value of the transfer efficiency itself that term alone merits further consideration transfer efficiency is often central to the results in analyses like these link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 eddy et al 2021 as well as many marine food web and ecosystem models e g christensen and pauly 1992 heymans and baird 2000 pauly et al 2000 libralato et al 2004 typically te is assumed to be approximately 10 which came from very early studies lindeman 1942 odum and barrett 1971 may 1976 pauly and christensen 1995 though more recent studies reviews and meta analyses suggest that te is somewhat higher libralato et al 2008 there is no means to directly measure te in a marine food web at least across entire tls and thus the te term is highly derived although what we present here spans the likely range of values colléter et al 2014 2015 heymans et al 2014 eddy et al 2021 it was obvious that the value of this te term had large effects on model results a prior sensitivity analysis unpublished data similarly demonstrated the impact of changing the te term in the current context this hyper responsiveness to changes in some te scenarios is seen in the response of the cumulative curves thus not only for this particular context but for trophic ecology more generally we recommend further examination and exploration of the assumptions surrounding te as well as novel ways to estimate or measure it odum 1969 jorgensen 2001 notes that ecosystems tend to optimize the use of energy by modulating their trophic structure along a continuum between high levels of energy flow early development stages and high levels of standing biomass mature development stages these ecosystem development stages seem to be well accommodated by the cumulative trophic theory and associated curves with modifications to curve properties corresponding to the different ends of the ecosystem maturity continuum odum 1969 for instance the shrinking of the cumb tl curve under perturbed conditions could very well be related to a reduction of the standing biomass and hence increased energy flows and even a reduced system capability to saturate the use of available energy e g increasing losses and wastes of metabolic expenditures or the presence of bottle necks in the food web energy transfer the cumulative trophic theory has not been developed without broader context yet further exploration of how it is connected to other means of framing and understanding ecosystem dynamics is warranted we particularly note that the cumulative trophic theory here has been explored in marine ecosystems how applicable it is to other types of non aquatic ecosystems remains an interesting question the value of any theory is often heightened in how it handles caveats or nuanced circumstances here the cumulative trophic theory was able to accommodate those especially in the growth selectivity and eutrophication scenarios recognizing that for example eutrophication is not linear nor uni directional is important and we were able to represent that nuance in this model construction a relatively simple equation when explored in multiple views with a particular emphasis on cumulative emergent features can provide a surprising amount of insight into marine food web dynamics testing any theory no matter how simple benefits from mathematical formulation simulation sensitivity analyses and application to near real world conditions caswell 1988 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 cariboni et al 2007 here we demonstrate that the cumulative trophic theory can be confronted with and survive those conditions the value of the cumulative trophic curves remains high and is improved even further by this theoretical simulated treatment of its features the commonality of s and hockey stick shaped curves is growing with each study that actually looks at cumulative biomass and production pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 such that these patterns are observed in essentially every marine ecosystem that has been examined certainly additional marine and aquatic ecosystems warrant cumulative curve examinations as do terrestrial ecosystems to verify the ubiquity and veracity of this theory and its predictions beyond the large marine ecosystem context yet the global observations from over 200 marine ecosystems link et al 2015 pranovi et al 2020 from over 70 years of data libralato et al 2019 and across a wide range of perturbations and histories is compelling evidence suggestive that this cumulative trophic theory has continued merit our ability to predict and repeat the responses of these curves to common pressures via known mechanisms increases the utility of these cumulative emergent properties of marine ecosystems the application of cumulative trophic theory for the wise management of marine ecosystems has higher utility knowing we can more repeatedly and comfortably predict their responses to a wide range of conditions thus the applications that may follow might prove useful for the even wiser management of marine ecosystems link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 more so that a relatively simple equation can depict capture and predict such a wide range of marine ecosystem dynamics across a broad array of situations is not trivial and further suggests the robustness of the cumulative trophic theory author credit

24520,examining marine ecosystems in a distinct way can produce new ecological theoretical and applied insights the common s and hockey stick shaped curves which result from examining the cumulative biomass and trophic level and the cumulative production and cumulative biomass curves of marine ecosystems have strong potential to elucidate the mechanisms of marine food webs these curves are based on the cumulative trophic theory which can be summarized as the integration of biomass and production across trophic level that results from the relatively simple trophic transfer equation here we test the behavior of this theory via modeled simulations of the transfer equation under a variety of common mechanisms that can influence marine ecosystems the simulated scenarios we present and evaluate here explore bottom up driven changes production growth internal dynamics transfer efficiency or top down driven changes mortality selectivity as well as multi mechanism scenarios overfishing and eutrophication that are commonly experienced in marine ecosystems we explore these scenarios at high medium or low levels of change for each feature to ascertain how they can result in major changes to the realized trophodynamics of a marine ecosystem our results lend credence to the generality of the cumulative trophic theory by predicting the empirically observed s and hockey stick

cumulative biomass cumulative production trophic level marine ecosystems 1 introduction the need for robust ecological theory is needed for both inherent understanding and use in applied situations peters 1991 the many pressures facing ecosystems necessitate understanding of common repeatable and predictable dynamics such that these dynamics indicate degrees of ecosystem perturbation as well as recovery link et al 2002 2015 jennings 2005 link 2005 shin et al 2010 tam et al 2017 this is especially true for marine ecosystems whose distinctiveness from terrestrial ecosystems is well documented i e scale different fluid dynamics difficulty of observations scope and speed of species movement etc steele 1985 link 2002 carr et al 2003 and whose difference from terrestrial and smaller scale aquatic ecosystems often results in a lag of ecological theory being developed for and applied to them steele 1985 townsend et al 2018 here we describe how a relatively simple equation that arises from an ecological theory based on cumulative evaluations of ecosystem properties can be useful for understanding marine ecosystem responses to a wide range of changes the understanding of cumulative patterns such that they can detect and predict major common pressures could suggest potential interventions sainsbury and sumaila 2003 jennings 2005 link 2005 2010 2018 link et al 2011 2015 tam et al 2017 via common mechanisms ecological theory that enables one to address the pervasive perturbations facing marine ecosystems via a general mechanism with a clear and robust pattern potentially has global implications one such theory is the cumulative trophic theory with its emergent features link et al 2015 this theory posits that the cumulative biomass across trophic level and the cumulative production across cumulative biomass behaves in a repeatable consistent fundamental manner that is readily predicted the studies on this topic to date have demonstrated that there are consistent fundamental emergent properties common to all marine ecosystems and that these cumulative biomass trophic level cumb tl and cumulative production cumulative biomass cumb cump curve patterns are observed in every ecosystem that has been examined albeit with nuanced curve properties across the range of types of ecosystems link et al 2015 pranovi et al 2020 the cumb tl curve results in a s shaped curve whereas the cump cumb curve results in a hockey stick shape the curve shapes have been observed across multiple ecosystems types of data etc in over 200 different marine ecosystems that span over 70 years of data pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 fig 1 furthermore these curves respond to perturbation and recovery in known repeatable predicable ways with associated curve parameters being useful to delineate perturbed or recovered ecosystems link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 these dynamics have led to globally proposed thresholds that may be useful for better management of marine ecosystems link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 the cumulative trophic theory and associated curve parameters have had a largely empirical emphasis on pattern detection and replication which is understandable as the first step in development of theoretical explanation simulating these cumulative theory curves as an emergent property of ecosystems from a simple understanding of trophodynamics lindeman 1942 libralato et al 2014 link et al 2015 would also be valuable here we aim to explore a suite of simulations across a range of scenarios and factors common to many marine ecosystems 1 1 a primer on cumulative trophic theory with an emphasis on emergent properties of cumulative curves cumulative trophic curves are the emergent ecosystem properties of examining cumulative biomass cumb and cumulative production cump across trophic levels tls link et al 2015 notably such emergent properties are based on a clear theoretical background of biomass accumulation that is log normally distributed across trophic level fig 1c which when examined cumulatively results in a sigmoidal cumulative biomass trophic level curve cumb tl discussed further below fig 1e subsequent transfers of production and biomass are efficiency limited across trophic level and up through a food chain fig 1b as in the simple trophic transfer equation eq 1 1 c u m p m a x 1 1 t l p p t e i t l 1 where cumpmax is the cumulative production of the system pp is net primary production often expressed as net primary production pp tl is trophic level and te is the average tl transfer efficiency libralato et al 2008 thus production at different trophic levels always results in pyramids because the transfer efficiency is always much lower than 1 and usually close to 0 1 may 1976 pauly and christensen 1995 and hence cumulative curves of production are monotonically asymptotic tending to plateau near the sum of all system productivity i e cumpmax fundamental trophodynamic features are represented by overall system limits based on primary production fig 1a turnover of populations average growth or transfer efficiency and growth in size are the overall system limits that influence the production curve cf link et al 2015 additionally classical biomasses across trophic levels are not necessarily pyramidal in marine systems see fath and killian 2007 pranovi and link 2009 but are more often rhomboidal due to high standing biomass at tl 2 i e benthos and plankton that can derive energy from dead organic matter and or from primary producers i e herbivores and detritivores fig 1b the cumulative biomass curve across trophic levels cumb tl is thus a sigmoidal curve i e a curve fig 1e with an inflection point reflective of this rhomboidal nature fig 1b and unimodal approximately normal log distribution of biomass across tl fig 1c the cumb tl curves exhibit a typical s shaped pattern that seems to hold regardless of type of ecosystem or type of data used to construct them pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2014 the cumb cump curves also tend to consistently exhibit a hockey stick shaped curve fig 1f broader examination has confirmed the existence and commonality of these curves from over 200 different marine ecosystems around the planet and demonstrated repeatable consistent and predictable changes in curve shapes due to perturbations that can modify trophodynamic features of large marine ecosystems lmes pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 in this context we note that perturbations do not modify the fundamental shape of cumulative curves but rather their key features fig 1g 1h in a stylized example of the cumb tl curve fig 1g link et al 2015 perturbations result in changes in the s shaped curve over time that become less steep and move toward low tls for example fishing causes depletion of biomass of upper trophic levels and prevalence of lower trophic levels as highlighted by the fishing down the food web phenomenon pauly et al 1998 in the cumulative theory this would be hypothesized to result in the flattening and shrinking of the s shaped cumb tl curve fig 1g eutrophication similarly increases the proportion of lower tl biomasses micheli 1999 and species invasions also produce overgrowth of selected lower tl species libralato et al 2015 both hypothesized to result in similar responses in the cumb tl curve fig 1g conversely ecosystem recovery results in increased steepness and movement toward upper tls of these curves fig 1g 1h these situations imply measurable changes on the major curve parameters primarily determinants of the s curve such as the biomass inflection point tl inflection point and steepness or slope which can be tracked over time to determine major shifts in condition of an ecosystem see pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 libralto et al 2020 they thus correspond to and detect changes from many instances of known marine ecosystem perturbation for example the gulf of mexico large marine ecosystem has experienced notable perturbations due to the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill which has resulted in numerous changes to trophic structure and ecosystem function ainsworth et al 2021 woodstock et al 2021 those changes have also been detected in cumb tl curves for the gulf of mexico libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 these three simple curve parameters represent emergent properties of lmes with a surprising degree of insight into ecosystem structure and functioning thus the cumulative curves hold some promise in delineating regions of ecosystem state that require management action more so the behavior of these curves under a varying set of conditions warrants further examination there are major mechanisms whereby marine populations their resulting food webs and ultimately the resulting trophodynamics of marine ecosystems can be perturbed or recovered these mechanisms group largely into changes to production or growth on the one hand versus changes to mortality or removals on the other with perhaps some rewiring of the efficiency of internal transfer dynamics here we explore this in further detail for a simulated food chain with seven trophic levels using deconstructed features of the simple trophic transfer equation eq 1 2 methods 2 1 model taking eq 1 in discretized form for distinct i e integer trophic levels one can back calculate production and biomass for each tl the production p at any given trophic level tl is effectively obtained by the transfer efficiency declination of primary production pp 2 p t l p p t e t l 1 c f lindeman 1942 as described further in libralato et al 2008 2014 as estimates of biomass are often harder to obtain across all taxa in an ecosystem one can use common ranges of production to biomass ratios p b shannon and jarre teichmann 1999 heymans and baird 2000 heymans et al 2004 from the p b ratio one can obtain biomass b at a given tl as 3 b t l p t l p b t l for some scenarios we wanted to harvest i e some form of removal some of the taxa or at least use a variable form of mortality m as a placeholder this removal r e g fisheries catch other mortality etc was estimated as 4 r t l p t l 1 e m s e l e c t i v i t y t l where ptl is as before and the selectivity is the amount the production at the trophic level subject to mortality and which leads to the realized production accounting for any such mortality pr as 5 p r p t l r t l and then the realized biomass accounting for catch or other sources of mortality that is removed br as 6 b r t l p r t l p b t l 2 2 curves and scenarios the preceding values i e b p and pr were calculated for all steps of the food chain up to tl 7 these were based on the initial pp level and assumptions of realistic values for te and p b then the values particularly p and b were summed across tl to obtain cumulative biomass cumb and cumulative production cump the cumb discrete data was plotted against each tl and cump was plotted against cumb for each of the scenarios evaluated see below c f fig 1e f there are many potential curve features one can estimate from the s and hockey stick shaped curves respectively pranovi et al 2014 link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 but we do not present all of these here as our primary focus was to examine the shape size and magnitude of the s and hockey stick shaped curves we present these basic s curve and hockey stick shaped plots for each set of scenarios we explored these two distinct curves across a range of simulated conditions these are loosely grouped into bottom up driven features that include changes in production base of the entire ecosystem as seen modified via pp in growth as modified via p b ratios across various tls and top down driven features such as mortality as modified by m and selectivity a type of tl based evaluation of mortality across various tls furthermore scenarios exploring changes in overarching internal ecosystem properties i e the efficiency of the food web as modified by te were explored a special set of scenarios representing two common major pressures facing marine ecosystems overfishing and eutrophication as modified via a combination of parameters were also examined table 1 for eutrophication the parameters were set to initially mimic increased production but then as higher levels of eutrophication occurred less production and increases in non fishing mortality were parameterized to reflect the dynamics of eutrophication the overfishing scenarios were parameterized to reflect not only fishing mortality but also increases of selectivity for various trophic levels the full suite of scenarios aimed to answer the following questions are these pressures resulting in major changes to the realized trophodynamics of a marine ecosystem how much do different pressures affect the cumulative curves and does the cumulative curve theory explain observed results for each set of scenarios except the special mixed scenarios we held all parameters constant as in the base scenario except the variable under examination table 1 the levels of changes in each scenario were intended to cover a range of plausible ecosystem conditions that represent perturbed or recovered states as realized via the various common mechanisms that can impact marine ecosystems we present each set of resulting cumb and cump curves for the range of scenarios and also key curve parameters and features relative to the base scenario to demonstrate the magnitude of the scenario response 3 results overall we ran 35 different scenarios in addition to the base case to explore the many possible ways in which marine food webs can respond to different pressures effectively these were in the very high high medium low very low categories of each of the possible top down or bottom up mechanisms that can influence marine ecosystem trophodynamics when examining the results of these various model runs it is helpful to compare them to the base case scenario for each particular suite of scenarios table 2 it is also helpful to compare them more broadly to fig 1g and 1h when ascertaining whether the magnitude and direction a particular scenario result was positive or negative one can see the stretching and growing of the curves to indicate positive or recovery dynamics whereas a shrinking and moving towards the origin can indicate negative or perturbation dynamics fig 2 7 table 2 for the production scenarios fig 2 the response is as one would expect from cumulative trophic theory with lower basal production the s shaped curve flattens out and loses both its steepness and clear inflection point at lower to mid trophic levels as well as lowering the amount of total cumulative biomass observed fig 2a table 2 conversely as production increases the s shaped curve becomes more pronounced and heightens the s shape with ultimately a higher cumulative biomass observed fig 2a table 2 the cump cumb curve shows the classical very expected pattern of a shrinking hockey stick fig 1h with the curve becoming smaller and closer to the origin as production declines fig 2b table 2 among all the sets of scenarios these production scenarios tended to show the largest departure from the baseline table 2 with changes much greater than 100 in many cases larger than 200 from the base scenario in another bottom up set of scenarios changing the growth at various tls has some seemingly counterintuitive results fig 3 the s shaped curve shows that an increase in growth for tl 1 3 or across all tls the curve actually shrinks and flattens fig 3a similar to a lower production situation fig 2a table 2 the opposite occurs for an increase in those tls with the s shaped curve enlarging fig 3a the cump cumb curve effectively maintained the same shape but the blade of the hockey stick begins at higher biomass levels with an actual decrease growth at tl 1 3 or across all tls fig 3b table 2 conversely the blade shifts to lower cumulative biomass with higher growth rates at these various tls fig 3b table 2 the results for changing growth for tl 5 or any higher tl not shown are effectively the same on both curves and don t fundamentally differ from the base case scenario fig 3 why lower or slower growth leads to an increase in the curves and opposite of what would be expected fig 1 is likely deduced from the growth term i e p b being in the denominator eq 6 when calculating biomass from production at each tl and hence when integrated results in cumb being higher the production and cump do not fundamentally differ in these scenarios fig 3b we best understand this to be that faster higher growth rates tend to result in lower standing biomass due to higher turnover rates of said biomass odum and barrett 1971 gasol et al 1997 these scenarios had very few instances that were greater than 40 difference from the base scenario except when changing growth at all tls i e the all tl scenarios results from exploring transfer efficiency were as expected fig 1g h albeit with an important nuance from either production or growth fig 4 lower tes resulted in a flattened s shaped curve fig 4a table 2 and shorter closer to the origin cump cumb hockey stick curves fig 4b table 2 and the opposite held higher tes results in larger hockey sticks fig 4b table 2 and more pronounced s shaped curves fig 4a the s shaped curves in all three of these bottom up figs 2b 4b scenarios could be effectively interchangeable but the cump cumb curves in these scenarios are more distinct with the curves at lower tes shrinking and being both closer to the origin and with much less cumulative biomass i e the handle of the hockey stick is shorter both the te fig 4b and production fig 2b cump cumb curves shrink and have smaller cumulative production at lower levels whereas the growth cump cumb curve fig 3b has the same amount of cumulative production and a much less pronounced decline in cumulative biomass in the te scenarios with higher te there is more production transferring to upper trophic levels and the effect on the handle of the hockey stick is more noticeable fig 4b table 2 with the highest level of cumulative biomass among all of the scenarios explored all the moderate high or higher te scenarios showed notable changes from the base scenario for the cumb tl curve but effectively no changes to the cump cumb curve table 2 shifting emphasis to more top down considerations the mortality scenarios fig 5 match what would be expected with an increase in perturbation fig 1g h l k the s shaped curves are more pronounced at lower mortality levels and flatten out at higher mortality levels fig 5a table 2 although opposite in mechanism and hence sign i e here the highest levels are the lowest curves the s shaped curves in these mortality scenarios fig 5a are qualitatively similar to the prior s shaped curves noted fig 2a 4a that is lowering mortality has the same response as increasing production or te the same holds true for the cump cumb curves fig 5b the hockey stick similarly enlarges or shrinks and moves toward the origin at lower and higher mortality levels respectively fig 5b table 2 the cump cumb curves do not fundamentally exceed a cumulative production but those values do decline with higher mortalities fig 5b table 2 the cumulative biomasses similarly decline with increased mortality fig 5b table 2 these mortality scenarios show moderate changes from the base scenario for the cumb tl curve and very minor changes for the cump cumb curve table 2 the selectivity scenarios show similar but less pronounced responses fig 6 as the mortality scenario curves fig 5 there is less difference in the s shaped curves fig 6a table 2 and the scenarios that essentially test how much of a tl that is available for removal e g mortality fishing etc has less of an impact again higher effects across various tls resulted in a shallower s shape and vice versa fig 6a table 2 the cump cumb curves fig 6b table 2 similarly exhibited the same type of responses seen in the mortality scenario curves fig 5b but again were less pronounced the difference in cumulative production across most of these scenarios was less than 5 the exception is the highest selectivity effect which had notably lower cumulative production this effect resulted from allowing for availability to potential removal of both tl 1 and 2 in that particular scenario similar to the mortality scenarios these selectivity scenarios had relatively minor differences to the base scenario table 2 the final set of scenarios were meant to exemplify two common pressures facing marine ecosystems i e overfishing and eutrophication both overfishing scenarios show a flattening and shrinking of the s shaped curve relative to the baseline fig 7 a table 2 as would be expected fig 1g k the cump cumb curves similarly show a shrinking and shortening of the hockey stick though the starting overfishing scenario i e mild impacts are relatively close to the base case scenario fig 7b table 2 the full overfishing scenario had significantly eroded cumulative biomass almost by a factor of two the eutrophication scenarios are more nuanced as eutrophication initiates the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and cump cumb curve fig 7b shows an increase and even extension of cumulative biomass consistent with an increase in production scenarios fig 2 as eutrophication sets in it actually flattens the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and though it raises the cump cumb curve does not increase available cumulative biomass fig 7b table 2 at strong eutrophication both the s shaped curve fig 7a table 2 and cump cumb curves fig 7b table 2 exhibit patterns consistent with severe declines in production fig 2 or increases in mortality fig 5 reflective of the combined effects of severe eutrophication 4 discussion our model simulation results demonstrate that cumulative trophic theory can predict consistent and repeatable patterns in response to a range of common pressures facing marine ecosystems these generally conform to a broad set of empirical observations pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 and confirm the expected responses to positive i e recovery or negative i e perturbation conditions link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 that they arise from a relatively simple trophic transfer equation has high utility across all these simulated scenarios a few observations emerge first is that the s and hockey stick shaped curves are repeated across the various impacting mechanisms for this generic marine ecosystem although they did change shapes no one scenario entirely obliterated these curve shapes as expected from cumulative trophic theory fig 1e f that the s and hockey stick shaped curves were generally retained may be further evidence for the widespread utility of these patterns and the possible benefits of approaches that consider them second the response of increasing top down pressures or decreasing bottom up factors generally resulted in responses on these curves consistent with perturbation fig 1g k that the general responses shrunk decreased and moved toward the origin regardless of specific mechanism of change demonstrates the common directional responses to perturbation as well as the validity of the cumulative trophic theory the converse holds as well the response of increasing bottom up factors and decreasing top down pressures generally resulted in responses consistent with recovery of marine ecosystems another observation is that these scenarios demonstrate that they can accommodate nuances to a suite of conditions as seen in the growth or eutrophication scenarios that these curves are able to detect and present these nuances in eutrophication is useful being able to address non linear or at least non obvious responses is requisite for a theoretical approach to be flexible enough to meet and survive real world situations even if they are simulated these simulations resulted in predictable repeatable common and consistent patterns that observation is not trivial flattening the s curve and shrinking the hockey stick under degrading scenarios and vice versa are in line with what one would expect from the cumulative trophic theory link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 that these patterns repeat under a wide range of simulated conditions and possible mechanisms is further evidence that this theory truly does describe major emergent features of marine ecosystem dynamics most pressures are relatively straightforward to understand as are the cumulative curve responses increasing top down or decreasing bottom up factors micheli 1999 collie and delong 2001 lotze and milewski 2004 frank 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 results in readily observable perturbations to marine ecosystems conversely increasing bottom up and decreasing top down factors lotze and milewski 2004 myers and worm 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 lynam et al 2017 results in relaxation of these pressures and even potential recovery of marine ecosystems changes in bottom up drivers responded as expected as did changes in top down pressures but what about more specific cases selected tl removals that mimic apex predator reduction libralato et al 2008 or fishing through the food web at lower to mid tls essington et al 2006 also had responses that would be expected given that the cumulative trophic theory was able to accommodate two examples of common pressures facing marine ecosystems overfishing and eutrophication that have more multi faceted mechanisms is also not trivial and a valuable outcome e g piroddi et al 2021 other common pressures that warrant testing in future studies include changing thermal conditions with particular temperature links to growth or production libralato et al 2015 bentley et al 2017 serpetti et al 2017 changes in acidification ph and related chemical responses linked to mortality or growth zunino et al 2021 changes in multiple ocean uses across many sectors douvere and ehler 2009 white et al 2012 efficacy of certain marine ecosystem management measures including marine protected areas walters 2000 wood et al 2008 food web biomagnification of toxins plastics and other chemicals kelly et al 2007 diepens and koelmans 2018 or even siting of offshore energy and impacts on ecological functioning gill 2005 among others collectively this suite of scenarios demonstrates that the cumulative trophic theory and the cumb tl and cump cumb curves can capture and predict the dynamics of marine ecosystems one seemingly counterintuitive response that warrants further exploration is the results seen from increasing growth as treated here we represented growth as p b ratios shannon and jarre teichmann 1999 heymans and baird 2000 heymans et al 2004 as a result of that term being in the denominator of some core equations to back calculate biomass eq 6 increased growth resulted in a decline in overall standing biomass though this did not ultimately impact production and cumulative production it did alter the accumulation of biomass along the trophic chain and thus the cumulative biomass again we understand this to be indicative that faster higher growth rates tend to result in lower standing biomass due to higher turnover rates of said biomass odum and barrett 1971 gasol et al 1997 others have postulated that higher growth leads to higher standing biomass dortch and packard 1989 gasol et al 1997 and we understand that argument as well here we also accounted for removals of said biomass so we suspect that is why our results align with those associated with the turnover rate explanation given that there is high standing biomass at intermediate trophic levels in marine ecosystems deyoung et al 2004 link et al 2015 could also give undue weight to changes in growth for those organisms at least in terms of cumulative responses this is an area that merits further examination an important aspect of trophodynamics is the concept of trophic level lindeman 1942 libralato et al 2014 shannon et al 2014 here we treat tl as an integer for simplicity in calculations certainly there is debate about what a non integer tl means odum and heald 1975 christensen and pauly 1992 pauly and watson 2005 shannon et al 2014 and we appreciate that for a given taxa of marine species that the tl is not fixed across size life history seasonality geographic location etc polis and strong 1996 woodward and hildrew 2002 layman et al 2005 hunt and mckinnell 2006 fort et al 2010 costalago et al 2012 we suspect that integrating a more continuous treatment of tl that also considers the pathways of interactions among species e g o gorman and emmerson 2009 and pressures e g agnetta et al 2019 in the food web that are more complicated than in a linear food chain will result in broadly comparable results and preliminary examinations tend to confirm that suspicion future work examining a continuous treatment of tl beyond the discrete approach presented here is warranted as well as the analysis using complex ecosystem models that might detect potential counterintuitive effects and also might provide further support to the cumulative theory link et al 2015 they could also be used as tools to test thresholds libralato et al 2019 one intriguing aspect of the core trophic transfer equation eq 1 is the value of the transfer efficiency itself that term alone merits further consideration transfer efficiency is often central to the results in analyses like these link et al 2015 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 eddy et al 2021 as well as many marine food web and ecosystem models e g christensen and pauly 1992 heymans and baird 2000 pauly et al 2000 libralato et al 2004 typically te is assumed to be approximately 10 which came from very early studies lindeman 1942 odum and barrett 1971 may 1976 pauly and christensen 1995 though more recent studies reviews and meta analyses suggest that te is somewhat higher libralato et al 2008 there is no means to directly measure te in a marine food web at least across entire tls and thus the te term is highly derived although what we present here spans the likely range of values colléter et al 2014 2015 heymans et al 2014 eddy et al 2021 it was obvious that the value of this te term had large effects on model results a prior sensitivity analysis unpublished data similarly demonstrated the impact of changing the te term in the current context this hyper responsiveness to changes in some te scenarios is seen in the response of the cumulative curves thus not only for this particular context but for trophic ecology more generally we recommend further examination and exploration of the assumptions surrounding te as well as novel ways to estimate or measure it odum 1969 jorgensen 2001 notes that ecosystems tend to optimize the use of energy by modulating their trophic structure along a continuum between high levels of energy flow early development stages and high levels of standing biomass mature development stages these ecosystem development stages seem to be well accommodated by the cumulative trophic theory and associated curves with modifications to curve properties corresponding to the different ends of the ecosystem maturity continuum odum 1969 for instance the shrinking of the cumb tl curve under perturbed conditions could very well be related to a reduction of the standing biomass and hence increased energy flows and even a reduced system capability to saturate the use of available energy e g increasing losses and wastes of metabolic expenditures or the presence of bottle necks in the food web energy transfer the cumulative trophic theory has not been developed without broader context yet further exploration of how it is connected to other means of framing and understanding ecosystem dynamics is warranted we particularly note that the cumulative trophic theory here has been explored in marine ecosystems how applicable it is to other types of non aquatic ecosystems remains an interesting question the value of any theory is often heightened in how it handles caveats or nuanced circumstances here the cumulative trophic theory was able to accommodate those especially in the growth selectivity and eutrophication scenarios recognizing that for example eutrophication is not linear nor uni directional is important and we were able to represent that nuance in this model construction a relatively simple equation when explored in multiple views with a particular emphasis on cumulative emergent features can provide a surprising amount of insight into marine food web dynamics testing any theory no matter how simple benefits from mathematical formulation simulation sensitivity analyses and application to near real world conditions caswell 1988 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 cariboni et al 2007 here we demonstrate that the cumulative trophic theory can be confronted with and survive those conditions the value of the cumulative trophic curves remains high and is improved even further by this theoretical simulated treatment of its features the commonality of s and hockey stick shaped curves is growing with each study that actually looks at cumulative biomass and production pranovi and link 2009 pranovi et al 2012 2014 2020 link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 such that these patterns are observed in essentially every marine ecosystem that has been examined certainly additional marine and aquatic ecosystems warrant cumulative curve examinations as do terrestrial ecosystems to verify the ubiquity and veracity of this theory and its predictions beyond the large marine ecosystem context yet the global observations from over 200 marine ecosystems link et al 2015 pranovi et al 2020 from over 70 years of data libralato et al 2019 and across a wide range of perturbations and histories is compelling evidence suggestive that this cumulative trophic theory has continued merit our ability to predict and repeat the responses of these curves to common pressures via known mechanisms increases the utility of these cumulative emergent properties of marine ecosystems the application of cumulative trophic theory for the wise management of marine ecosystems has higher utility knowing we can more repeatedly and comfortably predict their responses to a wide range of conditions thus the applications that may follow might prove useful for the even wiser management of marine ecosystems link et al 2015 2020 libralato et al 2019 pranovi et al 2020 more so that a relatively simple equation can depict capture and predict such a wide range of marine ecosystem dynamics across a broad array of situations is not trivial and further suggests the robustness of the cumulative trophic theory author credit

24521,a mathematical model is developed to investigate the effect of harvesting zone configuration upon total biomass yield of a resource species with size dependent continuum spatiotemporal

traditional approach of viewing size as a structure parameter the model takes a form of a coupled system of partial differential equations pde of reaction diffusion type for the population density and first order hyperbolic transport type for the mass state variable the model was investigated both analytically and numerically and is illustrated by applying it to the harvesting of a brown shrimp

time and discrete structure models caswell 2001 are currently available as tools for modeling structured populations in order to limit model complexity one often restricts consideration to a single structural phenomenon in spite of obvious compelling arguments for studying the impact of multiple interacting structural effects for combining spatial inhomogeneity with age or size structure can lead to increased predictive power and enhanced biological understanding of a populations dynamical behavior over spatially homogeneous models one approach of modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of a population structured by mass or size in general is to treat mass as a continuous structuring parameter and develop a partial differential equation model 1 n t x w t γ t x w n t x w w n t x w v t x w δ t x w in which n w γ and δ denote density in number individual mass individual growth and per capita death respectively and v is a velocity vector field modeling spatial transport turner 1999 births are handled through an initial condition with respect to the mass variable 2 n t w b w b β t w n t w d w 3 n 0 w n 0 w for w b w where β t w is the per capita fecundity for individuals with the mass w and w b is the birth mass however when mass is modeled as a structural parameter the dimensionality of the partial differential equation 1 is increased by one compared with the model without mass structure this is computationally expensive here we develop a model that introduces mass as an additional dependent variable rather than a structural parameter for this we will add an additional partial differential equation with the same space and time dimensionality as the corresponding model without mass however it is computationally less expensive than the model with mass as an additional independent variable 1 therefore the new model will be a computationally more efficient for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of number of individuals and mass of a population than the traditional model we call this model a density and mass model then we will apply the model to hypothetical scenarios of shrimp fisheries this paper is organized as follows first we derive the model second the model is analytically investigated then the model is parameterized for a shrimp population and it is numerically investigated for various scenarios with regard to allocation of fishing effort finally the results are discussed 2 derivation of model in this section 2 1 we discuss our approach of mass dependent population dynamics model and derive the density and mass model starting with conservation laws for biomass and number density we define average mass mass per individual and we show how the basic model is derived we assume a spatially uniform distribution of number and mass in 2 1 1 and derive the growth model we add a spatial transport term to the system of ordinary differential equations odes derived and obtain a system of coupled nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations pdes in 2 1 2 the mass dependent transport coefficient yields a system of coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pdes to track density and mass of a population at location x and time t in 2 2 we discuss the boundary conditions for mass model 2 1 density and mass model our approach to introduce a measure of mass is to track number density n x t and biomass density ρ x t of a population we define number density n x t to be the number of individuals in a population per unit domain the domain is a unit length in a 1 d model and unit area in a 2 d model biomass density ρ x t is defined as the total biomass per unit domain we define the measure of mass through 4 w x t ρ x t n x t which is the average mass per individual at location x at time t conservation laws allow for interactions between a system and the universe outside of the system that is they allow for population growth population decline immigration emigration accretion and ablation of mass this law will be used in the derivation of density and mass model which will be discussed in the following subsection in a continuum approach to modeling a population with spatial effects movements of individual must be understood at a population level that is population density spreads throughout a region rather than keep tracking of the motion of individuals such a population spread is often modeled through a diffusive process a convenient way to include this effect is through introduction of a velocity function v t x for a population defined on region r which describes movement of the population over the region in particular the spread of a population density u t x is said to be diffusive if the velocity vector of the population density is proportional to the negative density gradient that is v t x can be constitutively written as 5 u t x v t x μ u t x where μ is the diffusion coefficient thus the constitutive choice in expression 5 means that the population move in the direction of maximum decrease of number of individuals turner 1999 tracking both number n x t and biomass ρ x t densities and the assumption of diffusive transport lead to two natural choices for the velocity vector field v namely 6 v μ ρ ρ or 7 v μ n n where μ denotes the transport coefficient one might model the number density n x t as follows 8 n t n v d b 0 this equation says how number density changes due to diffusive transport v birth b and death d in addition to the birth and death rates growth of an individual affects the biomass density let g be the growth rate function that is the rate at which an individual grows which accounts for the change in the average mass the conservation law for biomass density and biomass ρ x t is given by 9 ρ t ρ v w d b n g 0 where d is the death rate b is the birth rate and g is the growth rate functions eq 9 is the conservation law for biomass density and the equation defines how biomass evolves due to transport birth death and growth using the definition of average mass 4 in 8 and 9 we derive the following pde for average mass 10 w v w g this equation determines how average mass of a population changes due to movement and growth the reader is referred to appendix a for a detailed derivation of 10 we are interested in tracking number density and average mass of a population velocity vector v is given as 11 v μ n n further taking μ to be a constant results in 12 n μ δ n b d 13 w μ n w n g henceforth we refer to number density and average mass as density and mass respectively both of these terms still retain their definitions density is the number of individuals per unit domain and mass means mass per individual average mass the above system of equations although obtained after several simplifying assumptions are still very complicated to analyze eq 12 is a parabolic partial differential equation whereas eq 13 is a first order hyperbolic partial differential equation here b d and g denote the birth death and growth processes which are functions of density n and mass w to study the equilibrium behavior of the system we set b d 0 12 becomes the classical diffusion equation regardless of the initial state solutions to the heat equation are infinitely smooth this depends on the boundary conditions when g 0 eq 13 becomes a first order homogeneous hyperbolic pde 14 w v w 0 suppose v is constant there now exists a closed form solution when v is constant the solutions of hyperbolic pde 14 are traveling waves in higher dimensions when v v x rather than v being a constant a similar method of solution again leads to traveling solutions however the assumption v v x can lead to what are known as shocks this means a dramatic change in the mass of species over a small time period i e a singularity in the gradient of mass w the seemingly simple system of partial differential equations 12 and 13 is in fact quite complicated to analyze very little is known about its mathematical properties if its inherited from parabolic like first equation 12 or hyperbolic like second equation 13 or if its behavior entirely different from either type we would like to investigate if the system develops shocks or its solutions are smooth function of x for all time t indeed its equilibria correspond to the solutions of the system 15 n 0 16 w 0 this gives a coupled system of pdes in the spatial variable x 17 μ δ n b d 18 μ n w n g such systems can have multiple solutions among the possible solutions are the spatially homogeneous ones 19 b n w d n w 20 g n w 0 these are the equilibria for system of odes also it is not known if these are the only solutions of the spatially dependent equilibrium eqs 17 and 18 nevertheless in spite of lack of well developed theory for the system 12 and 13 it still offers an attractive approach to modeling mass and space dependent population dynamics in the next section we derive the growth model 2 1 1 derivation of growth model to derive the growth model we first assume spatially uniform distributions that is n t and w t are functions of time only where n t denotes the number of individuals and w t denotes the mass per individual let ρ t n t w t denote the biomass density we now discuss the mathematical representations of nonlinear birth b n w death d n w and growth g n w processes 21 b n w β w w m n 1 ρ k 22 d n w d n 23 g n w ψ w m w 1 ρ k where β d and ψ are instantaneous birth death and growth rates that can be functions of mass w here w m is the characteristic mass defined as the maximum mass an individual can attain before the carrying capacity k is defined it is important to know the meaning of the term parent stock according to the definition of international council for the exploration of the sea ices ices 2012 parent stock means total weight of all sexually mature fish in the stock the carrying capacity in the parent stock k is the total biomass per unit domain nonlinear birth function 21 gives how the number of individuals in a population changes due to instantaneous birth rate β which is modified by density dependence and mass density dependent death is given by 22 the mathematical representation for nonlinear growth function 23 shows how mass changes due to instantaneous growth rate ψ also it is important to note that this is the von bertalanffy growth equation sparre and venema 1998 the rate of growth of an individual declines with mass until it reaches its maximum mass that is mass is capped by the maximum mass the environment can support the model to track number of individuals takes the form 24 n t b n t w t d n t w t eq 24 represents the number balance and it says how number of individuals changes due to birth and death at time t the growth equation for mass w t is derived considering how the biomass ρ t evolves due to birth death and growth to that end we consider the biomass balance 25 ρ t n t g n t w t w b b n t w t d n t w t w where w b denote the birth mass differentiating biomass density ρ t 26 ρ t n t w t with respect to time t one gets 27 ρ t n t w t n t w t rewriting the above expression for change in the mass w t we have 28 w t ρ t n t n t w t n t now using expression for change in number of individuals 24 and change in biomass 25 in 28 and after doing some algebra we get the growth model 29 w t g n t w t b n t w t n w b w one can augment 24 and 29 with spatial transport terms to obtain the system of partial differential equations to track density and mass of a population at a space variable x and time t 30 n μ δ n b n w d n w 31 w μ n w n b n w n w b w g n w the coupled nonlinear system of pdes 30 and 31 arising from our modeling effort will be henceforth referred to as the density and mass model as a first step to understanding our model we reduce the model to 1 d system of coupled nonlinear parabolic hyperbolic partial differential equations 32 n t μ 2 n x 2 b n w d n w 33 w t μ 1 n n x w x b n w n w b w g n w where n x t and w x t are the density and mass of a population respectively here b n w d n w and g n w are the nonlinear birth death and growth terms defined above 21 23 also μ is the transport coefficient and w b is the mass at birth eq 32 gives density of the population at a location x and time t it is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and mortality the first term describes diffusion random motion of a population the second term represents density dependent reproduction and the last term denotes the density dependent death the mass of a population at a location x and time t is given by 33 and is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and growth the first term describes transport of a population the second term represents change in mass due to birth mass and reproduction negative sign signifies as birth increases the mass goes down i e individuals are born with a smaller size the third term captures change in the mass due to growth and it also caps the mass at the maximum 2 1 2 density and mass model with mass dependent transport coefficients the assumption that the transport coefficient depends on the mass applied to the system of coupled nonlinear parabolic 32 and hyperbolic 33 pde discussed in section 2 1 2 yields a system of coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pdes to track density and mass of a population at location x and time t for illustrative purposes we consider a mass dependent transport coefficient μ μ 1 w of the form 34 μ μ 1 1 w w m giving rise to the system of partial differential equations 35 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x b n w d n w 36 w t μ 1 1 w w m 1 n n x w x b n w n w b w g n w where n x t and w x t are the density and mass of a population respectively at a spatial variable x and time t all other quantities are as previously defined the constitutive choice 34 means when mass approaches the maximum mass that is when the species grows to its maximum size diffusive transport gets shuts down that is the system is driven to equilibrium now substituting the nonlinear functions b n w d n w and g n w 21 22 23 in above reaction diffusion and hyperbolic system of partial differential equations 35 and 36 37 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x β w w m n 1 ρ k d n 38 w t μ 1 1 w w m 1 n n x w x β w w m 1 ρ k w b w ψ w m w 1 ρ k our assumption is that the system under consideration is closed in the sense that individuals in a population are being isolated from the outside world the mathematical condition arising from this biological property is that there is no flux of any individuals through the boundary turner 1999 thus for a closed ecosystem the system of pdes must be augmented by initial conditions 39 n x 0 n 0 x w x 0 w 0 x and no flux boundary conditions this is all that we can assert for a closed ecosystem 40 n x t a 0 n x t b 0 this cannot be assumed the discussion on bc s clarifies the issue 41 w x t a 0 w x t b 0 where a b is the domain length eq 37 helps to track density of the population at location x and time t it is controlled by four processes diffusion transport reproduction and mortality the first term in the right hand side of eq 37 describes diffusion that is random motion of species with a mass dependent coefficient the second term of eq 37 shows how transport brings in change in density density dependent reproduction and death are represented by the third and the fourth term of eq 37 respectively the mass of species at location x and time t is given by 38 and is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and growth the first term in the right hand side of eq 38 describes transport of species with mass dependent coefficient the second term of eq 38 represents change in mass due to reproduction negative sign signifies as birth increases the average mass goes down the third term of eq 38 captures change in the average mass due to growth and it shows average mass is capped by the mass which the environment can support 2 2 a note on boundary conditions for w x t eq 38 is a nonlinear first order hyperbolic partial differential equation posed on the domain t 0 0 x 1 when posed on the infinite domain x such equations require only a single initial condition to be well posed however when posed on a compact interval such as 0 1 the issue of appropriate boundary conditions arises the central issue is easily illustrated by considering the simple first order hyperbolic equation 42 t u x t a x u x t 0 x 0 1 t 0 43 u x 0 g x x 0 1 where a 0 is a constant introducing characteristic coordinates one finds the general solution to 42 43 to be 44 u x t g x a t the solution 44 is a traveling wave to the left along the interval 0 x 1 the key point to be emphasized is that at x 0 the left traveling wave to the boundary point x 0 completely determines the solution u 0 t whereas at x 1 the left traveling wave from the boundary point x 1 requires a boundary condition for example the zero flux condition x u 1 t 0 for all t 0 similarly if a 0 then a boundary condition is required at x 0 but cannot be imposed at x 1 more generally consider the hyperbolic equation 45 t u x t a x t x u x t 0 x 0 1 t 0 46 u x 0 g x x 0 1 there are now four cases to consider depending upon 47 a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 thus for example if a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 then boundary conditions cannot be applied to either endpoint whereas if a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 then boundary conditions must be applied to both endpoints moreover the method of characteristics gives an expression for the solution to 45 46 indeed one readily shows that 48 u x t t g x t t where for any 0 ξ 1 the characteristic curve ξ x t t is defined by x t a x t t x 0 ξ thus the solution u x t is constant on each characteristic curve the method of characteristics readily generalizes to semilinear equations for which the null right hand side of 45 is replaced by a general function f x t u and quasilinear equations for which the coefficient a x t u x t is also a function of u an interesting limiting case of 47 occurs when a 0 t 0 or a 1 t 0 suppose a 0 t 0 then appealing to the method of characteristics one concludes that u 0 t is completely determined for all time by the initial conditions so one cannot specify a boundary condition similarly for a 0 t 0 applying this observation to eq 38 it follows that if zero neumann conditions are assumed to hold for n x t then one cannot impose boundary conditions for w x t at either boundary point x 0 1 3 analysis of density and mass model in this section we show the non dimensionalization of density mass model and equilibria for the corresponding ode system towards the end of section we also derive expression for sustainable fishing rates 3 1 dimensional analysis we now discuss the dimensions of the variables and the parameters in the above system number density n x t is the total number of individuals per unit domain length with dimensions n l in one dimension the domain is a unit line and in two dimensions the

parameters ψ β and d are maximum instantaneous individual per capita average growth rate with dimensions 1 t maximum instantaneous per capita birth rate with dimensions 1 t and natural instantaneous per capita mortality rate with dimensions 1 t the transport coefficient is given by μ with dimensions l 2 t in order to reduce the number of parameters we shall non dimensionalize the system of reaction diffusion 37 and hyperbolic 38 equations to rescale time t one can choose 49 t t β t t d t t ψ our choice is 50 t t β we define l m a constant used to rescale the spatial variable x we introduce the following non dimensionalization 51 n n k m w w w m t β t x x l m where w m is the characteristic mass defined as the maximum mass individual can attain and k m is the characteristic density say 52 k m k w m using dimensionless variables 51 and 52 in system of partial differential equations 37 and 38 and dropping the tildes on the dimensionless variables 53 n t a 1 w 2 n x 2 a n x

transport death growth rates are given by 56 a μ β l m 2 ν d β c ψ β respectively in the following section we present a very brief theoretical analysis of the governing system of differential equations 53 and 54 the pde system is difficult to analyze but the ode counterpart is tractable we now include an analysis of the spatially constant equilibria 3 2 theoretical analysis of the spatially uniform density and mass model in the following subsection we discuss the ode system corresponding to spatially homogeneous solutions to the governing eqs 24 29 the corresponding dimensionless system of ordinary differential equations is 57 d n d t n w 1 n w ν n 58 d w d t c 1 n w 1 w w 1 n w w b w where n is the density w is the mass per individual average mass here dimensionless ratio ν takes two forms in the non fishing domain ν will be defined as ν n 59 ν n d β where d is the natural instantaneous per capita death rate and β is the maximum instantaneous per capita birth rate on fishing domain ν is defined as ν f where 60 ν f d f β where f is the instantaneous fishing mortality rate also 61 c ψ β w b w b w m to find all the equilibria of system of odes we set the right hand side of the above system to zero in the next subsection we analyze the equilibrium system 3 3 condition for positive equilibria yield and an expression for maximum sustainable fishing rate analysis of ode system leads to equilibrium system 62 n w 1 n w ν f 0 63 1 n w c 1 w w w w b 0 where n w are the equilibria points there are four cases 64 n 0 65 w 1 n w ν f 66 n w 1 67 c 1 w w w w b it is clear that 66 is not possible since 62 cannot be satisfied by either 64 or 65 thus 67 must hold this implies in particular that w is independent of ν and f it depends only upon c and w b for case 64 extinction n 0 and w is given by 67 hence w 0 even for extinction to test the extinction state for stability we compute the jacobian j j j 11 j 12 j 21 j 22 68 j 11 w 1 n w ν f n w 2

λ 2 c w w w b clearly λ 2 0 hence the extinction state is stable λ 1 0 w f ν biomass yield is given by 74 y f n w w n w 1 n w ν 75 w 3 n 1 ν w w n hence y is maximized when 76 n 1 ν w 2 w 77 y m a x w 4 1 ν w 2 our aim is to find an expression for maximum sustainable fishing rate f s for which we get maximum sustainable biomass yield msby in turn this allows to harvest a marine population sustainably msby is the maximum catch in weight that can be caught without depleting the population so we consider the expression 60 for dimensionless ratio ν f before deriving an expression for maximum sustainable fishing rate f s we list the possible definitions of fishing rates which will be used in this discussion 1 f is the instantaneous fishing mortality rate 2 f m a x is the maximum fishing rate that gives a nonnegative stable equilibrium 3 f s is the fishing rate that gives maximum sustainable yield msy in biomass under an ode model 4 f s is the fishing rate within a fishing

population occurs at maximum sustainable fishing rate 4 application of density mass model to shrimp fisheries 4 1 models and methods here we apply the model to brown shrimp farfantepenaeus aztecus fisheries brown shrimp spawn in deep waters 18 137 m offshore throughout the year and females typically lay 500 000 to 1 million eggs during a spawning season noaa fisheries 2016 the eggs hatch within 24 h of being fertilized lassuy 1983 and their larval stage lasts approximately 10 15 days during the larval stage they are free floating and carried by tides and currents inshore to salt marshes and estuaries where they develop into juveniles once they reach 50 66 mm they become subadults and begin to migrate offshore where they become mature adults the whole life cycle is completed in approximately one year brown shrimp is currently one of the most economically important fishery stocks in the united states fisheries economics of the united states 2018 the use of marine protected areas seasonal area closure is one of the ways shrimp is currently managed mathematical model is explored on a 1d topological space numerical simulations are done for a 1d model it is assumed that the fishing is distributed along the coastline and hence x is defined as horizontal distance the model was parameterized based on information available in the existing literature tables 1 and 2 to calculate d we used an instantaneous natural mortality rate of 0 275 per month which was multiplied by 12 months to convert the rate to annual rate nance et al 1989 for β figure 10 from nance et al 1989 was used we fitted the beverton holt curve and obtained the maximum slope 0 96 1 0 6 and finally took the natural log to convert from the finite rate to instantaneous rate for ψ we used a daily rate of 0 074 g per day in carothers and grant 1987 that was multiplied by 365 to convert to an annual rate for the diffusion rate we used three different values table 3 which were arbitrarily chosen to encompass a wide range of scenarios with regard to their spatial movements we investigated two different scenarios in the first scenario we studied the effects of spatially structured fishing mortality under this model we create zones that are fished and that are protected from fishing the latter is often referred as marine protected areas mpas we create different number of mpas but the total length of fishing and mpa zones remains constant in particular we divide the coastline into discrete zones of mpas and harvesting the domain length is compared to the coastline and 40 of the entire domain length is assumed to be the fishing zone under all models starting with one fishing zone in the middle fishing zones spread like a wave reaching the ends of coastline making up to 2 i fishing zones where i 0 1 2 3 4 with equal width in each zone except for the two fishing zone configurations mpas are equally distributed the table 4 shows the number and width of each fishing zone under each of the fishing zone configurations we vary fishing mortality and investigate how msby changes with fishing mortality rate under different fishing zone configurations in the second scenario we investigate the effects of mass dependency of natural mortality and reproduction under this scenario the chance of survival and instantaneous birth rate are higher with increase in mass to understand the mass dependency we consider three cases given in table 5 we define mass dependent natural mortality as 79 d w d m i n w m w d m a x d m i n w m w b where w m is the maximum mass an individual can attain and w b is the non dimensional birth mass 80 w b w b w m where w b is the dimensional birth mass d m i n and d m a x are the minimum and maximum natural mortality rates respectively initially we assume a low initial mass in a population that is a population consists of small individuals mathematically this means when w is close to w b then mass dependent mortality d w takes d m a x as its value ecologically natural mortality is often higher when an individual is smaller in size minello et al 1989 but when an individual grows in size w approaches w m mass dependent mortality d w approaches d m i n the nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pde system used for examining the mass dependent rates 81 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x b n w d n w 82 w t

above by maximum mass w m parameters used for this scenario chosen to highlight the effects of mass dependency are listed in tables 6 and 7 the parameters described in table 6 were used in the numerical simulations authors have tried a variety of parameter sets in the simulations the values used in the simulations were modified from table 1 to emphasize observed dynamics but the qualitative results remain the same under a wide range of parameter values the mass dependent natural mortality d w in the above table 6 is given by expression 79 4 2 results 4 2 1 sustainable biomass yield under various fishing zone configurations the effects of fishing zone configurations table 4 are investigated under different fishing mortality rate and transport rate first we applied different fishing mortality rate under five different configurations with a low transport rate then we increase the transport rate to intermediate and high rates from fig 2 it can be observed that under a low transport rate as we increase the fishing mortality rate msby increases first peaks at some intermediate fishing morality rate and gradually declines as we increase the number of fishing zones msby also increases furthermore the fishing mortality rate at msby is shifted to higher rate we note that when the number of fishing zones is increased size of each fishing zone becomes smaller although the total fishing zone remains the same our numerical results under low transport rate suggest that in a multiple fishing zone scenario with a network of mpas small mpas are effective in producing high sustainable yield the results under the medium transport rate are similar to those under low transport rate except when the number of fishing zone is increased to 16 fig 3 with 16 fishing zones the sustainable biomass yield declines rapidly with fishing mortality rate after reaching the msby when the transport rate is increased further fig 4 sustainable yield start declining rapidly almost linearly as fishing mortality is increased beyond msby under the 4 16 fishing zone cases these results suggest that mobility of species is critically important in configuring mpa 4 2 2 instantaneous biomass yield with mass dependent mortality and birth rates we now compare how the mass dependency of mortality and birth rates affects the instantaneous biomass yield of brown shrimp populations eqs 81 and 82 the non trivial equilibrium points of eqs 81 and 82 for density and mass are given by 83 n w 1 ν w w c w b c w b 2 4 c 2 here dimensionless ratio ν in the equilibrium value for density n takes two forms in the non fishing domain ν takes the form ν n 84 ν n d w β on the fishing domain b takes the form b f 85 ν f d w f β also 86 c ψ β w b w b w m the numerical results for instantaneous biomass yield over time are given in fig 5 the speed at which density and mass reaches its asymptotic value under 1 case iii was the slowest mass independent mortality and 2 case ii was the fastest mass independent reproduction whereas 3 case i was moderate mass dependent reproduction and mortality these differences drove the system 81 and 82 to equilibrium at different speeds and hence the instantaneous biomass yield fig 5 to discuss the results for scenario 2 we use case i mass dependent mortality and birth as reference and compare the results with case ii and case iii using the terms underestimate and overestimate however we note that we are not assuming that case i is the true model when both mortality and birth are mass dependent case i instantaneous biomass yield continues to go down until large time t 10 this is due to the mass dependent natural mortality d w when the individuals are smaller they die with higher rate during later period t 10 to t 60 instantaneous biomass yield increases due to mass dependent birth β w because average mass becomes large and large individuals produce more offspring which brings up the biomass this in turn increases the instantaneous biomass yield for case ii when instantaneous birth rate β is constant instantaneous biomass yield reaches the equilibrium faster and is underestimated because mass independent birth assumes mass does not affect per capita birth when natural mortality d is assumed to be a constant case iii instantaneous biomass yield is monotonically decreasing function of time and is overestimated because of mass independence of mortality rate sustainable biomass yield is highest for case i where both mortality and birth are mass dependent it can be observed from fig 5 that instantaneous biomass yield goes down for case ii at a faster rate than case i the slower declining instantaneous biomass yield for case i can be explained due to higher body mass mass dependent birth and lower mortality as body mass increases mass dependent mortality the results suggest that mass independent per capita rates either underestimate or overestimate the instantaneous biomass yield therefore mass dependent per capita rates estimate the instantaneous biomass yield more conservatively results from our model suggest the importance of mass dependence of per capita rates for understanding the sustainability of populations 5 discussion and conclusion in this study shankara narayana rao 2016 we focused on constructing a population dynamics model to track density and average mass of a population over space and time and applied the model to a brown shrimp population the system of equations resulting from our modeling approach was a coupled non linear reaction diffusion equation and hyperbolic transport equation an analysis of the ode system corresponding to the spatially homogeneous solutions of the pde system was presented but a complete theoretical analysis of the pde system remains an open task a finite difference scheme for the numerical solution to the system of coupled nonlinear pdes was developed in particular key processes controlling populations like reproduction growth mortality and transport over various spatial and temporal scales were considered three different diffusive transport rates low medium and high were considered to explore how the mobility of species between mpas and fishing zones affects 1 the density and average mass of a population in and outside the protected areas and 2 instantaneous biomass yield and sustainable biomass yield in the fishing zone a high density gradient was observed for low mobile species in the mpa due to 1 lower transport rate and 2 fewer number of individuals being transported from the mpa to the fishing zone however a low density gradient for higher number of fishing zones was observed in the scenario with highly mobile species due to 1 high transport rate and 2 a large number of individuals in mpas being transported to the fishing zones the numerical results for the instantaneous biomass yield suggest that when we establish a network of marine protected areas along a coastline starting from two mpas in one fishing zone scenario to fifteen mpas in sixteen fishing zones scenarios instantaneous biomass yield is always higher for a species with high mobility when fishing with maximum sustainable fishing rate f s sustainability was captured when the model was tested for a wide range of fishing rates with multiple fishing zones and a network of mpas the numerical results suggest that for a low mobile species even if 1 fishing rate is increased and 2 increasing the number of fishing zones biomass yield remained sustainable when low mobility species are inside the mpa they tend to remains inside then the time spent inside the projected area is more and they have more opportunity to grow larger large individuals reproduce more offspring love et al 1990 adding sustainability of the population however for medium and high mobile species when fishing at higher fishing rates f f i biomass yield declines rapidly with increase in the fishing rate when a larger number of mpas are implemented this can be explained by species movement due to the faster movement chance of being caught by fishers are more this in turn causes fewer fish to be in the protected area results from neubert 2003 suggested that optimal harvesting strategy is a spatial chattering control with infinite sequences of reserve alternative with area of intense fishing our results suggest such a strategy for highly mobile species is dangerous and there is a need to identify the mobility of species before mpa implementation spatially explicitly harvesting strategy was explored suppose that msy for a spatially uniform distribution ode models occur at the fishing rate f s when spatially explicit harvesting strategies are considered msby does not occur at f s the results show that depending on the number of fishing zones msby fishing rate is different so this suggests that when mpas are introduced the fishing rates should be adjusted to reach the msby mortality rates of marine organisms are different between different life stages caddy 1996 fujiwara 2012 it has also been demonstrated that as shrimp grow there is lower vulnerability to predation minello et al 1989 we investigated mass dependent mortality and reproduction the numerical solutions show that sustainable biomass yield was higher with mass dependent rates than mass independent rates thus the results suggest mass dependent per capita rates are critically important for understanding the sustainability of marine populations the present model can be used to study density and mass fluctuations with change in the birth death growth and transport rates for different fish populations to demonstrate the validity of the model one could compare the numerical results with available field data it is interesting to study the models for different species with different transport rates and investigate their sustainability under different fishing effort scenarios the idea of dividing the coastline into multiple fishing zones and creating a network of mpas can be explored further with models including multiple species that are interacting with each other fujiwara et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 the work in this paper is a first step to study mpa configurations using a mathematical model we use brown shrimp as an example because it is currently managed using seasonal area closures from being fished i e the most common form of marine protected areas the mass dependent model was parameterized d β ψ k using the available data carothers and grant 1987 hart 2012 nance et al 1989 there are large uncertainties in density dependent terms which are difficult parameters to estimate for almost any marine species therefore for the mass dependent model we selected parameters to emphasize general characteristics of the simulation results the main message of the work is that although we do not know the movement rate it is very important to estimate if we want to improve mpa configuration credit authorship contribution statement b veena shankara

24521,a mathematical model is developed to investigate the effect of harvesting zone configuration upon total biomass yield of a resource species with size dependent continuum spatiotemporal population dynamics size with the interpretation of average mass per individual at each spatiotemporal point is modeled as an additional state variable along with population density in contrast to the traditional approach of viewing size as a structure parameter the model takes a form of a coupled system of partial differential equations pde of reaction diffusion type for the population density and first order hyperbolic transport type for the mass state variable the model was investigated both analytically and numerically and is illustrated by applying it to the harvesting of a brown shrimp population in the gulf of mexico distributed within a patched network of hypothesized marine protection areas mpas and fishing zones the results highlight the critical role that size dependent mobility plays in determining optimal mpa network configurations keywords parabolic and hyperbolic pde density mass biomass yield mass dependent mortality and birth rates brown shrimp marine protected areas mobility sustainable fishing rates 1 introduction structured population models have become common in modeling temporal changes in the abundance of individuals over a structuring parameter such as age mass developmental stage or space for example the mckendrick partial differential equation models continuous time and continuous age models keyfitz and keyfitz 1997 diffusion advection models continuous time and continuous space models neubert 2003 integro difference equation models discrete time and continuous structure models easterling et al 2000 and matrix population models discrete time and discrete structure models caswell 2001 are currently available as tools for modeling structured populations in order to limit model complexity one often restricts consideration to a single structural phenomenon in spite of obvious compelling arguments for studying the impact of multiple interacting structural effects for combining spatial inhomogeneity with age or size structure can lead to increased predictive power and enhanced biological understanding of a populations dynamical behavior over spatially homogeneous models one approach of modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of a population structured by mass or size in general is to treat mass as a continuous structuring parameter and develop a partial differential equation model 1 n t x w t γ t x w n t x w w n t x w v t x w δ t x w in which n w γ and δ denote density in number individual mass individual growth and per capita death respectively and v is a velocity vector field modeling spatial transport turner 1999 births are handled through an initial condition with respect to the mass variable 2 n t w b w b β t w n t w d w 3 n 0 w n 0 w for w b w where β t w is the per capita fecundity for individuals with the mass w and w b is the birth mass however when mass is modeled as a structural parameter the dimensionality of the partial differential equation 1 is increased by one compared with the model without mass structure this is computationally expensive here we develop a model that introduces mass as an additional dependent variable rather than a structural parameter for this we will add an additional partial differential equation with the same space and time dimensionality as the corresponding model without mass however it is computationally less expensive than the model with mass as an additional independent variable 1 therefore the new model will be a computationally more efficient for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of number of individuals and mass of a population than the traditional model we call this model a density and mass model then we will apply the model to hypothetical scenarios of shrimp fisheries this paper is organized as follows first we derive the model second the model is analytically investigated then the model is parameterized for a shrimp population and it is numerically investigated for various scenarios with regard to allocation of fishing effort finally the results are discussed 2 derivation of model in this section 2 1 we discuss our approach of mass dependent population dynamics model and derive the density and mass model starting with conservation laws for biomass and number density we define average mass mass per individual and we show how the basic model is derived we assume a spatially uniform distribution of number and mass in 2 1 1 and derive the growth model we add a spatial transport term to the system of ordinary differential equations odes derived and obtain a system of coupled nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations pdes in 2 1 2 the mass dependent transport coefficient yields a system of coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pdes to track density and mass of a population at location x and time t in 2 2 we discuss the boundary conditions for mass model 2 1 density and mass model our approach to introduce a measure of mass is to track number density n x t and biomass density ρ x t of a population we define number density n x t to be the number of individuals in a population per unit domain the domain is a unit length in a 1 d model and unit area in a 2 d model biomass density ρ x t is defined as the total biomass per unit domain we define the measure of mass through 4 w x t ρ x t n x t which is the average mass per individual at location x at time t conservation laws allow for interactions between a system and the universe outside of the system that is they allow for population growth population decline immigration emigration accretion and ablation of mass this law will be used in the derivation of density and mass model which will be discussed in the following subsection in a continuum approach to modeling a population with spatial effects movements of individual must be understood at a population level that is population density spreads throughout a region rather than keep tracking of the motion of individuals such a population spread is often modeled through a diffusive process a convenient way to include this effect is through introduction of a velocity function v t x for a population defined on region r which describes movement of the population over the region in particular the spread of a population density u t x is said to be diffusive if the velocity vector of the population density is proportional to the negative density gradient that is v t x can be constitutively written as 5 u t x v t x μ u t x where μ is the diffusion coefficient thus the constitutive choice in expression 5 means that the population move in the direction of maximum decrease of number of individuals turner 1999 tracking both number n x t and biomass ρ x t densities and the assumption of diffusive transport lead to two natural choices for the velocity vector field v namely 6 v μ ρ ρ or 7 v μ n n where μ denotes the transport coefficient one might model the number density n x t as follows 8 n t n v d b 0 this equation says how number density changes due to diffusive transport v birth b and death d in addition to the birth and death rates growth of an individual affects the biomass density let g be the growth rate function that is the rate at which an individual grows which accounts for the change in the average mass the conservation law for biomass density and biomass ρ x t is given by 9 ρ t ρ v w d b n g 0 where d is the death rate b is the birth rate and g is the growth rate functions eq 9 is the conservation law for biomass density and the equation defines how biomass evolves due to transport birth death and growth using the definition of average mass 4 in 8 and 9 we derive the following pde for average mass 10 w v w g this equation determines how average mass of a population changes due to movement and growth the reader is referred to appendix a for a detailed derivation of 10 we are interested in tracking number density and average mass of a population velocity vector v is given as 11 v μ n n further taking μ to be a constant results in 12 n μ δ n b d 13 w μ n w n g henceforth we refer to number density and average mass as density and mass respectively both of these terms still retain their definitions density is the number of individuals per unit domain and mass means mass per individual average mass the above system of equations although obtained after several simplifying assumptions are still very complicated to analyze eq 12 is a parabolic partial differential equation whereas eq 13 is a first order hyperbolic partial differential equation here b d and g denote the birth death and growth processes which are functions of density n and mass w to study the equilibrium behavior of the system we set b d 0 12 becomes the classical diffusion equation regardless of the initial state solutions to the heat equation are infinitely smooth this depends on the boundary conditions when g 0 eq 13 becomes a first order homogeneous hyperbolic pde 14 w v w 0 suppose v is constant there now exists a closed form solution when v is constant the solutions of hyperbolic pde 14 are traveling waves in higher dimensions when v v x rather than v being a constant a similar method of solution again leads to traveling solutions however the assumption v v x can lead to what are known as shocks this means a dramatic change in the mass of species over a small time period i e a singularity in the gradient of mass w the seemingly simple system of partial differential equations 12 and 13 is in fact quite complicated to analyze very little is known about its mathematical properties if its inherited from parabolic like first equation 12 or hyperbolic like second equation 13 or if its behavior entirely different from either type we would like to investigate if the system develops shocks or its solutions are smooth function of x for all time t indeed its equilibria correspond to the solutions of the system 15 n 0 16 w 0 this gives a coupled system of pdes in the spatial variable x 17 μ δ n b d 18 μ n w n g such systems can have multiple solutions among the possible solutions are the spatially homogeneous ones 19 b n w d n w 20 g n w 0 these are the equilibria for system of odes also it is not known if these are the only solutions of the spatially dependent equilibrium eqs 17 and 18 nevertheless in spite of lack of well developed theory for the system 12 and 13 it still offers an attractive approach to modeling mass and space dependent population dynamics in the next section we derive the growth model 2 1 1 derivation of growth model to derive the growth model we first assume spatially uniform distributions that is n t and w t are functions of time only where n t denotes the number of individuals and w t denotes the mass per individual let ρ t n t w t denote the biomass density we now discuss the mathematical representations of nonlinear birth b n w death d n w and growth g n w processes 21 b n w β w w m n 1 ρ k 22 d n w d n 23 g n w ψ w m w 1 ρ k where β d and ψ are instantaneous birth death and growth rates that can be functions of mass w here w m is the characteristic mass defined as the maximum mass an individual can attain before the carrying capacity k is defined it is important to know the meaning of the term parent stock according to the definition of international council for the exploration of the sea ices ices 2012 parent stock means total weight of all sexually mature fish in the stock the carrying capacity in the parent stock k is the total biomass per unit domain nonlinear birth function 21 gives how the number of individuals in a population changes due to instantaneous birth rate β which is modified by density dependence and mass density dependent death is given by 22 the mathematical representation for nonlinear growth function 23 shows how mass changes due to instantaneous growth rate ψ also it is important to note that this is the von bertalanffy growth equation sparre and venema 1998 the rate of growth of an individual declines with mass until it reaches its maximum mass that is mass is capped by the maximum mass the environment can support the model to track number of individuals takes the form 24 n t b n t w t d n t w t eq 24 represents the number balance and it says how number of individuals changes due to birth and death at time t the growth equation for mass w t is derived considering how the biomass ρ t evolves due to birth death and growth to that end we consider the biomass balance 25 ρ t n t g n t w t w b b n t w t d n t w t w where w b denote the birth mass differentiating biomass density ρ t 26 ρ t n t w t with respect to time t one gets 27 ρ t n t w t n t w t rewriting the above expression for change in the mass w t we have 28 w t ρ t n t n t w t n t now using expression for change in number of individuals 24 and change in biomass 25 in 28 and after doing some algebra we get the growth model 29 w t g n t w t b n t w t n w b w one can augment 24 and 29 with spatial transport terms to obtain the system of partial differential equations to track density and mass of a population at a space variable x and time t 30 n μ δ n b n w d n w 31 w μ n w n b n w n w b w g n w the coupled nonlinear system of pdes 30 and 31 arising from our modeling effort will be henceforth referred to as the density and mass model as a first step to understanding our model we reduce the model to 1 d system of coupled nonlinear parabolic hyperbolic partial differential equations 32 n t μ 2 n x 2 b n w d n w 33 w t μ 1 n n x w x b n w n w b w g n w where n x t and w x t are the density and mass of a population respectively here b n w d n w and g n w are the nonlinear birth death and growth terms defined above 21 23 also μ is the transport coefficient and w b is the mass at birth eq 32 gives density of the population at a location x and time t it is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and mortality the first term describes diffusion random motion of a population the second term represents density dependent reproduction and the last term denotes the density dependent death the mass of a population at a location x and time t is given by 33 and is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and growth the first term describes transport of a population the second term represents change in mass due to birth mass and reproduction negative sign signifies as birth increases the mass goes down i e individuals are born with a smaller size the third term captures change in the mass due to growth and it also caps the mass at the maximum 2 1 2 density and mass model with mass dependent transport coefficients the assumption that the transport coefficient depends on the mass applied to the system of coupled nonlinear parabolic 32 and hyperbolic 33 pde discussed in section 2 1 2 yields a system of coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pdes to track density and mass of a population at location x and time t for illustrative purposes we consider a mass dependent transport coefficient μ μ 1 w of the form 34 μ μ 1 1 w w m giving rise to the system of partial differential equations 35 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x b n w d n w 36 w t μ 1 1 w w m 1 n n x w x b n w n w b w g n w where n x t and w x t are the density and mass of a population respectively at a spatial variable x and time t all other quantities are as previously defined the constitutive choice 34 means when mass approaches the maximum mass that is when the species grows to its maximum size diffusive transport gets shuts down that is the system is driven to equilibrium now substituting the nonlinear functions b n w d n w and g n w 21 22 23 in above reaction diffusion and hyperbolic system of partial differential equations 35 and 36 37 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x β w w m n 1 ρ k d n 38 w t μ 1 1 w w m 1 n n x w x β w w m 1 ρ k w b w ψ w m w 1 ρ k our assumption is that the system under consideration is closed in the sense that individuals in a population are being isolated from the outside world the mathematical condition arising from this biological property is that there is no flux of any individuals through the boundary turner 1999 thus for a closed ecosystem the system of pdes must be augmented by initial conditions 39 n x 0 n 0 x w x 0 w 0 x and no flux boundary conditions this is all that we can assert for a closed ecosystem 40 n x t a 0 n x t b 0 this cannot be assumed the discussion on bc s clarifies the issue 41 w x t a 0 w x t b 0 where a b is the domain length eq 37 helps to track density of the population at location x and time t it is controlled by four processes diffusion transport reproduction and mortality the first term in the right hand side of eq 37 describes diffusion that is random motion of species with a mass dependent coefficient the second term of eq 37 shows how transport brings in change in density density dependent reproduction and death are represented by the third and the fourth term of eq 37 respectively the mass of species at location x and time t is given by 38 and is controlled by three processes transport reproduction and growth the first term in the right hand side of eq 38 describes transport of species with mass dependent coefficient the second term of eq 38 represents change in mass due to reproduction negative sign signifies as birth increases the average mass goes down the third term of eq 38 captures change in the average mass due to growth and it shows average mass is capped by the mass which the environment can support 2 2 a note on boundary conditions for w x t eq 38 is a nonlinear first order hyperbolic partial differential equation posed on the domain t 0 0 x 1 when posed on the infinite domain x such equations require only a single initial condition to be well posed however when posed on a compact interval such as 0 1 the issue of appropriate boundary conditions arises the central issue is easily illustrated by considering the simple first order hyperbolic equation 42 t u x t a x u x t 0 x 0 1 t 0 43 u x 0 g x x 0 1 where a 0 is a constant introducing characteristic coordinates one finds the general solution to 42 43 to be 44 u x t g x a t the solution 44 is a traveling wave to the left along the interval 0 x 1 the key point to be emphasized is that at x 0 the left traveling wave to the boundary point x 0 completely determines the solution u 0 t whereas at x 1 the left traveling wave from the boundary point x 1 requires a boundary condition for example the zero flux condition x u 1 t 0 for all t 0 similarly if a 0 then a boundary condition is required at x 0 but cannot be imposed at x 1 more generally consider the hyperbolic equation 45 t u x t a x t x u x t 0 x 0 1 t 0 46 u x 0 g x x 0 1 there are now four cases to consider depending upon 47 a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 thus for example if a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 then boundary conditions cannot be applied to either endpoint whereas if a 0 t 0 and a 1 t 0 then boundary conditions must be applied to both endpoints moreover the method of characteristics gives an expression for the solution to 45 46 indeed one readily shows that 48 u x t t g x t t where for any 0 ξ 1 the characteristic curve ξ x t t is defined by x t a x t t x 0 ξ thus the solution u x t is constant on each characteristic curve the method of characteristics readily generalizes to semilinear equations for which the null right hand side of 45 is replaced by a general function f x t u and quasilinear equations for which the coefficient a x t u x t is also a function of u an interesting limiting case of 47 occurs when a 0 t 0 or a 1 t 0 suppose a 0 t 0 then appealing to the method of characteristics one concludes that u 0 t is completely determined for all time by the initial conditions so one cannot specify a boundary condition similarly for a 0 t 0 applying this observation to eq 38 it follows that if zero neumann conditions are assumed to hold for n x t then one cannot impose boundary conditions for w x t at either boundary point x 0 1 3 analysis of density and mass model in this section we show the non dimensionalization of density mass model and equilibria for the corresponding ode system towards the end of section we also derive expression for sustainable fishing rates 3 1 dimensional analysis we now discuss the dimensions of the variables and the parameters in the above system number density n x t is the total number of individuals per unit domain length with dimensions n l in one dimension the domain is a unit line and in two dimensions the

parameters ψ β and d are maximum instantaneous individual per capita average growth rate with dimensions 1 t maximum instantaneous per capita birth rate with dimensions 1 t and natural instantaneous per capita mortality rate with dimensions 1 t the transport coefficient is given by μ with dimensions l 2 t in order to reduce the number of parameters we shall non dimensionalize the system of reaction diffusion 37 and hyperbolic 38 equations to rescale time t one can choose 49 t t β t t d t t ψ our choice is 50 t t β we define l m a constant used to rescale the spatial variable x we introduce the following non dimensionalization 51 n n k m w w w m t β t x x l m where w m is the characteristic mass defined as the maximum mass individual can attain and k m is the characteristic density say 52 k m k w m using dimensionless variables 51 and 52 in system of partial differential equations 37 and 38 and dropping the tildes on the dimensionless variables 53 n t a 1 w 2 n x 2 a n x

transport death growth rates are given by 56 a μ β l m 2 ν d β c ψ β respectively in the following section we present a very brief theoretical analysis of the governing system of differential equations 53 and 54 the pde system is difficult to analyze but the ode counterpart is tractable we now include an analysis of the spatially constant equilibria 3 2 theoretical analysis of the spatially uniform density and mass model in the following subsection we discuss the ode system corresponding to spatially homogeneous solutions to the governing eqs 24 29 the corresponding dimensionless system of ordinary differential equations is 57 d n d t n w 1 n w ν n 58 d w d t c 1 n w 1 w w 1 n w w b w where n is the density w is the mass per individual average mass here dimensionless ratio ν takes two forms in the non fishing domain ν will be defined as ν n 59 ν n d β where d is the natural instantaneous per capita death rate and β is the maximum instantaneous per capita birth rate on fishing domain ν is defined as ν f where 60 ν f d f β where f is the instantaneous fishing mortality rate also 61 c ψ β w b w b w m to find all the equilibria of system of odes we set the right hand side of the above system to zero in the next subsection we analyze the equilibrium system 3 3 condition for positive equilibria yield and an expression for maximum sustainable fishing rate analysis of ode system leads to equilibrium system 62 n w 1 n w ν f 0 63 1 n w c 1 w w w w b 0 where n w are the equilibria points there are four cases 64 n 0 65 w 1 n w ν f 66 n w 1 67 c 1 w w w w b it is clear that 66 is not possible since 62 cannot be satisfied by either 64 or 65 thus 67 must hold this implies in particular that w is independent of ν and f it depends only upon c and w b for case 64 extinction n 0 and w is given by 67 hence w 0 even for extinction to test the extinction state for stability we compute the jacobian j j j 11 j 12 j 21 j 22 68 j 11 w 1 n w ν f n w 2

sustainably msby is the maximum catch in weight that can be caught without depleting the population so we consider the expression 60 for dimensionless ratio ν f before deriving an expression for maximum sustainable fishing rate f s we list the possible definitions of fishing rates which will be used in this discussion 1 f is the instantaneous fishing mortality rate 2 f m a x is the maximum fishing rate that gives a nonnegative stable equilibrium 3 f s is the fishing rate that gives maximum sustainable yield msy in biomass under an ode model 4 f s is the fishing rate within a fishing

population occurs at maximum sustainable fishing rate 4 application of density mass model to shrimp fisheries 4 1 models and methods here we apply the model to brown shrimp farfantepenaeus aztecus fisheries brown shrimp spawn in deep waters 18 137 m offshore throughout the year and females typically lay 500 000 to 1 million eggs during a spawning season noaa fisheries 2016 the eggs hatch within 24 h of being fertilized lassuy 1983 and their larval stage lasts approximately 10 15 days during the larval stage they are free floating and carried by tides and currents inshore to salt marshes and estuaries where they develop into juveniles once they reach 50 66 mm they become subadults and begin to migrate offshore where they become mature adults the whole life cycle is completed in approximately one year brown shrimp is currently one of the most economically important fishery stocks in the united states fisheries economics of the united states 2018 the use of marine protected areas seasonal area closure is one of the ways shrimp is currently managed mathematical model is explored on a 1d topological space numerical simulations are done for a 1d model it is assumed that the fishing is distributed along the coastline and hence x is defined as horizontal distance the model was parameterized based on information available in the existing literature tables 1 and 2 to calculate d we used an instantaneous natural mortality rate of 0 275 per month which was multiplied by 12 months to convert the rate to annual rate nance et al 1989 for β figure 10 from nance et al 1989 was used we fitted the beverton holt curve and obtained the maximum slope 0 96 1 0 6 and finally took the natural log to convert from the finite rate to instantaneous rate for ψ we used a daily rate of 0 074 g per day in carothers and grant 1987 that was multiplied by 365 to convert to an annual rate for the diffusion rate we used three different values table 3 which were arbitrarily chosen to encompass a wide range of scenarios with regard to their spatial movements we investigated two different scenarios in the first scenario we studied the effects of spatially structured fishing mortality under this model we create zones that are fished and that are protected from fishing the latter is often referred as marine protected areas mpas we create different number of mpas but the total length of fishing and mpa zones remains constant in particular we divide the coastline into discrete zones of mpas and harvesting the domain length is compared to the coastline and 40 of the entire domain length is assumed to be the fishing zone under all models starting with one fishing zone in the middle fishing zones spread like a wave reaching the ends of coastline making up to 2 i fishing zones where i 0 1 2 3 4 with equal width in each zone except for the two fishing zone configurations mpas are equally distributed the table 4 shows the number and width of each fishing zone under each of the fishing zone configurations we vary fishing mortality and investigate how msby changes with fishing mortality rate under different fishing zone configurations in the second scenario we investigate the effects of mass dependency of natural mortality and reproduction under this scenario the chance of survival and instantaneous birth rate are higher with increase in mass to understand the mass dependency we consider three cases given in table 5 we define mass dependent natural mortality as 79 d w d m i n w m w d m a x d m i n w m w b where w m is the maximum mass an individual can attain and w b is the non dimensional birth mass 80 w b w b w m where w b is the dimensional birth mass d m i n and d m a x are the minimum and maximum natural mortality rates respectively initially we assume a low initial mass in a population that is a population consists of small individuals mathematically this means when w is close to w b then mass dependent mortality d w takes d m a x as its value ecologically natural mortality is often higher when an individual is smaller in size minello et al 1989 but when an individual grows in size w approaches w m mass dependent mortality d w approaches d m i n the nonlinear reaction diffusion hyperbolic pde system used for examining the mass dependent rates 81 n t μ 1 1 w w m 2 n x 2 μ 1 n x w x b n w d n w 82 w t

above by maximum mass w m parameters used for this scenario chosen to highlight the effects of mass dependency are listed in tables 6 and 7 the parameters described in table 6 were used in the numerical simulations authors have tried a variety of parameter sets in the simulations the values used in the simulations were modified from table 1 to emphasize observed dynamics but the qualitative results remain the same under a wide range of parameter values the mass dependent natural mortality d w in the above table 6 is given by expression 79 4 2 results 4 2 1 sustainable biomass yield under various fishing zone configurations the effects of fishing zone configurations table 4 are investigated under different fishing mortality rate and transport rate first we applied different fishing mortality rate under five different configurations with a low transport rate then we increase the transport rate to intermediate and high rates from fig 2 it can be observed that under a low transport rate as we increase the fishing mortality rate msby increases first peaks at some intermediate fishing morality rate and gradually declines as we increase the number of fishing zones msby also increases furthermore the fishing mortality rate at msby is shifted to higher rate we note that when the number of fishing zones is increased size of each fishing zone becomes smaller although the total fishing zone remains the same our numerical results under low transport rate suggest that in a multiple fishing zone scenario with a network of mpas small mpas are effective in producing high sustainable yield the results under the medium transport rate are similar to those under low transport rate except when the number of fishing zone is increased to 16 fig 3 with 16 fishing zones the sustainable biomass yield declines rapidly with fishing mortality rate after reaching the msby when the transport rate is increased further fig 4 sustainable yield start declining rapidly almost linearly as fishing mortality is increased beyond msby under the 4 16 fishing zone cases these results suggest that mobility of species is critically important in configuring mpa 4 2 2 instantaneous biomass yield with mass dependent mortality and birth rates we now compare how the mass dependency of mortality and birth rates affects the instantaneous biomass yield of brown shrimp populations eqs 81 and 82 the non trivial equilibrium points of eqs 81 and 82 for density and mass are given by 83 n w 1 ν w w c w b c w b 2 4 c 2 here dimensionless ratio ν in the equilibrium value for density n takes two forms in the non fishing domain ν takes the form ν n 84 ν n d w β on the fishing domain b takes the form b f 85 ν f d w f β also 86 c ψ β w b w b w m the numerical results for instantaneous biomass yield over time are given in fig 5 the speed at which density and mass reaches its asymptotic value under 1 case iii was the slowest mass independent mortality and 2 case ii was the fastest mass independent reproduction whereas 3 case i was moderate mass dependent reproduction and mortality these differences drove the system 81 and 82 to equilibrium at different speeds and hence the instantaneous biomass yield fig 5 to discuss the results for scenario 2 we use case i mass dependent mortality and birth as reference and compare the results with case ii and case iii using the terms underestimate and overestimate however we note that we are not assuming that case i is the true model when both mortality and birth are mass dependent case i instantaneous biomass yield continues to go down until large time t 10 this is due to the mass dependent natural mortality d w when the individuals are smaller they die with higher rate during later period t 10 to t 60 instantaneous biomass yield increases due to mass dependent birth β w because average mass becomes large and large individuals produce more offspring which brings up the biomass this in turn increases the instantaneous biomass yield for case ii when instantaneous birth rate β is constant instantaneous biomass yield reaches the equilibrium faster and is underestimated because mass independent birth assumes mass does not affect per capita birth when natural mortality d is assumed to be a constant case iii instantaneous biomass yield is monotonically decreasing function of time and is overestimated because of mass independence of mortality rate sustainable biomass yield is highest for case i where both mortality and birth are mass dependent it can be observed from fig 5 that instantaneous biomass yield goes down for case ii at a faster rate than case i the slower declining instantaneous biomass yield for case i can be explained due to higher body mass mass dependent birth and lower mortality as body mass increases mass dependent mortality the results suggest that mass independent per capita rates either underestimate or overestimate the instantaneous biomass yield therefore mass dependent per capita rates estimate the instantaneous biomass yield more conservatively results from our model suggest the importance of mass dependence of per capita rates for understanding the sustainability of populations 5 discussion and conclusion in this study shankara narayana rao 2016 we focused on constructing a population dynamics model to track density and average mass of a population over space and time and applied the model to a brown shrimp population the system of equations resulting from our modeling approach was a coupled non linear reaction diffusion equation and hyperbolic transport equation an analysis of the ode system corresponding to the spatially homogeneous solutions of the pde system was presented but a complete theoretical analysis of the pde system remains an open task a finite difference scheme for the numerical solution to the system of coupled nonlinear pdes was developed in particular key processes controlling populations like reproduction growth mortality and transport over various spatial and temporal scales were considered three different diffusive transport rates low medium and high were considered to explore how the mobility of species between mpas and fishing zones affects 1 the density and average mass of a population in and outside the protected areas and 2 instantaneous biomass yield and sustainable biomass yield in the fishing zone a high density gradient was observed for low mobile species in the mpa due to 1 lower transport rate and 2 fewer number of individuals being transported from the mpa to the fishing zone however a low density gradient for higher number of fishing zones was observed in the scenario with highly mobile species due to 1 high transport rate and 2 a large number of individuals in mpas being transported to the fishing zones the numerical results for the instantaneous biomass yield suggest that when we establish a network of marine protected areas along a coastline starting from two mpas in one fishing zone scenario to fifteen mpas in sixteen fishing zones scenarios instantaneous biomass yield is always higher for a species with high mobility when fishing with maximum sustainable fishing rate f s sustainability was captured when the model was tested for a wide range of fishing rates with multiple fishing zones and a network of mpas the numerical results suggest that for a low mobile species even if 1 fishing rate is increased and 2 increasing the number of fishing zones biomass yield remained sustainable when low mobility species are inside the mpa they tend to remains inside then the time spent inside the projected area is more and they have more opportunity to grow larger large individuals reproduce more offspring love et al 1990 adding sustainability of the population however for medium and high mobile species when fishing at higher fishing rates f f i biomass yield declines rapidly with increase in the fishing rate when a larger number of mpas are implemented this can be explained by species movement due to the faster movement chance of being caught by fishers are more this in turn causes fewer fish to be in the protected area results from neubert 2003 suggested that optimal harvesting strategy is a spatial chattering control with infinite sequences of reserve alternative with area of intense fishing our results suggest such a strategy for highly mobile species is dangerous and there is a need to identify the mobility of species before mpa implementation spatially explicitly harvesting strategy was explored suppose that msy for a spatially uniform distribution ode models occur at the fishing rate f s when spatially explicit harvesting strategies are considered msby does not occur at f s the results show that depending on the number of fishing zones msby fishing rate is different so this suggests that when mpas are introduced the fishing rates should be adjusted to reach the msby mortality rates of marine organisms are different between different life stages caddy 1996 fujiwara 2012 it has also been demonstrated that as shrimp grow there is lower vulnerability to predation minello et al 1989 we investigated mass dependent mortality and reproduction the numerical solutions show that sustainable biomass yield was higher with mass dependent rates than mass independent rates thus the results suggest mass dependent per capita rates are critically important for understanding the sustainability of marine populations the present model can be used to study density and mass fluctuations with change in the birth death growth and transport rates for different fish populations to demonstrate the validity of the model one could compare the numerical results with available field data it is interesting to study the models for different species with different transport rates and investigate their sustainability under different fishing effort scenarios the idea of dividing the coastline into multiple fishing zones and creating a network of mpas can be explored further with models including multiple species that are interacting with each other fujiwara et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 the work in this paper is a first step to study mpa configurations using a mathematical model we use brown shrimp as an example because it is currently managed using seasonal area closures from being fished i e the most common form of marine protected areas the mass dependent model was parameterized d β ψ k using the available data carothers and grant 1987 hart 2012 nance et al 1989 there are large uncertainties in density dependent terms which are difficult parameters to estimate for almost any marine species therefore for the mass dependent model we selected parameters to emphasize general characteristics of the simulation results the main message of the work is that although we do not know the movement rate it is very important to estimate if we want to improve mpa configuration credit authorship contribution statement b veena shankara

24522,despite their potential to support the optimization of weed management available ecophysiological models for the simulation of crop weed interaction are still not adopted in operational contexts for some of them the reasons deal with the insufficient validation in farming conditions whereas others are either too complex for being used in operational contexts or too empiric for being free from site or context specific effects here we present a new approach weedycosmo to support strategic decisions on weed management derived from the cosmo process based model for the simulation of phytocoenosis dynamics the model dynamically reproduces on a yearly basis the interaction between crop and weeds at canopy level through the daily quantification of the suitability of each species to weather conditions and management practices as well as to the simulated system state variables dynamically predicted outputs are the relative abundance of crop and weeds and state variables for each species like e g aboveground biomass biomass of different plant organs grain yield leaf area index plant height weedycosmo was calibrated and validated using data from different sites in the jiangsu province china and in arkansas usa and years from 1982 to 2014 where different rice varieties and two major rice weeds i e red rice oryza sativa l var sylvatica and barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli l were grown in monoculture or mixture model performances were satisfying for rice crops grown in interaction with weeds relative root mean square error never exceeded 25 2 regardless of the variable considered and nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency was always higher than 0 63 despite the low number of inputs and parameters needed to run the simulations the degree of accuracy was similar to the ones achieved with other models for crop weed interaction this allows considering weedycosmo as a promising approach in light of the possible integration in decision support systems targeting operational farming conditions keywords echinochloa crus galli inter specific competition oryza sativa var sylvatica warm weedycosmo 1 introduction optimizing the use of pesticides is a priority in agricultural management because of their impact on the environment on biodiversity fletcher et al 1988 freemark and boutin 1995 on the health of farmers lopez et al 2007 and consumers ascherio et al 2006 stillerman et al 2008 as well as on farmers income however since it is hard imagining to satisfy global food demand without using pesticides seufert et al 2012 leifeld 2016 the optimization of pesticide management largely relies on limiting unnecessary applications despite differences due to the crops and contexts considered weeds are worldwide responsible for about 32 of yield losses thus representing one of the most severe biotic factors limiting global food production oerke and dehne 2004 in the case of important staple food like rice incorrect management of weeds can lead to yield losses that can exceed 60 with even higher values in case of direct sowing under aerobic conditions dass et al 2017 farmers experience may be not enough to avoid yield losses while minimizing the use of herbicides because of the complex dynamics that characterize the interactions between crops weeds environmental conditions and other management practices for this reason tools for optimizing herbicides application were developed they range from simple rule based systems to equations relating the number of weed individuals or damaged area to the treatment timing up to complex systems based on mathematical simulation models park et al 2003 ecophysiological models for the simulation of crop weed interaction e g graf et al 1990 kropff et al 1992 debaeke et al 1997 caton et al 1999 can be classified according to different criteria e g the degree of empiricism leading in this case to the identification of empiric mechanistic and mixed approaches other classifications are based on the level of abstraction in the way plants are represented individual level species level or field level models or on the spatial virtual field large area spatially explicit and temporal seasonal multi annual extent of the simulation despite such large differences many authors underlined that it is impossible to identify a priori a category of models that is better than the others the choice of a model depending on the specific objectives and conditions of application colbach 2010 as an example some authors e g renton 2013 suggested to shift from field level models to individual based ones in case the objective is the analysis of the effects of tillage on weed populations in the medium long term or in case the effects of pesticides on resistance phenomena need to be investigated despite the theoretical reasons behind shifting towards modeling approaches more detailed in the way underlying processes are represented the increase in complexity has often limited the use of models for decision making e g park et al 2003 given increasing the detail in process representation often translates into huge effort and uncertainty during model parameterization colbach 2010 some of the models potentially available to support decision making indeed are often too complex i e too many parameters and input variables to be calibrated or initialized and too sensitive to uncertainty in parameter values freckleton et al 2008 for being successfully transferred to operational farming conditions colbach et al 2014 other models for the simulation of crop weed interaction are not suitable for being implemented in decision support systems dss targeting the tactical in season management of weeds although they can be successfully used to compare management scenarios to identify strategies for weed management in the medium long term beltran et al 2011 other approaches are instead potentially suitable to be used as simulation engines within operational dss but are still insufficiently validated freckleton and stephens 2009 moreover one of the factors that often limit the adoption of models within decision support systems is their insufficient capability to reproduce long term effects of weed management strategies park et al 2003 one of the solutions to overcome these limitations is extending cropping system models already used within operational or pre operational dss e g thorp et al 2008 kadiyala et al 2015 busetto et al 2017 bonfante et al 2019 by providing them with algorithms for the simulation of key dynamics of crop weed interaction some of these models have indeed been used for years in a variety of contexts and they have been validated under operational conditions for a variety of purposes moreover their functioning and outputs are often simple enough to be understood by farmers directly thorp et al 2008 or after their implementation in dedicated software platforms e g busetto et al 2017 the main strength of this kind of models is the favourable relationship between the effort needed to run simulations parsimony for inputs and the capability to capture key aspects of the system of interest this allows obtaining outputs at canopy scale clearly understandable and suitable for decision making by relying at least partially on existing spatially distributed sources of weather soil and management data another advantage of extending existing operational crop models is the possibility to reuse the parameterizations available to estimate growth and development of cultivars and hybrids for the crops of interest thus limiting the calibration effort to weed parameters the objectives of this study were i developing a new model annual in the current configuration or crop weed interaction suitable for operational contexts i e a simulation engine for dss targeting strategic decisions and ii evaluating the model for rice and two of the most important rice weeds worldwide i e barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli l and red rice oryza sativa l var sylvatica the approach we propose extends the cosmo confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 algorithms for the simulation of the interaction among different species in phytocoenosis and it uses the warm model confalonieri et al 2009 for the simulation of growth and development of rice and weeds warm has been used since it was demonstrated to be suitable for being used in operational contexts indeed after being extensively evaluated under a variety of conditions it is already adopted for large area applications dealing with yield forecasts pagani et al 2019 and with supporting the distribution of fertilizers busetto et al 2017 and fungicides nettleton et al 2019 the reason for starting from the cosmo principles for inter specific dynamics derives from its capability of extending cropping system models already used within operational dss 2 materials and methods 2 1 a new approach for simulating rice weed interaction 2 1 1 principle the proposed approach for rice weed interaction weedycosmo derives from the generic plant community model cosmo confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 cosmo is a process based virtual field model that simulates at a daily time step annual dynamics of phytocoenosis in terms of productivity of the community and relative abundance of the different species by using weather data physical and chemical soil properties and management information it simulates community dynamics based on two assumptions i inter specific competition and changes in species relative abundance are derived from species specific responses by means of sets of suitability functions to hierarchically arranged environmental and management drivers ii parameter values of the community as a whole are daily derived from the relative abundance of each species and from the parameter values of the different species when grown in monoculture in practice the suitability of each species to the conditions explored each day is used to drive changes in the characteristics of the community changes in the relative abundance of the different species reflect in changes in the parameter values of the community which are daily used to estimate the rate variables i e changes in the values of state variables within the time step of the phytocoenosis as a whole using a single instance of a crop model using this approach the traits of the plant community codified in the parameters of the generic crop model dynamically change at each time step as a function of the suitability of each species in the community to environmental and management conditions and the only state variables that are daily integrated are those referring to the community in the case of crop weed interaction rate and state variables of crop and weeds need to be explicitly simulated to allow e g quantifying the impact of weeds on crop yields and identifying infestation thresholds to trigger herbicide distribution moreover keeping track of rate and state variables of crop and weeds allows the explicit simulation of the competition for resources between the different species for this reason contrarily to the original cosmo approach in weedycosmo one instance of crop model is used for simulating growth and development of each of the crop and weed species present in the field 2 1 2 the warm model the crop model used in this study is the daily time step version of warm confalonieri et al 2009 this model was used for estimating rice and weeds rate and state variables at each time step in particular two instances of the model were run given only rice and one weed species either barnyardgrass or red rice were simultaneously available in the datasets used for model evaluation table 1 plant emergence is estimated when a species specific thermal time threshold is reached with thermal time being cumulated between base and maximum temperatures starting from the sowing day warm simulates species development as a function of the thermal time

1977 with radiation use efficiency g dry biomass mj 1 modulated by temperature senescence diseases light saturation of enzymatic chains and atmospheric co2 concentration daily cumulated aboveground biomass agb kg ha 1 is partitioned to the different plant organs as a function of development stage with differences among genotypes reproduced by modulating the value of a parameter that represents the fraction of photosynthates that are daily partitioned to leaves at early phenological stages grain yield kg ha 1 is the cumulated biomass partitioned to reproductive organs at physiological maturity plant height is estimated as a function of biomass partitioned to stems confalonieri et al 2011 whereas green leaf area expansion m2 m 2 day 1 is simulated as a function of the biomass daily partitioned to leaves and of a development dependent specific leaf area daily emitted leaf area index units are considered senescent once they reach a thermal time threshold the amount of intercepted radiation is derived from green leaf area index lai m2 m 2 and canopy extinction coefficient for solar radiation using the beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 concerning agro management practices the model simulates the effect of fertilization fungicide distribution and water management in terms of water availability due to irrigation and effect on the vertical thermal profile in case of flooding details on warm algorithms are available in reference papers e g confalonieri et al 2009 pagani et al 2014 2 1 3 weedycosmo in order to explicitly simulate the state variables of each crop and weed species the cosmo approach has been modified to allow using an instance of a generic crop model in this study warm for each of the species in the simulated field this allowed keeping track of species state variables separately without preventing weedycosmo from simulating the state variables of the community which are derived as the average of the species state variables weighted by their relative abundance fig 1 similarly to the original cosmo approach weedycosmo estimates at each time step changes in the relative abundance of each crop and weed species using a set of hierarchically arranged unitless suitability functions this allows reproducing the response of each species to environmental e g temperature flood tolerance and nitrogen contents and management e g chemical treatments factors by accounting for the state variable of the community and for the features of the different species fig 1 the relative abundance of the i th species scpi 0 1 agb agb 1 in the community is derived at each time step t according to eq 1 whose meaning is changing the relative abundance of each of the species in the community according to its suitability to the conditions explored during the time step compared to the suitability of the community as a whole during the same time step 1 s c p i t s c p i t 1 s f s i c s f n i z where s c p i t 1 0 1 unitless is the relative abundance at

community suitability eq 3 2 s f s i q 1 z h s f i q 3 c s f i 1 n s f s i in practice eq 2 is used to derive the overall suitability for the species i as the sum of the hierarchy corrected suitability factors eq 4 obtained for the z drivers whereas eq 3 is used to derive the suitability of the community as a whole as the sum of the suitability of the different species in the community in eq 2 q is the position of a driver in the drivers hierarchy and h s f i q unitless is the hierarchy corrected suitability of the i th species to the q th driver estimated as 4 h s f i q s f i q q 1

according to the knowledge on plant responses to different categories of drivers and to the studies from lindquist and kropff 1997 and hattori et al 2009 the drivers were arranged in the following hierarchy herbicide treatments global solar radiation competition for light floodwater level tolerance to submergence and mean air temperature different response to thermal regimes of the different species other drivers available in weedycosmo e g soil water and nitrogen contents were switched off for this study since the datasets used for model evaluation referred to experiments where fields were fully irrigated and fertilized no competition for water and nutrients for solar radiation the original cosmo suitability function confalonieri 2014 was slightly modified to increase the relative importance of plant height compared to leaf area index lai the new function f r 0 1 unitless is calculated for each species in the rice weeds community according to eq 5 5 f r 0 5 l a i m a x l a i c o m m l a i m a x l a i c o m m 2 h m a x h c o m m h m a x h c o m m 6 where laicomm m2 m 2 and hcomm cm are the lai and height of the community as a whole at time step t whereas laimax m2 m 2 and hmax cm are parameters defining the maximum lai and height that the species or cultivar or population in case of weeds can reach under unlimiting conditions in practice eq 5 is used to compare the community state variables at a certain time step and the potential of each of the species in the community for the same variables laicomm and hcomm are estimated as an average of the corresponding rice and weeds state variables at time step t weighted by the relative abundance of the different species at the same time step the hypothesis behind eq 5 is that at each time step the higher the maximum height or maximum lai of a species compared to the current height or lai of the community the higher the suitability of that species for competing for radiation for the water suitability function the cosmo approach for the species capability to uptake water from soil is used for unflooded conditions whereas a new function f sb 0 1 unitless eq 6 was developed to consider species tolerance to floodwater hattori et al 2009 as a function of water depth and plant height 6 f s b h s u b t h s u b 0 1 unitless is calculated according to eq 7 whereas t eq 8 is a species specific

r i t parameter unitless 0 to 1 represents the percentage of h m a x corresponding to the floodwater level at which gas exchanges are arrested in practice according to eq 7 the larger the actual plant height compared to the floodwater level the higher the tolerance to floodwater eq 8 modulates the tolerance according to species specific factors such as the presence and development of aerenchyma a triangular approach is used for the suitability to temperature f t 0 1 unitless eq 10 10 f t t a t b t o p t t b t a t b t a t o p t 1 t a t o p t t c o f f t o p t t a t o p t t a t c o f f 0 e l s e w h e r e where ta c is the mean air temperature tb topt and tcoff c are parameters representing minimum optimum and cutoff temperatures for photosynthesis and development respectively which are set to the same values of the corresponding parameters of the crop model warm the impact of weed chemical treatments is reproduced by using a coefficient that quantifies the efficiency of specific chemicals in reducing the presence of the different weed species in practice in case of a single weed species weed and crop relative abundance after the treatment are calculated according to eqs 11 and 12 11 s c p w a t s c p w b t 1 e f f t 12 s c p c a t s c p c b t s c p w b t s c p w a t where scpw at and scpw bt 0 1 unitless are the relative abundance of the weed before and after the treatment respectively scpc at and scpc bt 0 1 unitless are the corresponding values for the crop which for the sake of simplicity is assumed to be not affected by treatments efft parameter 0 1 unitless is the chemical treatment efficiency the same approach is applied in case of more weed species state variables of the weeds e g agb lai and of the community are then reduced accordingly 2 2 experimental data model calibration and evaluation weedycosmo was evaluated for rice crops including two major rice weeds kraehmer et al 2016 i e barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli and red rice oryza sativa var sylvatica using datasets published by zeng et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 for barnyardgrass and datasets from diarra et al 1985 and kwon et al 1992 for red rice table 1 in these datasets rice and weeds were grown both individually and in mixture in this case with rice and a single weed species at a time table 1 for all the datasets rice and weeds were grown under unlimiting conditions for water and nutrients fields were continuously flooded 2 5 cm water level in the datasets from zeng et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 whereas irrigation or temporary flooding were applied in the other datasets simulations were performed from 13 june to 11 october for dataset with id 1 from 10 may to 7 october for id 2 5 and 13 16 from 28 may to 25 october for id 6 11 and 17 18 from 8 june to 5 november for id 19 22 and from 18 may to 15 september for id 12 and 23 further details on the management of experimental fields are provided in the reference literature table 1 weather data were derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim database dee et al 2011 given nutrients were unlimiting in all the datasets the model suitability functions for nitrogen and water limitation were switched off during the simulations the relative abundance of weed and rice was initialized at sowing according to the information made available with the datasets calibration and evaluation were carried out using different datasets table 1 and in two steps focusing first on the parameters of the warm model for the rice varieties and the two weeds and then on the weedycosmo parameters involved with inter specific dynamics appendix a model parameters were calibrated using the trial and error approach with trials carried out after analysing time trends of different state variables with respect to available observations from the calibration datasets table 1 the procedure is considered as complete when satisfying values of agreement metrics are reached the trial and error approach has been preferred to the use of automatic optimization algorithms because of the presence of some inconsistencies in data pattern over time which can be better interpreted by expert users rather than by automatic algorithms to the benefit of the robustness of parameterization confalonieri et al 2016 the values of maximum height and maximum lai were instead set to the values published by zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 diarra et al 1985 and kwon et al 1992 then model evaluation was performed on the remaining datasets table 1 model performance was

the potential use of the model as a management support tool a scenario analysis was run to evaluate the model sensitivity to changes in management practices and in the characteristics of the rice cultivar rice cultivar liangy oupeijiu and barnyardgrass parameters were those calibrated and evaluated table 1 the only exception being the growing degree days to flowering and from flowering to maturity for rice which were decreased by 30 because of the lower temperatures and higher latitude in milan compared to those that characterize the jiangsu area where the zhang et al 2017 experiments were carried out a base scenario was defined where growth and development of rice and barnyardgrass were simulated in a paddy field close to milan 45 22 n 9 12 e lombardy northern italy under unlimiting conditions for water continuous flooding and nutrients simulations were run using 20 years of weather data 1986 2005 to account for differences in weather among seasons weather data were retrieved from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim database dee et al 2011 each year was considered as independent simulations being re initialized with barnyardgrass at 30 relative abundance initial infestation at the beginning of each season sowing for the management strategy in the base scenario was on 30 may with the field kept flooded 5 cm water level throughout the season two broad spectrum herbicide penoxsulam 40 g a i ha 1 92 efficiency against echinochloa spp cavanna et al 2004 treatments were applied 15 and 35 days after sowing the base scenario was compared with four alternative scenarios that differed from the base one for i the first herbicide treatment was applied when rice was at the 2nd leaf stage and the second was not fixed but triggered by the model when barnyardgrass relative abundance exceeded 6 5 scenario 1 ii floodwater level at 10 cm instead of 5 cm scenario 2 iii higher thermal requirements for rice to emerge 50 growing degree days scenario 3 iv taller rice plants 135 cm instead of 125 cm scenario 4 analysis of variance followed by the tukey test was run to evaluate the significance of the differences among scenarios for each scenario the 20 yields simulated using the 20 years of weather data were used as replicates 3 results 3 1 model calibration calibrated values for all parameters are available in appendix a for all rice cultivars parameter values of the warm model are in the range of those used by confalonieri et al 2009 and pagani et al 2014 for rice cultivars grown in chinese and italian rice districts cardinal temperatures are consistent with the values used by casanova et al 1998 for modeling rice growth and development in spain whereas calibrated values for maximum radiation use efficiency and extinction coefficient for solar radiation fall in the range of the values estimated by campbell et al 2001 and dingkuhn et al 1999 respectively specific leaf area at emergence and at mid tillering are close to the values measured by dingkuhn et al 1998 for different rice genotypes in cote d ivoire main differences among rice cultivars deal with radiation use efficiency which is lower for the us cultivars and with the growing degree days needed to reach emergence flowering and maturity with the cultivars grown in the experiments performed in china presenting higher thermal requirements other differences deal with canopy development with the chinese cultivars being characterized by higher values for maximum leaf area index and maximum plant height and by lower specific leaf area at emergence model results were overall satisfactory r2 being always higher than 0 81 and the slope of the linear regression between simulated and observed data ranging from 0 77 to 1 37 time dynamics of the different state variables were reliably reproduced for all rice varieties and for both weeds regardless they were grown in monoculture or in mixture figs 2 and 3 table 2 concerning the simulation of rice and red rice in monoculture fig 2 table 2 the model accurately estimated aboveground biomass agb in particular the values achieved by the agreement metrics for the simulation of rice and in fig 2a and red rice in fig 2b agb and rice lai and in fig 2c were always in ranges considered as fully satisfactory i e 20 0 5 0 2 for rrmse ef and crm respectively chung et al 1999 bellocchi et al 2002 moriasi et al 2007 the good performances achieved for red rice were to a certain extent expected given the similarities between red rice and cultivated rice in terms of morphological and physiological features and the known suitability of the warm model for rice the accuracy in simulating time trends of rice agb and lai reflected in reliable yield estimates and in fig 2e regardless of the cultivar and of the experimental site and year observations referring to rice grown with barnyardgrass and red rice fig 3 were accurately reproduced by the model which showed performances very similar to those achieved for the datasets where rice was grown in monoculture in particular agreement metrics for agb and in fig 3a were consistent with monoculture ones whereas those calculated for lai and in fig 3c were slightly better with ef equal to 0 87 results were satisfactory ef 0 87 also for yield simulation although in this case model performances were lightly poorer compared to what achieved for rice in monoculture and in fig 3e the model capability to reproduce rice growth in monoculture and in interaction with barnyardgrass and red rice led to a good simulation of the yield losses due to the competition from the two grass weeds with ef equal to 0 79 respectively and crm close to 0 indicating the absence of systematic under or over estimations table 2 the low number of observations available for calibrating barnyardgrass parameters affected the values of some of the performance metrics table 2 although the agreement between observed and simulated variables was overall satisfactory lai values fig 3 d were accurately reproduced by the model with mae and rrmse very close to their optima whereas the negative value for ef is due to the low variability in measured data criss and winston 2008 concerning agb fig 3b barnyardgrass simulations presented a marked overestimation for the first sampling event whereas good agreement was achieved for the others the accuracy in the simulation of barnyardgrass height is demonstrated by the good values achieved for all the metrics table 2 3 2 model evaluation no relevant worsening in model performance were noticed while moving from calibration to evaluation datasets table 2 regardless of the simulated species and of the growing conditions monoculture vs mixtures the only exception was for lai of rice grown in monoculture and in fig 2c for which the values of the agreement metrics were less satisfying compared to those achieved for the same variable during calibration and in general for the other variables for lai values higher than 3 the model overestimated lai of rice fig 2c and underestimated the one of red rice fig 2d with overall crm values of 0 33 and 0 21 respectively table 2 the underestimation of lai values in the second part of the red rice cycle is due to the fact that the model does not simulate new leaf emergence after the flowering stage contrarily to what happens in reality compared to what achieved during calibration rice agb was simulated with the same degree of accuracy when the crop was grown in monoculture and in fig 2a whereas better values for all the metrics were obtained for the same variable when rice was competing with weeds and in fig 3a good results were achieved also for rice yield simulations with the crop grown in monoculture in fig 2e and in mixture with weeds in fig 3e 3 3 evaluating weed management scenarios means and standard deviations of the outputs from the 20 annual simulations run for the scenario analysis are shown in fig 4 compared to the base one scenario 1 led to a light increase in rice yield 3 1 that resulted non significant however considering the 20 seasons it was characterized by a lower number of herbicide treatments per year 1 55 treatments year 1 versus 2 00 treatments year 1 this means that one the one hand differences in the weather conditions among seasons allowed avoiding the second treatment in nine years out of 20 given the weed relative abundance never exceeded the threshold triggering the second treatment maximum relative abundance after the first treatment in those nine years was 6 4 on the other hand the higher mean yield demonstrates that triggering the second treatment based on the weed relative abundance instead of applying it a constant number of days after sowing allowed increasing the treatment efficiency in the years when the second treatment was applied results from scenario 2 demonstrate the model sensitivity to floodwater level increasing floodwater level from 5 cm to 10 cm allowed penalizing the weeds which are less tolerant than rice to partial submergence of culm tissues hattori et al 2009 indeed the mean of the daily floodwater level suitability factors for rice decreased by 5 3 because of the increase in floodwater level whereas it decreased by 36 0 for the weed this translated into higher competitiveness of rice with a 11 8 increase in mean yield compared to the base scenario however the large variability among seasons made the increase non significant scenarios 3 and 4 are instead based on changes to the values of two of the traits of the simulated rice cultivar increased thermal requirements for emergence scenario 3 led the weed establishing faster than rice thus making more pressure on the crop with an effect that was only partially mitigated by the two herbicide treatments the weed relative abundance before the second treatment was 25 higher compared to the base scenario this led to a mean rice yield that was 21 2 lower p 0 05 compared to the value simulated for the base scenario on the contrary the 10 cm taller rice plants that characterized the scenarios 4 allowed achieving slightly higher although the difference was not significant yields compared to the base scenario 2 7 because of a higher capability to compete for radiation the mean of the weed daily suitability factors for radiation was indeed 2 less compared the base scenario 4 discussion 4 1 novelty of the proposed approach weedycosmo is a new model for the simulation of crop weed interaction based on hierarchically arranged factors daily accounting for the suitability of the different species to environmental and management drivers the model derived from the cosmo approach for the simulation of phytocoenosis dynamics can be coupled with any generic crop model allowing users to work with the crop model they are more familiar with or for which parameter sets for local cultivars are already available this allows upscaling from single species canopies to multi species ones with a reduced effort compared to other approaches the model is characterized by a good compromise between applicability parsimony in terms of information needed for calibration and application and biophysical adherence to the underlying system indeed despite the algorithms used for crop weed interaction are decidedly simpler than in other approaches good performances were achieved for the simulation of time dynamics of key state variables and for the estimation of yield losses caused by weeds when the model was evaluated using datasets collected under different environmental and management conditions this translates into a high usability while successfully capturing key dynamics of crop weed interaction 4 2 reliability domain of validity and limits despite the potential risks due to the calibration method and to the relationship between the number of parameters and the number of observations available for model parameterization the absence of worsening in model performance during the evaluation against independent datasets revealed an overall good robustness of the modeling approach and of the defined parameter sets the simulation of rice aboveground biomass agb and leaf area index lai in monoculture fig 2a table 2 revealed a degree of accuracy consistent with previous studies where rice growth was estimated using different models bouman and van laar 2006 belder et al 2007 or the same crop simulator e g confalonieri et al 2009 pagani et al 2014 the higher uncertainty in lai simulation compared to other variables was already observed by different authors yu et al 2006 confalonieri et al 2009 tartarini et al 2019 and it can be partly due to the larger uncertainty in the methods used for estimating this variable despite early stages are crucial for crop weed interaction martin et al 2001 deen et al 2003 observed during this phase a larger uncertainty in crop and weed grown in mixture lai estimates in a comparative study where four crop weed models were evaluated for wheat and lolium rigidum in this study the authors underlined a general tendency of the models to decrease their accuracy while moving from species in monoculture to crop weed mixtures this phenomenon was not observed during the evaluation of weedycosmo which correctly reproduced observed time dynamics of lai in the post emergence phase and throughout the season for rice and the two weed species whereas it underestimated observations for this variable for red rice in monoculture only for values larger than 6 m2 m 2 in general the overall good model performance while estimating lai should be considered of primary importance given the role of this variable in quantifying the response of rice and weeds to radiation this is indeed crucial for correctly reproducing changes in the relative abundance of the different species throughout the season weedycosmo performances in estimating rice yield losses due to weeds were better than those obtained using empirical approaches based on relative leaf area kropff and spitters 1991 and similar to what achieved for the same crop and weed by bastiaans et al 1997 and kropff et al 1993 using the intercom model in particular kropff et al 1993 reported that intercom allowed explaining 93 of the variance in observations whereas weedycosmo in spite of lower requirements in terms of inputs needed to run the simulation explained only 10 variance less however the model evaluation for barnyardgrass should be considered as decidedly preliminary given the few data available indeed despite the good performances achieved for rice in mixture with this weed species could be considered an indirect guarantee of the functioning of the whole system and thus of the reliability of barnyardgrass parameterization related parameter values need to be further evaluated one of the main limits of the current version of weedycosmo is the absence of algorithms for simulating phenotypic plasticity driven by inter and intra specific competition colbach et al 2019 this choice was due to the need of limiting model complexity to increase the potential of the model for being adopted in operational farming contexts the quest for limiting the complexity of the model also led to design weedycosmo in such a way to reproduce crop weed interaction at canopy level without downscaling to individual based architectures the good performances obtained during model evaluation further demonstrate that the model design could strictly depend on the specific objective and conditions of application colbach 2010 and that increasing model complexity when not strictly needed could prevent models from being used for decision making under operational conditions park et al 2003 another limit of the approach we propose deals with the absence of algorithms for simulating weed seed survival and thus multi annual weed dynamics this requires initializing the model at the beginning of each seasons however modeling approaches for the simulation of weed seedbank processes are available e g otto et al 2007 bohan et al 2011 and will be integrated in the next version of weedycosmo 4 3 application and implications for weed management support despite some simplifications suggest to further investigate the model behavior in response to treatments e g the effect of canopy density on herbicide efficiency is not considered the scenario analysis demonstrated the suitability of the model as a tool to support strategic decisions regarding when and how often to apply herbicides indeed its capability of optimizing the timing of treatments led to an overall increase in the treatment efficiency and in avoiding the second treatment in 45 of the simulated seasons moreover the model capability of reproducing the lower tolerance of weeds to the partial submersion of tissues hattori et al 2009 makes the model suitable to support weed control strategies based also on the modulation of water management moreover the model sensitivity to changes in the traits of the simulated rice cultivar opens to the possibility to perform ideotyping studies for supporting breeding programs targeting an increase of rice competitiveness against weeds this would be important especially for production contexts moving towards the reduction of the use of chemicals or their abandonment e g organic farming indeed despite the increasing demand for breeding programs targeting a higher competitiveness against weeds fontaine et al 2009 very few studies are available where crop weed interaction models were used to identify in a quantitative way plant traits able to maximize potential crop productivity while minimizing yield losses due to weeds e g colbach et al 2019 however the model potential for being used to support decision making is limited in its current configuration by the absence of algorithms for the estimation of seed production and survival this limits the types of analysis the model can be used for although the capability to reproduce seasonal dynamics of crop weed interaction with a low number of inputs opens to further extensions of the model that will broaden its usefulness for management support under operational farming conditions 4 4 perspectives thanks to the good balance between usability and capability of capturing key processes involved with crop weed interaction weedycosmo opens up new opportunities for extending existing dss towards the possibility to support weed management under operational farming conditions further activities will refer to tests on other crops and weeds and to the model linkage to modeling approaches for the simulation of weed seedbank processes like seed mortality and dormancy e g otto et al 2007 bohan et al 2011 and weed germination emergence e g masin et al 2010 gardarin et al 2012 borgy et al 2015 and the evaluation of the model for designing rice ideotypes more competitive against weeds bastiaans et al 1997 moreover approaches for the simulation of the effect of mechanical weed control will also be implemented 5 conclusions we proposed a new approach namely weedycosmo to simulate the time dynamics involved with crop weed interaction based on the quantification of the suitability of the different species to the environmental and management conditions explored each day the model was developed by targeting operational contexts thus we paid particular attention to limit its requirements in terms of data needed for calibration and application weedycosmo can be coupled with any generic crop model thus allowing to extend existing modeling approaches e g those already implemented in operational simulation platforms for being used to support strategic decisions on weed management weedycosmo demonstrated its suitability in simulating the interactions between different rice cultivars and two major rice weeds i e red rice and barnyardgrass whose time trends of aboveground biomass and leaf area index were accurately reproduced as well as rice yield losses due to weed presence the model demonstrated its suitability also for scenario analysis showing a good potential for being used to identify context specific management strategies as demonstrated by the results achieved during model evaluation the novel approach to upscale from single species to multi species canopies allows simulating crop weed interaction without the need to implement individual based architectures this makes the model easy to use because of the limited number of parameters most of which are shared with many crop models widely used worldwide however despite its low complexity the good performances achieved seem to further demonstrate what observed by deen et al 2003 who concluded a comparative study suggesting the absence of clear relationships between model complexity and the capability to capture most of the dynamics involved with crops response to weed competition the capability of weedycosmo to simulate changes in the relative abundance of crops and weeds on a daily basis encourages its evaluation as a tool to support the optimization of weed management

24522,despite their potential to support the optimization of weed management available ecophysiological models for the simulation of crop weed interaction are still not adopted in operational contexts for some of them the reasons deal with the insufficient validation in farming conditions whereas others are either too complex for being used in operational contexts or too empiric for being free from site or context specific effects here we present a new approach weedycosmo to support strategic decisions on weed management derived from the cosmo process based model for the simulation of phytocoenosis dynamics the model dynamically reproduces on a yearly basis the interaction between crop and weeds at canopy level through the daily quantification of the suitability of each species to weather conditions and management practices as well as to the simulated system state variables dynamically predicted outputs are the relative abundance of crop and weeds and state variables for each species like e g aboveground biomass biomass of different plant organs grain yield leaf area index plant height weedycosmo was calibrated and validated using data from different sites in the jiangsu province china and in arkansas usa and years from 1982 to 2014 where different rice varieties and two major rice weeds i e red rice oryza sativa l var sylvatica and barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli l were grown in monoculture or mixture model performances were satisfying for rice crops grown in interaction with weeds relative root mean square error never exceeded 25 2 regardless of the variable considered and nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency was always higher than 0 63 despite the low number of inputs and parameters needed to run the simulations the degree of accuracy was similar to the ones achieved with other models for crop weed interaction this allows considering weedycosmo as a promising approach in light of the possible integration in decision support systems targeting operational farming conditions keywords echinochloa crus galli inter specific competition oryza sativa var sylvatica warm weedycosmo 1 introduction optimizing the use of pesticides is a priority in agricultural management because of their impact on the environment on biodiversity fletcher et al 1988 freemark and boutin 1995 on the health of farmers lopez et al 2007 and consumers ascherio et al 2006 stillerman et al 2008 as well as on farmers income however since it is hard imagining to satisfy global food demand without using pesticides seufert et al 2012 leifeld 2016 the optimization of pesticide management largely relies on limiting unnecessary applications despite differences due to the crops and contexts considered weeds are worldwide responsible for about 32 of yield losses thus representing one of the most severe biotic factors limiting global food production oerke and dehne 2004 in the case of important staple food like rice incorrect management of weeds can lead to yield losses that can exceed 60 with even higher values in case of direct sowing under aerobic conditions dass et al 2017 farmers experience may be not enough to avoid yield losses while minimizing the use of herbicides because of the complex dynamics that characterize the interactions between crops weeds environmental conditions and other management practices for this reason tools for optimizing herbicides application were developed they range from simple rule based systems to equations relating the number of weed individuals or damaged area to the treatment timing up to complex systems based on mathematical simulation models park et al 2003 ecophysiological models for the simulation of crop weed interaction e g graf et al 1990 kropff et al 1992 debaeke et al 1997 caton et al 1999 can be classified according to different criteria e g the degree of empiricism leading in this case to the identification of empiric mechanistic and mixed approaches other classifications are based on the level of abstraction in the way plants are represented individual level species level or field level models or on the spatial virtual field large area spatially explicit and temporal seasonal multi annual extent of the simulation despite such large differences many authors underlined that it is impossible to identify a priori a category of models that is better than the others the choice of a model depending on the specific objectives and conditions of application colbach 2010 as an example some authors e g renton 2013 suggested to shift from field level models to individual based ones in case the objective is the analysis of the effects of tillage on weed populations in the medium long term or in case the effects of pesticides on resistance phenomena need to be investigated despite the theoretical reasons behind shifting towards modeling approaches more detailed in the way underlying processes are represented the increase in complexity has often limited the use of models for decision making e g park et al 2003 given increasing the detail in process representation often translates into huge effort and uncertainty during model parameterization colbach 2010 some of the models potentially available to support decision making indeed are often too complex i e too many parameters and input variables to be calibrated or initialized and too sensitive to uncertainty in parameter values freckleton et al 2008 for being successfully transferred to operational farming conditions colbach et al 2014 other models for the simulation of crop weed interaction are not suitable for being implemented in decision support systems dss targeting the tactical in season management of weeds although they can be successfully used to compare management scenarios to identify strategies for weed management in the medium long term beltran et al 2011 other approaches are instead potentially suitable to be used as simulation engines within operational dss but are still insufficiently validated freckleton and stephens 2009 moreover one of the factors that often limit the adoption of models within decision support systems is their insufficient capability to reproduce long term effects of weed management strategies park et al 2003 one of the solutions to overcome these limitations is extending cropping system models already used within operational or pre operational dss e g thorp et al 2008 kadiyala et al 2015 busetto et al 2017 bonfante et al 2019 by providing them with algorithms for the simulation of key dynamics of crop weed interaction some of these models have indeed been used for years in a variety of contexts and they have been validated under operational conditions for a variety of purposes moreover their functioning and outputs are often simple enough to be understood by farmers directly thorp et al 2008 or after their implementation in dedicated software platforms e g busetto et al 2017 the main strength of this kind of models is the favourable relationship between the effort needed to run simulations parsimony for inputs and the capability to capture key aspects of the system of interest this allows obtaining outputs at canopy scale clearly understandable and suitable for decision making by relying at least partially on existing spatially distributed sources of weather soil and management data another advantage of extending existing operational crop models is the possibility to reuse the parameterizations available to estimate growth and development of cultivars and hybrids for the crops of interest thus limiting the calibration effort to weed parameters the objectives of this study were i developing a new model annual in the current configuration or crop weed interaction suitable for operational contexts i e a simulation engine for dss targeting strategic decisions and ii evaluating the model for rice and two of the most important rice weeds worldwide i e barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli l and red rice oryza sativa l var sylvatica the approach we propose extends the cosmo confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 algorithms for the simulation of the interaction among different species in phytocoenosis and it uses the warm model confalonieri et al 2009 for the simulation of growth and development of rice and weeds warm has been used since it was demonstrated to be suitable for being used in operational contexts indeed after being extensively evaluated under a variety of conditions it is already adopted for large area applications dealing with yield forecasts pagani et al 2019 and with supporting the distribution of fertilizers busetto et al 2017 and fungicides nettleton et al 2019 the reason for starting from the cosmo principles for inter specific dynamics derives from its capability of extending cropping system models already used within operational dss 2 materials and methods 2 1 a new approach for simulating rice weed interaction 2 1 1 principle the proposed approach for rice weed interaction weedycosmo derives from the generic plant community model cosmo confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 cosmo is a process based virtual field model that simulates at a daily time step annual dynamics of phytocoenosis in terms of productivity of the community and relative abundance of the different species by using weather data physical and chemical soil properties and management information it simulates community dynamics based on two assumptions i inter specific competition and changes in species relative abundance are derived from species specific responses by means of sets of suitability functions to hierarchically arranged environmental and management drivers ii parameter values of the community as a whole are daily derived from the relative abundance of each species and from the parameter values of the different species when grown in monoculture in practice the suitability of each species to the conditions explored each day is used to drive changes in the characteristics of the community changes in the relative abundance of the different species reflect in changes in the parameter values of the community which are daily used to estimate the rate variables i e changes in the values of state variables within the time step of the phytocoenosis as a whole using a single instance of a crop model using this approach the traits of the plant community codified in the parameters of the generic crop model dynamically change at each time step as a function of the suitability of each species in the community to environmental and management conditions and the only state variables that are daily integrated are those referring to the community in the case of crop weed interaction rate and state variables of crop and weeds need to be explicitly simulated to allow e g quantifying the impact of weeds on crop yields and identifying infestation thresholds to trigger herbicide distribution moreover keeping track of rate and state variables of crop and weeds allows the explicit simulation of the competition for resources between the different species for this reason contrarily to the original cosmo approach in weedycosmo one instance of crop model is used for simulating growth and development of each of the crop and weed species present in the field 2 1 2 the warm model the crop model used in this study is the daily time step version of warm confalonieri et al 2009 this model was used for estimating rice and weeds rate and state variables at each time step in particular two instances of the model were run given only rice and one weed species either barnyardgrass or red rice were simultaneously available in the datasets used for model evaluation table 1 plant emergence is estimated when a species specific thermal time threshold is reached with thermal time being cumulated between base and maximum temperatures starting from the sowing day warm simulates species development as a function of the thermal time

biomass agb kg ha 1 is partitioned to the different plant organs as a function of development stage with differences among genotypes reproduced by modulating the value of a parameter that represents

radiation is derived from green leaf area index lai m2 m 2 and canopy extinction coefficient for solar radiation using the beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 concerning agro management practices the model simulates the effect of fertilization fungicide distribution and water management in terms of water availability due to irrigation and effect on the vertical thermal profile in case of flooding details on warm algorithms are available in reference papers e g confalonieri et al 2009 pagani et al 2014 2 1 3 weedycosmo in order to explicitly simulate the state variables of each crop and weed species the cosmo approach has been modified to allow using an instance of a generic crop model in this study warm for each of the species in the simulated field this allowed keeping track of species state variables separately without preventing weedycosmo from simulating the state variables of the community which are derived as the average of the species state variables weighted by their relative abundance fig 1 similarly to the original cosmo approach weedycosmo estimates at each time step changes in the relative abundance of each crop and weed species using a set of hierarchically arranged unitless suitability functions this allows reproducing the response of each species to environmental e g temperature flood tolerance and nitrogen contents and management e g chemical treatments factors by accounting for the state variable of the community and for the features of the different species fig 1 the relative abundance of the i th species scpi 0 1 agb agb 1 in the community is derived at each time step t according to eq 1 whose meaning is changing the relative abundance of each of the species in the community according to its suitability to the conditions explored during the time step compared to the suitability of the community as a whole during the same time step 1 s c p i t s c p i t 1 s f s i c s f n i z where s c p i t 1 0 1 unitless is the relative abundance at

community suitability eq 3 2 s f s i q 1 z h s f i q 3 c s f i 1 n s f s i in practice eq 2 is used to derive the overall suitability for the species i as the sum of the hierarchy corrected suitability factors eq 4 obtained for the z drivers whereas eq 3 is used to derive the suitability of the community as a whole as the sum of the suitability of the different species in the community in eq 2 q is the position of a driver in the drivers hierarchy and h s f i q unitless is the hierarchy corrected suitability of the i th species to the q th driver estimated as 4 h s f i q s f i q q 1 s f i q 1 s f i q q 2 h s f i q 1 s f i q 1 s f i q e l s e w h e r e q 2 where sf i q unitless is the suitability of the i th species to the driver in the q th position in the hierarchy in this study according to the knowledge on plant responses to different categories of drivers and to the studies from lindquist and kropff 1997 and hattori et al 2009 the drivers were arranged in the following hierarchy herbicide treatments global solar radiation competition for light floodwater level tolerance to submergence and mean air temperature different response to thermal regimes of the different species other drivers available in weedycosmo e g soil water and nitrogen contents were switched off for this study since the datasets used for model evaluation referred to experiments where fields were fully irrigated and fertilized no competition for water and nutrients for solar radiation the original cosmo suitability function confalonieri 2014 was slightly modified to increase the relative importance of plant height compared to leaf area index lai the new function f r 0 1 unitless is calculated for each species in the rice weeds community according to eq 5 5 f r 0 5 l a i m a x l a i c o m m l a i m a x l a i c o m m 2 h m a x h c o m m h m a x h c o m m 6 where laicomm m2 m 2 and hcomm cm are the lai and height of the community as a whole at time step t whereas laimax m2 m 2 and hmax cm are parameters defining the maximum lai and height that the species or cultivar or population in case of weeds can reach under unlimiting conditions in practice eq 5 is used to compare the community state variables at a certain time step and the potential of each of the species in the community for the same variables laicomm and hcomm are estimated as an average of the corresponding rice and weeds state variables at time step t weighted by the relative abundance of the different species at the same time step the hypothesis behind eq 5 is that at each time step the higher the maximum height or maximum lai of a species compared to the current height or lai of the community the higher the suitability of that species for competing for radiation for the water suitability function the cosmo approach for the species capability to uptake water from soil is used for unflooded conditions whereas a new function f sb 0 1 unitless eq 6 was developed to consider species tolerance to floodwater hattori et al 2009 as a function of water depth and plant height 6 f s b h s u b t h s u b 0 1 unitless is calculated according to eq 7 whereas t eq 8 is a species specific

r i t parameter unitless 0 to 1 represents the percentage of h m a x corresponding to the floodwater level at which gas exchanges are arrested in practice according to eq 7 the larger the actual plant height compared to the floodwater level the higher the tolerance to floodwater eq 8 modulates the tolerance according to species specific factors such as the presence and development of aerenchyma a triangular approach is used for the suitability to temperature f t 0 1 unitless eq 10 10 f t t a t b t o p t t b t a t b t a t o p t 1 t a t o p t t c o f f t o p t t a t o p t t a t c o f f 0 e l s e w h e r e where ta c is the mean air temperature tb topt and tcoff c are parameters representing minimum optimum and cutoff temperatures for photosynthesis and development respectively which are set to the same values of the corresponding parameters of the crop model warm the impact of weed chemical treatments is reproduced by using a coefficient that quantifies the efficiency of specific chemicals in reducing the presence of the different weed species in practice in case of a single weed species weed and crop relative abundance after the treatment are calculated according to eqs 11 and 12 11 s c p w a t s c p w b t 1 e f f t 12 s c p c a t s c p c b t s c p w b t s c p w a t where scpw at and scpw bt 0 1 unitless are the relative abundance of the weed before and after the treatment respectively scpc at and scpc bt 0 1 unitless are the corresponding values for the crop which for the sake of simplicity is assumed to be not affected by treatments efft parameter 0 1 unitless is the chemical treatment efficiency the same approach is applied in case of more weed species state variables of the weeds e g agb lai and of the community are then reduced accordingly 2 2 experimental data model calibration and evaluation weedycosmo was evaluated for rice crops including two major rice weeds kraehmer et al 2016 i e barnyardgrass echinocloa crus galli and red rice oryza sativa var sylvatica using datasets published by zeng et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 for barnyardgrass and datasets from diarra et al 1985 and kwon et al 1992 for red rice table 1 in these datasets rice and weeds were grown both individually and in mixture in this case with rice and a single weed species at a time table 1 for all the datasets rice and weeds were grown under unlimiting conditions for water and nutrients fields were continuously flooded 2 5 cm water level in the datasets from zeng et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 whereas irrigation or temporary flooding were applied in the other datasets simulations were performed from 13 june to 11 october for dataset with id 1 from 10 may to 7 october for id 2 5 and 13 16 from 28 may to 25 october for id 6 11 and 17 18 from 8 june to 5 november for id 19 22 and from 18 may to 15 september for id 12 and 23 further details on the management of experimental fields are provided in the reference literature table 1 weather data were derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim database dee et al 2011 given nutrients were unlimiting in all the datasets the model suitability functions for nitrogen and water limitation were switched off during the simulations the relative abundance of weed and rice was initialized at sowing according to the information made available with the datasets calibration and evaluation were carried out using different datasets table 1 and in two steps focusing first on the parameters of the warm model for the rice varieties and the two weeds and then on the weedycosmo parameters involved with inter specific dynamics appendix a model parameters were calibrated using the trial and error approach with trials carried out after analysing time trends of different state variables with respect to available observations from the calibration datasets table 1 the procedure is considered as complete when satisfying values of agreement metrics are reached the trial and error approach has been preferred to the use of automatic optimization algorithms because of the presence of some inconsistencies in data pattern over time which can be better interpreted by expert users rather than by automatic algorithms to the benefit of the robustness of parameterization confalonieri et al 2016 the values of maximum height and maximum lai were instead set to the values published by zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 diarra et al 1985 and kwon et al 1992 then model evaluation was performed on the remaining datasets table 1 model performance was evaluated using the dataset presented in table 1 with the following metrics mean absolute error mae eq 13 minimum and optimum 0 maximum relative root mean square error rrmse eq 14 minimum and optimum

the potential use of the model as a management support tool a scenario analysis was run to evaluate the model sensitivity to changes in management practices and in the characteristics of the rice cultivar rice cultivar liangy oupeijiu and barnyardgrass parameters were those calibrated and evaluated table 1 the only exception being the growing degree days to flowering and from flowering to maturity for rice which were decreased by 30 because of the lower temperatures and higher latitude in milan compared to those that characterize the jiangsu area where the zhang et al 2017 experiments were carried out a base scenario was defined where growth and development of rice and barnyardgrass were simulated in a paddy field close to milan 45 22 n 9 12 e lombardy northern italy under unlimiting conditions for water continuous flooding and nutrients simulations were run using 20 years of weather data 1986 2005 to account for differences in weather among seasons weather data were retrieved from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim database dee et al 2011 each year was considered as independent simulations being re initialized with barnyardgrass at 30 relative abundance initial infestation at the beginning of each season sowing for the management strategy in the base scenario was on 30 may with the field kept flooded 5 cm water level throughout the season two broad spectrum herbicide penoxsulam 40 g a i ha 1 92 efficiency against echinochloa spp cavanna et al 2004 treatments were applied 15 and 35 days after sowing the base scenario was compared with four alternative scenarios that differed from the base one for i the first herbicide treatment was applied when rice was at the 2nd leaf stage and the second was not fixed but triggered by the model when barnyardgrass relative abundance exceeded 6 5 scenario 1 ii floodwater level at 10 cm instead of 5 cm scenario 2 iii higher thermal requirements for rice to emerge 50 growing degree days scenario 3 iv taller rice plants 135 cm instead of 125 cm scenario 4 analysis of variance followed by the tukey test was run to evaluate the significance of the differences among scenarios for each scenario the 20 yields simulated using the 20 years of weather data were used as replicates 3 results 3 1 model calibration calibrated values for all parameters are available in appendix a for all rice cultivars parameter values of the warm model are in the range of those used by confalonieri et al 2009 and pagani et al 2014 for rice cultivars grown in chinese and italian rice districts cardinal temperatures are consistent with the values used by casanova et al 1998 for modeling rice growth and development in spain whereas calibrated values for maximum radiation use efficiency and extinction coefficient for solar radiation fall in the range of the values estimated by campbell et al 2001 and dingkuhn et al 1999 respectively specific leaf area at emergence and at mid tillering are close to the values measured by dingkuhn et al 1998 for different rice genotypes in cote d ivoire main differences among rice cultivars deal with radiation use efficiency which is lower for the us cultivars and with the growing degree days needed to reach emergence flowering and maturity with the cultivars grown in the experiments performed in china presenting higher thermal requirements other differences deal with canopy development with the chinese cultivars being characterized by higher values for maximum leaf area index and maximum plant height and by lower specific leaf area at emergence model results were overall satisfactory r2 being always higher than 0 81 and the slope of the linear regression between simulated and observed data ranging from 0 77 to 1 37 time dynamics of the different state variables were reliably reproduced for all rice varieties and for both weeds regardless they were grown in monoculture or in mixture figs 2 and 3 table 2 concerning the simulation of rice and red rice in monoculture fig 2 table 2 the model accurately estimated aboveground biomass agb in particular the values achieved by the agreement metrics for the simulation of rice and in fig 2a and red rice in fig 2b agb and rice lai and in fig 2c were always in ranges considered as fully satisfactory i e 20 0 5 0 2 for rrmse ef and crm respectively chung et al 1999 bellocchi et al 2002 moriasi et al 2007 the good performances achieved for red rice were to a certain extent expected given the similarities between red rice and cultivated rice in terms of morphological and physiological features and the known suitability of the warm model for rice the accuracy in simulating time trends of rice agb and lai reflected in reliable yield estimates and in fig 2e regardless of the cultivar and of the experimental site and year observations referring to rice grown with barnyardgrass and red rice fig 3 were accurately reproduced by the model which showed performances very similar to those achieved for the datasets where rice was grown in monoculture in particular agreement metrics for agb and in fig 3a were consistent with monoculture ones whereas those calculated for lai and in fig 3c were slightly better with ef equal to 0 87 results were satisfactory ef 0 87 also for yield simulation although in this case model performances were lightly poorer compared to what achieved for rice in monoculture and in fig 3e the model capability to reproduce rice growth in monoculture and in interaction with barnyardgrass and red rice led to a good simulation of the yield losses due to the competition from the two grass weeds with ef equal to 0 79 respectively and crm close to 0 indicating the absence of systematic under or over estimations table 2 the low number of observations available for calibrating barnyardgrass parameters affected the values of some of the performance metrics table 2 although the agreement between observed and simulated variables was overall satisfactory lai values fig 3 d were accurately reproduced by the model with mae and rrmse very close to their optima whereas the negative value for ef is due to the low variability in measured data criss and winston 2008 concerning agb fig 3b barnyardgrass simulations presented a marked overestimation for the first sampling event whereas good agreement was achieved for the others the accuracy in the simulation of barnyardgrass height is demonstrated by the good values achieved for all the metrics table 2 3 2 model evaluation no relevant worsening in model performance were noticed while moving from calibration to evaluation datasets table 2 regardless of the simulated species and of the growing conditions monoculture vs mixtures the only exception was for lai of rice grown in monoculture and in fig 2c for which the values of the agreement metrics were less satisfying compared to those achieved for the same variable during calibration and in general for the other variables for lai values higher than 3 the model overestimated lai of rice fig 2c and underestimated the one of red rice fig 2d with overall crm values of 0 33 and 0 21 respectively table 2 the underestimation of lai values in the second part of the red rice cycle is due to the fact that the model does not simulate new leaf emergence after the flowering stage contrarily to what happens in reality compared to what achieved during calibration rice agb was simulated with the same degree of accuracy when the crop was grown in monoculture and in fig 2a whereas better values for all the metrics were obtained for the same variable when rice was competing with weeds and in fig 3a good results were achieved also for rice yield simulations with the crop grown in monoculture in fig 2e and in mixture with weeds in fig 3e 3 3 evaluating weed management scenarios means and standard deviations of the outputs from the 20 annual simulations run for the scenario analysis are shown in fig 4 compared to the base one scenario 1 led to a light increase in rice yield 3 1 that resulted non significant however considering the 20 seasons it was characterized by a lower number of herbicide treatments per year 1 55 treatments year 1 versus 2 00 treatments year 1 this means that one the one hand differences in the weather conditions among seasons allowed avoiding the second treatment in nine years out of 20 given the weed relative abundance never exceeded the threshold triggering the second treatment maximum relative abundance after the first treatment in those nine years was 6 4 on the other hand the higher mean yield demonstrates that triggering the second treatment based on the weed relative abundance instead of applying it a constant number of days after sowing allowed increasing the treatment efficiency in the years when the second treatment was applied results from scenario 2 demonstrate the model sensitivity to floodwater level increasing floodwater level from 5 cm to 10 cm allowed penalizing the weeds which are less tolerant than rice to partial submergence of culm tissues hattori et al 2009 indeed the mean of the daily floodwater level suitability factors for rice decreased by 5 3 because of the increase in floodwater level whereas it decreased by 36 0 for the weed this translated into higher competitiveness of rice with a 11 8 increase in mean yield compared to the base scenario however the large variability among seasons made the increase non significant scenarios 3 and 4 are instead based on changes to the values of two of the traits of the simulated rice cultivar increased thermal requirements for emergence scenario 3 led the weed establishing faster than rice thus making more pressure on the crop with an effect that was only partially mitigated by the two herbicide treatments the weed relative abundance before the second treatment was 25 higher compared to the base scenario this led to a mean rice yield that was 21 2 lower p 0 05 compared to the value simulated for the base scenario on the contrary the 10 cm taller rice plants that characterized the scenarios 4 allowed achieving slightly higher although the difference was not significant yields compared to the base scenario 2 7 because of a higher capability to compete for radiation the mean of the weed daily suitability factors for radiation was indeed 2 less compared the base scenario 4 discussion 4 1 novelty of the proposed approach weedycosmo is a new model for the simulation of crop weed interaction based on hierarchically arranged factors daily accounting for the suitability of the different species to environmental and management drivers the model derived from the cosmo approach for the simulation of phytocoenosis dynamics can be coupled with any generic crop model allowing users to work with the crop model they are more familiar with or for which parameter sets for local cultivars are already available this allows upscaling from single species canopies to multi species ones with a reduced effort compared to other approaches the model is characterized by a good compromise between applicability parsimony in terms of information needed for calibration and application and biophysical adherence to the underlying system indeed despite the algorithms used for crop weed interaction are decidedly simpler than in other approaches good performances were achieved for the simulation of time dynamics of key state variables and for the estimation of yield losses caused by weeds when the model was evaluated using datasets collected under different environmental and management conditions this translates into a high usability while successfully capturing key dynamics of crop weed interaction 4 2 reliability domain of validity and limits despite the potential risks due to the calibration method and to the relationship between the number of parameters and the number of observations available for model parameterization the absence of worsening in model performance during the evaluation against independent datasets revealed an overall good robustness of the modeling approach and of the defined parameter sets the simulation of rice aboveground biomass agb and leaf area index lai in monoculture fig 2a table 2 revealed a degree of accuracy consistent with previous studies where rice growth was estimated using different models bouman and van laar 2006 belder et al 2007 or the same crop simulator e g confalonieri et al 2009 pagani et al 2014 the higher uncertainty in lai simulation compared to other variables was already observed by different authors yu et al 2006 confalonieri et al 2009 tartarini et al 2019 and it can be partly due to the larger uncertainty in the methods used for estimating this variable despite early stages are crucial for crop weed interaction martin et al 2001 deen et al 2003 observed during this phase a larger uncertainty in crop and weed grown in mixture lai estimates in a comparative study where four crop weed models were evaluated for wheat and lolium rigidum in this study the authors underlined a general tendency of the models to decrease their accuracy while moving from species in monoculture to crop weed mixtures this phenomenon was not observed during the evaluation of weedycosmo which correctly reproduced observed time dynamics of lai in the post emergence phase and throughout the season for rice and the two weed species whereas it underestimated observations for this variable for red rice in monoculture only for values larger than 6 m2 m 2 in general the overall good model performance while estimating lai should be considered of primary importance given the role of this variable in quantifying the response of rice and weeds to radiation this is indeed crucial for correctly reproducing changes in the relative abundance of the different species throughout the season weedycosmo performances in estimating rice yield losses due to weeds were better than those obtained using empirical approaches based on relative leaf area kropff and spitters 1991 and similar to what achieved for the same crop and weed by bastiaans et al 1997 and kropff et al 1993 using the intercom model in particular kropff et al 1993 reported that intercom allowed explaining 93 of the variance in observations whereas weedycosmo in spite of lower requirements in terms of inputs needed to run the simulation explained only 10 variance less however the model evaluation for barnyardgrass should be considered as decidedly preliminary given the few data available indeed despite the good performances achieved for rice in mixture with this weed species could be considered an indirect guarantee of the functioning of the whole system and thus of the reliability of barnyardgrass parameterization related parameter values need to be further evaluated one of the main limits of the current version of weedycosmo is the absence of algorithms for simulating phenotypic plasticity driven by inter and intra specific competition colbach et al 2019 this choice was due to the need of limiting model complexity to increase the potential of the model for being adopted in operational farming contexts the quest for limiting the complexity of the model also led to design weedycosmo in such a way to reproduce crop weed interaction at canopy level without downscaling to individual based architectures the good performances obtained during model evaluation further demonstrate that the model design could strictly depend on the specific objective and conditions of application colbach 2010 and that increasing model complexity when not strictly needed could prevent models from being used for decision making under operational conditions park et al 2003 another limit of the approach we propose deals with the absence of algorithms for simulating weed seed survival and thus multi annual weed dynamics this requires initializing the model at the beginning of each seasons however modeling approaches for the simulation of weed seedbank processes are available e g otto et al 2007 bohan et al 2011 and will be integrated in the next version of weedycosmo 4 3 application and implications for weed management support despite some simplifications suggest to further investigate the model behavior in response to treatments e g the effect of canopy density on herbicide efficiency is not considered the scenario analysis demonstrated the suitability of the model as a tool to support strategic decisions regarding when and how often to apply herbicides indeed its capability of optimizing the timing of treatments led to an overall increase in the treatment efficiency and in avoiding the second treatment in 45 of the simulated seasons moreover the model capability of reproducing the lower tolerance of weeds to the partial submersion of tissues hattori et al 2009 makes the model suitable to support weed control strategies based also on the modulation of water management moreover the model sensitivity to changes in the traits of the simulated rice cultivar opens to the possibility to perform ideotyping studies for supporting breeding programs targeting an increase of rice competitiveness against weeds this would be important especially for production contexts moving towards the reduction of the use of chemicals or their abandonment e g organic farming indeed despite the increasing demand for breeding programs targeting a higher competitiveness against weeds fontaine et al 2009 very few studies are available where crop weed interaction models were used to identify in a quantitative way plant traits able to maximize potential crop productivity while minimizing yield losses due to weeds e g colbach et al 2019 however the model potential for being used to support decision making is limited in its current configuration by the absence of algorithms for the estimation of seed production and survival this limits the types of analysis the model can be used for although the capability to reproduce seasonal dynamics of crop weed interaction with a low number of inputs opens to further extensions of the model that will broaden its usefulness for management support under operational farming conditions 4 4 perspectives thanks to the good balance between usability and capability of capturing key processes involved with crop weed interaction weedycosmo opens up new opportunities for extending existing dss towards the possibility to support weed management under operational farming conditions further activities will refer to tests on other crops and weeds and to the model linkage to modeling approaches for the simulation of weed seedbank processes like seed mortality and dormancy e g otto et al 2007 bohan et al 2011 and weed germination emergence e g masin et al 2010 gardarin et al 2012 borgy et al 2015 and the evaluation of the model for designing rice ideotypes more competitive against weeds bastiaans et al 1997 moreover approaches for the simulation of the effect of mechanical weed control will also be implemented 5 conclusions we proposed a new approach namely weedycosmo to simulate the time dynamics involved with crop weed interaction based on the quantification of the suitability of the different species to the environmental and management conditions explored each day the model was developed by targeting operational contexts thus we paid particular attention to limit its requirements in terms of data needed for calibration and application weedycosmo can be coupled with any generic crop model thus allowing to extend existing modeling approaches e g those already implemented in operational simulation platforms for being used to support strategic decisions on weed management weedycosmo demonstrated its suitability in simulating the interactions between different rice cultivars and two major rice weeds i e red rice and barnyardgrass whose time trends of aboveground biomass and leaf area index were accurately reproduced as well as rice yield losses due to weed presence the model demonstrated its suitability also for scenario analysis showing a good potential for being used to identify context specific management strategies as demonstrated by the results achieved during model evaluation the novel approach to upscale from single species to multi species canopies allows simulating crop weed interaction without the need to implement individual based architectures this makes the model easy to use because of the limited number of parameters most of which are shared with many crop models widely used worldwide however despite its low complexity the good performances achieved seem to further demonstrate what observed by deen et al 2003 who concluded a comparative study suggesting the absence of clear relationships between model complexity and the capability to capture most of the dynamics involved with crops response to weed competition the capability of weedycosmo to simulate changes in the relative abundance of crops and weeds on a daily basis encourages its evaluation as a tool to support the optimization of weed management

24523,defining a species ecological niche is not a trivial task particularly for marine taxa since physical and biological constraints are not easily perceived in these environments yet coastal habitats are divided into provinces influenced by different environmental conditions such as superficial marine currents causing seasonality in marine productivity and biomass the south american tern sterna hirundinacea is a poorly known migratory seabird distributed along the pacific and atlantic coasts of south america including the malvinas falkland islands and occurring in most of the south american coastal provinces limited knowledge on the migratory behaviour of the species points to differential habits between southern and northern populations the species breeding season also varies with latitude and season occurring during spring in the south and in the fall in northern areas of the species occurrence these observations point to putatively ecologically distinct populations along the species range that seem to be coincident with coastal provinces to test our hypotheses we estimated full range ecological niche models per season and we used coastal provinces to model ecological niches for each of the known breeding areas seasons we also tested for environmental space differentiation between seasons and breeding and non breeding areas overall the species does not seem to occupy significantly different ecological niches throughout the year except during the breeding season particularly between the warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces in fall this suggests that the south american tern migratory behaviour the selection of different microhabitats and reproductive areas or distinct biological interactors might be influencing the species environmental space nonetheless our models reinforce the gradual migration of this tern species towards the south spending the summer mostly in the malvinas falkland islands interestingly the species seems to be resident in peru coastal area thus despite the absence of ecological divergence population structure should be tested and demographic trends assessed along the species range keywords coastal provinces migration niche overlap niche divergence niche truncation seasonality 1 introduction the concept of niche is one of the most relevant in ecology yet one of the most discussed and difficult to apply in practice e g brown and carnaval 2019 peterson and soberón 2012 multiple concepts have been suggested from the arguably simplest fundamental niche comprising the set of environmental combinations in which viable populations can persist to promote the survival of the species peterson et al 2011 to the more complex definition of occupied niche which further considers biological interactors e g pollinators dispersers competitors and predators and the accessible areas for population dispersal barve et al 2011 peterson et al 2011 soberón et al 2017 however most of these biotic factors are difficult to represent in the niche modelling process hence are rarely included barve et al 2011 soberón et al 2017 moreover in real life situations species are in a non equilibrium state i e over ecological times their distribution ranges are constantly shifting in response to biotic interactions the appearance of geographic barriers seasonal climatic patterns and other anthropogenic disturbances araújo and pearson 2005 brown and carnaval 2019 elith et al 2010 eyres et al 2017 peterson and soberón 2012 in this regard several studies have also emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate calibration areas to build ecological niche models enms that provide the most ecologically realistic results i e choosing areas large enough to consider the species mobility but restricted enough to reflect their dispersal limitations anderson and raza 2010 barve et al 2011 giovanelli et al 2010 peterson 2011 soberón and peterson 2005 vanderwal et al 2009 while this selection might be straightforward in terrestrial environments where physical e g rivers mountains and biological barriers e g competitors are often easily perceived azuaje rodríguez et al 2020 tocchio et al 2015 modelling marine species is a particular challenge especially for migratory species due to the lack of evident barriers to dispersal melo merino et al 2020 and limited knowledge on migration habits and data for non breeding areas ponti et al 2020 understanding ecological requirements and distribution of seabirds is vital for their conservation and the maintenance of their ecosystems since seabirds are top predators in the marine environments and their populations act as bioindicators of oceanographic changes responding to the increase in the sea surface temperature weimerskirch et al 2003 direct disturbances on marine natural habitats are affecting both the migratory behaviour and the survival of these birds dias et al 2019 hogan et al 2010 russell et al 2015 senner et al 2017 yorio et al 1994 so far although seabirds are globally spread studies assessing their seasonal distributions and ecological requirements have been mostly conducted in the atlantic coasts melo merino et al 2020 models with high temporal and spatial resolution are still lacking for most of the south american species particularly those occurring in the pacific coasts melo merino et al 2020 therefore how southern coastal environments shape the seabirds migratory behaviour and influence population differentiation have been seldom addressed topics but see e g ingenloff 2017 scales et al 2016 along marine coasts different superficial marine currents increase productivity and biomass heterogeneously creating distinct feeding areas for seabird communities bost et al 2009 friedlaender et al 2011 and possibly forcing populations to vary their migratory and reproductive habits according to the food availability bost et al 2009 these areas harbour different sets of endemic taxa and have been divided into provinces to convey such marine variability spalding et al 2007 in south america provinces from the atlantic coast tropical southwestern atlantic and warm temperate southwestern atlantic fig 1 present an enhanced marine productivity resulting from superficial marine currents from the subtropical surface warm water of brazil and sub antarctic cold waters from the antarctic circumpolar current olson et al 1988 spalding et al 2007 in the pacific coast the tropical eastern pacific and warm temperate southeastern pacific provinces are influenced by the cold nutrient rich water from the humboldt current system and the antarctic polar front spalding et al 2007 thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 lastly the most southern province the magellanic province is characterized by low water salinity cold temperatures and high concentration of nutrients product of the convergence of the sub antarctic and antarctic polar fronts and the malvinas falkland current olson et al 1988 spalding et al 2007 the south american tern sterna hirundinacea is a migratory seabird restricted to a narrow coastal area within the atlantic coast mostly from the south of brazil to argentina including the malvinas falkland islands and in the pacific coast from chile to peru fig 1 in austral winter the species distribution occasionally extends further north to ecuador and north eastern of brazil but resident populations seem to be established in the rest of the territory gochfeld et al 2020 making this species to occur in the majority of the south american coastal provinces fig 1 the south american tern southern populations seem to present a long distance directional migration making long distance seasonal movements along chilean coasts and argentina and malvinas falkland islands eyres et al 2017 gochfeld et al 2020 however it is uncertain if long distance migrations are also performed by the south american tern connecting both northern and southern populations this observation might suggest the delimitation of distinct populations for the south american tern along latitudinal and longitudinal axes i e pacific vs atlantic and northern vs southern populations furthermore the breeding season varies markedly with latitude reproduction occurs during spring from october to december for southern breeding colonies distributed on the coast of southern argentina and chile and the malvinas falkland islands i e mostly in the magellanic province fig 1 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 whereas northern breeding colonies are established in the fall between april and june being distributed along the coast of brazil corresponding to the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province fig 1 and north of chile and peru i e within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province fig 1 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 vooren and chiaradia 1990 thus the putatively different migratory behaviour and particularly the different seasonally reproductive habits along the species distribution suggest the south american tern might harbour ecologically distinct populations limited by the south american coastal provinces fig 1 in this context here we use this tern species to test the utility of coastal provinces delimitation in the niche modelling procedure for seabirds by i estimating enms for the entire range of distribution of the south american tern per season and in each of the putative breeding populations delimited by coastal provinces ii by comparing ecological niches between breeding and non breeding areas and seasons through environmental space differentiation testing and iii by describing the most relevant environmental variables that influence the species distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 occurrence data the study area includes the atlantic latitude from 9 8 n to 58 6 s and longitude from 69 4 w to 33 3 e and the pacific coasts of south america latitude from 0 14 n to 58 01 s and longitude from 84 2 w to 67 1 e we delineated calibration areas as coastal marine areas within a 250 km buffer around the shore fig 1 considering the south american tern mobility the maximum distance from shore to high sea observed from the species occurrence records and the distance between mainland and the malvinas falkland islands barve et al 2011 gochfeld et al 2020 ingenloff 2017 soberón and peterson 2005 we used the qgis platform v 2 18 28 to delineate the study area qgis development team 2019 we collected 8585 occurrence records for the south american tern from online repositories vertnet vertnet org accessed january 2019 xeno canto xeno canto org accessed january 2019 and global biodiversity information facility gbif org accessed july 2019 corresponding to the period between 1907 and 2019 these repositories present a data quality control and expert review before the online publication we removed records with incomplete geographic information duplicated records from the same grid square and records falling outside the calibration area using the package modelos in r v 3 5 3 r core team 2019 we used a final dataset of 644 occurrence records fig 1 table s1 and divided these records according to the southern hemisphere meteorological seasons spring september 21 december 20 summer december 21 march 20 fall march 21 june 20 and winter june 21 september 20 to accommodate the species reproductive and migratory seasonality into the enms eyres et al 2017 ingenloff 2017 nasa oceancolor web 2019 even though the records extended over a 112 years period most of them were collected in the last few years fig s1 in addition exploratory analyses dividing the records into old 1907 2001 and modern datasets 2002 2019 revealed similarity in the environmental and geographic spaces between sets supporting all records could be used in the modelling procedure 2 2 environmental data we used eight environmental variables known to be ecologically relevant for seabirds barrett and krasnov 1996 weichler et al 2004 we obtained the following variables from global modis aqua l3 smi data absorption coefficient due to phytoplankton at 443 nm chlorophyll a concentration photosynthetically available radiation particulate organic carbon particulate inorganic carbon sea surface temperature nightly sea surface temperature and diffuse attenuation coefficient oceancolor gsfc nasa gov accessed august 2019 these environmental variables encompassed seasonal climatology mean composite and were downloaded separately for each season the variables corresponded to the period between 2002 and 2019 and presented a 4 km spatial resolution to match the resolution of the occurrence data franklin 2010 peterson et al 2011 to select from these eight environmental variables those uncorrelated for the modelling procedure we performed a pearson s correlation analysis using the usdm r package considering a correlation threshold r 0 70 dormann et al 2013 r core team 2019 zar 1999 2 3 ecological niche modelling since enough evidence exists for ecological seasonality in the south american tern i e migration occurring mostly during the winter and summer and reproduction during the spring and fall carlos 2009 eyres et al 2017 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 we completed enms by season following two different approaches in the first approach we calibrated models for the entire species distribution range with no delimitation of geographic populations resulting in four enms i e one per season for the second approach we calibrated enms for the three known breeding areas seasons for the south american tern considering their delimitation by the coastal provinces from the global biogeographic system for coastal and shelf areas marine regions of the world spalding et al 2007 magellanic province in the spring warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces in the fall fig 1 and then performed projections into the entire species distribution range we expected to obtain higher occurrence probability within provinces during breeding seasons if the environmental features of the coastal provinces would be good proxies to delimit ecologically distinct populations of the south american tern we selected maxent a presence background algorithm because we only had presence records for the south american tern and such algorithms are considered less biased than absence based methods in such cases peterson et al 2011 we ran the algorithm in the kuenm package in r v 3 5 3 cobos et al 2019 r core team 2019 this package allows species specific settings to generate the enms such as feature classes standardized multiplier values and the use of different data partitioning methods in addition the package automates model calibration evaluation and reproducibility cobos et al 2019 for each model we performed 10 replicates with the bootstrap method allowing for a random 75 training and 25 testing data partition we generated 10 000 random background points throughout the entire calibration area phillips et al 2009 phillips and dudík 2008 such random background method assumes that the species is equally likely to reach any location across the calibration area merow et al 2013 to obtain the best model possible in each replicate we tested three feature classes l linear q quadratic p product in three different combinations lq lqp q and five different standardized multiplier values 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 merow et al 2013 to assess the significance of each model we used the partial area roc curve using 50 of random points and 500 bootstrap iterations considering best models with mean 1 and p value 0 05 peterson et al 2008 the performance of each model was assessed through omission rates with good performances corresponding to a rate 5 cobos et al 2019 finally the akaike s information criterion aicc was used to assess models complexity aicc values close to zero were preferred muscarella et al 2014 we used the complementary log log cloglog transformation in maxent to estimate the occurrence probability phillips et al 2017 finally for the model projections under the second modelling approach we used the free extrapolation setting to predict the responses in the entire area of distribution of the species the r code for all the methodological procedures and a brief description of the models following the odmap overview data model assessment and prediction protocol zurell et al 2020 are provided in the appendix s1 and table s2 2 4 environmental space comparisons we used the humboldt package in r v 3 5 3 brown and carnaval 2019 r core team 2019 to test if the occupied niche for the south american tern varies throughout the year and distribution range i e between seasons and areas respectively this algorithm overcomes the need for similar geographical space between the target species populations allowing to compare different regions and considers a multidimensional and abstract environmental space accounting for the non equilibrium state that characterizes wild species distributions brown and carnaval 2019 warren et al 2010 2008 we performed both the niche overlap test and the niche divergence test brown and carnaval 2019 these tests distinguish whether differences in the environmental space emerge from true niche divergence or result from other factors such as life history traits biological interactors or the configuration of the accessible environments brown and carnaval 2019 in each test we considered schoener s d niche similarity index which ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting complete overlap warren et al 2008 and a statistical significance at p 0 05 for the equivalence and background statistics brown and carnaval 2019 a significant value p 0 05 for the equivalence and background statistics in both niche overlap and divergence test indicates that the niches compared are different and divergent brown and carnaval 2019 in addition we estimated the potential niche truncation index pnti to evaluate if the species occupied niche reflects its fundamental niche brown and carnaval 2019 per season and province moderate 0 15 pnti 0 3 to high risk values pnti 0 3 inform that the occupied niche does not match the fundamental niche of the species to do so we removed occurrences closer than 50 km to each other to avoid spatial autocorrelation rarefy units 50 km reduced the input data so that the extent was identical reduce env 2 and we used a principal component analyses reductype pca to represent the environmental space we also corrected the occurrence densities of each dataset correct env t and used a kernel smooth scale of 0 75 and values of kernel density of 0 0001 thresh espace z we first completed comparisons between seasons considering the full distribution range of the south american tern to assess niche differentiation and divergence along the species annual migration we expected to find niche similarity between seasons justifying the migratory movement secondly we tested variation between breeding areas seasons i e magellanic province during spring and each of the warm temperate southwestern atlantic and the warm temperate southeastern pacific provinces in fall and non breeding areas seasons i e all the other possible combinations between provinces and seasons to detect niche differentiation and divergence during the species annual reproductive cycle we expected to find niche differentiation between breeding and non breeding areas seasons justifying the regionally asynchronic breeding periods 3 results 3 1 ecological niche models enms four environmental variables were selected after pearson s correlation test chlorophyll a concentration absorption due to phytoplankton at 443 nm particulate inorganic carbon and sea surface temperature see fig s2 for a detailed annual variation of each environmental variable the final dataset comprised 644 occurrence records for the south american tern the number of observations for the spring and summer 68 32 n 440 was superior to that for the fall and winter 31 68 n 204 table 1 during breeding seasons most of the records correspond to the magellanic province 18 2 n 117 follow by the warm temperate southeastern pacific 6 52 n 42 and the warm temperate southwestern atlantic 4 4 n 28 table 1 importantly we have found a limited number of occurrences during the breeding season within the tropical eastern pacific n 2 and the tropical southeastern atlantic provinces n 4 with most of the occurrences in these provinces collected during the winter n 20 the parameters for each of the best models selected are depicted in table 1 the partial area under the roc curve values and the akaike s information criterion supported statistical significance and good performance of all the enms table 1 in addition omission rates values were overall low 0 07 table 1 the occurrence probability obtained in the first modelling approach fig 2 was ecologically realistic and gave a good representation of the migratory behaviour of the species fig 2 in this first approach the areas in the north were almost entirely replaced by southern locations from winter to summer with the exception of peru coastal area that remained with a high occurrence probability year round fig 2 in the second modelling approach projections made for the fall within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province fig 3 a b and spring in the magellanic province fig 3c d predicted a high occurrence probability outside the known area of occurrence for the species in each time of the year only for the fall within the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province the projection supported higher occurrence probability within the reported breeding area fig 3d e response curves for the first modelling approach indicated a positive correlation between the absorption coefficient due to phytoplankton at 443 nm and the occurrence probability of the species during the spring but not so during the other seasons fig s3 a e i m the chlorophyll a concentration was also positively correlated with the occurrence probability of the species during all the seasons fig s3 b f j and n conversely the particulate inorganic carbon was negatively correlated with the species occurrence during all but the summer season fig s3 c g k o similarly during spring and summer as the sea surface temperature increased the occurrence probability of the species decreased fig s3 d h 3 2 environmental space comparisons the niche overlap tests between seasons considering the entire species distribution range d 0 19 e 0 05 and in the provinces during non breeding seasons d 0 09 e 0 05 indicated niche equivalency table 2 conversely only one comparison between breeding seasons warm temperate southeastern pacific province vs warm temperate southwestern

seasons d 0 24 e 0 05 and provinces during breeding and non breeding seasons d 0 11 e 0 05 table 2 we were not able to perform some niche divergence tests between provinces due to little overlap in

niche comparisons between provinces resulted in variable levels of niche truncation table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the south american tern ecological niche the occurrence records we have gathered confirm that the south american tern only occurs occasionally during winter in the northmost area of the species occurrence i e within the tropical eastern pacific and tropical southeastern atlantic provinces carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 general distribution patterns and seasonality previously documented for the south american tern further supports the species winters mainly on the coasts of brazil and peru and spends the summer in chile and argentina bugoni and vooren 2005 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 vooren and chiaradia 1990 this seasonal behaviour is well evidenced in the records available for the atlantic particularly southern argentina with considerably distinct number of occurrences between spring summer and autumn winter supporting previous references to this species as sub antarctic kullenberg 1963 interestingly our full range calibration enms not only reflect the reported north south seasonal movements of the species but also the seasonality of the migration between argentina spring and the malvinas falkland islands summer more importantly all our models for the first modelling approach support the species might be resident in peru contradicting current literature gochfeld et al 2020 during the fall the south american tern mostly establishes reproductive colonies along the coasts of peru within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province and brazil within the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province and in the magellanic province during spring carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 this would suggest that the provinces could be delimiting environmentally different conditions for the south american tern however most of our models predicted higher occurrence probability outside the expected areas supporting that this second approach has limited utility in identifying relevant ecological barriers at least for this seabird therefore our discussion on the species ecological requirements is based on the enms obtained from the full range calibration area differences in the response curves obtained per environmental variable seem to point to interesting environmental differences between seasons chlorophyll a concentration response curves indicate a positive correlation with the occurrence probability of the species during all seasons chlorophyll a has also been often observed as a relevant variable for procellariiformes from the southern atlantic ocean as the grey headed albatross thalassarche chrysostoma scales et al 2016 and other charadriiformes from the north pacific ocean as the kelp gull larus dominicanus franklin s gull larus pipixcan and grey gull larus modestus weichler et al 2004 in fact chlorophyll a has been used as a proxy of marine productivity and prey availability for several taxa including seabirds friedlaender et al 2011 ingenloff 2017 tobeña et al 2016 chlorophyll a is an indirect estimator of the biomass of phytoplankton and photosynthetic rate of the primary marine producers hu et al 2012 sardiña 2005 turner 2004 yentsch 1960 this fuels zooplankton and fish production which ultimately supports higher trophic levels including large populations of seabirds thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 the south american tern seems so not to be an exception as fish comprise most of its diet alfaro et al 2011 the species has a generalist feeding strategy characterized by a broad dietary niche width alfaro et al 2011 amundsen et al 1996 a variety of fish species are part of the diet of this tern in the atlantic coast as the pelagic engraulis anchoita anchoa marinii lycengraulis grossidens and odontesthes argentinensis ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 terns are surface feeding species that make shallow dives into the ocean water vandendriessche et al 2007 notwithstanding some demersal fish species are also part of the south american tern diet e g bigtooth corvina isopisthus parvipinnis stripped weakfish cynoscion guatucupa argentine croaker umbrina canosai silverside odontesthes incisa king weakfish macrodon ancylodon whitemouth croaker micropogonias furnieri largehead hairtail trichiurus lepturus and false hering harengula clupeola ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 these demersal fish species can only be obtained through discarded bycatch fish and not by direct capture at deep sea as observed for other tern species such as the royal tern thalasseus maximus bugoni and vooren 2005 and the common tern sterna hirundo during the non breeding periods bugoni and vooren 2004 commercial fishery is increasing the diversity of fish species present in seabirds diet altering their feeding and migratory habits favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 friedlaender et al 2011 karpouzi et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 furthermore maximum fishing effort occurs during spring and summer along the southern coast of south america and in the atlantic coast during winter guiet et al 2019 coinciding with the species migratory behaviour additionally the south american tern can occasionally exploit other resources although fish comprise the larger proportion 82 88 of the species diet the rest of the year in the winter season when fish stocks are limited crustaceans and insects can also be part of the diet of the south american tern ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 fracasso et al 2011 therefore although chlorophyll a and so marine productivity and prey availability are relevant for the presence of the south american tern the species generalist and opportunistic feeding behaviour might also be contributing for the absence of environmental variation in our models despite there are no studies based on the diet of the south american tern in the pacific coast the pelagic anchoveta engraulis ringens might be an important food resource in that region as this is the major prey species for the arctic tern sterna paradisaea in the humboldt upwelling at the north pacific ocean duffy et al 2013 for the first modelling approach the response curves for the sea surface temperature indicate a negative correlation with the occurrence probability of the species but only during the spring and summer variation in seabird distribution patterns has for long known to be influenced by variation in the sea surface temperature gall et al 2017 weichler et al 2004 and the species has been associated to cold fronts before kullenberg 1963 furthermore this variable is of great importance in marine ecosystem regulation and its increase leads to algal blooms which might be beneficial supporting marine productivity but also harmful leading to the eutrophication of the ocean rivas 2010 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 due to climate change natural but toxic algal blooms are more frequent associated with a rise on the sea surface temperature since the 1990 s ipcc 2019 trainer et al 2020 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 seasonal blooms in the patagonian continental shelf take place during the austral spring and summer caused by the influence of thermal fronts i e sudden increases in the sea surface temperature that are in general more numerous and intense during these seasons poulton et al 2013 rivas 2006 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 this can explain the sea surface temperature seasonal negative effect on the south american tern occurrence particulate inorganic carbon also presented a negative correlation with the occurrence probability for the south american tern during fall and winter particulate inorganic carbon is one of the principal products of the oceanic photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton hopkins et al 2019 southern hemisphere plays a significant role in the temporal and spatial variability in the oceanic particulate inorganic carbon with highest values observed at the beginning of the austral summer and lowest at the beginning of the austral winter predominantly off the coasts of chile and namibia hopkins et al 2019 during winter and early spring primary production rates and phytoplankton biomass increase in the southeastern brazilian coast related to the nutrients supplied from seasonal displacement of the subtropical convergence and the freshwater discharge of the la plata river and patos lagoon estuary ciotti et al 1995 lima et al 1996 the cold low salinity sub antarctic waters from the argentinean shelf arriving the southeastern brazilian coast increases the biological productivity and the dynamics of shelf sea ecosystem lima et al 1996 which might explain the response of the particulate inorganic carbon to the enm models in winter 4 2 environmental space comparisons for the south american tern most of our results from the humboldt analyses for the equivalence and background statistic suggest that there is limited support for seasonal niche differentiation and divergence along the south american tern migration route despite the low values of schoener s d niche similarity index in our comparisons d 0 19 similar results for this index were show by ponti et al 2020 for other charadriiformes species d 0 1 supporting this might be a general pattern for these birds however this interpretation must be done with caution since humboldt s niche comparisons might be less efficient when the environmental spaces compared are very similar but also for taxa with narrow and restricted ranges due to the inherent limited environmental space available for comparison brown and carnaval 2019 as verified in our case study some migratory seabird species present a high level of migratory connectivity as well i e most individuals from one breeding population move to the same non breeding location to form a non breeding population with a relatively small proportion of individuals migrating to other wintering areas webster et al 2002 for instance some tern species with a long distance migration such as the artic tern encompass coastal oceanic and polar regions duffy et al 2013 fijn et al 2013 redfern and bevan 2020 and the common tern and the sandwich tern thalasseus sandvicensis perform overland migrations across the teesmouth national nature reserve in northeastern england ward 2000 the south american tern is known to migrate across the atlantic coast from the south of argentina to brazil and malvinas falkland islands and along the pacific coast from ecuador to chile gochfeld et al 2020 this migratory strategy of the south american tern might allow the species to maintain similar environmental spaces throughout the year as supported in our analyses yet niche overlap tests suggest that south american tern might occupy different environmental spaces during breeding seasons particularly during the fall in the warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces this probably results from differences in the choice of microhabitats and reproductive areas that might lead to environmental space differentiation in seabird species burg and croxall 2001 as the geographic distance between the ranges of two populations increases shared biotic factors are expected to decrease and might play different roles in the distribution of the populations brown and carnaval 2019 furthermore the seasonal and spatial differences in microhabitat choices are suspected to play an important role in niche segregation while avoiding competition amongst tern species bugoni and vooren 2005 last environmental seasonal comparisons considering the entire species distribution range resulted in a low niche truncation risk indicating that the measured occupied niche reflects the species fundamental niche brown and carnaval 2019 conversely environmental comparisons between provinces resulted in a moderated to high niche truncation risk indicating that the environmental space of each province represents only a sub portion of the species fundamental niche this is also consistent with the spurious occurrence probability areas obtained in enm models by province provinces seem to be incomplete representations of the fundamental niche as their use as calibration areas result in overfitted models peterson et al 2011 5 conclusions our results refuted our hypothesis that coastal provinces might correspond to environmental variation delimiting distinct ecological niches for seabirds however the use of such partitioning allows the detection of regional environmental variation that would be otherwise unnoticed furthermore our regional per season partitioning confirms that in the enm procedure for migratory species either seabirds or other it is essential to account for the non equilibrium state of their distributions and seasonal partitioning of the data is valuable to understand the species dynamics although such approach has still been seldom used ingenloff 2017 therefore we recommend partitioning the occurrence datasets into seasons for enm of migratory species niche truncation analysis seems to be an interesting method to confirm the adequacy of such division nonetheless ecological niche comparisons remain challenging rendering ambiguous results for seabirds hindered by the narrow distribution ranges of these species brown and carnaval 2019 the potential ecological niche of the south american tern is driven principally by environmental variables indicative of marine ecosystem regulation marine productivity and prey availability as observed for other seabirds gall et al 2017 rivas 2010 scales et al 2016 thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 the temporal variability we observe in the potential niche of the south american tern does not seem to be enough to cause environmental divergence and differentiation nonetheless we highlight that investigation on the role of fisheries bycatch as food resource and driver of niche divergence is still lacking for this and other seabirds particularly in the pacific coast importantly the influence of sea surface temperature and sea surface temperature increase ipcc 2019 is not homogeneous throughout the south american coasts per season how this variation will impact population persistence and connectivity between populations of the south american tern and other seabirds is unclear since genetic population structure and demographic trends on this and other species are poorly known faria et al 2010 gochfeld et al 2020 importantly the year round high occurrence probability area in coastal peru that we have identified in our models corresponding to the northernmost portion of the species distribution and potentially seasonally isolated points to a probable population structure which should be further investigated moreover given that more than 20 of the recently globally assessed seabird species are estimated to be negatively impacted by climate change alone dias et al 2019 we emphasize a thorough assessment of the demographic trends and population structure for the south american tern are urgently needed

24523,defining a species ecological niche is not a trivial task particularly for marine taxa since physical and biological constraints are not easily perceived in these environments yet coastal habitats are divided into provinces influenced by different environmental conditions such as superficial marine currents causing seasonality in marine productivity and biomass the south american tern sterna hirundinacea is a poorly known migratory seabird distributed along the pacific and atlantic coasts of south america including the malvinas falkland islands and occurring in most of the south american coastal provinces limited knowledge on the migratory behaviour of the species points to differential habits between southern and northern populations the species breeding season also varies with latitude and season occurring during spring in the south and in the fall in northern areas of the species occurrence these observations point to putatively ecologically distinct populations along the species range that seem to be coincident with coastal provinces to test our hypotheses we estimated full range ecological niche models per season and we used coastal provinces to model ecological niches for each of the known breeding areas seasons we also tested for environmental space differentiation between seasons and breeding and non breeding areas overall the species does not seem to occupy significantly different ecological niches throughout the year except during the breeding season particularly between the warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces in fall this suggests that the south american tern migratory behaviour the selection of different microhabitats and reproductive areas or distinct biological interactors might be influencing the species environmental space nonetheless our models reinforce the gradual migration of this tern species towards the south spending the summer mostly in the malvinas falkland islands interestingly the species seems to be resident in peru coastal area thus despite the absence of ecological divergence population structure should be tested and demographic trends assessed along the species range keywords coastal provinces migration niche overlap niche divergence niche truncation seasonality 1 introduction the concept of niche is one of the most relevant in ecology yet one of the most discussed and difficult to apply in practice e g brown and carnaval 2019 peterson and soberón 2012 multiple concepts have been suggested from the arguably simplest fundamental niche comprising the set of environmental combinations in which viable populations can persist to promote the survival of the species peterson et al 2011 to the more complex definition of occupied niche which further considers biological interactors e g pollinators dispersers competitors and predators and the accessible areas for population dispersal barve et al 2011 peterson et al 2011 soberón et al 2017 however most of these biotic factors are difficult to represent in the niche modelling process hence are rarely included barve et al 2011 soberón et al 2017 moreover in real life situations species are in a non equilibrium state i e over ecological times their distribution ranges are constantly shifting in response to biotic interactions the appearance of geographic barriers seasonal climatic patterns and other anthropogenic disturbances araújo and pearson 2005 brown and carnaval 2019 elith et al 2010 eyres et al 2017 peterson and soberón 2012 in this regard several studies have also emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate calibration areas to build ecological niche models enms that provide the most ecologically realistic results i e choosing areas large enough to consider the species mobility but restricted enough to reflect their dispersal limitations anderson and raza 2010 barve et al 2011 giovanelli et al 2010 peterson 2011 soberón and peterson 2005 vanderwal et al 2009 while this selection might be straightforward in terrestrial environments where physical e g rivers mountains and biological barriers e g competitors are often easily perceived azuaje rodríguez et al 2020 tocchio et al 2015 modelling marine species is a particular challenge especially for migratory species due to the lack of evident barriers to dispersal melo merino et al 2020 and limited knowledge on migration habits and data for non breeding areas ponti et al 2020 understanding ecological requirements and distribution of seabirds is vital for their conservation and the maintenance of their ecosystems since seabirds are top predators in the marine environments and their populations act as bioindicators of oceanographic changes responding to the increase in the sea surface temperature weimerskirch et al 2003 direct disturbances on marine natural habitats are affecting both the migratory behaviour and the survival of these birds dias et al 2019 hogan et al 2010 russell et al 2015 senner et al 2017 yorio et al 1994 so far although seabirds are globally spread studies assessing their seasonal distributions and ecological requirements have been mostly conducted in the atlantic coasts melo merino et al 2020 models with high temporal and spatial resolution are still lacking for most of the south american species particularly those occurring in the pacific coasts melo merino et al 2020 therefore how southern coastal environments shape the seabirds migratory behaviour and influence population differentiation have been seldom addressed topics but see e g ingenloff 2017 scales et al 2016 along marine coasts different superficial marine currents increase productivity and biomass heterogeneously creating distinct feeding areas for seabird communities bost et al 2009 friedlaender et al 2011 and possibly forcing populations to vary their migratory and reproductive habits according to the food availability bost et al 2009 these areas harbour different sets of endemic taxa and have been divided into provinces to convey such marine variability spalding et al 2007 in south america provinces from the atlantic coast tropical southwestern atlantic and warm temperate southwestern atlantic fig 1 present an enhanced marine productivity resulting from superficial marine currents from the subtropical surface warm water of brazil and sub antarctic cold waters from the antarctic circumpolar current olson et al 1988 spalding et al 2007 in the pacific coast the tropical eastern pacific and warm temperate southeastern pacific provinces are influenced by the cold nutrient rich water from the humboldt current system and the antarctic polar front spalding et al 2007 thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 lastly the most southern province the magellanic province is characterized by low water salinity cold temperatures and high concentration of nutrients product of the convergence of the sub antarctic and antarctic polar fronts and the malvinas falkland current olson et al 1988 spalding et al 2007 the south american tern sterna hirundinacea is a migratory seabird restricted to a narrow coastal area within the atlantic coast mostly from the south of brazil to argentina including the malvinas falkland islands and in the pacific coast from chile to peru fig 1 in austral winter the species distribution occasionally extends further north to ecuador and north eastern of brazil but resident populations seem to be established in the rest of the territory gochfeld et al 2020 making this species to occur in the majority of the south american coastal provinces fig 1 the south american tern southern populations seem to present a long distance directional migration making long distance seasonal movements along chilean coasts and argentina and malvinas falkland islands eyres et al 2017 gochfeld et al 2020 however it is uncertain if long distance migrations are also performed by the south american tern connecting both northern and southern populations this observation might suggest the delimitation of distinct populations for the south american tern along latitudinal and longitudinal axes i e pacific vs atlantic and northern vs southern populations furthermore the breeding season varies markedly with latitude reproduction occurs during spring from october to december for southern breeding colonies distributed on the coast of southern argentina and chile and the malvinas falkland islands i e mostly in the magellanic province fig 1 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 whereas northern breeding colonies are established in the fall between april and june being distributed along the coast of brazil corresponding to the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province fig 1 and north of chile and peru i e within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province fig 1 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 vooren and chiaradia 1990 thus the putatively different migratory behaviour and particularly the different seasonally reproductive habits along the species distribution suggest the south american tern might harbour ecologically distinct populations limited by the south american coastal provinces fig 1 in this context here we use this tern species to test the utility of coastal provinces delimitation in the niche modelling procedure for seabirds by i estimating enms for the entire range of distribution of the south american tern per season and in each of the putative breeding populations delimited by coastal provinces ii by comparing ecological niches between breeding and non breeding areas and seasons through environmental space differentiation testing and iii by describing the most relevant environmental variables that influence the species distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 occurrence data the study area includes the atlantic latitude from 9 8 n to 58 6 s and longitude from 69 4 w to 33 3 e and the pacific coasts of south america latitude from 0 14 n to 58 01 s and longitude from 84 2 w to 67 1 e we delineated calibration areas as coastal marine areas within a 250 km buffer around the shore fig 1 considering the south american tern mobility the maximum distance from shore to high sea observed from the species occurrence records and the distance between mainland and the malvinas falkland islands barve et al 2011 gochfeld et al 2020 ingenloff 2017 soberón and peterson 2005 we used the qgis platform v 2 18 28 to delineate the study area qgis development team 2019 we collected 8585 occurrence records for the south american tern from online repositories vertnet vertnet org accessed january 2019 xeno canto xeno canto org accessed january 2019 and global biodiversity information facility gbif org accessed july 2019 corresponding to the period between 1907 and 2019 these repositories present a data quality control and expert review before the online publication we removed records with incomplete geographic information duplicated records from the same grid square and records falling outside the calibration area using the package modelos in r v 3 5 3 r core team 2019 we used a final dataset of 644 occurrence records fig 1 table s1 and divided these records according to the southern hemisphere meteorological seasons spring september 21 december 20 summer december 21 march 20 fall march 21 june 20 and winter june 21 september 20 to accommodate the species reproductive and migratory seasonality into the enms eyres et al 2017 ingenloff 2017 nasa oceancolor web 2019 even though the records extended over a 112 years period most of them were collected in the last few years fig s1 in addition exploratory analyses dividing the records into old 1907 2001 and modern datasets 2002 2019 revealed similarity in the environmental and geographic spaces between sets supporting all records could be used in the modelling procedure 2 2 environmental data we used eight environmental variables known to be ecologically relevant for seabirds barrett and krasnov 1996 weichler et al 2004 we obtained the following variables from global modis aqua l3 smi data absorption coefficient due to phytoplankton at 443 nm chlorophyll a concentration photosynthetically available radiation particulate organic carbon particulate inorganic carbon sea surface temperature nightly sea surface temperature and diffuse attenuation coefficient oceancolor gsfc nasa gov accessed august 2019 these environmental variables encompassed seasonal climatology mean composite and were downloaded separately for each season the variables corresponded to the period between 2002 and 2019 and presented a 4 km spatial resolution to match the resolution of the occurrence data franklin 2010 peterson et al 2011 to select from these eight environmental variables those uncorrelated for the modelling procedure we performed a pearson s correlation analysis using the usdm r package considering a correlation threshold r 0 70 dormann et al 2013 r core team 2019 zar 1999 2 3 ecological niche modelling since enough evidence exists for ecological seasonality in the south american tern i e migration occurring mostly during the winter and summer and reproduction during the spring and fall carlos 2009 eyres et al 2017 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 we completed enms by season following two different approaches in the first approach we calibrated models for the entire species distribution range with no delimitation of geographic populations resulting in four enms i e one per season for the second approach we calibrated enms for the three known breeding areas seasons for the south american tern considering their delimitation by the coastal provinces from the global biogeographic system for coastal and shelf areas marine regions of the world spalding et al 2007 magellanic province in the spring warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces in the fall fig 1 and then performed projections into the entire species distribution range we expected to obtain higher occurrence probability within provinces during breeding seasons if the environmental features of the coastal provinces would be good proxies to delimit ecologically distinct populations of the south american tern we selected maxent a presence background algorithm because we only had presence records for the south american tern and such algorithms are considered less biased than absence based methods in such cases peterson et al 2011 we ran the algorithm in the kuenm package in r v 3 5 3 cobos et al 2019 r core team 2019 this package allows species specific settings to generate the enms such as feature classes standardized multiplier values and the use of different data partitioning methods in addition the package automates model calibration evaluation and reproducibility cobos et al 2019 for each model we performed 10 replicates with the bootstrap method allowing for a random 75 training and 25 testing data partition we generated 10 000 random background points throughout the entire calibration area phillips et al 2009 phillips and dudík 2008 such random background method assumes that the species is equally likely to reach any location across the calibration area merow et al 2013 to obtain the best model possible in each replicate we tested three feature classes l linear q quadratic p product in three different combinations lq lqp q and five different standardized multiplier values 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 merow et al 2013 to assess the significance of each model we used the partial area roc curve using 50 of random points and 500 bootstrap iterations considering best models with mean 1 and p value 0 05 peterson et al 2008 the performance of each model was assessed through omission rates with good performances corresponding to a rate 5 cobos et al 2019 finally the akaike s information criterion aicc was used to assess models complexity aicc values close to zero were preferred muscarella et al 2014 we used the complementary log log cloglog transformation in maxent to estimate the occurrence probability phillips et al 2017 finally for the model projections under the second modelling approach we used the free extrapolation setting to predict the responses in the entire area of distribution of the species the r code for all the methodological procedures and a brief description of the models following the odmap overview data model assessment and prediction protocol zurell et al 2020 are provided in the appendix s1 and table s2 2 4 environmental space comparisons we used the humboldt package in r v 3 5 3 brown and carnaval 2019 r core team 2019 to test if the occupied niche for the south american tern varies throughout the year and distribution range i e between seasons and areas respectively this algorithm overcomes the need for similar geographical space between the target species populations allowing to compare different regions and considers a multidimensional and abstract environmental space accounting for the non equilibrium state that characterizes wild species distributions brown and carnaval 2019 warren et al 2010 2008 we performed both the niche overlap test and the niche divergence test brown and carnaval 2019 these tests distinguish whether differences in the environmental space emerge from true niche divergence or result from other factors such as life history traits biological interactors or the configuration of the accessible environments brown and carnaval 2019 in each test we considered schoener s d niche similarity index which ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting complete overlap warren et al 2008 and a statistical significance at p 0 05 for the equivalence and background statistics brown and carnaval 2019 a significant value p 0 05 for the equivalence and background statistics in both niche overlap and divergence test indicates that the niches compared are different and divergent brown and carnaval 2019 in addition we estimated the potential niche truncation index pnti to evaluate if the species occupied niche reflects its fundamental niche brown and carnaval 2019 per season and province moderate 0 15 pnti 0 3 to high risk values pnti 0 3 inform that the occupied niche does not match the fundamental niche of the species to do so we removed occurrences closer than 50 km to each other to avoid spatial autocorrelation rarefy units 50 km reduced the input data so that the extent was identical reduce env 2 and we used a principal component analyses reductype pca to represent the environmental space we also corrected the occurrence densities of each dataset correct env t and used a kernel smooth scale of 0 75 and values of kernel density of 0 0001 thresh espace z we first completed comparisons between seasons considering the full distribution range of the south american tern to assess niche differentiation and divergence along the species annual migration we expected to find niche similarity between seasons justifying the migratory movement secondly we tested variation between breeding areas seasons i e magellanic province during spring and each of the warm temperate southwestern atlantic and the warm temperate southeastern pacific provinces in fall and non breeding areas seasons i e all the other possible combinations between provinces and seasons to detect niche differentiation and divergence during the species annual reproductive cycle we expected to find niche differentiation between breeding and non breeding areas seasons justifying the regionally asynchronic breeding periods 3 results 3 1 ecological niche models enms four environmental variables were selected after pearson s correlation test chlorophyll a concentration absorption due to phytoplankton at 443 nm particulate inorganic carbon and sea surface temperature see fig s2 for a detailed annual variation of each environmental variable the final dataset comprised 644 occurrence records for the south american tern the number of observations for the spring and summer 68 32 n 440 was superior to that for the fall and winter 31 68 n 204 table 1 during breeding seasons most of the records correspond to the magellanic province 18 2 n 117 follow by the warm temperate southeastern pacific 6 52 n 42 and the warm temperate southwestern atlantic 4 4 n 28 table 1 importantly we have found a limited number of occurrences during the breeding season within the tropical eastern pacific n 2 and the tropical southeastern atlantic provinces n 4 with most of the occurrences in these provinces collected during the winter n 20 the parameters for each of the best models selected are depicted in table 1 the partial area under the roc curve values and the akaike s information criterion supported statistical significance and good performance of all the enms table 1 in addition omission rates values were overall low 0 07 table 1 the occurrence probability obtained in the first modelling approach fig 2 was ecologically realistic and gave a good representation of the migratory behaviour of the species fig 2 in this first approach the areas in the north were almost entirely replaced by southern locations from winter to summer with the exception of peru coastal area that remained with a high occurrence probability year round fig 2 in the second modelling approach projections made for the fall within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province fig 3 a b and spring in the magellanic province fig 3c d predicted a high occurrence probability outside the known area of occurrence for the species in each time of the year only for the fall within the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province the projection supported higher occurrence probability within the reported breeding area fig 3d e response curves for the first modelling approach indicated a positive correlation between the absorption coefficient due to phytoplankton at 443 nm and the occurrence probability of the species during the spring but not so during the other seasons fig s3 a e i m the chlorophyll a concentration was also positively correlated with the occurrence probability of the species during all the seasons fig s3 b f j and n conversely the particulate inorganic carbon was negatively correlated with the species occurrence during all but the summer season fig s3 c g k o similarly during spring and summer as the sea surface temperature increased the occurrence probability of the species decreased fig s3 d h 3 2 environmental space comparisons the niche overlap tests between seasons considering the entire species distribution range d 0 19 e 0 05 and in the provinces during non breeding seasons d 0 09 e 0 05 indicated niche equivalency table 2 conversely only one comparison between breeding seasons warm temperate southeastern pacific province vs warm temperate southwestern

seasons d 0 24 e 0 05 and provinces during breeding and non breeding seasons d 0 11 e 0 05 table 2 we were not able to perform some niche divergence tests between provinces due to little overlap in shared analogous environments table 2 for the comparisons performed analogous climate space percentage varied between 83 and 61 table 2 in all comparisons performed at least one background statistic was non significant supporting the similarity of the compared niches brown and carnaval 2019 all niche comparisons between seasons presented between low to moderate niche truncation pnti 0 17 table 2 niche comparisons between provinces resulted in variable levels of niche truncation table 2 4 discussion 4 1 the south american tern ecological niche the occurrence records we have gathered confirm that the south american tern only occurs occasionally during winter in the northmost area of the species occurrence i e within the tropical eastern pacific and tropical southeastern atlantic provinces carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 general distribution patterns and seasonality previously documented for the south american tern further supports the species winters mainly on the coasts of brazil and peru and spends the summer in chile and argentina bugoni and vooren 2005 carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 vooren and chiaradia 1990 this seasonal behaviour is well evidenced in the records available for the atlantic particularly southern argentina with considerably distinct number of occurrences between spring summer and autumn winter supporting previous references to this species as sub antarctic kullenberg 1963 interestingly our full range calibration enms not only reflect the reported north south seasonal movements of the species but also the seasonality of the migration between argentina spring and the malvinas falkland islands summer more importantly all our models for the first modelling approach support the species might be resident in peru contradicting current literature gochfeld et al 2020 during the fall the south american tern mostly establishes reproductive colonies along the coasts of peru within the warm temperate southeastern pacific province and brazil within the warm temperate southwestern atlantic province and in the magellanic province during spring carlos 2009 gochfeld et al 2020 portflitt toro et al 2018 this would suggest that the provinces could be delimiting environmentally different conditions for the south american tern however most of our models predicted higher occurrence probability outside the expected areas supporting that this second approach has limited utility in identifying relevant ecological barriers at least for this seabird therefore our discussion on the species ecological requirements is based on the enms obtained from the full range calibration area differences in the response curves obtained per environmental variable seem to point to interesting environmental differences between seasons chlorophyll a concentration response curves indicate a positive correlation with the occurrence probability of the species during all seasons chlorophyll a has also been often observed as a relevant variable for procellariiformes from the southern atlantic ocean as the grey headed albatross thalassarche chrysostoma scales et al 2016 and other charadriiformes from the north pacific ocean as the kelp gull larus dominicanus franklin s gull larus pipixcan and grey gull larus modestus weichler et al 2004 in fact chlorophyll a has been used as a proxy of marine productivity and prey availability for several taxa including seabirds friedlaender et al 2011 ingenloff 2017 tobeña et al 2016 chlorophyll a is an indirect estimator of the biomass of phytoplankton and photosynthetic rate of the primary marine producers hu et al 2012 sardiña 2005 turner 2004 yentsch 1960 this fuels zooplankton and fish production which ultimately supports higher trophic levels including large populations of seabirds thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 the south american tern seems so not to be an exception as fish comprise most of its diet alfaro et al 2011 the species has a generalist feeding strategy characterized by a broad dietary niche width alfaro et al 2011 amundsen et al 1996 a variety of fish species are part of the diet of this tern in the atlantic coast as the pelagic engraulis anchoita anchoa marinii lycengraulis grossidens and odontesthes argentinensis ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 terns are surface feeding species that make shallow dives into the ocean water vandendriessche et al 2007 notwithstanding some demersal fish species are also part of the south american tern diet e g bigtooth corvina isopisthus parvipinnis stripped weakfish cynoscion guatucupa argentine croaker umbrina canosai silverside odontesthes incisa king weakfish macrodon ancylodon whitemouth croaker micropogonias furnieri largehead hairtail trichiurus lepturus and false hering harengula clupeola ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 these demersal fish species can only be obtained through discarded bycatch fish and not by direct capture at deep sea as observed for other tern species such as the royal tern thalasseus maximus bugoni and vooren 2005 and the common tern sterna hirundo during the non breeding periods bugoni and vooren 2004 commercial fishery is increasing the diversity of fish species present in seabirds diet altering their feeding and migratory habits favero et al 2000 fracasso et al 2011 friedlaender et al 2011 karpouzi et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 furthermore maximum fishing effort occurs during spring and summer along the southern coast of south america and in the atlantic coast during winter guiet et al 2019 coinciding with the species migratory behaviour additionally the south american tern can occasionally exploit other resources although fish comprise the larger proportion 82 88 of the species diet the rest of the year in the winter season when fish stocks are limited crustaceans and insects can also be part of the diet of the south american tern ajó et al 2011 alfaro et al 2011 fracasso et al 2011 therefore although chlorophyll a and so marine productivity and prey availability are relevant for the presence of the south american tern the species generalist and opportunistic feeding behaviour might also be contributing for the absence of environmental variation in our models despite there are no studies based on the diet of the south american tern in the pacific coast the pelagic anchoveta engraulis ringens might be an important food resource in that region as this is the major prey species for the arctic tern sterna paradisaea in the humboldt upwelling at the north pacific ocean duffy et al 2013 for the first modelling approach the response curves for the sea surface temperature indicate a negative correlation with the occurrence probability of the species but only during the spring and summer variation in seabird distribution patterns has for long known to be influenced by variation in the sea surface temperature gall et al 2017 weichler et al 2004 and the species has been associated to cold fronts before kullenberg 1963 furthermore this variable is of great importance in marine ecosystem regulation and its increase leads to algal blooms which might be beneficial supporting marine productivity but also harmful leading to the eutrophication of the ocean rivas 2010 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 due to climate change natural but toxic algal blooms are more frequent associated with a rise on the sea surface temperature since the 1990 s ipcc 2019 trainer et al 2020 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 seasonal blooms in the patagonian continental shelf take place during the austral spring and summer caused by the influence of thermal fronts i e sudden increases in the sea surface temperature that are in general more numerous and intense during these seasons poulton et al 2013 rivas 2006 zohdi and abbaspour 2019 this can explain the sea surface temperature seasonal negative effect on the south american tern occurrence particulate inorganic carbon also presented a negative correlation with the occurrence probability for the south american tern during fall and winter particulate inorganic carbon is one of the principal products of the oceanic photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton hopkins et al 2019 southern hemisphere plays a significant role in the temporal and spatial variability in the oceanic particulate inorganic carbon with highest values observed at the beginning of the austral summer and lowest at the beginning of the austral winter predominantly off the coasts of chile and namibia hopkins et al 2019 during winter and early spring primary production rates and phytoplankton biomass increase in the southeastern brazilian coast related to the nutrients supplied from seasonal displacement of the subtropical convergence and the freshwater discharge of the la plata river and patos lagoon estuary ciotti et al 1995 lima et al 1996 the cold low salinity sub antarctic waters from the argentinean shelf arriving the southeastern brazilian coast increases the biological productivity and the dynamics of shelf sea ecosystem lima et al 1996 which might explain the response of the particulate inorganic carbon to the enm models in winter 4 2 environmental space comparisons for the south american tern most of our results from the humboldt analyses for the equivalence and background statistic suggest that there is limited support for seasonal niche differentiation and divergence along the south american tern migration route despite the low values of schoener s d niche similarity index in our comparisons d 0 19 similar results for this index were show by ponti et al 2020 for other charadriiformes species d 0 1 supporting this might be a general pattern for these birds however this interpretation must be done with caution since humboldt s niche comparisons might be less efficient when the environmental spaces compared are very similar but also for taxa with narrow and restricted ranges due to the inherent limited environmental space available for comparison brown and carnaval 2019 as verified in our case study some migratory seabird species present a high level of migratory connectivity as well i e most individuals from one breeding population move to the same non breeding location to form a non breeding population with a relatively small proportion of individuals migrating to other wintering areas webster et al 2002 for instance some tern species with a long distance migration such as the artic tern encompass coastal oceanic and polar regions duffy et al 2013 fijn et al 2013 redfern and bevan 2020 and the common tern and the sandwich tern thalasseus sandvicensis perform overland migrations across the teesmouth national nature reserve in northeastern england ward 2000 the south american tern is known to migrate across the atlantic coast from the south of argentina to brazil and malvinas falkland islands and along the pacific coast from ecuador to chile gochfeld et al 2020 this migratory strategy of the south american tern might allow the species to maintain similar environmental spaces throughout the year as supported in our analyses yet niche overlap tests suggest that south american tern might occupy different environmental spaces during breeding seasons particularly during the fall in the warm temperate southeastern pacific and warm temperate southwestern atlantic provinces this probably results from differences in the choice of microhabitats and reproductive areas that might lead to environmental space differentiation in seabird species burg and croxall 2001 as the geographic distance between the ranges of two populations increases shared biotic factors are expected to decrease and might play different roles in the distribution of the populations brown and carnaval 2019 furthermore the seasonal and spatial differences in microhabitat choices are suspected to play an important role in niche segregation while avoiding competition amongst tern species bugoni and vooren 2005 last environmental seasonal comparisons considering the entire species distribution range resulted in a low niche truncation risk indicating that the measured occupied niche reflects the species fundamental niche brown and carnaval 2019 conversely environmental comparisons between provinces resulted in a moderated to high niche truncation risk indicating that the environmental space of each province represents only a sub portion of the species fundamental niche this is also consistent with the spurious occurrence probability areas obtained in enm models by province provinces seem to be incomplete representations of the fundamental niche as their use as calibration areas result in overfitted models peterson et al 2011 5 conclusions our results refuted our hypothesis that coastal provinces might correspond to environmental variation delimiting distinct ecological niches for seabirds however the use of such partitioning allows the detection of regional environmental variation that would be otherwise unnoticed furthermore our regional per season partitioning confirms that in the enm procedure for migratory species either seabirds or other it is essential to account for the non equilibrium state of their distributions and seasonal partitioning of the data is valuable to understand the species dynamics although such approach has still been seldom used ingenloff 2017 therefore we recommend partitioning the occurrence datasets into seasons for enm of migratory species niche truncation analysis seems to be an interesting method to confirm the adequacy of such division nonetheless ecological niche comparisons remain challenging rendering ambiguous results for seabirds hindered by the narrow distribution ranges of these species brown and carnaval 2019 the potential ecological niche of the south american tern is driven principally by environmental variables indicative of marine ecosystem regulation marine productivity and prey availability as observed for other seabirds gall et al 2017 rivas 2010 scales et al 2016 thiel et al 2007 weichler et al 2004 the temporal variability we observe in the potential niche of the south american tern does not seem to be enough to cause environmental divergence and differentiation nonetheless we highlight that investigation on the role of fisheries bycatch as food resource and driver of niche divergence is still lacking for this and other seabirds particularly in the pacific coast importantly the influence of sea surface temperature and sea surface temperature increase ipcc 2019 is not homogeneous throughout the south american coasts per season how this variation will impact population persistence and connectivity between populations of the south american tern and other seabirds is unclear since genetic population structure and demographic trends on this and other species are poorly known faria et al 2010 gochfeld et al 2020 importantly the year round high occurrence probability area in coastal peru that we have identified in our models corresponding to the northernmost portion of the species distribution and potentially seasonally isolated points to a probable population structure which should be further investigated moreover given that more than 20 of the recently globally assessed seabird species are estimated to be negatively impacted by climate change alone dias et al 2019 we emphasize a thorough assessment of the demographic trends and population structure for the south american tern are urgently needed

24524,individual based forest models ibms are useful to investigate the effect of environment on forest structure and dynamics but they are often restricted to site specific applications to build confidence for spatially distributed simulations model transferability i e the ability of the same model to provide reliable predictions at contrasting sites has to be thoroughly tested we tested the transferability of a spatially explicit forest ibm troll with a trait based species parameterization and global gridded climate forcing by applying it to two sites with sharply contrasting climate and floristic compositions across the tropics one in south america and one in southeast asia we identified which parameters are most influential for model calibration and assessed the model sensitivity to climatic conditions for a given calibration troll produced realistic predictions of forest structure and dynamics at both sites and this necessitates the recalibration of only three parameters namely photosynthesis efficiency crown allometry and mortality rate all three relate to key processes that constrain model transferability and warrant further model development and data acquisition with mortality being a particular priority of improvement for the current generation of vegetation models varying the climatic conditions at both sites demonstrate similar and expected model responses gpp increased with temperature and irradiance while stem density and aboveground biomass declined as temperature increased the climate dependence of productivity and biomass was mediated by plant respiration carbon allocation and mortality which has implications both on model development and on forecasting of future carbon dynamics our detailed examination of forest ibm transferability unveils key processes that need to improve in genericity before reliable large scale implementations can be envisioned graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords troll forest simulations model calibration climate forcing taiwan amazonia 1 introduction forests harbor more than half of the total terrestrial biodiversity gardner et al 2010 and contribute to climate change mitigation ellison et al 2017 mitchard 2018 however forest disturbances are important drivers of canopy cover change and they will likely impact tropical forest structure diversity and functioning in the future feng et al 2018 malhi et al 2009 zemp et al 2017 these projections depend on a detailed understanding of the processes that link the abiotic environment to forest dynamics as can be achieved through integration into simulation models fisher et al 2018 shugart et al 2018 confronting the robustness reliability and realism of such models is crucial to gain confidence in their predictions prentice et al 2015 dynamic global vegetation models dgvms adopt a coarse representation of the coupling between vegetation and biogeochemical cycles their simplified description of vegetation dynamics assume a limited set of vegetation structure and summarize plant diversity with a few plant functional types pfts modern dgvms simulate demographic processes and trait variability fisher et al 2010 koven et al 2020 sakschewski et al 2015 sato et al 2007 scheiter et al 2013 however difficulties remain in representing plant recruitment and mortality translating into uncertainties in model projections of forest dynamics fisher et al 2018 unlike dgvms individual based forest models ibms explicitly simulate tree establishment growth competition and mortality simulating forest structure and dynamics at the stand scale bugmann 2001 deangelis and grimm 2014 fischer et al 2016 shugart 1984 botkin et al 1972 forest ibms adopt a fine grained representation of the diversity and structure of tree assemblages which facilitates the exploration of mixed species forest responses to climate variability maréchaux et al 2021 one drawback is that the calibration of forest ibms is data demanding and requires data at a fine spatial and temporal scale for this reason ibms have traditionally been restricted to stand scale application and even if their extension to regional or global scale is technically possible shugart et al 2018 shugart et al 2015 one fundamental challenge is to explore the model validity across space at the heart of model upscaling is the question of model transferability wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 when a model has been calibrated at one site how well does it simulate the vegetation dynamics at another site model transferability hinges upon how well the model is able to capture forest processes at any given site and on whether the same biogeochemical and biophysical relationships hold across sites fyllas et al 2017 sullivan et al 2020 for instance process based models couple forest processes such as photosynthesis water uptake and allocation to environmental drivers in a generic way through mechanistic modules these processes are parameterized locally through measurable traits with consistent biological and ecological meaning e g functional traits this means that in theory a completely process based model should be transferable to any site provided that measurements of the environmental drivers e g climatic variables and relevant traits of all locally present tree species are available however for some processes current knowledge is insufficient to develop generic functions and a simplified representation is necessary to encapsulate finer processes mediated by environmental biogeographic or evolutionary factors as a result part of the site specificity is hidden in the model equations and parameters themselves these site specific parameters need to be re calibrated from one site to the other to ensure reliable simulation outputs which increases calibration efforts and hampers transferability lehmann and huth 2015 maréchaux et al 2021 even generic equations have typically been formulated using input data from specific sites and under specific conditions which will not always be consistent with the data provided for model initialization at other sites huber et al 2018 this issue is especially important for tropical forests which have high variability in composition structure and functioning within and between sites making model transferability and upscaling a greater challenge castanho et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 townsend et al 2008 model transferability in part depends on the availability of standardized and spatially distributed data on forest structure and function for example site specific information can be prescribed for a model through trait based data on floristic diversity fyllas et al 2014 maréchaux and chave 2017 or remote sensing data fischer et al 2019 joetzjer et al 2017 shugart et al 2015 consistent climatic boundary conditions derived from weather models and data assimilation systems also increase model transferability bugmann and fischlin 1996 fauset et al 2019 this also facilitates the evaluation of how a model responds to changes in climate forcing conditions for example in light limited tropical rainforests we expect that gpp will exhibit weakly positive or even negative relationship with increasing temperature due to increasing competition mortality and faster turnover allen et al 2010 clark et al 2010 mcdowell et al 2018 another way to improve model transferability is to convert modules that are implicitly site specific into more generic formulations that encode site specific conditions only through dependence on environmental and floristic composition this can be facilitated by performing tests to identify model processes that are currently particularly site specific the improvement of the representation of those processes through theoretical and empirical work across multiple sites should then be prioritized for instance we expect that outputs of forest ibms will be highly sensitive to parameters of mortality and a more accurate mechanistic representation of mortality should improve the reliability of model projections under conditions beyond the range of the original calibration data johnson et al 2016 bugmann et al 2019 although several studies have explored the issue of transferability of forest ibms bugmann and solomon 1995 lagarrigues et al 2015 ma et al 2017 shuman et al 2015 they have so far been limited to temperate and boreal forests with low tree species diversity in this study we explored the conditions of transferability of a forest ibm between two contrasting tropical forest sites chosen to maximize dissimilarity in geography floristic composition and environmental conditions evaluating separately the effect of parameter calibration and of climate forcing we asked the following questions 1 how well does a locally calibrated forest ibm perform when transferred at another site we expect a degradation of model performance with no fine tuning at the contrasting site 2 what key parameters determine model performance during model transfer we expect that since most fundamental processes are captured by generic formulations in the model only few parameters will be identified as in need of recalibration these parameters point to limitations in model representation of the underlying processes 3 what are the expected responses of the model to variations in climatic conditions at a given site in the absence of water limitation as in light limited rainforests gpp should increase with temperature and irradiance while biomass should depend less on temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the troll model is a spatially explicit individual based model in which the aboveground space of a forest stand is divided into 3d cells of size 1 m3 hereafter called voxels chave 1999 maréchaux and chave 2017 solar irradiance photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd is computed inside each voxel as the irradiance fraction transmitted from the the voxel immediately above it we considered only vertical light transmittance in the canopy for trees at the edge of the simulated plot we simulate light interception only for the part of the crown that is inside the plot and then scale total assimilation with crown radius at most one tree can establish in each 1 1 m pixel at any given time and only self standing stems 1 cm in trunk diameter at breast height dbh are explicitly modeled herbaceous plants and lianas are not included the effects of topography and water balance are not modeled seeds and seedlings 1 cm dbh are indirectly modeled as part of a regeneration compartment with inputs from an external seed rain and seed production within the simulated stand each modeled tree is a 3d object characterized by dbh height crown radius crown depth total leaf surface area and age trees are assigned species specific trait values which influence processes such as photosynthesis growth and mortality at each monthly timestep the model simulates carbon assimilation photosynthesis respiration carbon allocation and growth for each tree and also simulates seed dispersal or tree death when conditions are met tree growth is the result of an explicit balance between carbon assimilation photosynthesis and respiration carbon assimilation is represented with the c3 photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 which depends on temperature irradiance vapor pressure deficit vpd and atmospheric co2 concentration during a monthly timestep photosynthesis is calculated over half hourly periods of a representative day monthly mean values of temperature irradiance and vpd atmospheric co2 concentration is assumed constant stomatal conductance is modeled following medlyn et al 2011 we define the parameter φ quantum carbon yield per quantum photon as the initial slope of the photosynthetic carbon assimilation against irradiance curve this parameter controls carbon uptake in light limited conditions farquhar et al 1980 the value of φ depends on environment and species and it has been shown to be an important source of uncertainty in vegetation models domingues et al 2014 mercado et al 2009 after the gross assimilated carbon is calculated from the photosynthesis model net assimilated carbon is calculated as the gross assimilated carbon minus respiration net assimilated carbon is then allocated into biomass in different organs based on parameters of fixed fractions resulting in tree growth and leaf flush dynamics in the same timestep the resulting changes in tree height crown shape and position and leaf density will then influence the calculation of the light environment and photosynthesis of each tree in the next timestep the allometric relationship relating tree height and dbh is assumed to be species specific while allometric functions relating dbh and crown size are assumed the same for all trees crown radius grows as a function of dbh following a non linear relationship c r e c r a c r b ln d b h where cra and crb are general parameters provided in input hence higher cra indicates larger crowns for trees of all sizes whereas higher crb indicates that larger trees have disproportionately larger crowns than smaller trees identical values of cra and crb are prescribed for all species given the paucity of available data even if it is acknowledged that crown size allometry can vary within species across species and across sites jucker et al 2017 loubota panzou et al 2021 in troll tree mortality results from several processes i stochastic mortality modeled as a function of a maximal background mortality rate m and a linearly decreasing relationship with species specific wood density wd so that m e f f m α w d α being positive m is the maximal possible value of the mortality rate ii carbon starvation if net assimilated carbon is negative over a consecutive period exceeding leaf lifespan so that old leaves have all died while no new leaves could be produced assuming no internal carbon storage and iii stochastic treefall events assumed to depend on a tree height threshold where the parameter vc represents the variability of this threshold both m and vc hence summarize complex processes that are not modeled mechanistically a schematic diagram which illustrates the structures and processes controlling the individual and community level dynamics of a forest in the troll model can be found in maréchaux and chave 2017 appendix s5 figure s1 necessary inputs for a run of troll include i climate forcing data for the simulated location ii species specific parameters of plant traits for the simulated forest and iii species independent parameters the source code of troll v2 5 is written in c and is available at https github com troll code troll on a computing cluster each simulation of 200 200 m and 500 years uses around 15 min of cpu time 2 2 global climate forcing the troll model requires the following climate forcing variables monthly mean values of daytime and nighttime mean temperature cumulated rainfall mean wind speed daytime mean irradiance and daytime mean vapor pressure deficit vpd as well as average normalized daily variations of temperature irradiance and vpd we used the cru ncep reanalysis as a standardized climate forcing version 8 version 7 archived at https rda ucar edu datasets ds314 3 viovy 2018 the cru ncep data set is a global gridded 0 5 0 5 sub daily 6 hourly climate product spanning the 1901 2016 period it provides eight climatic variables temperature precipitation wind speed in two orthogonal components downward longwave and shortwave radiations air specific humidity and atmospheric pressure resulting from the combination of observation based cru ts 3 2 data harris et al 2014 and model based ncep ncar data kalnay et al 1996 we constructed reference monthly mean conditions based on the time range 1980 2016 a period for which the most observations are available in order to ensure higher accuracy kistler et al 2001 and calculated and extracted climatic variables necessary for troll input appendix a 2 3 study site and species parameterization we parameterized the troll model for nouragues french guiana in south america and fushan taiwan in southeast asia aside from the difference in climatic patterns there is no floristic overlap between nouragues and fushan and tree trait distribution at the two sites differ widely for example there is no overlap in the interquartile range of leaf mass per area lma g m 2 values 41 62 73 86 at fushan and 82 71 111 45 at nouragues and of wood density g cm 3 values 0 464 0 524 at fushan and 0 600 0 727 at nouragues the nouragues ecological research station includes a 12 hectare 400 m 300 m plot in a moist lowland tropical forest part of the amazonian biome the nouragues site experiences two dry seasons per year with mean annual precipitation around 3000 mm mean annual temperature around 26 c and a mean relative humidity around 99 bongers et al 2001 since plot establishment in 1994 censuses were completed regularly 2001 2007 2012 2017 all self standing stems dbh 10 cm were identified measured tagged and mapped the plot has 622 tree species chave et al 2008 maréchaux and chave 2017 the fushan forest dynamics plot fdp is a 25 hectare 500 m 500 m plot in a moist broadleaf subtropical forest in the northeast of taiwan su et al 2007 and is a part of forestgeo forest global earth observatory anderson teixeira et al 2015 condit 1998 the fushan site is under the influence of northeasterly monsoon in winter and frequent typhoon visits in summer and autumn with mean annual precipitation around 4200 mm mean annual temperature around 18 c and a mean relative humidity around 95 plot elevation ranges from 600 m to 733 m su et al 2007 since plot establishment in 2004 censuses were completed every five years where all self standing stems with a dbh 1 cm were identified measured tagged and mapped with a total of 110 recorded tree species in the plot su et al 2007 species specific parameters of troll include leaf mass per area lma g m 2 nitrogen and phosphorus content per mass nmass pmass g g 1 wood density g cm 3 maximum dbh cm dbh height allometric parameters and regional relative abundance we implemented all 622 species in the model for the nouragues site a complete set of measured trait values were available for 163 species and for the other species a combination of species specific values and genus means or abundance weighted community means were assigned maréchaux and chave 2017 for the fushan site we implemented 94 species for which a complete set of measured trait values were available this represents ca 90 of the trees the methodology of data collection is detailed in appendix b climatic data were extracted from the cru ncep dataset at both sites we also used local climate data to force the model simulations at nouragues semi hourly meteorological data are available from 2013 to 2019 recorded 400 m away from the plot 4 05 n 52 41 w at fushan daily meteorological data are available from 1991 to 2012 with hourly data from 2013 to 2016 recorded at a meteorological station 3 km east of the forest plot 24 45 n 121 35 e a comparison of the local versus gridded climatic conditions is provided in appendix c for all simulations we simulated forest regeneration from bare soil for a reference plot area of 4 hectares 200 m 200 m for a duration of 500 years 6000 monthly timesteps based on trial simulation after 500 years the forest has reached a steady state 2 4 global parameter calibration in addition to species specific parameters troll includes a set of 41 species independent parameters or global parameters the majority of these parameters can be measured empirically including those of initialization plot size initial size and leaf densities of trees etc and trait variability intraspecific variation and covariance other parameters could vary across sites and they are the primary target of this study we first performed a preliminary sensitivity analysis on five parameters tested in a previous study maréchaux and chave 2017 which revealed that the model had a low sensitivity to the light extinction coefficient k and to carbon allocation fractions fwood and fcanopy we also found that stem density was not adequately estimated at fushan appendix d we hypothesized that asymmetric light competition and tree mortality may be factors shaping stem density thus we focused on the calibration of five parameters φ vc cra crb m table 1 for which it is difficult to obtain precise field estimates we examined model responses by varying these parameters across a range of values while using fixed values taken from literature for all other parameters including k fwood and fcanopy for φ vc and m we generated uniform prior distributions bounded within the reported value range cra and crb the slope and intercept of the log transformed crown radius to dbh relationship are strongly correlated so we generated correlated standard normal distributions using the cholesky decomposition assuming a pearson s r of 0 8 then transformed them to beta prior distributions of beta 2 2 bounded within the empirically observed value ranges we performed 500 calibration runs for both study sites for each simulation three parameters φ vc and m were randomly drawn from the uniform prior distribution and the two crown allometry parameters cra and crb were drawn as a pair from the correlated beta prior distributions goodness of fit was assessed using four summary metrics stem density dbh 10 cm n10 trees ha 1 large stem density dbh 30 cm n30 trees ha 1 aboveground biomass agb mg ha 1 and gross primary productivity gpp mgc ha 1 yr 1 these metrics summarize both forest structure and functioning and overall constrain the model well empirical values for these metrics were obtained from census data for n10 n30 and agb and from a global gridded database for gpp madani and parazoo 2020 for each summary metric and each simulation we calculated the steady state value defined as the mean over the last 100 years of simulation and qualitatively described trends of model outcome and model sensitivity to each parameter using scatter plots of parameters against output metrics appendix e model goodness of fit was derived from individual summary statistics using an euclidean distance between the simulated metrics and empirical values centered and scaled and we reported median and interquartile range of parameter values of the simulations with the 10 best overall fit i e 50 best simulations out of 500 we quantified parameter informativeness i e the degree to which the dispersion of the posterior parameter distribution is reduced compared to the prior distribution using the ratio between the interquartile range iqr of the best fit simulations to that of all simulations a smaller ratio indicates higher parameter informativeness finally we reported the temporal trends of the four summary metrics and discussed their fit with field observation values 2 5 forest response to climatic conditions a virtual experiment to study the dependence of forest structure and dynamics on temperature irradiance and vpd we performed the following simulated experiment in the cru ncep dataset we selected a subset of points corresponding to lowland light limited rain forest within the 35 n 35 s latitude range based on elevation 1000 m climate annual precipitation 2000 mm yr 1 guan et al 2015 wagner et al 2016 and land cover esa forest cci land cover classes 50 60 70 80 and 90 at both study sites we then performed 500 simulations each time using the three climatic variables at a randomly sampled point within the selected subset and using optimal parameter values the general parameter values of the one simulation that provided the best overall fit during calibration with the initial climatic condition table 2 the aim of this experiment is to explore the response of a forest stand as its climate forcing changes with a range and correlation structure between the climatic variables that are realistic for tropical forests and to examine if this climate effect is consistent between sites to select the reference pixels we used precipitation data from cru ncep the c3s global land cover product for 2018 accessible at https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php esa 2017 and elevation data from the srtm product accessible at http www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 we used the gdal translate utility to rescale the land cover data 300 m 300 m and elevation data 1 km 1 km to match the spatial scale of cru ncep 0 5 0 5 this resulted in a set of 3753 reference climate pixels of which we randomly sampled 500 using the corresponding climatic variables to force simulations for both fushan and nouragues to evaluate model sensitivity we used the same four summary metrics n10 n30 agb gpp for each metric we calculated the steady state value of each simulation mean value of the last 100 simulated years and described the trends of model outcome and model sensitivity to each variable using scatter plots of climatic variables against output metrics in order to quantify the degree of influence of each climatic variable we fitted linear models with climatic variables as independent terms and the summary metrics as dependent terms and reported semi partial coefficients as effect size assumptions for linear models were tested and confirmed two sample points with temperature lower than 15 c were identified as high leverage points but their inclusion did not significantly deviate the statistical estimates appendix f 2 6 data analysis data processing statistical analysis and visualization were performed in r 3 3 0 r core team 2019 apart from those already mentioned elsewhere r packages ggplot2 ggpubr ncdf4 raster data table geosphere sp tidyr extremes and biomass were used for this study dowle and srinivasan 2020 gilleland and

lesser extent to crb higher quantum yield φ led to higher large stem density and agb and a sharp increase in productivity higher overall crown size larger cra values led to lower stem density and agb and a slight increase in productivity its relationship with large stem density and agb was non linear at fushan higher mortality rates m led to reduced large stem density and agb figs e1 e2 the parameter values corresponding to the simulation maximizing the goodness of fit were similar between the two sites for φ and crb but differed markedly for vc cra and m table 2 we used the iqr ratio as measure of parameter informativeness lower iqr ratio signifies higher informativeness the most informative parameter was found to be cra informative at both sites 0 55 at fushan and 0 38 at nouragues φ was informative at nouragues 0 38 but less so at fushan 0 78 and m was informative at fushan 0 33 but less so at nouragues 0 75 crb and vc were only moderately informative values 0 6 at both sites fig 1 temporal change of all four summary statistics n10 n30 agb and gpp were qualitatively similar at both sites showing sigmoidal increase for stem densities n10 and n30 we observed a gradual increase of agb and rapid increase and stabilization of gpp at both sites and an initial overshoot of n10 at nouragues but not at fushan table 3 fig 2 at nouragues all steady state estimated metric values showed a good fit to field values at fushan n10 was underestimated ca 14 gpp was overestimated ca 9 and n30 and agb showed reasonably good fit to field values both climate forcings yielded similar model outputs matching well field observations n10 values were similar n30 and agb values were slightly lower when using ground based climate forcing at fushan and gpp values were markedly lower when using ground based climate forcing at both sites fig 2 median climate values across sampled pixels were temperature 26 25 c irradiance 207 6 w m 2 vpd 0 644 kpa temperature irradiance and vpd all had significant effects on simulated forest structure and functioning although effect sizes varied temperature effect on n10 was strongly negative at fushan but non significant at nouragues it had strong negative effects on n30 and agb but a weak positive effect on gpp at both sites irradiance had a positive effect on all four metrics at both sites and are especially strong for gpp vpd had weakly negative effects on gpp at both sites its effects on the other three metrics were weakly positive at fushan and non significant at nouragues overall effect sizes were weaker at nouragues than at fushan except for irradiance effects on n30 and agb fig 3 table 4 4 discussion in this study we tested the transferability of a forest ibm and demonstrated that the model predicts forest structure and functioning with reasonable accuracy at two species rich forest sites in different bioregions parameters controlling photosynthetic efficiency crown allometry and background mortality were found to be key for model calibration we showed that calibration could help identify influential processes in trait based forest ibms and suggests that there is potential of ibm upscaling with improved representation of influential processes and parameter estimation 4 1 transferability of an individual based model the troll model was designed to incorporate a detailed representation of forest diversity while remaining relatively easy to parameterize at a forest site by prescribing each species using a set of commonly measured traits maréchaux and chave 2017 this approach alleviates the calibration burden of model transfer deangelis and grimm 2014 and facilitates the implementation of large scale testing of individual based models however not all parameters used in the model are directly observable or easily measurable in the field some are integrators of multiple processes not explicitly represented within the model so the issue of model transferability still stands and we here ask whether a calibrated parameter set for one site performs well elsewhere we estimated model parameters through model inversion comparing model outputs against field observations hartig et al 2012 this approach has been used for several dgvm parameterizations usually by calibrating against eddy covariance data ichii et al 2010 pappas et al 2013 restrepo coupe et al 2017 here goodness of fit depends on four summary statistics of forest structure stem density and functioning biomass and productivity that are usually available in field inventory data or global gridded data in the future the approach could be improved by using the whole height or diameter distribution of the simulated forest or by adopting a likelihood based approach hartig et al 2014 hartig et al 2012 we calibrated the model at two contrasted tropical forest sites in spite of their marked differences in climatic conditions species composition and functional diversity the simulated forests matched field observations after the calibration of a limited subset of parameters this supports the view that forest models with trait based parameterization are capable of capturing site specific characteristics that underpin community dynamics and structure at a given forest site we speculate that the use of trait based species parameterization contributes to the reduced need for refitting i e higher model genericity christoffersen et al 2016 fisher et al 2018 fyllas et al 2014 pappas et al 2016 parameters that do differ across sites point to potential improvements in the model a discussion we now turn to 4 2 parameter calibration we performed calibrations for three parameters that influence predicted forest structure and functioning photosynthetic efficiency φ crown allometry cra and tree mortality m as φ represents the actual quantum yield of photosynthesis the amount of fixed carbon per light flux absorbed by the chloroplasts higher φ value results in higher carbon assimilation when light is limiting and higher gpp this parameter only leads to a moderate increase in large stem density n30 and agb and an even smaller effect on overall stem density n10 indicating that forest demography and biomass accumulation are not solely conditioned by productivity but also hinge on respiration carbon allocation and carbon residence time álvarez dávila et al 2017 johnson et al 2016 malhi et al 2015 model calibration was not sensitive to troll s species independent carbon allocation parameters appendix d but it should be pointed out that carbon allocation does vary across and even within species malhi et al 2015 negrón juárez et al 2015 therefore including a more mechanistic or trait mediated representation of carbon allocation may unveil more heterogeneity in forest dynamics and is an important objective in future model development merganičová et al 2019 negrón juárez et al 2015 schippers et al 2015 trugman et al 2019 in troll crown allometry directly controls light use efficiency and tree competition higher cra values mean that trees have wider crowns at a given diameter and achieve higher carbon assimilation rates due to increased light interception leading to the observed pattern of increase in gpp with increased cra wider crowns also create more intense shading for smaller trees in the understory and cause higher tree turnover and mortality leading to the observed pattern of decreasing stem density and agb stand structure also strongly depends on the level of prescribed inter and intraspecific variability of crown allometry which determine how complementarity in crown architecture could increase light use efficiency and promote coexistence pretzsch 2019 vieilledent et al 2010 mortality is an important parameter for calibration in troll tree mortality is a complex process and in current ibms it is often modeled empirically and thus remains one of the main sources of model uncertainty bugmann et al 2019 in the formind model the mortality rate is empirically correlated with environmental variables such as precipitation and soil property which vary across space rödig et al 2018 2017 such simplifications limit our ability to explore how different causes of tree mortality impact forest structure mcdowell et al 2018 natural disturbance events such as fire drought or wind are responsible for a significant proportion of tree mortality fischer et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2018 peterson et al 2019 and they impact forest structure and functioning ibanez et al 2019 magnabosco marra et al 2018 pugh et al 2019 the two forest sites selected for this study depend on different wind disturbance regimes notably fushan is influenced by frequent tropical cyclones dowdy et al 2012 lin et al 2011 while nouragues is not exposed to cyclones at nouragues troll simulates an overshoot of stem density during early succession indicating self thinning but not at fushan one hypothesis for this pattern is that cyclones select for a more open canopy at fushan resulting in a less intense self thinning this may also explain why the optimal value for the background mortality rate m is lower at fushan than at nouragues it would be important to devise more mechanistic representations of disturbance events in troll 4 3 upscaling of individual based models various efforts have been made to upscale ibms to the regional or global scale individual based approaches have been coupled to or developed within dgvms fisher et al 2018 sakschewski et al 2015 sato et al 2007 to represent cohort processes ma et al 2017 prescribed environmental data for simulations of the forcchin ibm model at several flux tower sites and validated the simulated carbon flux against flux tower data rödig et al 2018 2017a performed regionalization for the formind model by calibrating the mortality parameter at a number of sites and correlating it with environmental variables precipitation and soil properties and performing simulations at sites over the entire amazon using mortality parameters predicted from the environmental variables simulated temporal dynamics of canopy height were then compared with remote sensing data to determine the succession status of each site which was then used to generate amazon wide estimation of other forest attributes such as biomass and productivity yet these studies assigned trees to a small number of plant functional types that relied on empirical parameterization our study although smaller in scope is a proof of concept demonstrating that trait based ibm upscaling is achievable with minimal calibration and is therefore realistic in the tropics provided that trait measurements exist and tree floristic composition is available at the focal site moreover since model output contains detailed information about forest composition troll could also help answer how plant diversity responds to environmental changes with every forest model assumptions are made about which parameters are species dependent and which are not the model described here troll is designed with the aim to contain as much species specific information that is currently available for an individual based model this choice does not necessarily incur higher computational burden than the plant functional type approach since in both cases every individual tree is simulated however supplying models with species specific information requires considerably more parameterization effort with the ongoing collection effort of plant traits in permanent plots around the world the assembly of global trait databases anderson teixeira et al 2015 chave et al 2009 kattge et al 2020 and development of techniques to measure new plant traits we expect that it will be easier to generalize this approach to many sites here we show that of the species independent parameters only a few require site specific calibration for realistic model output to be achieved and identifying these parameters helps identifying priorities for future theoretical and modeling development as well as for field measurements medlyn et al 2016 4 4 climate impact on forests using ibms another important part of assessing transferability of forest ibms consists in evaluating how the model responds to environmental forcing an important step in understanding how forests respond to climate change shugart et al 2018 we here examined the effect of climate forcing without the need of re calibration fauset et al 2019 shugart et al 2018 many forest ibms prescribe climatic conditions based on locally measured data ma et al 2017 shuman et al 2015 yet it is important to provide a consistent climate forcing condition even at places where local measurements do not exist and to ensure comparability among sites the integration of the gridded cru ncep climate dataset as model input fulfills this condition and thus further simplifies large scale implementation troll simulations at the fushan and nouragues sites with different climatic conditions demonstrate that the model reproduces a general pattern of climatic response that remain nearly identical upon model transfer with only quantitative differences between sites the simulated positive relationship of gpp with temperature and irradiance and the negative relationship with vpd are in agreement with expectations malhi et al 2015 reyer 2015 under the current model version vpd constrains leaf stomatal conductance in the photosynthesis process and we found a weak effect of vpd as water availability is one of the key climatic factors that shape forest dynamics and functioning álvarez dávila et al 2017 feng et al 2018 galbraith et al 2010 poorter et al 2017 further investigation of forest response to drought and soil water stress is necessary and will be the focus of future model development at both sites we observed a decoupling between the response of productivity and that of stem density and agb with increasing temperature gpp increased while large tree density and agb decreased these observations are consistent with empirical studies that showed that productivity is a poor predictor of biomass in old growth tropical forests johnson et al 2016 malhi et al 2015 biomass accumulation is controlled by numerous processes other than carbon assimilation including mortality functional composition and size structure allen et al 2010 bugmann et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 the fushan site responded more strongly to variation in climatic conditions than nouragues one interpretation of this finding is that the native bioclimatic conditions of nouragues may be closer to the average condition of reference climatic conditions whereas fushan has a fringe climatic condition subtropical consequently constraining the fushan forest to average tropical forest climatic conditions had more effect than on the nouragues forest 4 5 conclusion and perspectives we have demonstrated that a detailed exploration of the calibration and transferability of trait based forest ibms offers an opportunity to assess the genericity of model assumptions even though our results are based on model simulations they do pave the way towards a much more systematic exploration of model behavior across a wide range of sites that are representative of a variety of forest types we here identify two main priorities for future individual based model development 1 including more detailed and mechanistic representation of important physiological processes such as disturbance driven tree mortality seidl et al 2014 2011 uriarte et al 2009 and 2 improving constraints of key parameters with detailed and spatially distributed data such as informing crown allometry with remote sensing data calders et al 2018 fischer et al 2020 shugart et al 2015 with the help of improvements in these two directions we argue that upscaling of individual based vegetation models with detailed trait based species description need not be associated with high calibration burden and that they have great

randomly chosen individuals outside the plot measuring fresh volume by water displacement method and dry weight after oven drying at 80 c wood density was calculated as dry weight divided by fresh

for 1 to 18 individuals for each species depending on the accessibility of tree individuals due to the scarcity of available height data a hierarchical bayesian model was used to estimate model

24524,individual based forest models ibms are useful to investigate the effect of environment on forest structure and dynamics but they are often restricted to site specific applications to build confidence for spatially distributed simulations model transferability i e the ability of the same model to provide reliable predictions at contrasting sites has to be thoroughly tested we tested the transferability of a spatially explicit forest ibm troll with a trait based species parameterization and global gridded climate forcing by applying it to two sites with sharply contrasting climate and floristic compositions across the tropics one in south america and one in southeast asia we identified which parameters are most influential for model calibration and assessed the model sensitivity to climatic conditions for a given calibration troll produced realistic predictions of forest structure and dynamics at both sites and this necessitates the recalibration of only three parameters namely photosynthesis efficiency crown allometry and mortality rate all three relate to key processes that constrain model transferability and warrant further model development and data acquisition with mortality being a particular priority of improvement for the current generation of vegetation models varying the climatic conditions at both sites demonstrate similar and expected model responses gpp increased with temperature and irradiance while stem density and aboveground biomass declined as temperature increased the climate dependence of productivity and biomass was mediated by plant respiration carbon allocation and mortality which has implications both on model development and on forecasting of future carbon dynamics our detailed examination of forest ibm transferability unveils key processes that need to improve in genericity before reliable large scale implementations can be envisioned graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords troll forest simulations model calibration climate forcing taiwan amazonia 1 introduction forests harbor more than half of the total terrestrial biodiversity gardner et al 2010 and contribute to climate change mitigation ellison et al 2017 mitchard 2018 however forest disturbances are important drivers of canopy cover change and they will likely impact tropical forest structure diversity and functioning in the future feng et al 2018 malhi et al 2009 zemp et al 2017 these projections depend on a detailed understanding of the processes that link the abiotic environment to forest dynamics as can be achieved through integration into simulation models fisher et al 2018 shugart et al 2018 confronting the robustness reliability and realism of such models is crucial to gain confidence in their predictions prentice et al 2015 dynamic global vegetation models dgvms adopt a coarse representation of the coupling between vegetation and biogeochemical cycles their simplified description of vegetation dynamics assume a limited set of vegetation structure and summarize plant diversity with a few plant functional types pfts modern dgvms simulate demographic processes and trait variability fisher et al 2010 koven et al 2020 sakschewski et al 2015 sato et al 2007 scheiter et al 2013 however difficulties remain in representing plant recruitment and mortality translating into uncertainties in model projections of forest dynamics fisher et al 2018 unlike dgvms individual based forest models ibms explicitly simulate tree establishment growth competition and mortality simulating forest structure and dynamics at the stand scale bugmann 2001 deangelis and grimm 2014 fischer et al 2016 shugart 1984 botkin et al 1972 forest ibms adopt a fine grained representation of the diversity and structure of tree assemblages which facilitates the exploration of mixed species forest responses to climate variability maréchaux et al 2021 one drawback is that the calibration of forest ibms is data demanding and requires data at a fine spatial and temporal scale for this reason ibms have traditionally been restricted to stand scale application and even if their extension to regional or global scale is technically possible shugart et al 2018 shugart et al 2015 one fundamental challenge is to explore the model validity across space at the heart of model upscaling is the question of model transferability wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 when a model has been calibrated at one site how well does it simulate the vegetation dynamics at another site model transferability hinges upon how well the model is able to capture forest processes at any given site and on whether the same biogeochemical and biophysical relationships hold across sites fyllas et al 2017 sullivan et al 2020 for instance process based models couple forest processes such as photosynthesis water uptake and allocation to environmental drivers in a generic way through mechanistic modules these processes are parameterized locally through measurable traits with consistent biological and ecological meaning e g functional traits this means that in theory a completely process based model should be transferable to any site provided that measurements of the environmental drivers e g climatic variables and relevant traits of all locally present tree species are available however for some processes current knowledge is insufficient to develop generic functions and a simplified representation is necessary to encapsulate finer processes mediated by environmental biogeographic or evolutionary factors as a result part of the site specificity is hidden in the model equations and parameters themselves these site specific parameters need to be re calibrated from one site to the other to ensure reliable simulation outputs which increases calibration efforts and hampers transferability lehmann and huth 2015 maréchaux et al 2021 even generic equations have typically been formulated using input data from specific sites and under specific conditions which will not always be consistent with the data provided for model initialization at other sites huber et al 2018 this issue is especially important for tropical forests which have high variability in composition structure and functioning within and between sites making model transferability and upscaling a greater challenge castanho et al 2016 johnson et al 2016 townsend et al 2008 model transferability in part depends on the availability of standardized and spatially distributed data on forest structure and function for example site specific information can be prescribed for a model through trait based data on floristic diversity fyllas et al 2014 maréchaux and chave 2017 or remote sensing data fischer et al 2019 joetzjer et al 2017 shugart et al 2015 consistent climatic boundary conditions derived from weather models and data assimilation systems also increase model transferability bugmann and fischlin 1996 fauset et al 2019 this also facilitates the evaluation of how a model responds to changes in climate forcing conditions for example in light limited tropical rainforests we expect that gpp will exhibit weakly positive or even negative relationship with increasing temperature due to increasing competition mortality and faster turnover allen et al 2010 clark et al 2010 mcdowell et al 2018 another way to improve model transferability is to convert modules that are implicitly site specific into more generic formulations that encode site specific conditions only through dependence on environmental and floristic composition this can be facilitated by performing tests to identify model processes that are currently particularly site specific the improvement of the representation of those processes through theoretical and empirical work across multiple sites should then be prioritized for instance we expect that outputs of forest ibms will be highly sensitive to parameters of mortality and a more accurate mechanistic representation of mortality should improve the reliability of model projections under conditions beyond the range of the original calibration data johnson et al 2016 bugmann et al 2019 although several studies have explored the issue of transferability of forest ibms bugmann and solomon 1995 lagarrigues et al 2015 ma et al 2017 shuman et al 2015 they have so far been limited to temperate and boreal forests with low tree species diversity in this study we explored the conditions of transferability of a forest ibm between two contrasting tropical forest sites chosen to maximize dissimilarity in geography floristic composition and environmental conditions evaluating separately the effect of parameter calibration and of climate forcing we asked the following questions 1 how well does a locally calibrated forest ibm perform when transferred at another site we expect a degradation of model performance with no fine tuning at the contrasting site 2 what key parameters determine model performance during model transfer we expect that since most fundamental processes are captured by generic formulations in the model only few parameters will be identified as in need of recalibration these parameters point to limitations in model representation of the underlying processes 3 what are the expected responses of the model to variations in climatic conditions at a given site in the absence of water limitation as in light limited rainforests gpp should increase with temperature and irradiance while biomass should depend less on temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the troll model is a spatially explicit individual based model in which the aboveground space of a forest stand is divided into 3d cells of size 1 m3 hereafter called voxels chave 1999 maréchaux and chave 2017 solar irradiance photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd is computed inside each voxel as the irradiance fraction transmitted from the the voxel immediately above it we considered only vertical light transmittance in the canopy for trees at the edge of the simulated plot we simulate light interception only for the part of the crown that is inside the plot and then scale total assimilation with crown radius at most one tree can establish in each 1 1 m pixel at any given time and only self standing stems 1 cm in trunk diameter at breast height dbh are explicitly modeled herbaceous plants and lianas are not included the effects of topography and water balance are not modeled seeds and seedlings 1 cm dbh are indirectly modeled as part of a regeneration compartment with inputs from an external seed rain and seed production within the simulated stand each modeled tree is a 3d object characterized by dbh height crown radius crown depth total leaf surface area and age trees are assigned species specific trait values which influence processes such as photosynthesis growth and mortality at each monthly timestep the model simulates carbon assimilation photosynthesis respiration carbon allocation and growth for each tree and also simulates seed dispersal or tree death when conditions are met tree growth is the result of an explicit balance between carbon assimilation photosynthesis and respiration carbon assimilation is represented with the c3 photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 which depends on temperature irradiance vapor pressure deficit vpd and atmospheric co2 concentration during a monthly timestep photosynthesis is calculated over half hourly periods of a representative day monthly mean values of temperature irradiance and vpd atmospheric co2 concentration is assumed constant stomatal conductance is modeled following medlyn et al 2011 we define the parameter φ quantum carbon yield per quantum photon as the initial slope of the photosynthetic carbon assimilation against irradiance curve this parameter controls carbon uptake in light limited conditions farquhar et al 1980 the value of φ depends on environment and species and it has been shown to be an important source of uncertainty in vegetation models domingues et al 2014 mercado et al 2009 after the gross assimilated carbon is calculated from the photosynthesis model net assimilated carbon is calculated as the gross assimilated carbon minus respiration net assimilated carbon is then allocated into biomass in different organs based on parameters of fixed fractions resulting in tree growth and leaf flush dynamics in the same timestep the resulting changes in tree height crown shape and position and leaf density will then influence the calculation of the light environment and photosynthesis of each tree in the next timestep the allometric relationship relating tree height and dbh is assumed to be species specific while allometric functions relating dbh and crown size are assumed the same for all trees crown radius grows as a function of dbh following a non linear relationship c r e c r a c r b ln d b h where cra and crb are general parameters provided in input hence higher cra indicates larger crowns for trees of all sizes whereas higher crb indicates that larger trees have disproportionately larger crowns than smaller trees identical values of cra and crb are prescribed for all species given the paucity of available data even if it is acknowledged that crown size allometry can vary within species across species and across sites jucker et al 2017 loubota panzou et al 2021 in troll tree mortality results from several processes i stochastic mortality modeled as a function of a maximal background mortality rate m and a linearly decreasing relationship with species specific wood density wd so that m e f f m α w d α being positive m is the maximal possible value of the mortality rate ii carbon starvation if net assimilated carbon is negative over a consecutive period exceeding leaf lifespan so that old leaves have all died while no new leaves could be produced assuming no internal carbon storage and iii stochastic treefall events assumed to depend on a tree height threshold where the parameter vc represents the variability of this threshold both m and vc hence summarize complex processes that are not modeled mechanistically a schematic diagram which illustrates the structures and processes controlling the individual and community level dynamics of a forest in the troll model

simulation of 200 200 m and 500 years uses around 15 min of cpu time 2 2 global climate forcing the troll model requires the following climate forcing variables monthly mean values of daytime and nighttime mean temperature cumulated rainfall mean wind speed daytime mean irradiance and daytime mean vapor pressure deficit vpd as well as average normalized daily variations of temperature

in south america and fushan taiwan in southeast asia aside from the difference in climatic patterns there is no floristic overlap between nouragues and fushan and tree trait distribution at the two sites differ widely for example there is no overlap in the interquartile range of leaf mass per area lma g m 2 values 41 62 73 86 at fushan and 82 71 111 45 at nouragues and of wood density g cm 3

biome the nouragues site experiences two dry seasons per year with mean annual precipitation around 3000 mm mean annual temperature around 26 c and a mean relative humidity around 99 bongers et al 2001 since plot establishment in 1994 censuses were completed regularly 2001 2007 2012 2017 all self standing stems dbh 10 cm were identified measured tagged and mapped the plot has 622 tree species chave et al 2008 maréchaux and chave 2017 the fushan forest dynamics plot fdp is a 25 hectare 500 m 500 m plot in a moist broadleaf subtropical forest in the northeast of taiwan su et al 2007 and is a

summer and autumn with mean annual precipitation around 4200 mm mean annual temperature around 18 c and a mean relative humidity around 95 plot elevation ranges from 600 m to 733 m su et al 2007 since plot establishment in 2004 censuses were completed every five years where all self standing stems with a dbh 1 cm were identified measured tagged and mapped with a total of 110 recorded tree species in the plot su et al 2007 species specific parameters of troll include leaf mass per area lma g m 2 nitrogen and phosphorus content per mass nmass pmass g g 1 wood density g cm 3 maximum dbh cm dbh height allometric parameters and regional relative abundance we implemented all 622 species in the model for the nouragues site a complete set of measured trait values were available for 163 species and for the other species a combination of species specific values and genus means or abundance weighted community means were assigned maréchaux and chave 2017 for the fushan site we implemented 94 species for which a complete set of measured trait values were available this represents ca 90 of the trees the methodology of data collection is detailed in appendix b climatic data were extracted from the cru ncep dataset at both sites we also used local climate data to force the model simulations at nouragues semi hourly meteorological data are available from 2013 to 2019 recorded 400 m away from the plot 4 05 n 52 41 w at fushan daily meteorological data are available from 1991 to 2012 with hourly data from 2013 to 2016 recorded at a meteorological station 3 km east of the forest plot 24 45 n 121 35 e a comparison of the local versus gridded climatic conditions is provided in appendix c for all simulations we simulated forest regeneration from bare soil for a reference plot area of 4 hectares 200 m 200 m for a duration of 500 years 6000 monthly timesteps based on trial simulation after 500 years the forest has reached a steady state 2 4 global parameter calibration in addition to species specific parameters troll includes a set of 41 species independent parameters or global parameters the majority of these parameters can be measured empirically including those of initialization plot size initial size and leaf densities of trees etc and trait variability intraspecific variation and covariance other parameters could vary across sites and they are the primary target of this study we first performed a preliminary sensitivity analysis on five parameters tested in a previous study maréchaux and chave 2017 which revealed that the model had a low sensitivity to the light extinction coefficient k and to carbon allocation fractions fwood and fcanopy we also found that stem density was not adequately estimated at fushan appendix d we hypothesized that asymmetric light competition and tree mortality may be factors shaping stem density thus we focused on the calibration of five parameters φ vc cra crb m table 1 for which it is difficult to obtain precise field estimates we examined model responses by varying these parameters across a range of values while using fixed values taken from literature for all other parameters including k fwood and fcanopy for φ vc and m we generated uniform prior distributions bounded within the reported value range cra and crb the slope and intercept of the log transformed crown radius to dbh relationship are strongly correlated so we generated correlated standard normal distributions using the cholesky decomposition assuming a pearson s r of 0 8 then transformed them to beta prior distributions of beta 2 2 bounded within the empirically observed value ranges we performed 500 calibration runs for both study sites for each simulation three parameters φ vc and m were randomly drawn from the uniform prior distribution and the two crown allometry parameters cra and crb were drawn as a pair from the correlated beta prior distributions goodness of fit was assessed using four summary metrics stem density dbh 10 cm n10 trees ha 1 large stem density dbh 30 cm n30 trees ha 1 aboveground biomass agb mg ha 1 and gross primary productivity gpp mgc ha 1 yr 1 these metrics summarize both forest structure and functioning and overall constrain the model well empirical values for these metrics were obtained from census data for n10 n30 and agb and from a global gridded database for gpp madani and parazoo 2020 for each summary metric and each simulation we calculated the steady state value defined as the mean over the last 100 years of simulation and qualitatively described trends of model outcome and model sensitivity to each parameter using scatter plots of parameters against output metrics appendix e model goodness of fit was derived from individual summary statistics using an euclidean distance between the simulated metrics and empirical values centered and scaled and we reported median and interquartile range of parameter values of the simulations with the 10 best overall fit i e 50 best simulations out of 500 we quantified parameter informativeness i e the degree to which the dispersion of the posterior parameter distribution is reduced compared to the prior distribution using the ratio between the interquartile range iqr of the best fit simulations to that of all simulations a smaller ratio indicates higher parameter informativeness finally we reported the temporal trends of the four summary metrics and discussed their fit with field observation values 2 5 forest response to climatic conditions a virtual experiment to study the dependence of forest structure and dynamics on temperature irradiance and vpd we performed the following simulated experiment in the cru ncep dataset we selected a subset of points corresponding to lowland light limited rain forest within the 35 n 35 s latitude range based on elevation 1000 m climate annual precipitation 2000 mm yr 1 guan et al 2015 wagner et al 2016 and land cover esa forest cci land cover classes 50 60 70 80 and 90 at both study sites we then performed 500 simulations each time using the three climatic variables at a randomly sampled point within the selected subset and using optimal parameter values the general parameter values of the one simulation that provided the best overall fit during calibration with the initial climatic condition table 2 the aim of this experiment is to explore the response of a forest stand as its climate forcing changes with a range and correlation structure between the climatic variables that are realistic for tropical forests and to examine if this climate effect is consistent between sites to select the reference pixels we used precipitation data from cru ncep the c3s global land cover product for 2018 accessible at https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php esa 2017 and elevation data from the srtm product accessible at http www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 we used the gdal translate utility to rescale the land cover data 300 m 300 m and elevation data 1 km 1 km to match the spatial scale of cru ncep 0 5 0 5 this resulted in a set of 3753 reference climate pixels of which we randomly sampled 500 using the corresponding climatic variables to force simulations for both fushan and nouragues to evaluate model sensitivity we used the same four summary metrics n10 n30 agb gpp for each metric we calculated the steady state value of each simulation mean value of the last 100 simulated years and described the trends of model outcome and model sensitivity to each variable using scatter plots of climatic variables against output metrics in order to quantify the degree of influence of each climatic variable we fitted linear models with climatic variables as independent terms and the summary metrics as dependent terms and reported semi partial coefficients as effect size assumptions for linear models were tested and confirmed two sample points with temperature lower than 15 c were identified as high leverage points but their inclusion did not significantly deviate the statistical estimates appendix f 2 6 data analysis data processing statistical analysis and visualization were performed in r 3 3 0 r core team 2019

lesser extent to crb higher quantum yield φ led to higher large stem density and agb and a sharp increase in productivity higher overall crown size larger cra values led to lower stem density and agb and a slight increase in productivity its relationship with large stem density and agb was non linear at fushan higher mortality rates m led to reduced large stem density and agb figs e1 e2 the parameter values corresponding to the simulation maximizing the goodness of fit were similar between the two sites for φ and crb but differed markedly for vc cra and m table 2 we used the iqr ratio as measure of parameter informativeness lower iqr ratio signifies higher informativeness the most informative parameter was found to be cra informative at both sites 0 55 at fushan and 0 38 at nouragues φ was informative at nouragues 0 38 but less so at fushan 0 78 and m was informative at fushan 0 33 but less so at nouragues 0 75 crb and vc were only moderately informative values 0 6 at both sites fig 1 temporal change of all four summary statistics n10 n30 agb and gpp were qualitatively similar at both sites showing sigmoidal increase for stem densities n10 and n30 we observed a gradual increase of agb and rapid increase and stabilization of gpp at both sites and an initial overshoot of n10 at nouragues but not at fushan table 3 fig 2 at nouragues all steady state estimated metric values showed a good fit to field values at fushan n10 was underestimated ca 14 gpp was overestimated ca 9 and n30 and agb showed reasonably good fit to field values both climate forcings yielded similar model outputs matching well field observations n10 values were similar n30 and agb values were slightly lower when using ground based climate forcing at fushan and gpp values were markedly lower when using ground based climate forcing at both sites fig 2 median climate values across sampled pixels were temperature 26 25 c irradiance 207 6 w m 2 vpd 0 644 kpa temperature irradiance and vpd all had significant effects on simulated forest structure and functioning although effect sizes varied temperature effect on n10 was strongly negative at fushan but non significant at nouragues it had strong negative effects on n30 and agb but a weak positive effect on gpp at both sites irradiance had a positive effect on all four metrics at both sites and are especially strong for gpp vpd had weakly negative effects on gpp at both sites its effects on the other three metrics were weakly positive at fushan and non significant at nouragues overall effect sizes were weaker at nouragues than at fushan except for irradiance effects on n30 and agb fig 3 table 4 4 discussion in this study we tested the transferability of a forest ibm and demonstrated that the model predicts forest structure and functioning with reasonable accuracy at two species rich forest sites in different bioregions parameters controlling photosynthetic efficiency crown allometry and background mortality were found to be key for model calibration we showed that calibration could help identify influential processes in trait based forest ibms and suggests that there is potential of ibm upscaling with improved representation of influential processes and parameter estimation 4 1 transferability of an individual based model the troll model was designed to incorporate a detailed representation of forest diversity while remaining relatively easy to parameterize at a forest site by prescribing each species using a set of commonly measured traits maréchaux and chave 2017 this approach alleviates the calibration burden of model transfer deangelis and grimm 2014 and facilitates the implementation of large scale testing of individual based models however not all parameters used in the model are directly observable or easily measurable in the field some are integrators of multiple processes not explicitly represented within the model so the issue of model transferability still stands and we here ask whether a calibrated parameter set for one site performs well elsewhere we estimated model parameters through model inversion comparing model outputs against field observations hartig et al 2012 this approach has been used for several dgvm parameterizations usually by calibrating against eddy covariance data ichii et al 2010 pappas et al 2013 restrepo coupe et al 2017 here goodness of fit depends on four summary statistics of forest structure stem density and functioning biomass and productivity that are usually available in field inventory data or global gridded data in the future the approach could be improved by using the whole height or diameter distribution of the simulated forest or by adopting a likelihood based approach hartig et al 2014 hartig et al 2012 we calibrated the model at two contrasted tropical forest sites in spite of their marked differences in climatic conditions species composition and functional diversity the simulated forests matched field observations after the calibration of a limited subset of parameters this supports the view that forest models with trait based parameterization are capable of capturing site specific characteristics that underpin community dynamics and structure at a given forest site we speculate that the use of trait based species parameterization contributes to the reduced need for refitting i e higher model genericity christoffersen et al 2016 fisher et al 2018 fyllas et al 2014 pappas et al 2016 parameters that do differ across sites point to potential improvements in the model a discussion we now turn to 4 2 parameter calibration we performed calibrations for three parameters that influence predicted forest structure and functioning photosynthetic efficiency φ crown allometry cra and tree mortality m as φ represents the actual quantum yield of photosynthesis the amount of fixed carbon per light flux absorbed by the chloroplasts higher φ value results in higher carbon assimilation when light is limiting and higher gpp this parameter only leads to a moderate increase in large stem density n30 and agb and an even smaller effect on overall stem density n10 indicating that forest demography and biomass accumulation are not solely conditioned by productivity but also hinge on respiration carbon allocation and carbon residence time álvarez dávila et al 2017 johnson et al 2016 malhi et al 2015 model calibration was not sensitive to troll s species independent carbon allocation parameters appendix d but it should be pointed out that carbon allocation does vary across and even within species malhi et al 2015 negrón juárez et al 2015 therefore including a more mechanistic or trait mediated representation of carbon allocation may unveil more heterogeneity in forest dynamics and is an important objective in future model development merganičová et al 2019 negrón juárez et al 2015 schippers et al 2015 trugman et al 2019 in troll crown allometry directly controls light use efficiency and tree competition higher cra values mean that trees have wider crowns at a given diameter and achieve higher carbon assimilation rates due to increased light interception leading to the observed pattern of increase in gpp with increased cra wider crowns also create more intense shading for smaller trees in the understory and cause higher tree turnover and mortality leading to the observed pattern of decreasing stem density and agb stand structure also strongly depends on the level of prescribed inter and intraspecific variability of crown allometry which determine how complementarity in crown architecture could increase light use efficiency and promote coexistence pretzsch 2019 vieilledent et al 2010 mortality is an important parameter for calibration in troll tree mortality is a complex process and in current ibms it is often modeled empirically and thus remains one of the main sources of model uncertainty bugmann et al 2019 in the formind model the mortality rate is empirically correlated with environmental variables such as precipitation and soil property which vary across space rödig et al 2018 2017 such simplifications limit our ability to explore how different causes of tree mortality impact forest structure mcdowell et al 2018 natural disturbance events such as fire drought or wind are responsible for a significant proportion of tree mortality fischer et al 2018 mcdowell et al 2018 peterson et al 2019 and they impact forest structure and functioning ibanez et al 2019 magnabosco marra et al 2018 pugh et al 2019 the two forest sites selected for this study depend on different wind disturbance regimes notably fushan is influenced by frequent tropical cyclones dowdy et al 2012 lin et al 2011 while nouragues is not exposed to cyclones at nouragues troll simulates an overshoot of stem density during early succession indicating self thinning but not at fushan one hypothesis for this pattern is that cyclones select for a more open canopy at fushan resulting in a less intense self thinning this may also explain why the optimal value for the background mortality rate m is lower at fushan than at nouragues it would be important to devise more mechanistic representations of disturbance events in troll 4 3 upscaling of individual based models various efforts have been made to upscale ibms to the regional or global scale individual based approaches have been coupled to or developed within dgvms fisher et al 2018 sakschewski et al 2015 sato et al 2007 to represent cohort processes ma et al 2017 prescribed environmental data for simulations of the forcchin ibm model at several flux tower sites and validated the simulated carbon flux against flux tower data rödig et al 2018 2017a performed regionalization for the formind model by calibrating the mortality parameter at a number of sites and correlating it with environmental variables precipitation and soil properties and performing simulations at sites over the entire amazon using mortality parameters predicted from the environmental variables simulated temporal dynamics of canopy height were then compared with remote sensing data to determine the succession status of each site which was then used to generate amazon wide estimation of other forest attributes such as biomass and productivity yet these studies assigned trees to a small number of plant functional types that relied on empirical parameterization our study although smaller in scope is a proof of concept demonstrating that trait based ibm upscaling is achievable with minimal calibration and is therefore realistic in the tropics provided that trait measurements exist and tree floristic composition is available at the focal site moreover since model output contains detailed information about forest composition troll could also help answer how plant diversity responds to environmental changes with every forest model assumptions are made about which parameters are species dependent and which are not the model described here troll is designed with the aim to contain as much species specific information that is currently available for an individual based model this choice does not necessarily incur higher computational burden than the plant functional type approach since in both cases every individual tree is simulated however supplying models with species specific information requires considerably more parameterization effort with the ongoing collection effort of plant traits in permanent plots around the world the assembly of global trait databases anderson teixeira et al 2015 chave et al 2009 kattge et al 2020 and development of techniques to measure new plant traits we expect that it will be easier to generalize this approach to many sites here we show that of the species independent parameters only a few require site specific calibration for realistic model output to be achieved and identifying these parameters helps identifying priorities for future theoretical and modeling development as well as for field measurements medlyn et al 2016 4 4 climate impact on forests using ibms another important part of assessing transferability of forest ibms consists in evaluating how the model responds to environmental forcing an important step in understanding how forests respond to climate change shugart et al 2018 we here examined the effect of climate forcing without the need of re calibration fauset et al 2019 shugart et al 2018 many forest ibms prescribe climatic conditions based on locally measured data ma et al 2017 shuman et al 2015 yet it is important to provide a consistent climate forcing condition even at places where local measurements do not exist and to ensure comparability among sites the integration of the gridded cru ncep climate dataset as model input fulfills this condition and thus further simplifies large scale implementation troll simulations at the fushan and nouragues sites with different climatic conditions demonstrate that the model reproduces a general pattern of climatic response that remain nearly identical upon model transfer with only quantitative differences between sites the simulated positive relationship of gpp with temperature and irradiance and the negative relationship with vpd are in agreement with expectations malhi et al 2015 reyer 2015 under the current model version vpd constrains leaf stomatal conductance in the photosynthesis process and we found a weak effect of vpd as water availability is one of the key climatic factors that shape forest dynamics and functioning álvarez dávila et al 2017 feng et al 2018 galbraith et al 2010 poorter et al 2017 further investigation of forest response to drought and soil water stress is necessary and will be the focus of future model development at both sites we observed a decoupling between the response of productivity and that of stem density and agb with increasing temperature gpp increased while large tree density and agb decreased these observations are consistent with empirical studies that showed that productivity is a poor predictor of biomass in old growth tropical forests johnson et al 2016 malhi et al 2015 biomass accumulation is controlled by numerous processes other than carbon assimilation including mortality functional composition and size structure allen et al 2010 bugmann et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 the fushan site responded more strongly to variation in climatic conditions than nouragues one interpretation of this finding is that the native bioclimatic conditions of nouragues may be closer to the average condition of reference climatic conditions whereas fushan has a fringe climatic condition subtropical consequently constraining the fushan forest to average tropical forest climatic conditions had more effect than on the nouragues forest 4 5 conclusion and perspectives we have demonstrated that a detailed exploration of the calibration and transferability of trait based forest ibms offers an opportunity to assess the genericity of model assumptions even though our results are based on model simulations they do pave the way towards a much more systematic exploration of model behavior across a wide range of sites that are representative of a variety of forest types we here identify two main priorities for future individual based model development 1 including more detailed and mechanistic representation of important physiological processes such as disturbance driven tree mortality seidl et al 2014 2011 uriarte et al 2009 and 2 improving constraints of key parameters with detailed and spatially distributed data such as informing crown allometry with remote sensing data calders et al 2018 fischer et al 2020 shugart et al 2015 with the help of improvements in these two directions we argue that upscaling of individual based vegetation models with detailed trait based species description need not be associated with high calibration burden and that they have great

randomly chosen individuals outside the plot measuring fresh volume by water displacement method and dry weight after oven drying at 80 c wood density was calculated as dry weight divided by fresh

constant ah corresponding to the diameter at which the tree height is half of hmax b1 h h m a x d b h a h d b h although dbh values for all individuals were available tree heights were only measured for 1 to 18 individuals for each species depending on the accessibility of tree individuals due to the scarcity of available height data a hierarchical bayesian model was used to estimate model parameters the model assumed that the species specific michaelis menten parameters hmax i and ah i for species i are distributed normally around common hyperparameters hmax and ah molto et al 2014

variables temperature precipitation irradiance extracted from cru ncep data and ground station data showed that apart from minor differences the climatic variables were largely congruent between cru

the overall model output did not deviate clearly from the observed value range no matter what their calibrated values were figs d1 d2 as a result in all subsequent simulations we set a constant value
