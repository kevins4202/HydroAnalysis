19805,better understanding the responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals is a key for considering using riverbed sediment bacterial community as an indicator of river water contamination by heavy metals for this integrated evaluation based on bacterial density activity and community structure through incubation experiments under well controlled conditions is necessary to obtain more closely relevant findings that are difficult to achieve through field studies the findings may also include those that can serve as new evidence to clarify contrary findings reported in previous studies in this study sequencing batch incubation experiments were performed using sediment suspensions from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses the effects of four metals pb cr cd and cu were investigated by spiking them separately under three different concentration levels glucose was added once every day as the carbon source throughout the whole incubation lasted for 30 days the changing trends of the density of general and heterotrophic bacteria showed clearly that the responses of sediment bacteria to cu were obviously stronger followed by that to cd whereas the responses to pb and cr were not apparent for incubation with cu a short term inhibition effect appeared in the initial 3 days and was then followed by a long term promotion effect reflected by obvious increases of bacterial density against control in regard of bacterial activity evaluated based on the first order consumption rate for glucose a trend of decreases was revealed the results of pcr dgge and sequence analysis of extracted 16s rdna further suggested there were bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and could grow readily to become new dominating ones the existence of such bacterial species was inferred as the reason leading to the observed increases of bacterial density during incubation with the metal graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals toxicity river sediment sediment bacteria bacterial community 16s rdna 1 introduction the pollution of water and soil environments by heavy metals is consistently a major issue in many parts of the world due to their adversary effects on associated ecosystems and detrimental effects on the health of humans and animals for natural water environment many water quality indexes related to the species and concentrations of heavy metals are included in respectively national standards and regulations and are used for evaluation of water quality and the extent of water pollution by heavy metals originated from natural sources and human activities social agricultural and industrial activities in the freshwater environment mainly including rivers lakes and dam reservoirs a sediment phase always exist even if its thickness and composition may change with many factors such as the coverages and uses of the associated catchment hydraulic conditions and meteorological conditions li et al 2003 2005 2008a b haller et al 2011 compared to the flowing water phase the sediment phase is relatively stable and contains bacterial communities whose composition and structure may reflect the quality of the flowing water due to such a feature of the sediment the bacterial community populated in the sediment may serve as a new biomonitoring index to assist in existing chemical analysis for realizing more comprehensive water quality evaluation as pointed out also by other researchers pronk et al 2009 haller et al 2011 to consider using water sediment bacteria as a potential index for evaluation of water contamination by heavy metals comprehensive understanding of the responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals is necessary this requires an integrated evaluation based on the following three aspects bacterial density activity and community structure the reason is because sediment bacterial species may differ in their capability of tolerance against heavy metals zhang et al 2016 their growth rate under the condition with and or without the presence of heavy metals gillan et al 2005 and their uptake rate for substrate available in the water environment hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 due to such differences the conclusion may differ according to the aspect from which evaluation is conducted for instance in regard of the responses of soil and marine sediment bacterial community to heavy metals in density previous studies have reported that heavy metal contamination may lead to a reduction of total microbial biomass brookes and mcgrath 1984 fliessbach et al 1994 and a decrease in the numbers of specific bacterial populations such as infecting rhizobia chaudri et al 1993 or mycorrhizae koomen et al 1990 however there are also other studies that have shown that metal stress does not always reduce productivity shi et al 2002 wenderoth and reber 1999 or biomass baath et al 1998 feris et al 2003 knight et al 1997 shi et al 2002 chodak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 similarly regarding the impacts of heavy metals on the diversity of soil and water sediment bacterial community findings reported in previous studies are also different through analysis of bacterial communities in heavy metal contaminated soils at different levels of resolution sandaa et al 1999 reported that heavy metal contamination may lead to a reduction of bacterial diversity however other researchers observed either an increase in microbial diversity sorci et al 1999 or no significant variation gillan et al 2005 the contrary findings are considered to be explainable by factors other than metals such as environmental variables the time of exposure etc haller et al 2011 for field studies toxic organic compounds if coexisted with heavy metals are also a factor that makes the evaluation of the impacts of heavy metals more complicated shi et al 2002 the responses of bacterial communities in natural environments to heavy metals are considered to be mainly in association with the toxicity of heavy metals for bacterial species too sensitive to heavy metals their growth may be inhibited koomen et al 1990 chaudri et al 1993 lahra et al 2003 barkay 1987 rasmussen and sørensen 2001 smit et al 1997 for bacterial species with strong resistance against heavy metals and those with weak resistance but can recover after adapting to the toxicity they may maintain their growth as dominating ones or become new dominating ones rasmussen and sørensen 2001 gillan et al 2005 for observed increases or no variation in microbial diversity of marine sediments along with heavy metal contamination sorci et al 1999 gillan et al 2005 the reason was speculated due mainly to the appearance of new dominant species rather than a reversion to the original community gillan et al 2005 in addition to the differences of bacterial species in their tolerance capability against heavy metals the differences in their uptake rate for substrate are also a probable factor contributing in part if not all to the observed differences as hinted in previous studies hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 such a hypothesis probably applies since within bacterial community there might be some bacterial species that have strong tolerance against heavy metals and could grow readily only when the substrate available for their use is ensured if such bacterial species exist depending on their density and the substrate availability for them as against other coexisted bacterial species increases or no apparent variations in the overall density of the bacterial community are likely to find new evidences to prove this relatively long term incubation experiments under well controlled conditions are necessary since field studies are difficult to differentiate the impacts of heavy metals from those of many environmental variables and hazardous organic compounds if coexisted accordingly the major objective of the present study was to evaluate the responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals through integrated evaluation of bacterial density activity and community structure under well controlled incubation conditions for this sequencing batch incubation experiments were performed using sediment suspensions from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses to each sediment suspension four metals pb cr cd and cu were separately spiked for three different concentration levels and glucose was added once every day as the carbon source throughout the whole incubation lasted for 30 days bacterial density was evaluated in terms of general and heterotrophic bacteria quantified with the well used standard plate count method the responses in bacterial activity were evaluated based on changing trends of the first order consumption rate parameter for the daily added glucose in regard of the responses in bacterial community structure pcr dgge and sequence analysis were performed for the extracted 16s rdna from sediment suspensions before and after incubation the well designed incubation experiment conditions were expected to provide more closely relevant findings that would be useful for better understanding the responses of bacterial community to heavy metals including those that may serve as new evidence for clarification of contrary findings reported in previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 riverbed sediment sites riverbed sediments were sampled from the downstream sites of kurisu river ijira river and gyaku river as shown in fig s1 as supplemental online material these three rivers are the tributaries of nagara river one of the major well known and relatively well conserved rivers on the largest honsyu island of japan and supplies water for various social agricultural and industrial purposes of gifu and its neighbouring aichi prefecture li et al 2003 the mainstream length of nagara river is 166 km and the basin area developed along the river extends for 1985 km2 with rich vegetation coverage approximately 80 of the whole basin is covered by forest types fig s1 such as the evergreen coniferous forest and the secondary forest of deciduous and evergreen broadleaved forest wei et al 2004 the use of the riverbed sediments from these three rivers for this study was made in order to generate data for comparison of the bacterial responses to heavy metals from sediments of rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses shimoyama 2002 for kurisu river the major land cover of its catchment is forest and human activities are very limited for the middle stream ijira river in addition to forest paddy fields and plowed fields are the major land uses of its catchment it was thus referred as the river with the pollution source mainly from nature and agricultural activities different from these two rivers the downstream gyaku river is an urban river its catchment is distributed with many small textile and dyeing industries and was thus referred as the river polluted mainly by human and industrial activities the concentrations of the targeted four metals pb cr cd and cu in both water and sediment phases of the three rivers are summarized in table 1 in this table the analytical results on the water phase ph temperature turbidity total dissolved organic carbon doc and ultra violet absorbance at the wavelength of 260 nm uv260 and the sediment phase organic matter content om are also included different water qualities and pollution levels by the four metal elements could be seen from table 1 2 2 sediment sampling and pretreatment sediment sampling from each river was conducted at five spots located within a length range of 20 m along the flow direction at its downstream about 5 km away from its estuary to nagara river from each spot about 100 ml of surface sediment about 0 3 cm in depth was collected by grab sampling and the collected sediment samples from all five spots of each river were then mixed within a pre sterilized 2 l plastic bottle immediately after transported using an icebox to the laboratory the mixed sediment of each river was stirred at 360 rpm for 30 min after addition of 1 l of the corresponding river water sampled at the time of sediment sampling and filtered in laboratory through 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters toyo roshi co ltd japan the time profile of suspended solid ss concentration obtained through preliminary detachment experiment confirmed that the adopted stirring condition was sufficient to detach and suspend fine particles attached even on coarse particles consisted mainly of sand particles and larger debris of various vegetation species contained in the sediment harata et al 2008 after stirring settling was followed for 30 s to separate the coarse particles and the obtained supernatant was used as the sediment suspension for sequencing batch incubation experiment in order to minimize the extent of any likely changes in the properties of sediment and detached sediment suspension the time between sediment sampling and the start of the incubation experiment was controlled to its minimum within 6 h for each of the three rivers 2 3 sequencing batch incubation experiment sequencing batch incubation experiment was conducted by using 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks as the reactors to each reactor the bacteria containing sediment suspension and the filtered water sample of each river were added together with sterilized culture medium containing glucose as the carbon source ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source and phosphorus kh2po4 and na2hpo4 the total volume of the mixed incubation liquid in each reactor was 800 ml with the initial sediment solid concentration being the same as 780 mg l dry weight the added carbon source as 10 mg c l and ammonium nitrogen as 1 mg n l harata et al 2012 the volume proportion of river water to culture medium in the initial 800 ml mixed incubation liquid was 99 1 since the phosphorus source was also used as the buffer to prevent distinct ph decreases caused by nitrification its initial concentration within each reactor was adjusted according to its use as a buffer 2 5 mm kh2po4 and 7 5 mm na2hpo4 heavy metals pb cr cd and cu were spiked into respective incubation reactors using the pre adjusted stock solutions of the reagent grade pb no3 2 k2cro4 cdcl2 cuso4 wako chemicals co ltd japan respectively as shown in table 2 for each metal species three concentration levels low middle and high were tested 0 1 1 0 10 mg l for pb cr and cd and 10 100 and 1000 mg l for cu the use of higher concentration levels for cu was made by referencing to the differences in the permissible limit for these metal species regulated in the specific effluent standards under the water pollution control law of japan as control for sediment from each river incubation experiment without spiking the metals was also conducted all reactors were sealed with teflon lined rubber septa substrate filling and mixed liquid sampling were performed using a syringe connected to a tube inserted to the bottom of each reactor through a hole opened on the septa to ensure sufficient do concentration within each reactor wetted air was consistently supplied to the liquid using an air blower through another small hole opened on the septa a small hole for air release from each reactor was also opened on the septa incubation was performed by shaking the reactors in dark for 30 days on a rotating culturing shaker within a temperature controlled room 20 c carbon source 10 mg c l as glucose and nitrogen source 1 mg n l as ammonium nitrogen were added to each reactor on a daily basis from the second day of the experiment mixed liquid was sampled at the designated time interval of three days on day 0 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 and 30 and subjected to analysis for microbial density all samples and community structure samples of day 0 and day 30 to obtain data for evaluation of the changes in the bacterial activity based on the mineralization rate for dissolved organic carbon on each of the above mentioned sampling days four liquid samples at the time points of 0 3 6 and 24 h were collected immediately after the addition of glucose and were analysed for dissolved organic carbon doc incubation experiment for each condition was conducted in duplicate 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 bacterial density bacterial density was evaluated by targeting on general and heterotrophic bacteria respectively these two well used bacterial indicators for natural water environment were analysed by following the standard plate count method described in the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater apha awwa wef 1998 2 4 2 bacterial activity bacterial activity was defined as the first order mineralization rate constant k of dissolved organic carbon doc calibrated by the density of heterotrophic bacteria k was estimated by fitting the measured doc data at the four time points 0 3 6 and 24 h after addition of glucose to each reactor for every 24 h with the first order reaction model this model was used because it fairly well described the data obtained in this study the correlation coefficient r2 fell in the range of 0 84 0 98 and had been frequently used in biodegradation studies li et al 2004 2008 du and li 2016 2017 the concentration of doc in the sampled liquid after filtration through 0 45 μm membrane filter was quantified with a toc analyser toc vws shimadzu co ltd japan for the experimental condition of this study in addition to the glucose added 10 mg c l for every 24 h certain percentages of the dissolved organic matter contained in the river water 0 6 1 0 2 8 mg c l for kurisu river ijira river and gyaku river respectively and that released to water from the added sediment the maximum concentration of 0 2 0 22 and 0 3 mg c l estimated based on the releasing potential determined through a releasing experiment conducted by stirring the sediment suspension of the three rivers for six days under the ph condition of 7 0 might also be used as the carbon source by bacteria in the sediment however since their contribution to the total amount of carbon source in each reactor throughout the whole incubation period of 30 days was much lower than that of the daily added glucose it is thus inferable that glucose was the main substrate available for bacteria in the reactors 1 d c d t k c where c is the doc concentration mg l measured immediately after addition of the glucose for every 24 h during incubation mg l t is time hr and k

changing trends in the density of heterotrophic bacteria hpc during incubation with the sediment of kurisu river are shown in fig 1 as examples compared to pb cr and cd the extent of sediment bacteria s responses to cu was more obvious in the initial 3 days for incubation spiked with middle and high concentrations of cu i e cu m and h the density was lower than that of the control ctrl after 3days however the density turned to a rapid increase and reached a level about 3 orders higher than ctrl for incubation with the low concentration i e cu l compared to ctrl the density was about 2 orders higher in ctrl the density values increased by about 2 orders after 1 day s incubation and then maintained a slight fluctuation till the end of incubation the observed increases in the ctrl was due to richer substrate in the reactor provided daily by the addition of glucose than in the field of the river for cd obvious bacterial growth was noticed for the incubation with high cd concentration i e cd h as it could be seen clearly that the density values increased by 1 2 orders as compared to ctrl for incubation spiked with pb and cr an apparent trend of either increases or decreases against ctrl was not revealed suggesting the responses of sediment bacteria to these two metals were not strong comparisons of the responses of sediment bacteria from all three rivers to the influential metals of cu and cd were made on the basis of relative density of heterotrophic bacteria a parameter defined as the ratio of the density of hpc in the reactors spiked with the metals to that of the control as shown in fig 2 for incubation with cd an apparent increasing trend appeared with the sediment bacteria from kurisu river spiked with the high concentration of 10 mg l with the sediment bacteria from ijira river and gyaku river being less affected compared to the responses to cd the responses to cu were more apparent and a short term inhibition effect followed by a distinct long term promotion effect was revealed for sediment bacteria from all three rivers in addition it is worthy of special mention that the observed two effects were more significant with the sediment from the upstream kurisu river than that from both the middle stream ijira river and the downstream gyaku river for general bacteria which were detected through culturing with higher substrate concentration under higher temperature than heterotrophic bacteria as illustrated in fig s2 as supplemental online material the changing trends of their density during incubation spiked with each of the four metals were very similar to those of the heterotrophic bacteria the different extent of responses of the sediment bacteria of the three rivers to the investigated metal species was probably caused by the differences in the extent of their exposure to the metals in the field of the rivers as described earlier that in both water and sediment phases the metal concentrations of kurisu river were lower than those of ijira river and gyaku river table 1 the initial reductions of relative bacterial density in incubation with cu might be explained by the inhibition effect on the growth of certain bacterial species if not all due to the toxicity of the metal element as reported by baath 1989 and giller et al 1998 the stronger inhabitation effect of cu was also reported by murata et al 2005 who compared soil bacterial responses to cu sb in and zn through incubation experiment using 96 well microtiter plates in contradiction with the reported inhabitation effects non reductions in biomass development were reported for sediment microbial communities in marine environment gillan et al 2005 and soil microbial communities wenderoth and reber 1999 baath et al 1998 feris et al 2003 knight et al 1997 shi et al 2002 results showing increased microbial diversity in heavy metal contaminated harbour sediments were also reported sorci et al 1999 the long term promotion effect of cu and cd observed in the present study was in part supportive of the previous findings sorci et al 1999 and could serve as a direct evidence showing the possibility of increases in the density of bacteria in water environment contaminated with heavy metals even if the standard plate count method has its limitations in detecting all heterotrophic bacterial species populated in river sediment based on the results of this study it is inferable that the observed responses of the riverbed sediment bacteria in density to cu and cd were probably a result of the following involvements 1 the activity of all bacterial species was inhibited in the initial time period and then recovered after adapted to the incubation condition 2 some bacterial species having faster uptake rate for substrate and can grow even under relatively low field substrate concentration were highly sensitive to the metals and their growth was inhibited the likely reason for the observed initial bacterial density reductions and 3 some bacterial species who had strong tolerance capability against metals and could grow readily under rich substrate condition existed and turned into rapid growth when the growth of the bacterial species having faster uptake rate for substrate was inhibited the likely reason for the observed long term bacterial density increases a forth explanation 4 was also conceivable the sediment contained some major species that were present in high proportion but were sensitive to metals and some species present at very low density in the sediment but could emerge after a lag time because they were more resistant to metals than the major species the apparently higher density values for incubation spiked with the metal than control noticed in the period of long term promotion effect could further lead to the inference that the contribution of 3 was relatively significant for the incubation conditions of this study to support this inference results on bacterial community structure are expected which will be revealed later in 3 3 3 2 responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals in activity the changing trends in the first order consumption rate constant k of glucose during sequencing batch incubation are shown in fig s3 as supplemental online material with the results obtained for the sediment of kurisu river as examples for the sediment of ijira river and gyaku river since changing trends similar to those of kurisu river were obtained they are not shown in this figure and will be discussed in terms of relative bacterial activity later in fig 4 compared to control ctrl the rate values for incubation with the metals were generally lower about 3 5 and 4 11 lower in average for pb and cr after day 9 and 15 23 and 11 48 lower in average after day 1 for cd and cu under all three spiking concentrations of each metal with the extent of decreases in k being more prominent for incubation spiked with cu based on the estimated k values and the corresponding heterotrophic bacterial concentrations the changing profiles of the sediment bacterial activity defined as the rate constant k divided by the hpc concentration are depicted it was obvious from fig 3 that of the four metal elements the activity of bacteria became particularly weaker for incubation spiked with cu under all three concentrations 10 100 and 1000 mg l and cd under the high concentration 10 mg l for incubation with cr and pb investigated the extent of their impacts under the spiking concentrations of this study was less significant than cd and cu for incubation with cd and cu in order to compare the differences among all three rivers the magnitudes of relative bacterial activity defined as the ratio of the activity in incubation spiked with the heavy metals to that of control ctrl were computed and depicted it was clear from fig 4 that the response of sediment bacteria differed with the rivers to the most influential metal element found in this study i e cu heterotrophic bacteria in the sediment of the upstream kurisu river responded obviously followed by the downstream gyaku river and then the middle stream ijira river to cd under the concentration of 10 mg l a distinctly stronger response was associated with the bacteria in the sediment of the upstream kurisu river for bacteria in the sediment of the middle stream ijira river and the downstream gyaku river the responses were weaker and similar the adversary effect of heavy metals on the activity of sediment bacteria observed in this study is supported by other studies which showed that soil incubation with heavy metals cu pb cd ni etc reduced dehydrogenase activity co2 respiration or the decomposition rates of organic matter added to soils wlike 1991 hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 in dose response incubation of suspensions of bacteria extracted from soils through measurement of protein synthesis pb was found more toxic than cr in affecting microbial activities shi et al 2002 under the incubation condition of the present study where ph was controlled at around 7 0 by the added phosphorus buffer the dissolved concentrations of pb cu and cd available for sediment bacteria during incubation were probably lower than the initial concentrations added to the reactors this was particularly more likely for the reactors added with the medium and high concentrations of the metals since the solubility of these metals at near neutral ph is low for cr with high solubility in water microbial activity could lead to reduction of cr vi into cr iii therefore it is worthy of special mention that the observed effects of the heavy metals on bacterial density and activity in the incubation experiment were a result of the likely involvement of both dissolved and not dissolved metal species for pb cu and cd and of the different existence forms for cr and were probably lower than those in water environment with lower ph levels taking also into consideration the revealed responses in density figs 1 and 2 i e the long term density increases of heterotrophic bacteria in the reactors of cu l cu m and cu h spiked with 10 100 and 1000 mg l of cu respectively and in the reactor of cd h spiked with 10 mg l of cd the decreases in the relative bacterial activity evaluated on the basis of the mineralization rate for dissolved organic carbon might be explained by the following the bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metals and grew to greater abundance probably possessed a slower consumption rate for the substrate added every day the reported inhibition effect due to the toxicity of the metals through for instance direct inhibition of the metabolic systems could not be excluded wlike 1991 hattori 1992 shi et al 2002 murata et al 2005 3 3 responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals in their community structure the pcr dgge patterns of amplified 16s rdna of sediment bacteria at the end of incubation for 30 days are shown in figs 5 7 in these figures the original band patterns before incubation are also presented as ctrl 0 day the observable differences in the number of dominating bands appeared in the original band patterns indicated the sediment bacterial community differed with the rivers incubation brought about distinct changes with the microbial community structure of kurisu river while that of both ijira river and gyaku river was less affected as could be seen by comparing the corresponding band patterns 30 day ctrl with the original ones ctrl 0 day the changes shown with kurisu river may indicate that the sediment of this river contained bacterial species that could grow faster under richer substrate condition which was provided in this study through the daily addition of glucose for incubation spiked with heavy metals changes in both the number and positions of dominating bands could be seen with the sediment from the upstream kurisu river and the middle stream ijira river whereas with the sediment from the downstream gyaku river where specific dominating bands were not found before incubation dominating bands appeared for all three rivers more apparent changes in the band patterns were revealed for incubation spiked with cu for instance with the sediment from kurisu river as could be seen from fig 5 that band f which was dominant in ctrl disappeared entirely in all three incubation runs of cu l cu m and cu h and band e which remained dominant in the incubation run of cu l disappeared in the runs of cu m and cu h in contrast band a was found emerging as a new dominant band in cu l cu m and cu h and band b only in cu h it is thus conceivable that the bacterial species related to the disappeared bands f and e in the kurisu river sediment probably had weaker tolerance against cu and were responsible for the short term decreases in the bacterial density observed at the beginning of incubation fig 2 and that the bacterial species of the newly emerged dominant bands a and b which probably had stronger tolerance against cu and could grow when the growth of the bacterial species of bands f and e was inhibited were responsible for the followed long term bacterial density increases fig 2 moreover the long term lowered bacterial activity evaluated based on the consumption rate for glucose throughout the incubation with cu fig 4 implies that the bacterial species related to the newly emerged dominant bands a and b might possess lower activity than those of the bands f and e and or their activity was to certain extent inhibited by the metal element as well from the obtained dgge gels 42 representative bands in total were excised for sequence analysis 11 for kurisu river 15 for ijira river and 16 for gyaku river the sequence analysis results showing the bacterial species of sediment bacteria of all three rivers and the changes in the dominating ones before and after incubation with and without spiking metals are summarized in table 3 for the upstream kurisu river proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two phylum that identified bacterial species belonged to for the middle and down streams ijira river and gyaku river in addition to these two phylum bacterial species in firmicutes and actinobacteria were also identified indicating the bacterial community in the middle and down stream rivers differed with that in the upstream river of the investigated nagara river basin the disappeared major bacterial species after incubation with cu were identified as sphingomonas sp sg 19e sphingomonas sp n9 sphingomonas sp n3 novosphingobium sp b 7 novosphingobium capsulatum strain 213 and curvibacter sp imcc12816 for the sediment of kurisu river microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp nakamurella multipartita nakamurella multipartita dsm and micropruina glycogenica for the sediment of ijira river and microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp nakamurella multipartita agromyces ramosus and nakamurella multipartita dsm 44233 for the sediment of gyaku river microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp and nakamurella multipartita were three common species in the sediment of the middle and down streams ijira river and gyaku river whose growth was inhibited by cu in regard of the newly emerged major dominant bacterial species after incubation with cu novosphingobium sp hu1 ah51 novosphingobium sp jsc r2 221 1 and sphingomonas sp mcfu17 were identified for the sediment of kurisu river flectobacillus sp gc5 flectobacillus sp wg3 massilia albidiflava strain a3 7 and duganella violaceusniger for the sediment of ijira river and flectobacillus sp gc5 massilia plicata strain 76 oxalobacteraceae bacterium sulf 8 novosphingobium sp hu1 ah51 novosphingobium sp jsc r2 221 1 for the sediment of gyaku river flectobacillus sp gc5 was the common species found to recover with the sediment of both the middle stream and the downstream rivers in previous studies through analysis of soils freshwater or marine sediments with different contamination history by heavy metals researchers have reported the impacts of heavy metals on the community structure of bacteria sandaa et al 1999 sorci et al 1999 gillan et al 2005 haller et al 2011 however since the likely impacts of some important environmental factors such as temperatures substrate concentrations and the presence levels of hazardous organic compounds could not be excluded from the results obtained the reached conclusions were not unique and differed with researchers some reported a reduction of bacterial diversity along with heavy metal contamination sandaa et al 1999 haller et al 2011 while others reported either an increase in microbial diversity sorci et al 1999 or no significant variations gillan et al 2005 standard acute bioassays using specific bacterial species helped determine the toxicity of heavy metals but were found difficult to evaluate their long term impacts on the structure and composition of environmental bacteria communities lahra et al 2003 the microbial structure analysis results of our study conducted under well controlled incubation conditions with sediment from three different rivers revealed not only the existence of some dominating bacterial species whose growth was inhibited due to 30 days contact with heavy metals but also the existence of bacterial species in the riverbed sediment that could grow and become dominating ones when the growth of original dominating species was inhibited a new finding related to the effects of heavy metal contamination on environmental bacterial communities the results of our study also clearly demonstrate that when riverbed sediment bacterial community is considered for use as an index of river water quality contamination by heavy metals evaluation based on the bacterial density alone may lead to a conclusion underestimating the effects of heavy metals and a combined evaluation in terms of bacterial density activity and community structure is necessary 4 conclusions responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals were investigated based on bacterial density activity and community structure under well controlled sequencing batch incubation conditions using sediment from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses for sediment bacteria from all three rivers the extent of responses to cu and cd was obviously stronger than that to pb and cr in incubation with cu in addition to a short inhibition effect appeared in the initial 3 days a long term promotion effect leading to obvious increases in the density of general and heterotrophic bacteria analysed with the standard plate count method was revealed suggesting there were sediment bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and could only grow readily when the growth of some original dominating bacterial species was inhibited the inhibition and promotion effects were found more obvious with the sediment of the upstream river than the middle stream and downstream rivers different from the responses in microbial density the activity of bacteria evaluated based on the first order consumption rate for glucose showed a general trend of decreases as compared to control further implying that the bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and grew readily even under high cu concentrations probably possessed slower consumption rate for the daily added substrate the results of pcr dgge and sequence analysis revealed the existence of such dominating bacterial species whose growth was inhibited and also more interestingly as a new finding the existence of bacterial species that turned into dominating ones with rich abundance in the presence of high concentrations of cu the results of this study suggest that when riverbed sediment bacterial community is considered for use as an indicator of river water contamination by heavy metals evaluation based on bacterial density alone may underestimate the effects of heavy metals and a combined evaluation in terms of bacterial density activity and community structure is necessary however caution should be addressed that the findings and conclusions related to the responses of bacterial density and activity to heavy metals are based on aerobic heterotrophic bacteria that could be cultured with the standard plate count method since this method could not give access to the whole bacterial communities in riverbed sediment including for examples the not cultural heterotrophic species and autotrophic bacterial species such nitrification bacteria on the basis of this study further investigations with approaches that could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the responses of sediment bacterial community to heavy metals are expected appendix a

19805,better understanding the responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals is a key for considering using riverbed sediment bacterial community as an indicator of river water contamination by heavy metals for this integrated evaluation based on bacterial density activity and community structure through incubation experiments under well controlled conditions is necessary to obtain more closely relevant findings that are difficult to achieve through field studies the findings may also include those that can serve as new evidence to clarify contrary findings reported in previous studies in this study sequencing batch incubation experiments were performed using sediment suspensions from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses the effects of four metals pb cr cd and cu were investigated by spiking them separately under three different concentration levels glucose was added once every day as the carbon source throughout the whole incubation lasted for 30 days the changing trends of the density of general and heterotrophic bacteria showed clearly that the responses of sediment bacteria to cu were obviously stronger followed by that to cd whereas the responses to pb and cr were not apparent for incubation with cu a short term inhibition effect appeared in the initial 3 days and was then followed by a long term promotion effect reflected by obvious increases of bacterial density against control in regard of bacterial activity evaluated based on the first order consumption rate for glucose a trend of decreases was revealed the results of pcr dgge and sequence analysis of extracted 16s rdna further suggested there were bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and could grow readily to become new dominating ones the existence of such bacterial species was inferred as the reason leading to the observed increases of bacterial density during incubation with the metal graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals toxicity river sediment sediment bacteria bacterial community 16s rdna 1 introduction the pollution of water and soil environments by heavy metals is consistently a major issue in many parts of the world due to their adversary effects on associated ecosystems and detrimental effects on the health of humans and animals for natural water environment many water quality indexes related to the species and concentrations of heavy metals are included in respectively national standards and regulations and are used for evaluation of water quality and the extent of water pollution by heavy metals originated from natural sources and human activities social agricultural and industrial activities in the freshwater environment mainly including rivers lakes and dam reservoirs a sediment phase always exist even if its thickness and composition may change with many factors such as the coverages and uses of the associated catchment hydraulic conditions and meteorological conditions li et al 2003 2005 2008a b haller et al 2011 compared to the flowing water phase the sediment phase is relatively stable and contains bacterial communities whose composition and structure may reflect the quality of the flowing water due to such a feature of the sediment the bacterial community populated in the sediment may serve as a new biomonitoring index to assist in existing chemical analysis for realizing more comprehensive water quality evaluation as pointed out also by other researchers pronk et al 2009 haller et al 2011 to consider using water sediment bacteria as a potential index for evaluation of water contamination by heavy metals comprehensive understanding of the responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals is necessary this requires an integrated evaluation based on the following three aspects bacterial density activity and community structure the reason is because sediment bacterial species may differ in their capability of tolerance against heavy metals zhang et al 2016 their growth rate under the condition with and or without the presence of heavy metals gillan et al 2005 and their uptake rate for substrate available in the water environment hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 due to such differences the conclusion may differ according to the aspect from which evaluation is conducted for instance in regard of the responses of soil and marine sediment bacterial community to heavy metals in density previous studies have reported that heavy metal contamination may lead to a reduction of total microbial biomass brookes and mcgrath 1984 fliessbach et al 1994 and a decrease in the numbers of specific bacterial populations such as infecting rhizobia chaudri et al 1993 or mycorrhizae koomen et al 1990 however there are also other studies that have shown that metal stress does not always reduce productivity shi et al 2002 wenderoth and reber 1999 or biomass baath et al 1998 feris et al 2003 knight et al 1997 shi et al 2002 chodak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 similarly regarding the impacts of heavy metals on the diversity of soil and water sediment bacterial community findings reported in previous studies are also different through analysis of bacterial communities in heavy metal contaminated soils at different levels of resolution sandaa et al 1999 reported that heavy metal contamination may lead to a reduction of bacterial diversity however other researchers observed either an increase in microbial diversity sorci et al 1999 or no significant variation gillan et al 2005 the contrary findings are considered to be explainable by factors other than metals such as environmental variables the time of exposure etc haller et al 2011 for field studies toxic organic compounds if coexisted with heavy metals are also a factor that makes the evaluation of the impacts of heavy metals more complicated shi et al 2002 the responses of bacterial communities in natural environments to heavy metals are considered to be mainly in association with the toxicity of heavy metals for bacterial species too sensitive to heavy metals their growth may be inhibited koomen et al 1990 chaudri et al 1993 lahra et al 2003 barkay 1987 rasmussen and sørensen 2001 smit et al 1997 for bacterial species with strong resistance against heavy metals and those with weak resistance but can recover after adapting to the toxicity they may maintain their growth as dominating ones or become new dominating ones rasmussen and sørensen 2001 gillan et al 2005 for observed increases or no variation in microbial diversity of marine sediments along with heavy metal contamination sorci et al 1999 gillan et al 2005 the reason was speculated due mainly to the appearance of new dominant species rather than a reversion to the original community gillan et al 2005 in addition to the differences of bacterial species in their tolerance capability against heavy metals the differences in their uptake rate for substrate are also a probable factor contributing in part if not all to the observed differences as hinted in previous studies hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 such a hypothesis probably applies since within bacterial community there might be some bacterial species that have strong tolerance against heavy metals and could grow readily only when the substrate available for their use is ensured if such bacterial species exist depending on their density and the substrate availability for them as against other coexisted bacterial species increases or no apparent variations in the overall density of the bacterial community are likely to find new evidences to prove this relatively long term incubation experiments under well controlled conditions are necessary since field studies are difficult to differentiate the impacts of heavy metals from those of many environmental variables and hazardous organic compounds if coexisted accordingly the major objective of the present study was to evaluate the responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals through integrated evaluation of bacterial density activity and community structure under well controlled incubation conditions for this sequencing batch incubation experiments were performed using sediment suspensions from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses to each sediment suspension four metals pb cr cd and cu were separately spiked for three different concentration levels and glucose was added once every day as the carbon source throughout the whole incubation lasted for 30 days bacterial density was evaluated in terms of general and heterotrophic bacteria quantified with the well used standard plate count method the responses in bacterial activity were evaluated based on changing trends of the first order consumption rate parameter for the daily added glucose in regard of the responses in bacterial community structure pcr dgge and sequence analysis were performed for the extracted 16s rdna from sediment suspensions before and after incubation the well designed incubation experiment conditions were expected to provide more closely relevant findings that would be useful for better understanding the responses of bacterial community to heavy metals including those that may serve as new evidence for clarification of contrary findings reported in previous studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 riverbed sediment sites riverbed sediments were sampled from the downstream sites of kurisu river ijira river and gyaku river as shown in fig s1 as supplemental online material these three rivers are the tributaries of nagara river one of the major well known and relatively well conserved rivers on the largest honsyu island of japan and supplies water for various social agricultural and industrial purposes of gifu and its neighbouring aichi prefecture li et al 2003 the mainstream length of nagara river is 166 km and the basin area developed along the river extends for 1985 km2 with rich vegetation coverage approximately 80 of the whole basin is covered by forest types fig s1 such as the evergreen coniferous forest and the secondary forest of deciduous and evergreen broadleaved forest wei et al 2004 the use of the riverbed sediments from these three rivers for this study was made in order to generate data for comparison of the bacterial responses to heavy metals from sediments of rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses shimoyama 2002 for kurisu river the major land cover of its catchment is forest and human activities are very limited for the middle stream ijira river in addition to forest paddy fields and plowed fields are the major land uses of its catchment it was thus referred as the river with the pollution source mainly from nature and agricultural activities different from these two rivers the downstream gyaku river is an urban river its catchment is distributed with many small textile and dyeing industries and was thus referred as the river polluted mainly by human and industrial activities the concentrations of the targeted four metals pb cr cd and cu in both water and sediment phases of the three rivers are summarized in table 1 in this table the analytical results on the water phase ph temperature turbidity total dissolved organic carbon doc and ultra violet absorbance at the wavelength of 260 nm uv260 and the sediment phase organic matter content om are also included different water qualities and pollution levels by the four metal elements could be seen from table 1 2 2 sediment sampling and pretreatment sediment sampling from each river was conducted at five spots located within a length range of 20 m along the flow direction at its downstream about 5 km away from its estuary to nagara river from each spot about 100 ml of surface sediment about 0 3 cm in depth was collected by grab sampling and the collected sediment samples from all five spots of each river were then mixed within a pre sterilized 2 l plastic bottle immediately after transported using an icebox to the laboratory the mixed sediment of each river was stirred at 360 rpm for 30 min after addition of 1 l of the corresponding river water sampled at the time of sediment sampling and filtered in laboratory through 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters toyo roshi co ltd japan the time profile of suspended solid ss concentration obtained through preliminary detachment experiment confirmed that the adopted stirring condition was sufficient to detach and suspend fine particles attached even on coarse particles consisted mainly of sand particles and larger debris of various vegetation species contained in the sediment harata et al 2008 after stirring settling was followed for 30 s to separate the coarse particles and the obtained supernatant was used as the sediment suspension for sequencing batch incubation experiment in order to minimize the extent of any likely changes in the properties of sediment and detached sediment suspension the time between sediment sampling and the start of the incubation experiment was controlled to its minimum within 6 h for each of the three rivers 2 3 sequencing batch incubation experiment sequencing batch incubation experiment was conducted by using 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks as the reactors to each reactor the bacteria containing sediment suspension and the filtered water sample of each river were added together with sterilized culture medium containing glucose as the carbon source ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source and phosphorus kh2po4 and na2hpo4 the total volume of the mixed incubation liquid in each reactor was 800 ml with the initial sediment solid concentration being the same as 780 mg l dry weight the added carbon source as 10 mg c l and ammonium nitrogen as 1 mg n l harata et al 2012 the volume proportion of river water to culture medium in the initial 800 ml mixed incubation liquid was 99 1 since the phosphorus source was also used as the buffer to prevent distinct ph decreases caused by nitrification its initial concentration within each reactor was adjusted according to its use as a buffer 2 5 mm kh2po4 and 7 5 mm na2hpo4 heavy metals pb cr cd and cu were spiked into respective incubation reactors using the pre adjusted stock solutions of the reagent grade pb no3 2 k2cro4 cdcl2 cuso4 wako chemicals co ltd japan respectively as shown in table 2 for each metal species three concentration levels low middle and high were tested 0 1 1 0 10 mg l for pb cr and cd and 10 100 and 1000 mg l for cu the use of higher concentration levels for cu was made by referencing to the differences in the permissible limit for these metal species regulated in the specific effluent standards under the water pollution control law of japan as control for sediment from each river incubation experiment without spiking the metals was also conducted all reactors were sealed with teflon lined rubber septa substrate filling and mixed liquid sampling were performed using a syringe connected to a tube inserted to the bottom of each reactor through a hole opened on the septa to ensure sufficient do concentration within each reactor wetted air was consistently supplied to the liquid using an air blower through another small hole opened on the septa a small hole for air release from each reactor was also opened on the septa incubation was performed by shaking the reactors in dark for 30 days on a rotating culturing shaker within a temperature controlled room 20 c carbon source 10 mg c l as glucose and nitrogen source 1 mg n l as ammonium nitrogen were added to each reactor on a daily basis from the second day of the experiment mixed liquid was sampled at the designated time interval of three days on day 0 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 and 30 and subjected to analysis for microbial density all samples and community structure samples of day 0 and day 30 to obtain data for evaluation of the changes in the bacterial activity based on the mineralization rate for dissolved organic carbon on each of the above mentioned sampling days four liquid samples at the time points of 0 3 6 and 24 h were collected immediately after the addition of glucose and were analysed for dissolved organic carbon doc incubation experiment for each condition was conducted in duplicate 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 bacterial density bacterial density was evaluated by targeting on general and heterotrophic bacteria respectively these two well used bacterial indicators for natural water environment were analysed by following the standard plate count method described in the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater apha awwa wef 1998 2 4 2 bacterial activity bacterial activity was defined as the first order mineralization rate constant k of dissolved organic carbon doc calibrated by the density of heterotrophic bacteria k was estimated by fitting the measured doc data at the four time points 0 3 6 and 24 h after addition of glucose to each reactor for every 24 h with the first order reaction model this model was used because it fairly well described the data obtained in this study the correlation coefficient r2 fell in the range of 0 84 0 98 and had been frequently used in biodegradation studies li et al 2004 2008 du and li 2016 2017 the concentration of doc in the sampled liquid after filtration through 0 45 μm membrane filter was quantified with a toc analyser toc vws shimadzu co ltd japan for the experimental condition of this study in addition to the glucose added 10 mg c l for every 24 h certain percentages of the dissolved organic matter contained in the river water 0 6 1 0 2 8 mg c l for kurisu river ijira river and gyaku river respectively and that released to water from the added sediment the maximum concentration of 0 2 0 22 and 0 3 mg c l estimated based on the releasing potential determined through a releasing experiment conducted by stirring the sediment suspension of the three rivers for six days under the ph condition of 7 0 might also be used as the carbon source by bacteria in the sediment however since their contribution to the total amount of carbon source in each reactor throughout the whole incubation period of 30 days was much lower than that of the daily added glucose it is thus inferable that glucose was the main substrate available for bacteria in the reactors 1 d c d t k c where c is the doc concentration mg l measured immediately after addition of the glucose for every 24 h during incubation mg l t is time hr and k

changing trends in the density of heterotrophic bacteria hpc during incubation with the sediment of kurisu river are shown in fig 1 as examples compared to pb cr and cd the extent of sediment bacteria s responses to cu was more obvious in the initial 3 days for incubation spiked with middle and high concentrations of cu i e cu m and h the density was lower than that of the control ctrl after 3days however the density turned to a rapid increase and reached a level about 3 orders higher than ctrl for incubation with the low concentration i e cu l compared to ctrl the density was about 2 orders higher in ctrl the density values increased by about 2 orders after 1 day s incubation and then maintained a slight fluctuation till the end of incubation the observed increases in the ctrl was due to richer substrate in the reactor provided daily by the addition of glucose than in the field of the river for cd obvious bacterial growth was noticed for the incubation with high cd concentration i e cd h as it could be seen clearly that the density values increased by 1 2 orders as compared to ctrl for incubation spiked with pb and cr an apparent trend of either increases or decreases against ctrl was not revealed suggesting the responses of sediment bacteria to these two metals were not strong comparisons of the responses of sediment bacteria from all three rivers to the influential metals of cu and cd were made on the basis of relative density of heterotrophic bacteria a parameter defined as the ratio of the density of hpc in the reactors spiked with the metals to that of the control as shown in fig 2 for incubation with cd an apparent increasing trend appeared with the sediment bacteria from kurisu river spiked with the high concentration of 10 mg l with the sediment bacteria from ijira river and gyaku river being less affected compared to the responses to cd the responses to cu were more apparent and a short term inhibition effect followed by a distinct long term promotion effect was revealed for sediment bacteria from all three rivers in addition it is worthy of special mention that the observed two effects were more significant with the sediment from the upstream kurisu river than that from both the middle stream ijira river and the downstream gyaku river for general bacteria which were detected through culturing with higher substrate concentration under higher temperature than heterotrophic bacteria as illustrated in fig s2 as supplemental online material the changing trends of their density during incubation spiked with each of the four metals were very similar to those of the heterotrophic bacteria the different extent of responses of the sediment bacteria of the three rivers to the investigated metal species was probably caused by the differences in the extent of their exposure to the metals in the field of the rivers as described earlier that in both water and sediment phases the metal concentrations of kurisu river were lower than those of ijira river and gyaku river table 1 the initial reductions of relative bacterial density in incubation with cu might be explained by the inhibition effect on the growth of certain bacterial species if not all due to the toxicity of the metal element as reported by baath 1989 and giller et al 1998 the stronger inhabitation effect of cu was also reported by murata et al 2005 who compared soil bacterial responses to cu sb in and zn through incubation experiment using 96 well microtiter plates in contradiction with the reported inhabitation effects non reductions in biomass development were reported for sediment microbial communities in marine environment gillan et al 2005 and soil microbial communities wenderoth and reber 1999 baath et al 1998 feris et al 2003 knight et al 1997 shi et al 2002 results showing increased microbial diversity in heavy metal contaminated harbour sediments were also reported sorci et al 1999 the long term promotion effect of cu and cd observed in the present study was in part supportive of the previous findings sorci et al 1999 and could serve as a direct evidence showing the possibility of increases in the density of bacteria in water environment contaminated with heavy metals even if the standard plate count method has its limitations in detecting all heterotrophic bacterial species populated in river sediment based on the results of this study it is inferable that the observed responses of the riverbed sediment bacteria in density to cu and cd were probably a result of the following involvements 1 the activity of all bacterial species was inhibited in the initial time period and then recovered after adapted to the incubation condition 2 some bacterial species having faster uptake rate for substrate and can grow even under relatively low field substrate concentration were highly sensitive to the metals and their growth was inhibited the likely reason for the observed initial bacterial density reductions and 3 some bacterial species who had strong tolerance capability against metals and could grow readily under rich substrate condition existed and turned into rapid growth when the growth of the bacterial species having faster uptake rate for substrate was inhibited the likely reason for the observed long term bacterial density increases a forth explanation 4 was also conceivable the sediment contained some major species that were present in high proportion but were sensitive to metals and some species present at very low density in the sediment but could emerge after a lag time because they were more resistant to metals than the major species the apparently higher density values for incubation spiked with the metal than control noticed in the period of long term promotion effect could further lead to the inference that the contribution of 3 was relatively significant for the incubation conditions of this study to support this inference results on bacterial community structure are expected which will be revealed later in 3 3 3 2 responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals in activity the changing trends in the first order consumption rate constant k of glucose during sequencing batch incubation are shown in fig s3 as supplemental online material with the results obtained for the sediment of kurisu river as examples for the sediment of ijira river and gyaku river since changing trends similar to those of kurisu river were obtained they are not shown in this figure and will be discussed in terms of relative bacterial activity later in fig 4 compared to control ctrl the rate values for incubation with the metals were generally lower about 3 5 and 4 11 lower in average for pb and cr after day 9 and 15 23 and 11 48 lower in average after day 1 for cd and cu under all three spiking concentrations of each metal with the extent of decreases in k being more prominent for incubation spiked with cu based on the estimated k values and the corresponding heterotrophic bacterial concentrations the changing profiles of the sediment bacterial activity defined as the rate constant k divided by the hpc concentration are depicted it was obvious from fig 3 that of the four metal elements the activity of bacteria became particularly weaker for incubation spiked with cu under all three concentrations 10 100 and 1000 mg l and cd under the high concentration 10 mg l for incubation with cr and pb investigated the extent of their impacts under the spiking concentrations of this study was less significant than cd and cu for incubation with cd and cu in order to compare the differences among all three rivers the magnitudes of relative bacterial activity defined as the ratio of the activity in incubation spiked with the heavy metals to that of control ctrl were computed and depicted it was clear from fig 4 that the response of sediment bacteria differed with the rivers to the most influential metal element found in this study i e cu heterotrophic bacteria in the sediment of the upstream kurisu river responded obviously followed by the downstream gyaku river and then the middle stream ijira river to cd under the concentration of 10 mg l a distinctly stronger response was associated with the bacteria in the sediment of the upstream kurisu river for bacteria in the sediment of the middle stream ijira river and the downstream gyaku river the responses were weaker and similar the adversary effect of heavy metals on the activity of sediment bacteria observed in this study is supported by other studies which showed that soil incubation with heavy metals cu pb cd ni etc reduced dehydrogenase activity co2 respiration or the decomposition rates of organic matter added to soils wlike 1991 hattori 1992 murata et al 2005 in dose response incubation of suspensions of bacteria extracted from soils through measurement of protein synthesis pb was found more toxic than cr in affecting microbial activities shi et al 2002 under the incubation condition of the present study where ph was controlled at around 7 0 by the added phosphorus buffer the dissolved concentrations of pb cu and cd available for sediment bacteria during incubation were probably lower than the initial concentrations added to the reactors this was particularly more likely for the reactors added with the medium and high concentrations of the metals since the solubility of these metals at near neutral ph is low for cr with high solubility in water microbial activity could lead to reduction of cr vi into cr iii therefore it is worthy of special mention that the observed effects of the heavy metals on bacterial density and activity in the incubation experiment were a result of the likely involvement of both dissolved and not dissolved metal species for pb cu and cd and of the different existence forms for cr and were probably lower than those in water environment with lower ph levels taking also into consideration the revealed responses in density figs 1 and 2 i e the long term density increases of heterotrophic bacteria in the reactors of cu l cu m and cu h spiked with 10 100 and 1000 mg l of cu respectively and in the reactor of cd h spiked with 10 mg l of cd the decreases in the relative bacterial activity evaluated on the basis of the mineralization rate for dissolved organic carbon might be explained by the following the bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metals and grew to greater abundance probably possessed a slower consumption rate for the substrate added every day the reported inhibition effect due to the toxicity of the metals through for instance direct inhibition of the metabolic systems could not be excluded wlike 1991 hattori 1992 shi et al 2002 murata et al 2005 3 3 responses of sediment bacteria to heavy metals in their community structure the pcr dgge patterns of amplified 16s rdna of sediment bacteria at the end of incubation for 30 days are shown in figs 5 7 in these figures the original band patterns before incubation are also presented as ctrl 0 day the observable differences in the number of dominating bands appeared in the original band patterns indicated the sediment bacterial community differed with the rivers incubation brought about distinct changes with the microbial community structure of kurisu river while that of both ijira river and gyaku river was less affected as could be seen by comparing the corresponding band patterns 30 day ctrl with the original ones ctrl 0 day the changes shown with kurisu river may indicate that the sediment of this river contained bacterial species that could grow faster under richer substrate condition which was provided in this study through the daily addition of glucose for incubation spiked with heavy metals changes in both the number and positions of dominating bands could be seen with the sediment from the upstream kurisu river and the middle stream ijira river whereas with the sediment from the downstream gyaku river where specific dominating bands were not found before incubation dominating bands appeared for all three rivers more apparent changes in the band patterns were revealed for incubation spiked with cu for instance with the sediment from kurisu river as could be seen from fig 5 that band f which was dominant in ctrl disappeared entirely in all three incubation runs of cu l cu m and cu h and band e which remained dominant in the incubation run of cu l disappeared in the runs of cu m and cu h in contrast band a was found emerging as a new dominant band in cu l cu m and cu h and band b only in cu h it is thus conceivable that the bacterial species related to the disappeared bands f and e in the kurisu river sediment probably had weaker tolerance against cu and were responsible for the short term decreases in the bacterial density observed at the beginning of incubation fig 2 and that the bacterial species of the newly emerged dominant bands a and b which probably had stronger tolerance against cu and could grow when the growth of the bacterial species of bands f and e was inhibited were responsible for the followed long term bacterial density increases fig 2 moreover the long term lowered bacterial activity evaluated based on the consumption rate for glucose throughout the incubation with cu fig 4 implies that the bacterial species related to the newly emerged dominant bands a and b might possess lower activity than those of the bands f and e and or their activity was to certain extent inhibited by the metal element as well from the obtained dgge gels 42 representative bands in total were excised for sequence analysis 11 for kurisu river 15 for ijira river and 16 for gyaku river the sequence analysis results showing the bacterial species of sediment bacteria of all three rivers and the changes in the dominating ones before and after incubation with and without spiking metals are summarized in table 3 for the upstream kurisu river proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the two phylum that identified bacterial species belonged to for the middle and down streams ijira river and gyaku river in addition to these two phylum bacterial species in firmicutes and actinobacteria were also identified indicating the bacterial community in the middle and down stream rivers differed with that in the upstream river of the investigated nagara river basin the disappeared major bacterial species after incubation with cu were identified as sphingomonas sp sg 19e sphingomonas sp n9 sphingomonas sp n3 novosphingobium sp b 7 novosphingobium capsulatum strain 213 and curvibacter sp imcc12816 for the sediment of kurisu river microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp nakamurella multipartita nakamurella multipartita dsm and micropruina glycogenica for the sediment of ijira river and microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp nakamurella multipartita agromyces ramosus and nakamurella multipartita dsm 44233 for the sediment of gyaku river microsphaera sp g 96 gram positive bacteria sp and nakamurella multipartita were three common species in the sediment of the middle and down streams ijira river and gyaku river whose growth was inhibited by cu in regard of the newly emerged major dominant bacterial species after incubation with cu novosphingobium sp hu1 ah51 novosphingobium sp jsc r2 221 1 and sphingomonas sp mcfu17 were identified for the sediment of kurisu river flectobacillus sp gc5 flectobacillus sp wg3 massilia albidiflava strain a3 7 and duganella violaceusniger for the sediment of ijira river and flectobacillus sp gc5 massilia plicata strain 76 oxalobacteraceae bacterium sulf 8 novosphingobium sp hu1 ah51 novosphingobium sp jsc r2 221 1 for the sediment of gyaku river flectobacillus sp gc5 was the common species found to recover with the sediment of both the middle stream and the downstream rivers in previous studies through analysis of soils freshwater or marine sediments with different contamination history by heavy metals researchers have reported the impacts of heavy metals on the community structure of bacteria sandaa et al 1999 sorci et al 1999 gillan et al 2005 haller et al 2011 however since the likely impacts of some important environmental factors such as temperatures substrate concentrations and the presence levels of hazardous organic compounds could not be excluded from the results obtained the reached conclusions were not unique and differed with researchers some reported a reduction of bacterial diversity along with heavy metal contamination sandaa et al 1999 haller et al 2011 while others reported either an increase in microbial diversity sorci et al 1999 or no significant variations gillan et al 2005 standard acute bioassays using specific bacterial species helped determine the toxicity of heavy metals but were found difficult to evaluate their long term impacts on the structure and composition of environmental bacteria communities lahra et al 2003 the microbial structure analysis results of our study conducted under well controlled incubation conditions with sediment from three different rivers revealed not only the existence of some dominating bacterial species whose growth was inhibited due to 30 days contact with heavy metals but also the existence of bacterial species in the riverbed sediment that could grow and become dominating ones when the growth of original dominating species was inhibited a new finding related to the effects of heavy metal contamination on environmental bacterial communities the results of our study also clearly demonstrate that when riverbed sediment bacterial community is considered for use as an index of river water quality contamination by heavy metals evaluation based on the bacterial density alone may lead to a conclusion underestimating the effects of heavy metals and a combined evaluation in terms of bacterial density activity and community structure is necessary 4 conclusions responses of riverbed sediment bacteria to heavy metals were investigated based on bacterial density activity and community structure under well controlled sequencing batch incubation conditions using sediment from three rivers with catchment of different land covers and uses for sediment bacteria from all three rivers the extent of responses to cu and cd was obviously stronger than that to pb and cr in incubation with cu in addition to a short inhibition effect appeared in the initial 3 days a long term promotion effect leading to obvious increases in the density of general and heterotrophic bacteria analysed with the standard plate count method was revealed suggesting there were sediment bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and could only grow readily when the growth of some original dominating bacterial species was inhibited the inhibition and promotion effects were found more obvious with the sediment of the upstream river than the middle stream and downstream rivers different from the responses in microbial density the activity of bacteria evaluated based on the first order consumption rate for glucose showed a general trend of decreases as compared to control further implying that the bacterial species that had strong tolerance against the metal and grew readily even under high cu concentrations probably possessed slower consumption rate for the daily added substrate the results of pcr dgge and sequence analysis revealed the existence of such dominating bacterial species whose growth was inhibited and also more interestingly as a new finding the existence of bacterial species that turned into dominating ones with rich abundance in the presence of high concentrations of cu the results of this study suggest that when riverbed sediment bacterial community is considered for use as an indicator of river water contamination by heavy metals evaluation based on bacterial density alone may underestimate the effects of heavy metals and a combined evaluation in terms of bacterial density activity and community structure is necessary however caution should be addressed that the findings and conclusions related to the responses of bacterial density and activity to heavy metals are based on aerobic heterotrophic bacteria that could be cultured with the standard plate count method since this method could not give access to the whole bacterial communities in riverbed sediment including for examples the not cultural heterotrophic species and autotrophic bacterial species such nitrification bacteria on the basis of this study further investigations with approaches that could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the responses of sediment bacterial community to heavy metals are expected appendix a

groundwater gw surface water sw and secondary effluent se by conventional ozonation the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 and the electro peroxone e peroxone processes was compared in batch tests se had significantly more fast reacting dissolved organic matter dom moieties than gw and sw therefore o3 decomposed much faster in se than in gw and sw at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc the application of o3 h2o2 and e peroxone process by adding external h2o2 stocks or in situ generating h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction during ozonation similarly enhanced the oh yield from o3 decomposition by 5 12 and 5 7 in gw and sw respectively compared to conventional ozonation in contrast due to the slower reaction kinetics of o3 with h2o2 than o3 with fast reacting dom moieties the addition or electro generation of h2o2 hardly increased the oh yield 4 increases in se corresponding to the changes in the oh yields the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and clofibric acid increased evidently in gw up to 14 18 at a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc moderately in sw up to 6 10 at 0 5 mg o3 mg doc and negligibly in se during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment compared to conventional ozonation these results indicate that similar to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process can more pronouncedly enhance o3 transformation to oh and thus increase the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in water matrices exerting relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents therefore by installing electrodes in existing ozone reactors the e peroxone process may provide a convenient way to enhance pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water applications where groundwater and surface water with low dom contents are used as the source waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process hydrogen peroxide micropollutant ozonation water matrix 1 introduction the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has raised increasing international concern michael et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 ternes and joss 2006 ternes 1998 although most pharmaceuticals are typically present at trace levels e g ng l 1 μg l 1 their complex mixtures can pose a potential threat to ecosystems and or human health secondary effluents discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as a major source for pharmaceuticals in the water environment eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 lee et al 2013 michael et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011 to protect the ecosystems advanced wastewater treatment e g ozonation and activated carbon adsorption are increasingly employed to abate pharmaceuticals from secondary effluents hollender et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 moreover while most pharmaceuticals may not pose considerable threats to human health at typical concentrations found in waters their presence can still arouse a concern to many individuals therefore when surface water and groundwater contaminated with pharmaceuticals are used as potable water sources effective drinking water treatments are desired to abate pharmaceuticals in water utilities acero et al 2000 acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone o3 is a commonly used disinfectant and oxidant in water and wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during conventional ozonation micropollutants can be oxidized by o3 and or by hydroxyl radicals oh that are generated from o3 decomposition in real water matrices von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with organics that have olefins activated aromatic systems or amines whereas oh is a less selective oxidant and reacts rapidly with almost all types of organic moieties a great number of studies have demonstrated that many pharmaceuticals are ozone reactive and can therefore be efficiently abated from various water matrices e g groundwater surface water and wastewater by conventional ozonation with low specific ozone doses e g 0 25 0 5 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc gerrity et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 kovalova et al 2013 lee et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 zucker et al 2016 however there are also many ozone resistant pharmaceuticals that can only be oxidized by oh and are therefore less efficiently abated during conventional ozonation the electro peroxone e peroxone process is a new electrochemically driven advanced oxidation process aop that combines conventional ozonation with in situ h2o2 production from electrochemical oxygen o2 reduction eq 1 at carbon based cathodes yuan et al 2013 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 during the e peroxone process o3 is generated from an o2 feed gas using ozone generators which is the same as in conventional ozonation because ozone generators can convert only a small fraction of the o2 feed gas to o3 ozone generator effluents o2 o3 gas mixtures that are sparged into ozone reactors are still composed of predominantly o2 usually 90 v v von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this part of o2 has little use for pollutant abatement and is therefore wasted during conventional ozonation however it provides an ideal o2 source for cathodic h2o2 production during the e peroxone process xia et al 2017 yuan et al 2013 the in situ generated h2o2 can considerably accelerate the transformation of o3 to oh eq 2 simplified according to fischbacher et al 2013 and von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus enhance the abatement kinetics of ozone resistant pollutants wang et al 2015a yao et al 2017 yao et al 2016 2 2h2o2 2o3 h2o 3o2 ho2 oh in addition the reaction of o3 with h2o2 can produce oh with a yield of 50 i e 0 5 mol of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed which is generally higher than those from o3 decomposition with electron rich components of dissolved organic matter dom in real water matrices e g 24 43 for phenols 8 17 for alkoxybenzenes and 15 for tertiary amines flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore it has been hypothesized that for a given applied ozone dose more oh can be produced to enhance the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation however this hypothesis has not been well evaluated in previous studies several studies have compared pharmaceutical abatement by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process and the results indicate that enhanced abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals can be obtained in the e peroxone process guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 2015a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 nevertheless all the previous studies employed small semi batch reactors volume 1 l with continuous o2 o3 gas sparging but did not measure the transferred ozone doses i e the ozone doses dissolved from the sparged o2 o3 gas to the liquid and the oh yields moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed due to the small reactors used in the previous studies ozone transfer efficiency is expected to be quite low during conventional ozonation and can be considerably enhanced in the presence of h2o2 during the e peroxone process e g enhanced o3 transfer efficiency from 16 to 31 was observed in a recent study using similar small semi batch reactors yao et al 2017 therefore it is inferred that higher ozone doses were actually applied during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation in the previous studies as a result it remains unclear whether the enhanced abatements of pharmaceuticals are mainly caused by the higher transferred ozone doses or the increased oh yield from a given transferred o3 dose during the e peroxone process this is a critical question when evaluating the cost effectiveness of ozone based processes because the energy consumption of water treatment is directly related to applied ozone doses hollender et al 2009 katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 moreover high concentration pharmaceutical solutions e g 20 100 mg l ibuprofen and amoxicillin were used in most previous studies mainly to evaluate the effectiveness of the e peroxone process and to reveal the degradation pathways of pharmaceuticals guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 wu et al 2017 in contrast pharmaceuticals are typically present at several orders of magnitude lower concentrations ng μg l than the background constituents e g natural organic matter and inorganic salts of real water matrix e g groundwater surface water and wastewater these water matrix constituents can significantly influence the micropollutant abatement during ozone based processes acero et al 2001 acero and von gunten 2001 huber et al 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it has often been shown that the addition of h2o2 during ozonation i e the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process can considerably enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants in groundwater but less significantly or even negligibly in surface water and wastewater acero and von gunten 2001 huber et al 2003 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 how the water matrix would affect pharmaceutical abatement by the e peroxone process has yet to be evaluated the main objective of this study was to compare the abatement of pharmaceuticals in real water matrices groundwater surface water and municipal secondary effluent by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process several pharmaceuticals with differing reactivities with o3 k o3 ranging from 10 to 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 were selected as model compounds and spiked in the selected waters the selected waters were then treated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process in a batch system by addition of an o3 stock solution in addition although it has been suggested that the e peroxone process may provide an attractive alternative to the conventional peroxone process for aop applications yao et al 2016 2017 to date no studies have been actually conducted to compare their performance for pharmaceutical abatement therefore conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 treatment of these waters were also carried out under similar conditions in this study the results were evaluated based on the o3 stability o3 exposures oh yields and oh exposures observed during the treatments of the various water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents diclofenac gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid and p chlorobenzoic acid p cba with purity 98 potassium indigo trisulfonate 80 85 and h2o2 30 wt solution were purchased from sigma aldrich the properties of pharmaceuticals and p cba are listed in table 1 according to their second order reaction rate constants with o3 the pharmaceuticals were divided into three groups that is the o3 reactive diclofenac and gemfibrozil moderately o3 reactive bezafibrate and o3 resistant ibuprofen and clofibric acid lee et al 2013 other chemicals e g h2so4 and na2s2o3 were analytical grade and purchased from beijing chemical works co china all these chemicals were used as received without further purification all solutions e g stock solutions of ozone and pharmaceuticals were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω pharmaceutical stock solutions were stirred for two days to ensure the complete dissolution of all pharmaceuticals before use o3 was generated from a pure o2 feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada concentrated ozone stock solutions were then prepared by continuously bubbling the ozone containing oxygen gas through milli q water that was cooled in a water bath 15 c 2 2 sample collection and preparation three types of water samples were used in this study to evaluate the effect of water matrix on pharmaceutical abatement during the e peroxone process a groundwater a surface water from a reservoir and a secondary waste effluent from a wwtp in beijing after collection and primary sedimentation the supernatant was immediately stored in polytetrafluorethylene ptfe bottles in a refrigerator 4 c and then used within two weeks for the experiments the main water quality parameters of the three water matrices are summarized in table 2 the three waters had a conductivity between 272 and 857 μs cm 1 and were used directly in the e peroxone process without addition of any electrolytes the background concentrations of model pharmaceuticals in these waters were below the quantification limits of the applied analytical methods see supporting information si table s1 to better evaluate their abatement small volumes of pharmaceutical stock solutions were spiked into the three waters to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l 1 for each pharmaceutical in addition p cba 150 μg l 1 was also spiked into the waters as a oh probe note that the oh scavenging rate from the spiked p cba was 1 6 3 6 of the total scavenging rate of the three water matrices table 2 see si section s2 for more details therefore p cba would not significantly consume oh radicals and affect the abatement of the target compounds during treatment 2 3 conventional ozonation e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment to accurately control applied ozone doses batch tests of conventional ozonation conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices were conducted in a sealed glass column reactor 250 ml by addition of freshly prepared o3 stock solutions rather than by directly sparging o2 o3 gas mixtures as in the previous semi batch studies yao et al 2016 see si fig s1 for the schematic of the batch system approximately 220 ml of the selected water was added in the reactor appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were then dosed into the waters to achieve specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc to initiate the oxidations next sufficiently long reaction times were allowed for complete o3 depletion during each batch experiment with the varying specific ozone doses that is 0 17 30 min during conventional ozonation and 0 17 1 min during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment of the three waters see si table s2 during all experiments the reactor was placed in a water bath to maintain the temperature at 15 1 c all experiments were repeated twice for the e peroxone process a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a pt plate 2 2 cm2 and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluorethylene carbon ptfe electrode 2 5 cm2 that could produce h2o2 effectively from the reduction of dissolved o2 wang et al 2012 to initiate the e peroxone treatment a dc power supply was turned on to produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction while dosing the ozone stock solutions into the reactor based on the results of previous studies yao et al 2017 and preliminary tests a constant current of 30 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment with the applied current h2o2 could be electrochemically produced at a stable rate of 1 2 mg l 1 min 1 in the three waters see si fig s4 as a result 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 of h2o2 could be produced when complete o3 depletion was attained 0 17 1 min during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters see si table s2 for the conventional o3 h2o2 process appropriate quantities of h2o2 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 which were equivalent to the quantities of h2o2 electro generated during the e peroxone treatment of the various waters were added to the water matrices just before dosing the ozone stock solutions see si table s2 for detailed reaction conditions 2 4 analytical methods the content of dissolved organic matter dom in the three waters e g humic acids in natural water and effluent organic matter in secondary effluent was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu co japan ozone concentrations in the stock solutions were determined by direct uv absorbance at 258 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during water treatment by the different processes samples were collected from the reactor at an array of reaction times i e 0 0 17 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 5 10 15 20 and 30 min o3 concentrations in the collected samples were measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 h2o2 concentrations were measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 the instantaneous ozone demand iod i e the amount of ozone rapidly consumed in the initial phase of ozone decomposition in water matrix was calculated as the difference between the dosed o3 and dissolved o3 residual after 10 s of reaction wert et al 2007 zucker et al 2016 ozone exposures the concentration of dissolved ozone integrated over reaction time i e o 3 d t were obtained from the area under ozone decay curves bader and hoigne 1981 oh exposures the concentration of oh integrated over reaction time i e o h d t were back calculated from the abatement of p cba lee et al 2013 for pharmaceutical analysis the collected samples were immediately added with sodium thiosulfate to quench residual oxidants and then filtered through a 0 22 μm filter membrane pharmaceuticals in the samples were then directly analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system applied biosystems see si table s1 for more details of the method to evaluate the oh yield from o3 decomposition moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed during conventional ozonation the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 treatment of the various water matrices additional experiments were conducted by adding 20 mm t buoh to the water samples prior to each oxidative treatment this large excess of t buoh can quench practically all the oh formed in the systems nothe et al 2009 the reaction of t buoh with oh leads to the formation of formaldehyde whose yield can be measured spectrophotometrically by the hantzsch method nash 1953 the oh yield is twice the formaldehyde yield during the t buoh assay nothe et al 2009 tekle rottering et al 2016 see si for more discussion on the t buoh assay 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality parameters the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the three waters ranged from 1 2 to 6 2 mg l 1 table 2 and increased in the order of gw sw and se it was noticed that se had a considerably higher specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 to doc than sw and gw which indicates that the dissolved organic matter dom in se had significantly more uv254 absorbing moieties i e olefins and or aromatic structures per unit mass of doc than the dom in sw and gw in contrast gw had the highest alkalinity followed by se and sw the ph of the selected waters was in the range of 8 0 8 2 the overall oh scavenging rates in the three waters are calculated according to the typical second order rate constants reported for the reaction of oh with the major oh scavengers dom carbonate and ammonia buxton et al 1988 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as reported in table 2 the overall oh scavenging rates increase in the order of gw sw se see si section s2 for more calculation details in addition it was observed that dom constituted the dominant oh scavenger in sw and se whereas bicarbonate was the dominant oh scavenger in gw 3 2 ozone decrease ozone stability varied significantly in gw sw and se at equivalent specific o3 doses 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc complete ozone depletion was achieved in 0 2 5 min in se 3 20 min in sw and 10 30 min in gw during conventional ozonation see fig 1 and si fig s2 the distinct differences in o3 stability in the three water matrices can be mainly attributed to their differing dom and carbonate contents during ozonation dom can react directly with o3 and act as promoters of radical chain reactions to promote o3 decomposition staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast carbonate alkalinity has a stabilizing effect on o3 decomposition by scavenging oh and thus inhibiting the radical chain reactions therefore o3 stability usually increases with increasing carbonate and decreases with increasing doc of water matrix acero and von gunten 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consistent with this general finding o3 stability decreased in order of gw sw se the addition or electro generation of h2o2 dramatically accelerated the o3 decrease in gw and sw compared to conventional ozonation fig 1 and si fig s3 however a somewhat less significant acceleration of o3 decrease was observed in se upon the h2o2 addition or electro generation which can be mainly attributed to the fact that the dom in se already mostly controls the ozone decomposition von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the results presented above are in agreement with previous findings of conventional o3 h2o2 studies which indicate that the addition of h2o2 can enhance the kinetics of ozone decomposition in waters that have relatively high ozone stability acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 for a given water matrix more rapid o3 depletion was observed during the o3 h2o2 process than during the e peroxone process fig 1 and si fig s3 this difference can be attributed to the differing ways of h2o2 supplying during the two processes to compare the two processes under similar conditions equivalent h2o2 doses were added or electro generated during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatment of the various waters see si table s2 however h2o2 is continuously produced from cathodic o2 reduction at a rate of 1 25 mg l 1 of h2o2 per minute during the e peroxone treatment 30 ma of the three water matrices see si fig s4 in contrast appropriate quantities of h2o2 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 equivalent to the quantities of h2o2 electro generated in 10 60 s during the e peroxone process at 30 ma see si table s2 were added at once in the waters before dosing the o3 stock for the implementation of the o3 h2o2 process due to the higher initial h2o2 concentrations a more pronounced acceleration of o3 decomposition was observed immediately after the commencement of the o3 h2o2 process fig 1 and si fig s3 if h2o2 was gradually dosed instead of added at once during the conventional peroxone process we expect that similar performance would be achieved for the two processes li et al 2013 wang et al 2015b 3 3 oh yield from o3 decomposition during conventional ozonation of gw the oh yields moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed decreased considerably from 27 to 15 as the specific ozone doses were increased from 0 5 mg o3 mg doc to 1 5 mg o3 mg doc fig 2 a this change indicates that gw had insufficient oh generating moieties e g electron rich aromatic components to react with the dosed o3 as the specific ozone doses were progressively increased indeed the groundwater had a low suva value of 0 67 l mg 1 m 1 table 2 which suggests that the nom in the groundwater had a low fraction of electron rich aromatic components that can react with o3 to yield oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as the oh generating moieties were consumed upon reactions with o3 residual o3 would decompose mainly via non radical mechanism thus resulting in a decrease in the oh yields with increasing specific o3 doses von sonntag and von gunten 2012 note that due to the slow reaction of o3 with oh k 70 m 1 s 1 oh induced o3 decomposition to oh is usually insignificant at the typical ph values of drinking water and wastewater treatment ph 8 5 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for sw and se which had higher dom contents and thus probably more oh generating moieties the oh yields did not change significantly with increasing the specific ozone doses during conventional ozonation fig 2b and c in fact as the specific ozone doses were increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the oh yields increased slightly in se during conventional ozonation similar increases have been observed in previous studies on ozonation of municipal and hospital wastewater effluents and were attributed to the less significant relative consumption of o3 by non oh generating water constituents e g nitrite and dom with olefin moieties as the specific ozone doses increased lee et al 2013 2014 besides accelerating o3 depletion the addition or electro generation of h2o2 increased the oh yields to varied extents in the three water matrices during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 2 in all experiments similar oh yields were obtained during the conventional o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes and their oh yields were approximately 12 higher than those obtained during conventional ozonation conducted under similar conditions these observations suggest that the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone process can similarly enhance o3 transformation to oh in the various water matrices the most significant increases in the oh yields were observed in gw where the addition or electro generation of h2o2 increased the oh yield by 5 12 which represents relative increases of 17 85 compared to the oh yield obtained during conventional ozonation for the tested specific ozone dose range 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc fig 2a as discussed previously gw has insufficient oh generating moieties e g electron rich aromatics the addition or electro generation of h2o2 can therefore considerably enhance the transformation of o3 to oh in gw acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 this result indicates that for an equivalent ozone dose significantly more oh can be produced during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatment of gw compared to conventional ozonation in comparison the oh yields increased moderately by 5 7 relative increase of 26 40 in sw and almost negligibly 4 in se upon h2o2 addition or electro generation this difference can be probably attributed to the fact that the dom in se had significantly more uv absorbing moieties e g olefins and aromatic structures than the dom in gw and sw see table 2 many uv absorbing moieties are also ozone reactive moieties that can outcompete h2o2 for o3 during the initial stage of the o3 h2o2 or the e peroxone processes nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for example at the ph range 8 0 8 2 of the three water matrices the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of o3 with phenols and olefins are generally within 104 107 m 1 s 1 which are 1 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of o3 with h2o2 at the same ph range 1500 2400 m 1 s 1 calculated according to eq 3 hoigné and bader 1983 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 3 k obs k ho 2 o 3 10 ph pk a where k obs is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of h2o2 with o3 k h o 2 o 3 9 6 106 m 1 s 1 pka of h2o2 11 8 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore during the initial stage of the o3 h2o2 or the e peroxone processes o3 will react preferentially with these ozone reactive dom moieties over h2o2 and thus result in similar oh yields as conventional ozonation acero and von gunten 2001 nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 however when these ozone reactive dom moieties are largely consumed in the first few seconds residual o3 can then react with h2o2 to increase the oh yield during the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation acero and von gunten 2001 nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 yao et al 2017 as shown in si fig s5 for conventional ozonation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc 63 77 45 67 and 1 36 of the dosed o3 remained in gw sw and se respectively after the first 10 s i e the instantaneous ozone demand iod period with more residual o3 available to react with h2o2 larger increases in the oh yield can be obtained during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 wert et al 2007 yao et al 2017 this explains why the extent of enhancement in the oh yields during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes increased in order of se sw and gw and with increasing the specific ozone doses fig 2 3 4 o3 exposures and oh exposures the o3 exposures o 3 d t and oh exposures o h d t obtained after complete o3 depletion during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of gw sw and se are shown in fig 3 due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by the added or electro generated h2o2 significantly lower o3 exposures were obtained during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices compared to conventional ozonation in contrast oh exposures changed differently in the three water matrices upon h2o2 addition or electro generation during ozonation for gw the oh exposures increased evidently during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation especially when relatively high specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc were applied fig 3d for sw the oh exposures increased slightly upon adding or electro generating h2o2 during ozonation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 mg o3 mg doc fig 3e at a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the spiked p cba was abated to below its quantification limit in sw by all three processes see fig 4 therefore the same oh exposures were estimated for the three processes based on the quantifiable abatement efficiency of p cba during the treatments of se similar oh exposures were obtained for all three processes regardless of the addition or electro generation of h2o2 fig 3f overall the results shown in fig 3 are in good agreement with the previous findings from studies on conventional o3 h2o2 process that is the addition of h2o2 during ozonation can enhance oh exposures in waters having high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents but does not considerably affect oh exposures in waters having low ozone stability e g wastewater with high dom contents where the ozone depletion is controlled by the dom acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2007 2009 3 5 abatement of pharmaceuticals the abatement efficiencies of pharmaceuticals obtained after complete ozone depletion during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the three waters are calculated using eq 4 and compared in fig 4 the contribution of o3 oxidation and oh oxidation for pharmaceutical abatements are calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively using the o3 and oh exposures determined for the three processes see fig 5 and si fig s6 elovitz and von gunten 1999 lee et al 2014 note that due to the mass transfer limitation of micropollutants to the anode anode oxidation plays a negligible role in pharmaceutical abatement during the e peroxone process see si fig s7 and li et al 2014 lin et al 2016 yao et al 2016 4 a b a t e m e n t 1 c r c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of pharmaceutical and cr is the residual concentration of pharmaceutical after the treatment 5 6 ozone reactive pharmaceuticals diclofenac and gemfibrozil were completely abated in the various water matrices by all three processes even at the lowest specific ozone dose tested in this study 0 5 mg o3 mg doc with the only exception of gemfibrozil in se see fig 4 during all processes the direct oxidation with o3 contributed almost exclusively for the abatements of diclofenac and gemfibrozil while the oxidation by oh contributed negligibly fig 5 and si fig s6 further analysis shows that abatements of diclofenac and gemfibrozil d l could be obtained within the first 30 s when a specific ozone dose of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was applied in all three processes see si fig s8 therefore although o3 exposures had been significantly reduced during the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes high abatement efficiencies could still be obtained for diclofenac and gemfibrozil kovalova et al 2013 lee et al 2013 2014 yao et al 2016 these results indicate that ozone reactive pharmaceuticals can be efficiently abated in various water matrices at low ozone exposures and their abatements are not considerably influenced by the addition or electro generation of h2o2 for bezafibrate which has an intermediate reactivity with o3 specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc were required to achieve 90 abatement efficiencies in the three water matrices by conventional ozonation fig 4 moreover the addition and electro generation of h2o2 resulted in considerable decreases in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies in gw during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation but did not considerably affect its abatement in sw and se fig 5a and b shows that oxidation with o3 played a major role for bezafibrate abatement during conventional ozonation of gw and sw however due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by h2o2 the mechanism of bezafibrate abatement shifted from o3 oxidation during conventional ozonation to oh oxidation during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment for gw this change caused considerable decreases in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies fig 4 however no significant changes in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies were observed between conventional ozonation the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 treatment of sw these findings suggest that regarding bezafibrate abatement the decrease of o3 exposures cannot be sufficiently compensated by the increase of oh exposures during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of gw but can be more effectively compensated during the treatment of sw see si table s5 for more discussion fig 4 shows that similar abatement efficiencies of bezafibrate were obtained in se when an equivalent specific ozone dose was applied during the conventional ozonation the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes this observation can be probably attributed to the fact that bezafibrate is mainly abated via oh oxidation during se treatment fig 5 and si fig s6 and similar oh exposures were obtained during all processes fig 3 in contrast to ozone reactive pharmaceuticals ozone resistant pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and clofibric acid were oxidized almost exclusively by oh during conventional ozonation the e peroxone or the o3 h2o2 treatments of the three water matrices fig 5 and si fig s6 therefore corresponding to the oh exposures in the various water matrices figs 2 and 3 the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and clofibric acid increased most evidently in gw 14 18 increase at a specific o3 dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc but only moderately in sw 6 10 increase at 0 5 mg o3 mg doc and negligibly in se during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 these results indicate that the enhancements for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement that can be obtained by changing conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or the o3 h2o2 process are highly dependent on the water matrix in general more pronounced enhancements could be obtained in water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents than those with low ozone stability e g wastewater with high dom contents in agreement with the previous findings from studies on the conventional peroxone process acero and von gunten 2001 gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pocostales et al 2010 wert et al 2009 compared with the previous studies that used semi batch reactors with continuous o2 o3 sparging guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 2015a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 smaller enhancements were generally obtained for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement in this batch tests when conventional ozonation was changed to the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 process this difference indicates that the enhanced abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in the semi batch systems can be partly or even largely attributed to the enhanced o3 mass transfer from the sparged o2 o3 gas into the solution which has been neglected in the previous studies unlike the small reactors used in lab studies ozone transfer efficiency in real ozone reactors is typically high 70 95 during conventional ozonation von gunten et al 1996 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process will not considerably enhance ozone transfer efficiency in real ozone reactors as in the small semi batch reactors this finding highlights that to better evaluate the e peroxone process under more realistic operating conditions ozone mass transfer efficiency should be measured during semi batch tests with continuous o2 o3 sparging yao et al 2017 nevertheless it should also be noted that in this study sufficiently long reaction times were allowed for complete ozone depletion in all batch experiments in contrast complete ozone depletion may not be attained in real ozone reactors due to shorter hydraulic residence times employed in practical applications von gunten et al 1996 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for an equivalent transferred ozone dose a higher degree of ozone transformation may be obtained in real ozone reactors during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 processes than conventional ozonation due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by h2o2 li et al 2015b von gunten et al 1996 therefore more significant enhancements for ozone resistant compound abatements than what was observed in this study may be obtained in full scale operations if the process is changed from conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 processes pisarenko et al 2012 von gunten et al 1996 3 6 prediction of pharmaceutical abatements based on the determined o3 and oh exposures fig 3 and second order rate constants for the reactions of pharmaceuticals with o3 and oh table 1 the abatement efficiencies of pharmaceuticals were calculated using eq 7 lee et al 2014 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the three water matrices fig 6 7 the good correlations r2 0 97 0 99 between the measured and predicted abatement efficiencies shown in fig 6 indicate that this chemical kinetic model can satisfactorily predict the abatements of pharmaceuticals during the three ozone based processes including the e peroxone process as shown in fig 5 and si fig s6 ozone resistant pharmaceuticals were oxidized predominantly by oh during conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 or e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices therefore eq 7 can be further simplified to eq 8 to predict the abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals using only oh exposures measured with an oh probe such as p cba lee et al 2013 8 fig 7 shows that the measured abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and clofibric acid obtained during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment of the various water matrices were consistent with those predicted using eq 8 in real ozone contactors oh exposures can be back calculated from the abatement of ozone resistant compounds externally spiked p cba or naturally existing internal tracers chelme ayala et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 this suggests that eq 8 may provide a simple rule of thumb to predict the abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in practical applications once their second order rate constants with oh are known 3 7 implications the results presented above indicate that in general the e peroxone process performs similarly to the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process in water and wastewater treatment both processes can significantly enhance the kinetics of o3 decomposition to oh compared to conventional ozonation especially during the treatment of waters that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents in addition when applied o3 doses exceed the iod of water matrices the oh yield can be enhanced to some extent during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 processes compared to conventional ozonation overall more pronounced enhancements in the oh yields can be obtained in water matrices that have high ozone stability therefore similar to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process may provide a viable way to enhance ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water applications where groundwater and surface water with low dom contents are typically used as the source water acero et al 2001 acero and von gunten 2001 chelme ayala et al 2011 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 yao et al 2017 nevertheless for an equivalent applied ozone dose the change of conventional ozonation to the conventional peroxone or e peroxone processes may only be able to accelerate the kinetics of ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement but unable to considerably enhance their abatement efficiencies in wastewater treatment hubner et al 2015 lee et al 2014 pisarenko et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while conventional o3 h2o2 process has been intensively investigated as an ozone based aop for pharmaceutical abatement its practical application is less common in water and wastewater utilities hollender et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 at present h2o2 is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone oxidation process on an industrial scale and the market price for h2o2 is 1 2 1 5 usd kg barazesh et al 2015 campos martin et al 2006 therefore h2o2 is generally considered a costly chemical for water and wastewater treatment barazesh et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2011 rosenfeldt et al 2006 moreover due to its high reactivity the transportation and handling of concentrated h2o2 solutions are dangerous and require special care campos martin et al 2006 furthermore h2o2 stock solution may decay during storage leading to declined efficiency these factors have limited the use of h2o2 in some water and wastewater utilities barazesh et al 2015 in contrast to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 in situ using o2 that would otherwise be wasted in ozonation processes therefore the e peroxone process can avoid the risks and decay problems associated with the use of concentrated h2o2 stocks in conventional o3 h2o2 process the energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation in the three waters was 5 4 9 3 kwh kg h2o2 equivalent to 0 4 0 6 usd kg based on the electricity cost 0 065 usd kwh reported in rosenfeldt et al 2006 see si table s4 and can be possibly further reduced by optimizing the reactor configurations e g increasing the area of electrodes and decreasing the distance between the anode and cathode to reduce cell voltages for example it has been reported that h2o2 can be electrochemically produced from cathodic o2 reduction at a cost of 0 1 0 3 usd kg in a variety of water matrices groundwater surface water and secondary effluents with conductivity of 360 2040 μs cm barazesh et al 2015 in addition existing ozone reactors can be easily retrofitted for the e peroxone system by installing electrodes li et al 2015b many low cost carbon based electrodes e g carbon ptfe carbon brush activated carbon felt and graphite can be used as the cathode for h2o2 electro generation from o2 reduction during the e peroxone process bakheet et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 due to their good stability and chemical resistance carbon electrodes can be used for extended periods during water and wastewater treatment barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 2009 hou et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the carbon ptfe cathode used in this study exhibited high stability during multiple trials of the e peroxone treatment of the various waters in addition zhang et al 2016 reported that activated carbon felt acf cathodes maintained high reactivity after 100 cycles of the semi batch e peroxone treatment of nitrobenzene solutions barazesh et al 2015 also showed that the fouling of the carbon ptfe cathode by calcium carbonate scaling did not affect h2o2 electro generation over a 50 day test of water treatment by an electrochemically driven uv h2o2 process overall the results from the present and previous studies indicate that the e peroxone process may provide a more convenient economical and safer alternative to enhance pharmaceutical and other micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater applications compared to the conventional o3 h2o2 process 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that the water matrix has a significant effect on the benefits that can be obtained for pharmaceutical abatement by changing conventional ozonation to the conventional peroxone and e peroxone process in general the addition or the electro generation of h2o2 during ozonation can more pronouncedly enhance the kinetics and oh yields from o3 decomposition in water matrix that has high ozone stability e g groundwater with high alkalinity and low dom contents than those with low stability e g wastewater with high dom contents therefore more significant enhancement for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement can be generally obtained during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatments of groundwater and surface water than wastewater therefore both the conventional peroxone and e peroxone processes can provide a feasible way to improve the efficiency of existing ozonation systems for pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water treatment applications where groundwater and surface water with relatively low dom contents are used as the source water the e peroxone process may represent a more attractive option due to its more convenient and safer way to provide h2o2 for implementation of advanced oxidation applications

groundwater gw surface water sw and secondary effluent se by conventional ozonation the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 and the electro peroxone e peroxone processes was compared in batch tests se had significantly more fast reacting dissolved organic matter dom moieties than gw and sw therefore o3 decomposed much faster in se than in gw and sw at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc the application of o3 h2o2 and e peroxone process by adding external h2o2 stocks or in situ generating h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction during ozonation similarly enhanced the oh yield from o3 decomposition by 5 12 and 5 7 in gw and sw respectively compared to conventional ozonation in contrast due to the slower reaction kinetics of o3 with h2o2 than o3 with fast reacting dom moieties the addition or electro generation of h2o2 hardly increased the oh yield 4 increases in se corresponding to the changes in the oh yields the abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant

during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment compared to conventional ozonation these results indicate that similar to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process can more pronouncedly enhance o3 transformation to oh and thus increase the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in water matrices exerting relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface

applications where groundwater and surface water with low dom contents are used as the source waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process hydrogen peroxide micropollutant ozonation water matrix 1 introduction the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has raised increasing international concern michael et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 ternes and joss 2006 ternes 1998 although most pharmaceuticals are typically present at trace levels e g ng l 1 μg l 1 their complex mixtures can pose a potential threat to ecosystems and or human health secondary effluents discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been identified as a major source for pharmaceuticals in the water environment eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 lee et al 2013 michael et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011 to protect the ecosystems advanced wastewater treatment e g ozonation and activated carbon adsorption are increasingly employed to abate pharmaceuticals from secondary effluents hollender et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 moreover while most pharmaceuticals may not pose considerable threats to human health at typical concentrations found in waters their presence can still arouse a concern to many individuals therefore when surface water and groundwater contaminated with pharmaceuticals are used as potable water sources effective drinking water treatments are desired to abate pharmaceuticals in water utilities acero et al 2000 acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone o3 is a commonly used disinfectant and oxidant in water and wastewater treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during conventional ozonation micropollutants can be oxidized by o3 and or by hydroxyl radicals oh that are generated from o3 decomposition in real water matrices von sonntag and von gunten 2012 o3 is a selective oxidant and reacts preferentially with organics that have olefins activated aromatic systems or amines whereas oh is a less selective oxidant and reacts rapidly with almost all types of organic moieties a great number of studies have demonstrated that many pharmaceuticals are ozone reactive and can therefore be efficiently abated from various water matrices e g groundwater surface water and wastewater by conventional ozonation with low specific ozone doses e g 0 25 0 5 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc gerrity et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 kovalova et al 2013 lee et al 2013 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 zucker et al 2016 however there are also many ozone resistant pharmaceuticals that can only be oxidized by oh and are therefore less efficiently abated during conventional ozonation the electro peroxone e peroxone process is a new electrochemically driven advanced oxidation process aop that combines conventional ozonation with in situ h2o2 production from electrochemical oxygen o2 reduction eq 1 at carbon based cathodes yuan et al 2013 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 during the e peroxone process o3 is generated from an o2 feed gas using ozone generators which is the same as in conventional ozonation because ozone generators can convert only a small fraction of the o2 feed gas to o3 ozone generator effluents o2 o3 gas mixtures that are sparged into ozone reactors are still composed of predominantly o2 usually 90 v v von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this part of o2 has little use for pollutant abatement and is therefore wasted during conventional ozonation however it provides an ideal o2 source for cathodic h2o2 production during the e peroxone process xia et al 2017 yuan et al 2013 the in situ generated h2o2 can considerably accelerate the transformation of o3 to oh eq 2 simplified according to fischbacher et al 2013 and von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus enhance the abatement kinetics of ozone resistant pollutants wang et al 2015a yao et al 2017 yao et al 2016 2 2h2o2 2o3 h2o 3o2 ho2 oh in addition the reaction of o3 with h2o2 can produce oh with a yield of 50 i e 0 5 mol of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed which is generally higher than those from o3 decomposition with electron rich components of dissolved organic matter dom in real water matrices e g 24 43 for phenols 8 17 for alkoxybenzenes and 15 for tertiary amines flyunt et al 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore it has been hypothesized that for a given applied ozone dose more oh can be produced to enhance the abatement efficiency of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals during the e peroxone process than conventional ozonation however this hypothesis has not been well evaluated in previous studies several studies have compared pharmaceutical abatement by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process and the results indicate that enhanced abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals can be obtained in the e peroxone process guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 2015a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 nevertheless all the previous studies employed small semi batch reactors volume 1 l with continuous o2 o3 gas sparging but did not measure the transferred ozone doses i e the ozone doses dissolved from the sparged o2 o3 gas to the liquid and the oh yields moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed due to the small reactors used in the previous studies ozone transfer efficiency is expected to be quite low during conventional ozonation and can be considerably enhanced in the presence of h2o2 during the e peroxone process e g enhanced o3 transfer efficiency from 16 to 31 was observed in a recent study using similar small semi batch reactors yao et al 2017 therefore it is inferred that higher ozone doses were actually applied during the e peroxone process than during conventional ozonation in the previous studies as a result it remains unclear whether the enhanced abatements of pharmaceuticals are mainly caused by the higher transferred ozone doses or the increased oh yield from a given transferred o3 dose during the e peroxone process this is a critical question when evaluating the cost effectiveness of ozone based processes because the energy consumption of water treatment is directly related to applied ozone doses hollender et al 2009 katsoyiannis et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 moreover high concentration pharmaceutical solutions e g 20 100 mg l ibuprofen and amoxicillin were used in most previous studies mainly to evaluate the effectiveness of the e peroxone process and to reveal the degradation pathways of pharmaceuticals guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 wu et al 2017 in contrast pharmaceuticals are typically present at several orders of magnitude lower concentrations ng μg l than the background constituents e g natural organic matter and inorganic salts of real water matrix e g groundwater surface water and wastewater these water matrix constituents can significantly influence the micropollutant abatement during ozone based processes acero et al 2001 acero and von gunten 2001 huber et al 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it has often been shown that the addition of h2o2 during ozonation i e the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process can considerably enhance the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants in groundwater but less significantly or even negligibly in surface water and wastewater acero and von gunten 2001 huber et al 2003 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 how the water matrix would affect pharmaceutical abatement by the e peroxone process has yet to be evaluated the main objective of this study was to compare the abatement of pharmaceuticals in real water matrices groundwater surface water and municipal secondary effluent by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process several pharmaceuticals with differing reactivities with o3 k o3 ranging from 10 to 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 were selected as model compounds and spiked in the selected waters the selected waters were then treated by conventional ozonation and the e peroxone process in a batch system by addition of an o3 stock solution in addition although it has been suggested that the e peroxone process may provide an attractive alternative to the conventional peroxone process for aop applications yao et al 2016 2017 to date no studies have been actually conducted to compare their performance for pharmaceutical abatement therefore conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 treatment of these waters were also carried out under similar conditions in this study the results were evaluated based on the o3 stability o3 exposures oh yields and oh exposures observed during the treatments of the various water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents diclofenac gemfibrozil bezafibrate ibuprofen clofibric acid and p chlorobenzoic acid p cba with purity 98 potassium indigo trisulfonate 80 85 and h2o2 30 wt solution were purchased from sigma aldrich the properties of pharmaceuticals and p cba are listed in table 1 according to their second order reaction rate constants with o3 the pharmaceuticals were divided into three groups that is the o3 reactive diclofenac and gemfibrozil moderately o3 reactive bezafibrate and o3 resistant ibuprofen and clofibric acid lee et al 2013 other chemicals e g h2so4 and na2s2o3 were analytical grade and purchased from beijing chemical works co china all these chemicals were used as received without further purification all solutions e g stock solutions of ozone and pharmaceuticals were prepared with milli q ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω pharmaceutical stock solutions were stirred for two days to ensure the complete dissolution of all pharmaceuticals before use o3 was generated from a pure o2 feed gas 99 9 using an ozone generator ol80f dst ozone services canada concentrated ozone stock solutions were then prepared by continuously bubbling the ozone containing oxygen gas through milli q water that was cooled in a water bath 15 c 2 2 sample collection and preparation three types of water samples were used in this study to evaluate the effect of water matrix on pharmaceutical abatement during the e peroxone process a groundwater a surface water from a reservoir and a secondary waste effluent from a wwtp in beijing after collection and primary sedimentation the supernatant was immediately stored in polytetrafluorethylene ptfe bottles in a refrigerator 4 c and then used within two weeks for the experiments the main water quality parameters of the three water matrices are summarized in table 2 the three waters had a conductivity between 272 and 857 μs cm 1 and were used directly in the e peroxone process without addition of any electrolytes the background concentrations of model pharmaceuticals in these waters were below the quantification limits of the applied analytical methods see supporting information si table s1 to better evaluate their abatement small volumes of pharmaceutical stock solutions were spiked into the three waters to achieve an initial concentration of 150 μg l 1 for each pharmaceutical in addition p cba 150 μg l 1 was also spiked into the waters as a oh probe note that the oh scavenging rate from the spiked p cba was 1 6 3 6 of the total scavenging rate of the three water matrices table 2 see si section s2 for more details therefore p cba would not significantly consume oh radicals and affect the abatement of the target compounds during treatment 2 3 conventional ozonation e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment to accurately control applied ozone doses batch tests of conventional ozonation conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices were conducted in a sealed glass column reactor 250 ml by addition of freshly prepared o3 stock solutions rather than by directly sparging o2 o3 gas mixtures as in the previous semi batch studies yao et al 2016 see si fig s1 for the schematic of the batch system approximately 220 ml of the selected water was added in the reactor appropriate volumes of freshly prepared ozone stock solutions were then dosed into the waters to achieve specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc to initiate the oxidations next sufficiently long reaction times were allowed for complete o3 depletion during each batch experiment with the varying specific ozone doses that is 0 17 30 min during conventional ozonation and 0 17 1 min during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment of the three waters see si table s2 during all experiments the reactor was placed in a water bath to maintain the temperature at 15 1 c all experiments were repeated twice for the e peroxone process a pair of electrodes was installed in the reactor the anode was a pt plate 2 2 cm2 and the cathode was a carbon polytetrafluorethylene carbon ptfe electrode 2 5 cm2 that could produce h2o2 effectively from the reduction of dissolved o2 wang et al 2012 to initiate the e peroxone treatment a dc power supply was turned on to produce h2o2 from cathodic o2 reduction while dosing the ozone stock solutions into the reactor based on the results of previous studies yao et al 2017 and preliminary tests a constant current of 30 ma was applied during the e peroxone treatment with the applied current h2o2 could be electrochemically produced at a stable rate of 1 2 mg l 1 min 1 in the three waters see si fig s4 as a result 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 of h2o2 could be produced when complete o3 depletion was attained 0 17 1 min during the e peroxone treatment of the three waters see si table s2 for the conventional o3 h2o2 process appropriate quantities of h2o2 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 which were equivalent to the quantities of h2o2 electro generated during the e peroxone treatment of the various waters were added to the water matrices just before dosing the ozone stock solutions see si table s2 for detailed reaction conditions 2 4 analytical methods the content of dissolved organic matter dom in the three waters e g humic acids in natural water and effluent organic matter in secondary effluent was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu co japan ozone concentrations in the stock solutions were determined by direct uv absorbance at 258 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during water treatment by the different processes samples were collected from the reactor at an array of reaction times i e 0 0 17 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 5 10 15 20 and 30 min o3 concentrations in the collected samples were measured with the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 h2o2 concentrations were measured using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 the instantaneous ozone demand iod i e the amount of ozone rapidly consumed in the initial phase of ozone decomposition in water matrix was calculated as the difference between the dosed o3 and dissolved o3 residual after 10 s of reaction wert et al 2007 zucker et al 2016 ozone exposures the concentration of dissolved ozone integrated over reaction time i e o 3 d t were obtained from the area under ozone decay curves bader and hoigne 1981 oh exposures the concentration of oh integrated over reaction time i e o h d t were back calculated from the abatement of p cba lee et al 2013 for pharmaceutical analysis the collected samples were immediately added with sodium thiosulfate to quench residual oxidants and then filtered through a 0 22 μm filter membrane pharmaceuticals in the samples were then directly analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system applied biosystems see si table s1 for more details of the method to evaluate the oh yield from o3 decomposition moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed during conventional ozonation the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 treatment of the various water matrices additional experiments were conducted by adding 20 mm t buoh to the water samples prior to each oxidative treatment this large excess of t buoh can quench practically all the oh formed in the systems nothe et al 2009 the reaction of t buoh with oh leads to the formation of formaldehyde whose yield can be measured spectrophotometrically by the hantzsch method nash 1953 the oh yield is twice the formaldehyde yield during the t buoh assay nothe et al 2009 tekle rottering et al 2016 see si for more discussion on the t buoh assay 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality parameters the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the three waters ranged from 1 2 to 6 2 mg l 1 table 2 and increased in the order of gw sw and se it was noticed that se had a considerably higher specific ultraviolet absorbance suva i e the ratio of uv254 to doc than sw and gw which indicates that the dissolved organic matter dom in se had significantly more uv254 absorbing moieties i e olefins and or aromatic structures per unit mass of doc than the dom in sw and gw in contrast gw had the highest alkalinity followed by se and sw the ph of the selected waters was in the range of 8 0 8 2 the overall oh scavenging rates in the three waters are calculated according to the typical second order rate constants reported for the reaction of oh with the major oh scavengers dom carbonate and ammonia buxton et al 1988 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as reported in table 2 the overall oh scavenging rates increase in the order of gw sw se see si section s2 for more calculation details in addition it was observed that dom constituted the dominant oh scavenger in sw and se whereas bicarbonate was the dominant oh scavenger in gw 3 2 ozone decrease ozone stability varied significantly in gw sw and se at equivalent specific o3 doses 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc complete ozone depletion was achieved in 0 2 5 min in se 3 20 min in sw and 10 30 min in gw during conventional ozonation see fig 1 and si fig s2 the distinct differences in o3 stability in the three water matrices can be mainly attributed to their differing dom and carbonate contents during ozonation dom can react directly with o3 and act as promoters of radical chain reactions to promote o3 decomposition staehelin and hoigne 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in contrast carbonate alkalinity has a stabilizing effect on o3 decomposition by scavenging oh and thus inhibiting the radical chain reactions therefore o3 stability usually increases with increasing carbonate and decreases with increasing doc of water matrix acero and von gunten 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consistent with this general finding o3 stability decreased in order of gw sw se the addition or electro generation of h2o2 dramatically accelerated the o3 decrease in gw and sw compared to conventional ozonation fig 1 and si fig s3 however a somewhat less significant acceleration of o3 decrease was observed in se upon the h2o2 addition or electro generation which can be mainly attributed to the fact that the dom in se already mostly controls the ozone decomposition von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the results presented above are in agreement with previous findings of conventional o3 h2o2 studies which indicate that the addition of h2o2 can enhance the kinetics of ozone decomposition in waters that have relatively high ozone stability acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 for a given water matrix more rapid o3 depletion was observed during the o3 h2o2 process than during the e peroxone process fig 1 and si fig s3 this difference can be attributed to the differing ways of h2o2 supplying during the two processes to compare the two processes under similar conditions equivalent h2o2 doses were added or electro generated during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatment of the various waters see si table s2 however h2o2 is continuously produced from cathodic o2 reduction at a rate of 1 25 mg l 1 of h2o2 per minute during the e peroxone treatment 30 ma of the three water matrices see si fig s4 in contrast appropriate quantities of h2o2 0 26 1 25 mg l 1 equivalent to the quantities of h2o2 electro generated in 10 60 s during the e peroxone process at 30 ma see si table s2 were added at once in the waters before dosing the o3 stock for the implementation of the o3 h2o2 process due to the higher initial h2o2 concentrations a more pronounced acceleration of o3 decomposition was observed immediately after the commencement of the o3 h2o2 process fig 1 and si fig s3 if h2o2 was gradually dosed instead of added at once during the conventional peroxone process we expect that similar performance would be achieved for the two processes li et al 2013 wang et al 2015b 3 3 oh yield from o3 decomposition during conventional ozonation of gw the oh yields moles of oh produced per mole of o3 consumed decreased considerably from 27 to 15 as the specific ozone doses were increased from 0 5 mg o3 mg doc to 1 5 mg o3 mg doc fig 2 a this change indicates that gw had insufficient oh generating moieties e g electron rich aromatic components to react with the dosed o3 as the specific ozone doses were progressively increased indeed the groundwater had a low suva value of 0 67 l mg 1 m 1 table 2 which suggests that the nom in the groundwater had a low fraction of electron rich aromatic components that can react with o3 to yield oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as the oh generating moieties were consumed upon reactions with o3 residual o3 would decompose mainly via non radical mechanism thus resulting in a decrease in the oh yields with increasing specific o3 doses von sonntag and von gunten 2012 note that due to the slow reaction of o3 with oh k 70 m 1 s 1 oh induced o3 decomposition to oh is usually insignificant at the typical ph values of drinking water and wastewater treatment ph 8 5 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for sw and se which had higher dom contents and thus probably more oh generating moieties the oh yields did not change significantly with increasing the specific ozone doses during conventional ozonation fig 2b and c in fact as the specific ozone doses were increased from 0 5 to 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the oh yields increased slightly in se during conventional ozonation similar increases have been observed in previous studies on ozonation of municipal and hospital wastewater effluents and were attributed to the less significant relative consumption of o3 by non oh generating water constituents e g nitrite and dom with olefin moieties as the specific ozone doses increased lee et al 2013 2014 besides accelerating o3 depletion the addition or electro generation of h2o2 increased the oh yields to varied extents in the three water matrices during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 2 in all experiments similar oh yields were obtained during the conventional o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes and their oh yields were approximately 12 higher than those obtained during conventional ozonation conducted under similar conditions these observations suggest that the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone process can similarly enhance o3 transformation to oh in the various water matrices the most significant increases in the oh yields were observed in gw where the addition or electro generation of h2o2 increased the oh yield by 5 12 which represents relative increases of 17 85 compared to the oh yield obtained during conventional ozonation for the tested specific ozone dose range 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc fig 2a as discussed previously gw has insufficient oh generating moieties e g electron rich aromatics the addition or electro generation of h2o2 can therefore considerably enhance the transformation of o3 to oh in gw acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 this result indicates that for an equivalent ozone dose significantly more oh can be produced during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatment of gw compared to conventional ozonation in comparison the oh yields increased moderately by 5 7 relative increase of 26 40 in sw and almost negligibly 4 in se upon h2o2 addition or electro generation this difference can be probably attributed to the fact that the dom in se had significantly more uv absorbing moieties e g olefins and aromatic structures than the dom in gw and sw see table 2 many uv absorbing moieties are also ozone reactive moieties that can outcompete h2o2 for o3 during the initial stage of the o3 h2o2 or the e peroxone processes nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for example at the ph range 8 0 8 2 of the three water matrices the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of o3 with phenols and olefins are generally within 104 107 m 1 s 1 which are 1 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of o3 with h2o2 at the same ph range 1500 2400 m 1 s 1 calculated according to eq 3 hoigné and bader 1983 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 3 k obs k ho 2 o 3 10 ph pk a where k obs is the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction of h2o2 with o3 k h o 2 o 3 9 6 106 m 1 s 1 pka of h2o2 11 8 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore during the initial stage of the o3 h2o2 or the e peroxone processes o3 will react preferentially with these ozone reactive dom moieties over h2o2 and thus result in similar oh yields as conventional ozonation acero and von gunten 2001 nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 however when these ozone reactive dom moieties are largely consumed in the first few seconds residual o3 can then react with h2o2 to increase the oh yield during the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation acero and von gunten 2001 nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 yao et al 2017 as shown in si fig s5 for conventional ozonation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 5 mg o3 mg doc 63 77 45 67 and 1 36 of the dosed o3 remained in gw sw and se respectively after the first 10 s i e the instantaneous ozone demand iod period with more residual o3 available to react with h2o2 larger increases in the oh yield can be obtained during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation nothe et al 2009 pocostales et al 2010 wert et al 2007 yao et al 2017 this explains why the extent of enhancement in the oh yields during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes increased in order of se sw and gw and with increasing the specific ozone doses fig 2 3 4 o3 exposures and oh exposures the o3 exposures o 3 d t and oh exposures o h d t obtained after complete o3 depletion during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of gw sw and se are shown in fig 3 due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by the added or electro generated h2o2 significantly lower o3 exposures were obtained during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices compared to conventional ozonation in contrast oh exposures changed differently in the three water matrices upon h2o2 addition or electro generation during ozonation for gw the oh exposures increased evidently during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation especially when relatively high specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc were applied fig 3d for sw the oh exposures increased slightly upon adding or electro generating h2o2 during ozonation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 mg o3 mg doc fig 3e at a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the spiked p cba was abated to below its quantification limit in sw by all three processes see fig 4 therefore the same oh exposures were estimated for the three processes based on the quantifiable abatement efficiency of p cba during the treatments of se similar oh exposures were obtained for all three processes regardless of the addition or electro generation of h2o2 fig 3f overall the results shown in fig 3 are in good agreement with the previous findings from studies on conventional o3 h2o2 process that is the addition of h2o2 during ozonation can enhance oh exposures in waters having high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents but does not considerably affect oh exposures in waters having low ozone stability e g wastewater with high dom contents where the ozone depletion is controlled by the dom acero and von gunten 2001 pisarenko et al 2012 pocostales et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2007 2009 3 5 abatement of pharmaceuticals the abatement efficiencies of pharmaceuticals obtained after complete ozone depletion during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the three waters are calculated using eq 4 and compared in fig 4 the contribution of o3 oxidation and oh oxidation for pharmaceutical abatements are calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively using the o3 and oh exposures determined for the three processes see fig 5 and si fig s6 elovitz and von gunten 1999 lee et al 2014 note that due to the mass transfer limitation of micropollutants to the anode anode oxidation plays a negligible role in pharmaceutical abatement during the e peroxone process see si fig s7 and li et al 2014 lin et al 2016 yao et al 2016 4 a b a t e m e n t 1 c r c 0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of pharmaceutical and cr is the residual concentration of pharmaceutical after the treatment 5 6 ozone reactive pharmaceuticals diclofenac and gemfibrozil were completely abated in the various water matrices by all three processes even at the lowest specific ozone dose tested in this study 0 5 mg o3 mg doc with the only exception of gemfibrozil in se see fig 4 during all processes the direct oxidation with o3 contributed almost exclusively for the abatements of diclofenac and gemfibrozil while the oxidation by oh contributed negligibly fig 5 and si fig s6 further analysis shows that abatements of diclofenac and gemfibrozil d l could be obtained within the first 30 s when a specific ozone dose of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was applied in all three processes see si fig s8 therefore although o3 exposures had been significantly reduced during the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes high abatement efficiencies could still be obtained for diclofenac and gemfibrozil kovalova et al 2013 lee et al 2013 2014 yao et al 2016 these results indicate that ozone reactive pharmaceuticals can be efficiently abated in various water matrices at low ozone exposures and their abatements are not considerably influenced by the addition or electro generation of h2o2 for bezafibrate which has an intermediate reactivity with o3 specific ozone doses 1 0 mg o3 mg doc were required to achieve 90 abatement efficiencies in the three water matrices by conventional ozonation fig 4 moreover the addition and electro generation of h2o2 resulted in considerable decreases in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies in gw during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation but did not considerably affect its abatement in sw and se fig 5a and b shows that oxidation with o3 played a major role for bezafibrate abatement during conventional ozonation of gw and sw however due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by h2o2 the mechanism of bezafibrate abatement shifted from o3 oxidation during conventional ozonation to oh oxidation during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment for gw this change caused considerable decreases in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies fig 4 however no significant changes in bezafibrate abatement efficiencies were observed between conventional ozonation the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 treatment of sw these findings suggest that regarding bezafibrate abatement the decrease of o3 exposures cannot be sufficiently compensated by the increase of oh exposures during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of gw but can be more effectively compensated during the treatment of sw see si table s5 for more discussion fig 4 shows that similar abatement efficiencies of bezafibrate were obtained in se when an equivalent specific ozone dose was applied during the conventional ozonation the o3 h2o2 and the e peroxone processes this observation can be probably attributed to the fact that bezafibrate is mainly abated via oh oxidation during se treatment fig 5 and si fig s6 and similar oh exposures were obtained during all processes fig 3 in contrast to ozone reactive pharmaceuticals ozone resistant pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and clofibric acid were oxidized almost exclusively by oh during conventional ozonation the e peroxone or the o3 h2o2 treatments of the three water matrices fig 5 and si fig s6 therefore corresponding to the oh exposures in the various water matrices figs 2 and 3 the abatement efficiencies of ibuprofen and clofibric acid increased most evidently in gw 14 18 increase at a specific o3 dose of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc but only moderately in sw 6 10 increase at 0 5 mg o3 mg doc and negligibly in se during the o3 h2o2 and e peroxone processes compared to conventional ozonation fig 4 these results indicate that the enhancements for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement that can be obtained by changing conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or the o3 h2o2 process are highly dependent on the water matrix in general more pronounced enhancements could be obtained in water matrices that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents than those with low ozone stability e g wastewater with high dom contents in agreement with the previous findings from studies on the conventional peroxone process acero and von gunten 2001 gerrity et al 2011 huber et al 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pocostales et al 2010 wert et al 2009 compared with the previous studies that used semi batch reactors with continuous o2 o3 sparging guo et al 2015 li et al 2014 2015a wu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 smaller enhancements were generally obtained for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement in this batch tests when conventional ozonation was changed to the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 process this difference indicates that the enhanced abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in the semi batch systems can be partly or even largely attributed to the enhanced o3 mass transfer from the sparged o2 o3 gas into the solution which has been neglected in the previous studies unlike the small reactors used in lab studies ozone transfer efficiency in real ozone reactors is typically high 70 95 during conventional ozonation von gunten et al 1996 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 therefore the change of conventional ozonation to the e peroxone process will not considerably enhance ozone transfer efficiency in real ozone reactors as in the small semi batch reactors this finding highlights that to better evaluate the e peroxone process under more realistic operating conditions ozone mass transfer efficiency should be measured during semi batch tests with continuous o2 o3 sparging yao et al 2017 nevertheless it should also be noted that in this study sufficiently long reaction times were allowed for complete ozone depletion in all batch experiments in contrast complete ozone depletion may not be attained in real ozone reactors due to shorter hydraulic residence times employed in practical applications von gunten et al 1996 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for an equivalent transferred ozone dose a higher degree of ozone transformation may be obtained in real ozone reactors during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 processes than conventional ozonation due to the acceleration of o3 decomposition by h2o2 li et al 2015b von gunten et al 1996 therefore more significant enhancements for ozone resistant compound abatements than what was observed in this study may be obtained in full scale operations if the process is changed from conventional ozonation to the e peroxone or o3 h2o2 processes pisarenko et al 2012 von gunten et al 1996 3 6 prediction of pharmaceutical abatements based on the determined o3 and oh exposures fig 3 and second order rate constants for the reactions of pharmaceuticals with o3 and oh table 1 the abatement efficiencies of pharmaceuticals were calculated using eq 7 lee et al 2014 and compared to their experimentally measured abatement efficiencies during the conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 and e peroxone treatment of the three water matrices fig 6 7 the good correlations r2 0 97 0 99 between the measured and predicted abatement efficiencies shown in fig 6 indicate that this chemical kinetic model can satisfactorily predict the abatements of pharmaceuticals during the three ozone based processes including the e peroxone process as shown in fig 5 and si fig s6 ozone resistant pharmaceuticals were oxidized predominantly by oh during conventional ozonation o3 h2o2 or e peroxone treatment of the various water matrices therefore eq 7 can be further simplified to eq 8 to predict the abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals using only oh exposures measured with an oh probe such as p cba lee et al 2013 8 fig 7 shows that the measured abatement efficiencies of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals ibuprofen and clofibric acid obtained during conventional ozonation the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 treatment of the various water matrices were consistent with those predicted using eq 8 in real ozone contactors oh exposures can be back calculated from the abatement of ozone resistant compounds externally spiked p cba or naturally existing internal tracers chelme ayala et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 this suggests that eq 8 may provide a simple rule of thumb to predict the abatement of ozone resistant pharmaceuticals in practical applications once their second order rate constants with oh are known 3 7 implications the results presented above indicate that in general the e peroxone process performs similarly to the conventional peroxone o3 h2o2 process in water and wastewater treatment both processes can significantly enhance the kinetics of o3 decomposition to oh compared to conventional ozonation especially during the treatment of waters that have relatively high ozone stability e g groundwater and surface water with low dom contents in addition when applied o3 doses exceed the iod of water matrices the oh yield can be enhanced to some extent during the e peroxone and o3 h2o2 processes compared to conventional ozonation overall more pronounced enhancements in the oh yields can be obtained in water matrices that have high ozone stability therefore similar to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process may provide a viable way to enhance ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water applications where groundwater and surface water with low dom contents are typically used as the source water acero et al 2001 acero and von gunten 2001 chelme ayala et al 2011 katsoyiannis et al 2011 pisarenko et al 2012 yao et al 2017 nevertheless for an equivalent applied ozone dose the change of conventional ozonation to the conventional peroxone or e peroxone processes may only be able to accelerate the kinetics of ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement but unable to considerably enhance their abatement efficiencies in wastewater treatment hubner et al 2015 lee et al 2014 pisarenko et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while conventional o3 h2o2 process has been intensively investigated as an ozone based aop for pharmaceutical abatement its practical application is less common in water and wastewater utilities hollender et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 at present h2o2 is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone oxidation process on an industrial scale and the market price for h2o2 is 1 2 1 5 usd kg barazesh et al 2015 campos martin et al 2006 therefore h2o2 is generally considered a costly chemical for water and wastewater treatment barazesh et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2011 rosenfeldt et al 2006 moreover due to its high reactivity the transportation and handling of concentrated h2o2 solutions are dangerous and require special care campos martin et al 2006 furthermore h2o2 stock solution may decay during storage leading to declined efficiency these factors have limited the use of h2o2 in some water and wastewater utilities barazesh et al 2015 in contrast to the conventional o3 h2o2 process the e peroxone process can produce h2o2 in situ using o2 that would otherwise be wasted in ozonation processes therefore the e peroxone process can avoid the risks and decay problems associated with the use of concentrated h2o2 stocks in conventional o3 h2o2 process the energy consumption for h2o2 electro generation in the three waters was 5 4 9 3 kwh kg h2o2 equivalent to 0 4 0 6 usd kg based on the electricity cost 0 065 usd kwh reported in rosenfeldt et al 2006 see si table s4 and can be possibly further reduced by optimizing the reactor configurations e g increasing the area of electrodes and decreasing the distance between the anode and cathode to reduce cell voltages for example it has been reported that h2o2 can be electrochemically produced from cathodic o2 reduction at a cost of 0 1 0 3 usd kg in a variety of water matrices groundwater surface water and secondary effluents with conductivity of 360 2040 μs cm barazesh et al 2015 in addition existing ozone reactors can be easily retrofitted for the e peroxone system by installing electrodes li et al 2015b many low cost carbon based electrodes e g carbon ptfe carbon brush activated carbon felt and graphite can be used as the cathode for h2o2 electro generation from o2 reduction during the e peroxone process bakheet et al 2013 hou et al 2016 xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 due to their good stability and chemical resistance carbon electrodes can be used for extended periods during water and wastewater treatment barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 2009 hou et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the carbon ptfe cathode used in this study exhibited high stability during multiple trials of the e peroxone treatment of the various waters in addition zhang et al 2016 reported that activated carbon felt acf cathodes maintained high reactivity after 100 cycles of the semi batch e peroxone treatment of nitrobenzene solutions barazesh et al 2015 also showed that the fouling of the carbon ptfe cathode by calcium carbonate scaling did not affect h2o2 electro generation over a 50 day test of water treatment by an electrochemically driven uv h2o2 process overall the results from the present and previous studies indicate that the e peroxone process may provide a more convenient economical and safer alternative to enhance pharmaceutical and other micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater applications compared to the conventional o3 h2o2 process 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that the water matrix has a significant effect on the benefits that can be obtained for pharmaceutical abatement by changing conventional ozonation to the conventional peroxone and e peroxone process in general the addition or the electro generation of h2o2 during ozonation can more pronouncedly enhance the kinetics and oh yields from o3 decomposition in water matrix that has high ozone stability e g groundwater with high alkalinity and low dom contents than those with low stability e g wastewater with high dom contents therefore more significant enhancement for ozone resistant pharmaceutical abatement can be generally obtained during the conventional peroxone and e peroxone treatments of groundwater and surface water than wastewater therefore both the conventional peroxone and e peroxone processes can provide a feasible way to improve the efficiency of existing ozonation systems for pharmaceutical abatement in drinking water treatment applications where groundwater and surface water with relatively low dom contents are used as the source water the e peroxone process may represent a more attractive option due to its more convenient and safer way to provide h2o2 for implementation of advanced oxidation applications

19807,antibiotic resistance genes args are an emerging concern in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as dissemination of args can pose a serious risk to human health few studies however have quantified args in membrane bioreactors mbrs although mbrs have been widely used for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment to reveal the capacity of mbrs for removal of args and the response of membrane fouling after antibiotic exposure five typical arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea and int1 were quantified affiliated by systematic membrane foulants analysis in a laboratory scale anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor a o mbr sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline hydrochloride additions increased arg abundances by 0 5 1 4 orders of magnitude in the activated sludge while the arg removal performance of the membrane module remained stable or even increased with arg absolute abundance in several cases with the abundance of removed args ranging from 0 6 to 5 6 orders of magnitude specifically the distribution of args in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested mbr samples indeed substantial fouling occurred after the antibiotic additions with the mean concentrations of soluble microbial product smp and extracellular polymeric substance eps increasing by 340 and 220 respectively in a membrane fouling cycle moreover the contents of eps and smp in the membrane foulants were significantly correlated with the arg absolute abundance of membrane foulants p 0 05 among which more significant correlations occurred between both the protein and polysaccharide of foulants than that with humic acid the dense membrane fouling layer and the membrane itself constituted dual barriers that effectively avoided the leakage of args from the membrane module our findings provide fundamental insights into the proliferation and removal of args in mbr systems and highlight the contribution of membrane fouling to arg removals in terms of the potential of mbr as an effective strategy to reduce arg levels in wwtp effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes membrane bioreactor membrane foulants extracellular polymeric substances soluble microbial product 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging environmental contaminants pruden et al 2006 sanderson et al 2016 are persistent in the environment leading to far reaching harmful resistance they have been widely found in numerous environmental reservoirs including surface waters soil aquaculture facilities and agricultural waste burch et al 2014 cheesanford et al 2001 chen et al 2012 cummings et al 2016 pruden et al 2012 2006 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are well known to serve as important reservoirs for various args encoding resistances to many different varieties of antibiotics aydin et al 2015 burch et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 liu et al 2014 mao et al 2015 sun et al 2016 extremely high bacterial loads coupled with subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics in activated sludge could contribute to proliferation and dissemination of args berendonk et al 2015 municipal wastewater systems have been shown to be a critical avenue for the discharge of args into the natural environment makowska et al 2016 and might represent an important node for limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance riquelme breazeal et al 2013 in contrast to most chemical contaminants in municipal wastewater args present both within bacterial genomes and in free dna are capable of persisting and even spreading into the environment via wastewater discharge berendonk et al 2015 existing wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic compounds nutrients for example nitrogen and phosphorus and suspended solids they have limited capability to efficiently remove emerging contaminants such as args args can survive and even increase in abundance during the wastewater treatment processes guo et al 2017 ju et al 2016 the persistence of args through wastewater treatment processes not only presents a serious ecological risk in natural environments but also has a negative influence on the development public perception and economic viability of wastewater reuse great efforts have been made to study the occurrence and abundance of various kinds of args in wwtps aydin et al 2015 karkman et al 2016 specifically remarkably higher removals of args have been observed in membrane bioreactor mbr facilities when compared with that in conventional treatment plants munir et al 2011 this might partly result from a more effective microbial removal in mbr systems than that in conventional activated sludge treatment systems which has been substantiated in previous studies performed both at pilot scale and within full scale wwtps marti et al 2011 ottoson et al 2006 moreover a recent study also investigated the impact of wastewater colloids on arg removals by membrane filtration which indicated that arg removals by membrane treatment could be enhanced by wastewater colloid arg interactions riquelme breazeal et al 2013 these results illustrate that membrane treatment could be promising for reducing args in wwtp effluents and thus alleviating public health risks in natural environments as the widely accepted principal components of membrane fouling layers extracellular polymeric substance eps and soluble microbial product smp have potential roles in the adsorption ability of metals hu et al 2007 joshi and juwarkara 2009 and organic matter esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 sheng et al 2008 considering these adsorption properties of eps and smp it could be speculated that membrane foulants might play an important positive role in arg removals in mbr systems there is little research studying the arg distribution in membrane foulants or the relationship between the components of membrane foulants and arg removals in mbr systems also little is known regarding the removal mechanism of args in membrane treatment especially the role of membrane foulants in arg removals which would provide helpful information to protect against propagation of args into the natural environment the objective of this study was to elucidate the fate of args in wastewater activated sludge and membrane foulants along the mbr process paying special attention to the vital role of membrane foulants in arg removals specifically we studied the role of various compositions of eps and smp of the membrane foulants in the arg distribution and removal in a mbr tetracyclines and sulfonamides which are widely used antibiotics both for human use and veterinary were added into the influent of the mbr system to induce arg proliferation sulfamethoxazole smx and tetracycline hydrochloride tc concentrations were each designed at 100 1000 μg l 1 according to those presented in antibiotic production wastewater generated along with the fermentative production of antibiotics larsson et al 2007 li et al 2010 polymerase chain reaction pcr and quantitative real time pcr qpcr were used to determine the occurrence and abundance of five arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea and int1 in the mbr system moreover correlations between the foulants contents and composition deposited on the membrane and the distribution and proliferation of args were analyzed to gain deep insights into the potential of mbr systems as an effective way to control arg dissemination into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 a o mbr reactor set up and operation in this study a laboratory scale anaerobic aerobic a o mbr with an effective volume of 15 l was established consisting of an anoxic unit 5 l and an aerobic unit 10 l fig s1 a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat sheet membrane module was submerged in the aerobic unit the mean pore size of the membrane module was 0 1 μm shanghai sinap membrane tech co ltd shanghai china and the effective filtration area was 0 2 m2 the aeration flow was monitored by a flow rate meter and supplied by means of air diffusers at the bottom of the reactors a feeding peristaltic pump longer china was controlled by a water level sensor to maintain a constant liquid level in the bioreactor intermittent filtration was conducted in the studied mbr 10 min filtration and 2 min pause using a permeation peristaltic pump the effluent flow rate was monitored by a water meter the trans membrane pressure tmp of the mbr was kept below 40 kpa the membrane modules were physically backwashed to remove the fouling layer and cleaned chemically every 20 35 days with naclo solution the concentration of available chlorine was 3000 mg l 1 inoculated sludge was obtained from the aeration tank in quyang sewage treatment plant shanghai china after inoculation and set up the system was operated for 275 days and monitored continuously at different smx and tc concentrations to investigate the fate of args along the treatment process and the role of foulants in arg removals stage 1 days 0 232 was operated as a control state without antibiotic addition in stage 2 days 233 242 smx and tc each at 100 μg l 1 were added to the synthetic wastewater in stage 3 days 243 275 smx and tc were each added at 1000 μg l 1 the antibiotic additions were made from standard stock solutions 1 g l 1 that were stored in a 20 c freezer the detailed operational conditions of the studied mbr are listed in table s1 the composition of the synthetic wastewater is described in table s2 the chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn of the simulated wastewater in this study mainly derived from ch3coona and nh4cl to achieve the desired influent concentrations of 350 400 mg cod l 1 and 30 50 mg nh4 n l 1 respectively 2 2 fouling layer sample collection the fouled membrane modules were taken out from the mbr at the end of each operational cycle when the tmp reached approximately 40 kpa the fouling layer on about 0 05 m2 of the membrane surface was carefully scraped off with a plastic sheet and simultaneously flushed with pure water the collected samples were well mixed with a magnetic blender model jb 2 leici instrument incorporated shanghai china then the collected sample was prepared and further treated according to the requirements of the specific analyses 2 3 dna extraction and pcr the dna in the wastewater membrane foulants and the activated sludge was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca according to the manufacturer s protocol because of the low level of dna in wastewater samples the process of preparing the dna was performed multiple times and combined to eliminate heterogeneity in the activated sludge and to avoid potential bias during the dna extraction process the purity and yield of the dna were determined by spectrophotometer analysis nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa pcr was applied to the collected samples to assess the presence of the following thirteen target genes three sulfonamide resistance genes suli sulii and suliii six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tetm teto tetq and tetx two erythromycin resistance genes erea and ereb and two integrase genes int1 and int2 according to previously described protocols luo et al 2010 ng et al 2001 pei et al 2006 sutcliffe et al 1996 all pcr reactions were run on a pcr thermocycler geneamp 9600 perkin elmer applied biosystems foster city california usa in 50 μl reaction volumes containing 1 pcr buffer 200 μm dntps 0 2 0 5 μm of each primer 1 25 u of taq dna polymerase 5prime hamburg germany and 1 μl of template dna dilutions from 100 to 500 ng dna nuclease free water was used as the negative control for each run the correct length of the amplified pcr product was evaluated by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing to confirm the specificity of pcr amplification 2 4 qpcr five args tetc tetx suli sulii erea with high detection frequencies in pcr as well as the integrase gene of class 1 integrons int1 and 16s rdna genes were selected for quantitative detection using the sybr green method ghosh and lapara 2007 primers and probe sequences as well as the applied qpcr conditions are summarized in table s3 plasmids carrying the target genes were used to generate standard curves according to the standard curves the ct values of unknown samples were used to calculate the corresponding number of gene copies qpcrs were conducted in 96 well plates with a final volume of 25 μl consisting of 12 5 μl 2 power sybr green pcr master mix life technologies usa 0

technologies usa the pcr protocol was as follows 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min following each run a melting curve was generated and analyzed to avoid nonspecific amplification each reaction was run in triplicate for each permutation of sample and primer set as well as the negative controls in which ultrapure water was added instead of dna template triplicates of the activated sludge in the aerobic mbr tank were collected on day 232 the end of stage 1 without antibiotic addition and 275 the end of stage 3 with antibiotic addition in the influent respectively for quantification of args and int1 by qpcr which could discount the influence of biological variability each sample was detected in triplicate to guarantee the low technical variation there was no significant difference between the technical replications so as between the biological replications p 0 05 the absolute abundances of args and int1 gene copies per sample volume copies ml 1 were determined to minimize variances caused by different bacterial abundances dna extraction and quantification efficiencies the relative abundances of args and int1 were obtained by normalizing their copy numbers to those of the 16s rrna genes 2 5 smp and eps characterization eps could be divided into extracted eps organic matter bound to the cell wall of the microorganism and smp which is unbound i e free matter judd 2008 in the present study the extracted eps is denoted simply as eps a heat extraction method morgan et al 1990 was modified to extract both the smp and eps from the biomass in the mbr a mixed liquor of activated sludge was centrifuged 5810r eppendorf to separate smp the supernatant after filtration through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane from the mixed liquor 4000 rpm 5 min 4 c for extraction of the eps the sludge pellet was resuspended in saline water 0 05 nacl solution to its original volume then heated in a water bath 60 c 30 min and centrifuged at 4000 g for 30 min at 4 c the collected supernatant after filtration through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane was regarded as the eps solution the contents of the smp and eps extractions were measured for protein polysaccharide and humic acid the protein and humic acid were measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer following the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 using bovine serum albumin sigma usa and humic acid fluka usa respectively as the standards the polysaccharide content was analyzed according to the phenol sulfuric acid method gerhardt et al 1994 using glucose as the standard all the above analyses were conducted in triplicate and their average values were reported 2 6 scanning electron microscopy sem at the end of each experimental stage 0 05 m2 of the fouled membranes were collected fixed dehydrated and coated with an approximately 10 15 nm layer of gold for sem analysis quanta 200 fei company following a previously reported protocol fox and demaree 1999 supplementary material text s1 a sample of new unfouled membrane was also collected and coated with gold for sem analysis as a control sample 2 7 statistical analysis copy numbers were log transformed as needed to normalize the distributions prior to statistical analysis data were analyzed by origin pro 9 0 origin lab corporation pearson correlation analysis spss ver 21 0 spss inc usa was performed to assess the relationships between the arg absolute abundance and contents of eps and smp in the membrane foulant samples p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 1 arg log reduction of the membrane module lg the arg absolute abundance in the activated sludge of the oxic unit the arg absolute abundance in the effluent eq 1 could directly reflect the arg removal efficiency of the membrane module 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling behavior in response to the increasing smx and tc additions 3 1 1 tmp development and membrane morphology the tmp profile of the studied mbr which could directly reflect the membrane fouling process displayed a gradual increasing trend in stage 1 and a sharp increasing trend in stage 2 after antibiotics were added fig 1 the membrane fouling cycle period from the day that tmp 0 kpa to the day that tmp 40 kpa was 25 days in stage 1 while it sharply decreased to 8 days and 4 days in stages 2 and 3 respectively the additions of antibiotics accelerated the membrane fouling process which increased the rate of increase of the tmp in stages 2 and 3 when compared with that in stage 1 variations in cod and nitrogen concentrations and removal efficiencies along with the increasing antibiotic additions were presented in fig s2 the cod and ammonia removals still remained at 89 0 9 and 99 1 2 respectively after the acclimation to the antibiotic exposure in stage 2 3 the tn removal efficiency remained steady in stages 1 and 2 87 2 2 while it obviously decreased by 27 in stage 3 sem images of the membrane showed that the new membrane was an asymmetric membrane fig 2 a and b at the end of stage 1 day 232 during which antibiotic stress was not imposed a filmy sheet of loose structured fouling layer deposited on the membrane surface fig 2c and d then the additions of smx and tc triggered severe membrane fouling and the fouling layer became denser as antibiotic concentration increased fig 2e h compared with the scraps of the foulants at the end of stage 1 the fouling layer at the end of stage 2 became more compact with the thickness of about 20 μm fig 2f at the end of stage 3 day 275 a dense and compact fouling layer approximately 40 μm in thickness was observed on the membrane surface fig 2g and h and rod shaped bacteria were attached to the fouling layer indicating that microorganisms were interconnected through the eps matrix fig 2g membrane foulants generally contain high molecular weight compounds with charged functional groups and possess both adsorptive and adhesive properties bin et al 2008 which could be favorable for the adherence of suspended microbes and sludge flocs these characteristics of membrane foulants could lead to improvements in effluent quality to some extent 3 1 2 changes in contents and composition of eps and smp in the membrane foulants 3 1 2 1 increased eps and smp production with increased membrane foulants after the additions of smx and tc were increased from 100 to 1000 μg l 1 a more significant increase in the eps and smp contents of membrane foulants was observed in stage 3 when compared with that of stage 2 fig 3 consistent with the more rapid increase in tmp in stage 3 compared with that in stage 2 for instance the mean eps and smp concentrations in a membrane fouling cycle increased by 193 5 and 57 2 mg m 2 respectively from stage 2 to stage 3 also the eps and smp contents in the mbr activated sludge showed a similar profile to that of membrane foulant contents fig s3 indicating that the increasing antibiotic additions such as smx and tc stimulated microorganisms to secrete more eps zheng et al 2016 3 1 2 2 increased protein and polysaccharide compositions of eps and smp in membrane foulants three different predominant components of eps and smp including protein polysaccharide and humic acid were analyzed to identify their individual contributions to membrane fouling and arg removals fig 3 the labile nature of protein and range of polydispersity of naturally occurring macromolecules add a complexity to the membrane foulants le clech et al 2006 polysaccharide is generally regarded as the dominant component of eps in membrane fouling since polysaccharide have higher viscosity than other components in eps and are easily accumulated on the membrane surface bin et al 2008 to date however there is no conclusively agreed constituent of the mixed liquor to which fouling can be primarily attributed in the present study both the protein and polysaccharide contents in smp and the protein contents in eps of the membrane foulant increased with increasing tmp while the polysaccharide content in eps decreased along with increasing tmp especially in the later periods of stages 2 and 3 fig 3 the additions of smx and tc at 1000 μg l 1 caused higher protein secretion than that at 100 μg l 1 in stage 3 the protein concentration in the eps matrix was high 320 mg m 2 with increasing tmp fig 3b possibly because the exposure of microorganisms to antibiotics induced them to secrete more protein similar observations have been made in previous studies that the protein production in eps was more than the polysaccharide production under norfloxacin stress at 0 35 mg l 1 in a biofilm sequencing batch reactor sbr possibly because the protein secretion metabolism of microorganisms was more sensitive to norfloxacin than that of the polysaccharide secretion metabolism zheng et al 2016 in response to the negative effects of toxic chemicals in the environment the microbial communities could vary their metabolic processes and thus produce different metabolic products i e the eps matrix as a microbial metabolic product might also potentially change its composition flemming and wingender 2010 given this metabolic change adopted by microorganisms the increased protein in the eps and smp production under antibiotic stress observed in the present study might be closely related to the microbial self protective strategy i e the increased protein production could encapsulate the microorganisms that exited in sludge flocs and adhered to the membrane fouling layer and thus protect themselves from the toxicity of smx and tc 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of args and int1 in the mbr system with the increasing smx and tc additions 3 2 1 spatial distribution of args in the activated sludge in the inoculated sludge taken from quyang sewage treatment plant shanghai china thirteen genes including three sulfonamide resistance genes suli sulii and suliii six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tetm teto tetq and tetx two erythromycin resistance genes erea and ereb and two integrase genes int1 and int2 were found to be present in relatively high abundance then these thirteen genes were targeted and amplified by pcr to access their abundance in the present study moreover to evaluate the potential and possibility of antibiotics co selection effects on the proliferation of args against different types of antibiotics abundance of erythromycin resistance genes erea were also evaluated among which five typical arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea with high detection frequencies in pcr along the various processes were further quantified using qpcr technology the tested args were present in the influent and prevailed through each stage of the studied mbr system fig 4 and fig s1 the relative abundance of args in the activated sludge increased after the antibiotic additions fig 4 a and c which implied an enrichment of args in the mbr system under antibiotic pressure moreover the absolute abundance of most tested genes was significantly higher in the activated sludge than that in the influent and the effluent during the whole experimental period except for the tetx subtype the arg abundances in the effluent remained roughly unchanged during the whole experimental period despite a great increase in the arg absolute abundance of the activated sludge with the antibiotic additions fig 4 which provides clear evidences of the robust performance of the mbr in arg removals in the influent the absolute abundance of tetx was the highest among the args tested fig 4b and d the concentration of each arg in the influent fluctuated less than 16 during the whole experimental period except for tetc which decreased by 25 from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 4b and d in the effluent liquid samples the absolute abundances of tetc and tetx in stage 3 were 3 62 105 and 1 15 107 copies ml 1 respectively increasing by one order of magnitude after the antibiotic additions fig 4b and d the presence of tc caused proliferation and enrichment of the corresponding resistance determinants in the mbr system leading to an increase in the tet r the sum of tetracycline resistance genes concentration in the effluent for the activated sludge samples after being exposed to smx and tc the relative abundance of most tested arg subtypes showed a significant increase during both anoxic and aerobic reaction processes fig 4a and c in the anoxic unit the relative abundances of suli tetc and erea in the activated sludge increased by 0 9 0 6 and 0 8 orders of magnitude respectively from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 4a and c the relative abundances of the other two subtypes sulii and tetx both decreased by 0 1 order of magnitude in the anoxic unit which was not a significant change fig 4a and c in the subsequent aerobic unit the relative abundance of each tested arg subtype in the activated sludge increased by over 0 5 orders of magnitude expect for tetc which only increased by 0 03 orders of magnitude from stage 1 to stage 3 du et al 2015 also reported that in a municipal wastewater treatment plant with a a2 o mbr system the relative abundance of the tested args increased in the mbr tank the absolute abundance of args decreased in both anaerobic effluent and anoxic effluent but increased in the aerobic effluent and ultimately declined in the mbr effluent 3 2 2 the arg abundance of the activated sludge in the aerobic unit over experimental period the variations in the arg abundances of the activated sludge in the aerobic unit were systematically studied along with the increasing antibiotic additions to identify correlations between antibiotics and arg abundance with exposure time to antibiotics the additions of smx and tc mainly caused increases in the relative abundance of suli tetc and int1 with the extended experimental time fig 5 specifically the predominant arg subtypes were suli in stage 1 days 1 232 tetc in stage 2 days 233 242 while in stage 3 days 243 275 suli and tetc jointly occupied the dominant portion of the antibiotic resistance profile in the activated sludge fig 5 in stage 1 without exposure to antibiotic stress both the overall relative abundance of arg subtypes and each arg subtype in the activated sludge decreased with operating time fig 5a because no antibiotic resistance selective pressure was exerted on the bacterial community in stage 1 after the antibiotic additions in stages 2 and 3 the overall relative abundance of all tested args increased by 0 9 orders of magnitude from 0 07 at the end of stage 1 day 232 to 0 51 at the end of stage 3 day 275 also the individual relative abundance of most tested arg subtypes generally increased from day 233 to day 275 stages 2 3 the most remarkable increase occurred in the relative abundance of tetc which increased from an average of 8 30 10 4 in stage 1 days 1 232 to 1 12 10 1 on average in stage 2 days 235 242 increasing by over 2 orders of magnitude fig 5a in other words the relative abundance of tetc compared with that of the all target args increased by 56 after the antibiotic additions fig 5b indeed after acclimation to a long term of antibiotics exposure the proliferation of args occurred in the activated sludge it was reported that over the course of one year operation of anaerobic sbrs the concentrations of the tested args encoding tetracycline sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin increased in the activated sludge aydin et al 2015 3 2 3 correlations between different arg subtypes and int1 in the activated sludge it has been universally acknowledged that args can be transferred very rapidly and widely between microorganisms that are present in the environment through mobile genetic elements such as plasmids integrons and transposons in surface waters soils wang et al 2013 xu et al 2011 and wwtps ben shahar et al 2012 the existence of int1 integrase gene of class 1 integrons a genetic platform for arg capture could be considered as an indicator of the intercellular transfer potential of antibiotic resistance berendonk et al 2015 correspondingly the relative abundance of the tested genes could determine the potential for intercellular arg proliferation and the antibiotic resistance level of microorganisms in samples in the present study the absolute abundance of int1 increased by 0 6 orders of magnitude after the antibiotic additions from day 233 to day 275 fig 4b and d which provided a clear evidence of the high potential for horizontal gene transfer in the activated sludge of the studied mbr under antibiotic stress there was a positive correlation between the enrichment of args and int1 relative abundance table 1 specifically a strongly significant correlation was observed between the relative abundance of int1 and suli p 0 01 table 1 and a significant correlation was observed between int1 and tetc p 0 05 table 1 the overall relative abundance of sul subtypes and tet subtypes were determined as sul r and tet r respectively notably both sul r and tet r showed significant positive correlations with int1 implying the importance of horizontal transfer in their proliferation table 1 moreover erea and sul r were significantly correlated with each other table 1 suggesting that these arg subtypes might be co occurring or co selected by mobile genetic elements in the studied mbr system our findings illustrated that antibiotic stress on the bacterial community could promote the potential for horizontal gene transfer and then increase the resistant proportion of the bacterial community through environmental selection in wastewater treatment processes 3 3 cooperation of membrane and its foulants for effective removals of args it is known that the main mechanism of arg removals in mbr systems is related to the separation and retention of microorganisms by the membrane module i e args mostly exist in the intracellular form and can be effectively retained by the membrane several studies confirmed that the microbial removal capacity of mbr systems is more effective than that of conventional activated sludge treatment systems marti et al 2011 ottoson et al 2006 indicating that mbr processes are favorable for arg removals over conventional activated sludge systems because most args are located in bacterial intracellular genomes it is noteworthy that the arg distribution in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process fig 6 this portion of the total arg distribution in mbr systems has been neglected in previous studies but it can substantially contribute to arg removals in membrane treatment systems and should no longer be neglected we deduced that there are two functions of appropriate membrane fouling fig 7 despite the fact that severe membrane fouling can lead to the membrane pore blocking 1 appropriate membrane fouling can reduce the effective pore size of the membrane and thus favor the retention of more microorganisms or even smaller size dna fragments 2 eps and or smp contained in the foulants can retain a portion of free args such as extracellular args which effectively prevents a part of the args leaking from the membrane 3 3 1 fouling induced reduction of the effective pore size of the membrane in the mbr system the size of activated sludge flocs was in the range of 0 05 1 0 mm data not shown which is larger than the pore size 0 1 0 4 μm of membranes that are widely used in wastewater treatment luxmy et al 2000 a single bacterium of 0 5 1 0 μm is likely to pass through the membrane pores 0 1 0 4 μm especially when the membrane is damaged or eroded by backflushing or chemical cleaning grady et al 2011 judd 2010 moreover dna is a long thin and flexible molecule breazeal et al 2012 commonly 1 kb of dna is 0 34 μm long with 100 helical turns madigan et al 1997 and 1 nm in diameter for double stranded dna heng et al 2004 therefore free args a form of dna could hypothetically squeeze length wise through a membrane pore breazeal et al 2012 thus posing a potential human health risk the sem images of the membrane cross section proved that some membrane pores were partially blocked with the fouling matters fig 2f thus reducing the effective pore size this provides the possibility for the mbr system to retain free args fig 7 and thus reduce their potential eco environmental risk 3 3 2 mechanism of retention of args by eps and smp in the foulants the potential of eps and smp to retain free microbial cells and dna including free antibiotic resistant bacteria and args should also be considered in the contribution of membrane foulants to arg removals fig 7 there are three possible reasons why eps and smp have good capacity to retain antibiotic resistant bacteria and args first the high molecular weight and cross linked structural properties of eps and smp could lead to binding with microbial cells through complex interactions such as ion bridging interaction hydrophobic interaction and polymer entanglement to form a vast net like structure with plenty of water ding et al 2015 liu et al 2004 wang et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 reported that amphoteric eps and smp containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in the molecular structure contributed to the separation and retention ability of foulants second the presence of colloids in wastewater systems could enhance the retention of args a previous study reported significant removals of args by membranes of 100 kda and smaller and the presence of wastewater colloids resulted in enhanced removals by larger pore size membranes which means that wastewater colloid arg interactions could facilitate arg removals by membranes breazeal et al 2012 third the possible changes in protein structure of eps and smp could be favorable for arg removals by the membrane module it was reported that amino acid compositions and secondary structures of protein in eps significantly contributed to hydrophobic interactions hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 which could further influence the adsorption ability of eps xu et al 2013 reported that eps production was not significantly influenced by sulfamethazine at 500 μg l 1 in an aerobic activated sludge system with a liquid suspended solids concentration of 2 5 g l 1 but the presence of sulfamethazine led to changes in the secondary structure of protein in eps it is possible in this study that a variation of the stretch degree for peptide chains of protein in eps and smp might be favorable for arg removals by the fouling layer possibly because of an increase in surface area available for arg retention in this study the smp and eps contents in the membrane foulants exhibited significant correlations with the arg absolute abundances in the foulants the absolute abundance of suli and tetx in foulants was significantly correlated with contents of both eps and smp table 2 specifically the protein component in eps of membrane foulants was significantly correlated with the absolute abundance of most of the tested genes in membrane foulants table 2 the protein and polysaccharide contents in both eps and smp showed more significant correlations with arg absolute abundance than with that of humic acid it is noteworthy that the absolute abundance of int1 only showed correlations with eps rather than with smp the significant correlations between the protein and polysaccharide contents of the eps and the overall eps contents with int1 the absolute abundance confirmed the important role of eps in int1 removal by the membrane process taken together combining the properties of bacterial binding and the potential to adsorb free args of eps and smp with the results of pearson correlation analysis in this study table 2 it could be speculated that eps and smp in membrane foulants played a vital role in reduction of antibiotic resistance level in the membrane effluent 3 4 robust performance of mbrs in the antibiotic resistance reduction 3 4 1 effective reduction of antibiotic resistance in the mbr although both the absolute abundance and the relative abundance of the tested args increased in the activated sludge of the aerobic membrane tank after the antibiotic additions in stages 2 and 3 section 3 2 fig 6 the arg removal performance of the membrane module arg log reduction of the membrane module eq 1 remained stable or even increased for several of the args during the experimental period fig 6b and d specifically the absolute abundance of suli decreased in the effluent although it increased in the activated sludge in the final aerobic unit membrane foulants and the polluted membrane after the additions of smx and tc fig 6b and d a similar trend was also observed for the distribution of the absolute abundance of erea in the membrane module treatment process fig 6b and d the absolute abundance of erea in the activated sludge of the aerobic tank and the membrane foulants increased by 0 5 and 0 7 orders of magnitude respectively after the additions of smx and tc while it remained roughly stable in the effluent moreover the overall absolute abundance of all tested args in the activated sludge increased from 3 29 109 copies ml 1 in stage 1 to 5 85 109 copies ml 1 in stage 3 while that in the effluent generally remained stable during the experimental period ranging from 7 54 106 copies ml 1 to 6 43 106 copies ml 1 fig 6b and d notably the sum of the total arg concentrations in both the membrane and foulants increased by 0 4 orders of magnitude in stage 3 with increases of 0 3 and 0 6 orders of magnitude in the polluted membrane and the foulants respectively fig 6b and d the above results imply that the cooperation of the membrane and the foulants contributed to the effective removals of args by the membrane module membrane filtration could play an important role in the retention of bioflocs and most free bacteria in wastewater the risk of the leakage of free args and free bacteria through membrane pores should not be ignored although it might be remedied by the foulants deposited on the membrane 3 4 2 contribution of membrane foulants to arg removals considering the size of membrane pores 0 1 μm in the present study is larger than that of dna molecules membrane foulants deposited on the membrane modules could reduce the effective pore size and therefore favor the efficient removal of free args in wastewater fig 7 from this point of view the high contents of eps and smp in membrane foulants induced by antibiotic pressure might have promoted arg removal efficiencies of the membrane module in other words the contribution of the membrane module to arg removals might have been promoted after the additions of smx and tc fig 6b and d sem images of the membrane surface confirmed that the fouling layer of which the main components are smp and eps became denser and more compact after the additions of smx and tc fig 2f and h although the increased foulant content induced by the antibiotic additions caused severe membrane fouling in the mbr its indispensable impact on the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and free args should not be ignored as mentioned in section 3 1 2 the increase in the eps and smp production under antibiotic stress was closely related to the microbial self protective strategy to protect the microorganisms from the toxicity of smx and tc table 2 microorganisms secreted more eps and smp in response to antibiotic stress with higher production of protein when compared with that of polysaccharide and humic acid fig 3 this increased eps production and especially the increased protein production stimulated by the smx and tc stress might have favored arg removals in the membrane treatment process because the dense fouling layer and the membrane per se could constitute a dual barrier against the leakage of args from the treatment system indeed the arg distribution analysis revealed that 13 25 of args in the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process was contained in the membrane foulants fig 6 membrane treatment technology is a promising method for managing the public health risks of args in wastewater effluents arg removals might even be enhanced by colloids in real world wastewaters pruden 2014 riquelme breazeal et al 2013 the colloidal foulants in mbr originate from feed substrate the release from cell lysis and the excretion of microorganism barker and stuckey 1999 our findings provide a fundamental insight into the vital role of membrane foulants in arg removals in mbr systems the removal of various args were significantly correlated with the protein polysaccharide and total contents of the eps and smp matrix although severe membrane fouling could be a challenge for mbr treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater the robust arg removals achieved by the mbr system in this study provides a promising treating process for controlling arg pollution in the environment to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that provides a comprehensive profile of the arg distribution in mbr systems including membrane foulants and elucidates the possible mechanisms of arg removals in the mbr system considering the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the demonstrated links between wwtps and args in receiving environments knowledge of arg removal mechanism in membrane processes would support the development of mbr treatment for more efficient and widespread utilization in wwtps 4 conclusions for the first time the distribution of args and removal capacity of a mbr using flat sheet membrane have been systemically examined after antibiotics exposure smx and tc paying special attention to the characteristics of membrane foulants and their contribution to arg removals the following conclusions can be delivered 1 although the smx and tc additions increased arg abundance by 0 5 1 4 orders of magnitude in the activated sludge and membrane fouling layer the arg removal performance of the membrane module was robust with the abundance of removed args in the range of 0 6 5 6 orders of magnitude 2 antibiotic residues could promote the potential for horizontal gene transfer through exerting antibiotic stress on the bacterial community in the mbr system and then increase the resistant proportion of the bacterial community through environmental selection in wastewater treatment processes 3 the distribution of args in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process under antibiotics stress 4 both the contents and components of smp and eps in membrane foulants were significantly correlated with arg abundance in foulants specifically protein and polysaccharide in both eps and smp showed more significant correlations with arg absolute abundance than with that of humic acid which provided solid evidences that membrane foulants indeed played an important role in arg removals during membrane treatment acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

19807,antibiotic resistance genes args are an emerging concern in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as dissemination of args can pose a serious risk to human health few studies however have quantified args in membrane bioreactors mbrs although mbrs have been widely used for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment to reveal the capacity of mbrs for removal of args and the response of membrane fouling after antibiotic exposure five typical arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea and int1 were quantified affiliated by systematic membrane foulants analysis in a laboratory scale anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor a o mbr sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline hydrochloride additions increased arg abundances by 0 5 1 4 orders of magnitude in the activated sludge while the arg removal performance of the membrane module remained stable or even increased with arg absolute abundance in several cases with the abundance of removed args ranging from 0 6 to 5 6 orders of magnitude specifically the distribution of args in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested mbr samples indeed substantial fouling occurred after the antibiotic additions with the mean concentrations of soluble microbial product smp and extracellular polymeric substance eps increasing by 340 and 220 respectively in a membrane fouling cycle moreover the contents of eps and smp in the membrane foulants were significantly correlated with the arg absolute abundance of membrane foulants p 0 05 among which more significant correlations occurred between both the protein and polysaccharide of foulants than that with humic acid the dense membrane fouling layer and the membrane itself constituted dual barriers that effectively avoided the leakage of args from the membrane module our findings provide fundamental insights into the proliferation and removal of args in mbr systems and highlight the contribution of membrane fouling to arg removals in terms of the potential of mbr as an effective strategy to reduce arg levels in wwtp effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes membrane bioreactor membrane foulants

agricultural waste burch et al 2014 cheesanford et al 2001 chen et al 2012 cummings et al 2016 pruden et al 2012 2006 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are well known to serve as important reservoirs

bacterial loads coupled with subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics in activated sludge could contribute to proliferation and dissemination of args berendonk et al 2015 municipal wastewater systems have been shown to be a critical avenue for the discharge of args into the natural environment makowska et al 2016 and might represent an important node for limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance riquelme breazeal et al 2013 in contrast to most chemical contaminants in municipal wastewater args present both within bacterial genomes and in free dna are capable of persisting and even spreading into the environment via wastewater discharge berendonk et al 2015 existing wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic compounds nutrients for example nitrogen and phosphorus and suspended solids they have limited capability to efficiently remove emerging contaminants such as args args can survive and even increase in abundance during the wastewater treatment processes guo et al 2017 ju et al 2016 the persistence of args through wastewater treatment processes not only presents a serious ecological risk in natural environments but also has a negative influence on the development public perception and economic viability of wastewater reuse great efforts have been made to study the occurrence and abundance of various kinds of args in wwtps aydin et al 2015 karkman et al 2016 specifically remarkably higher removals of args have been observed in membrane bioreactor mbr facilities when compared with that in conventional treatment plants munir et al 2011 this might partly result from a more effective microbial removal in mbr systems than that in conventional activated sludge treatment systems which has been substantiated in previous studies performed both at pilot scale and within full scale wwtps marti et al 2011 ottoson et al 2006 moreover a recent study also investigated the impact of wastewater colloids on arg removals by membrane filtration which indicated that arg removals by membrane treatment could be enhanced by wastewater colloid arg interactions riquelme breazeal et al 2013 these results illustrate that membrane treatment could be promising for reducing args in wwtp effluents and thus alleviating public health risks in natural environments as the widely accepted principal components of membrane fouling layers extracellular polymeric substance eps and soluble microbial product smp have potential roles in the adsorption ability of metals hu et al 2007 joshi and juwarkara 2009 and organic matter esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 sheng et al 2008 considering these adsorption properties of eps and smp it could be speculated that membrane foulants might play an important positive role in arg removals in mbr systems there is little research studying the arg distribution in membrane foulants or the relationship between the components of membrane foulants and arg removals in mbr systems also little is known regarding the removal mechanism of args in membrane treatment especially the role of membrane foulants in arg removals which would provide helpful information to protect against propagation of args into the natural environment the objective of this study was to elucidate the fate of args in wastewater activated sludge and membrane foulants along the mbr process paying special attention to the vital role of membrane foulants in arg removals specifically we studied the role of various compositions of eps and smp of the membrane foulants in the arg distribution and removal in a mbr tetracyclines and sulfonamides which are widely used antibiotics both for human use and veterinary were added into the influent of the mbr system to induce arg proliferation sulfamethoxazole smx and tetracycline hydrochloride tc concentrations were each designed at 100 1000 μg l 1 according to those presented in antibiotic production wastewater generated along with the fermentative production of antibiotics larsson et al 2007 li et al 2010 polymerase chain reaction pcr and quantitative real time pcr qpcr were used to determine the occurrence and abundance of five arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea and int1 in the mbr system moreover correlations between the foulants contents and composition deposited on the membrane and the distribution and proliferation of args were analyzed to gain deep insights into the potential of mbr systems as an effective way to control arg dissemination into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 a o mbr reactor set up and operation in this study a

was 0 2 m2 the aeration flow was monitored by a flow rate meter and supplied by means of air diffusers at the bottom of the reactors a feeding peristaltic pump longer china was controlled by a water level sensor to maintain a constant liquid level in the bioreactor intermittent filtration was conducted in the studied mbr 10 min filtration and 2 min pause using a permeation peristaltic pump the effluent flow rate was monitored by a water meter the trans membrane pressure tmp of the mbr was kept below 40 kpa the membrane modules were physically backwashed to remove the fouling layer and cleaned chemically every 20 35 days with naclo solution the concentration of available chlorine was 3000 mg l 1 inoculated sludge was obtained from the aeration tank in quyang sewage treatment plant shanghai china after inoculation and set up the system was operated for 275 days and monitored continuously at different smx and tc concentrations to investigate the fate of args along the treatment

synthetic wastewater in stage 3 days 243 275 smx and tc were each added at 1000 μg l 1 the antibiotic additions were made from standard stock solutions 1 g l 1 that were stored in a 20 c freezer the detailed operational conditions of the studied mbr are listed in table s1 the composition of the synthetic wastewater is described in table s2 the chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn of

sample collection the fouled membrane modules were taken out from the mbr at the end of each operational cycle when the tmp reached approximately 40 kpa the fouling layer on about 0 05 m2 of the membrane surface was carefully scraped off with a plastic sheet and simultaneously flushed with pure water the collected samples were well mixed with a magnetic blender model jb 2 leici instrument incorporated shanghai china then the collected sample was prepared and further treated according to the requirements of the specific analyses 2 3 dna extraction and pcr the dna in the wastewater membrane foulants and the activated sludge was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca according to the manufacturer s protocol because of the low level of dna in wastewater samples the process of preparing the dna was performed multiple times and combined to eliminate heterogeneity in the activated sludge and to avoid potential bias during the dna extraction process the purity and yield of the dna were determined by spectrophotometer analysis nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa pcr was applied to the collected samples to assess the presence of the following thirteen target genes three sulfonamide resistance genes suli sulii and suliii six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tetm teto tetq and tetx two erythromycin resistance genes erea and ereb and two integrase genes int1 and int2 according to previously described protocols luo et al 2010 ng et al 2001 pei et al 2006 sutcliffe et al 1996 all pcr reactions were run on a pcr thermocycler

nonspecific amplification each reaction was run in triplicate for each permutation of sample and primer set as well as the negative controls in which ultrapure water was added instead of dna template triplicates of the activated sludge in the aerobic mbr tank were collected on day 232 the end of stage 1 without antibiotic addition and 275 the end of stage 3 with antibiotic addition in the influent respectively for quantification of args and int1 by qpcr which could discount the influence of biological variability each sample was detected in triplicate to guarantee the low technical variation there was no significant difference between the technical replications so as between the biological replications p 0 05 the absolute abundances of args and int1 gene copies per sample volume copies ml 1 were determined to minimize variances caused by different bacterial abundances dna extraction and quantification efficiencies the relative abundances of args and int1 were obtained by normalizing their copy numbers to those of the 16s rrna genes 2 5 smp and eps characterization eps could be divided into extracted eps organic matter bound to the cell wall of the microorganism and smp which is unbound i e free matter judd 2008 in the present study the extracted eps is denoted simply as eps a heat extraction method morgan et al 1990 was modified to extract both the smp and eps from the biomass in the mbr a mixed liquor of activated sludge was centrifuged 5810r eppendorf to separate smp the supernatant after filtration through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane from the mixed liquor 4000 rpm 5 min 4 c for extraction of the eps the sludge pellet was resuspended in saline water 0 05 nacl solution to its original volume then heated in a water bath 60 c 30 min and centrifuged at 4000 g for 30 min at 4 c the collected supernatant after filtration through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane was regarded as the eps solution the contents of the smp and eps extractions were measured for protein polysaccharide and humic acid the protein and humic acid were measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer following the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 using bovine serum albumin sigma usa and humic acid fluka usa respectively as the standards the polysaccharide content was analyzed according to the phenol sulfuric acid method gerhardt et al 1994 using glucose as the standard all the above analyses were conducted in triplicate and their average values were reported 2 6 scanning electron microscopy sem at the end of each experimental stage 0 05 m2 of the fouled membranes were collected fixed dehydrated and coated with an approximately 10 15 nm layer of gold for sem analysis quanta 200 fei company following a previously reported protocol fox and demaree 1999 supplementary material text s1 a sample of new unfouled membrane was also collected and coated with gold for sem analysis as a control sample 2 7 statistical analysis copy numbers were log transformed as needed to normalize the distributions prior to statistical analysis data were analyzed by origin pro 9 0 origin lab corporation pearson correlation analysis spss ver 21 0 spss inc usa was performed to assess the relationships between the arg absolute abundance and contents of eps and smp in the membrane foulant samples p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 1 arg log reduction of the membrane module lg the arg absolute abundance in the activated sludge of the oxic unit the arg absolute abundance in the effluent eq 1 could directly reflect the arg removal efficiency of the membrane module 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling behavior in response to the increasing smx and tc additions 3 1 1 tmp development and membrane morphology the tmp profile of the studied mbr which could directly reflect the membrane fouling process displayed a gradual increasing trend in stage 1 and a sharp increasing trend in stage 2 after antibiotics were added fig 1 the membrane fouling cycle period from the day that tmp 0 kpa to the day that tmp 40 kpa was 25 days in stage 1 while it sharply decreased to 8 days and 4 days in stages 2 and 3 respectively the additions of antibiotics accelerated the membrane fouling process which increased the rate of increase of the tmp in stages 2 and 3 when compared with that in stage 1 variations in cod and nitrogen concentrations and removal efficiencies along with the increasing antibiotic additions were presented in fig s2 the cod and ammonia removals still remained at 89 0 9 and 99 1 2 respectively after the acclimation to the antibiotic exposure in stage 2 3 the tn removal efficiency remained steady in stages 1 and 2 87 2 2 while it obviously decreased by 27 in stage 3 sem images of the membrane showed that the new membrane was an asymmetric membrane fig 2 a and b at the end of stage 1 day 232 during which antibiotic stress was not imposed a filmy sheet of loose structured fouling layer deposited on the membrane surface fig 2c and d then the additions of smx and tc triggered severe membrane fouling and the fouling layer became denser as antibiotic concentration increased fig 2e h compared with the scraps of the foulants at the end of stage 1 the fouling layer at the end of stage 2 became more compact with the thickness of about 20 μm fig 2f at the end of stage 3 day 275 a dense and compact fouling layer approximately 40 μm in thickness was observed on the membrane surface fig 2g and h and rod shaped bacteria were attached to the fouling layer indicating that microorganisms were interconnected through the eps matrix fig 2g membrane foulants generally contain high molecular weight compounds with charged functional groups and possess both adsorptive and adhesive properties bin et al 2008 which could be favorable for the adherence of suspended microbes and sludge flocs these characteristics of membrane foulants could lead to improvements in effluent quality to some extent 3 1 2 changes in contents and composition of eps and smp in the membrane foulants 3 1 2 1 increased eps and smp production with increased membrane foulants after the additions of smx and tc were increased from 100 to 1000 μg l 1 a more significant increase in the eps and smp contents of membrane foulants was observed in stage 3 when compared with that of stage 2 fig 3 consistent with the more rapid increase in tmp in stage 3 compared with that in stage 2 for instance the mean eps and smp concentrations in a membrane fouling cycle increased by 193 5 and 57 2 mg m 2 respectively from stage 2 to stage 3 also the eps and smp contents in the mbr activated sludge showed a similar profile to that of membrane foulant contents fig s3 indicating that the increasing antibiotic additions such as smx and tc stimulated microorganisms to secrete more eps zheng et al 2016 3 1 2 2 increased protein and polysaccharide compositions of eps and smp in membrane foulants three different predominant components of eps and smp including protein polysaccharide and humic acid were analyzed to identify their individual contributions to membrane fouling and arg removals fig 3 the labile nature of protein and range of polydispersity of naturally occurring macromolecules add a complexity to the membrane foulants le clech et al 2006 polysaccharide is generally regarded as the dominant component of eps in membrane fouling since polysaccharide have higher viscosity than other components in eps and are easily accumulated on the membrane surface bin et al 2008 to date however there is no conclusively agreed constituent of the mixed liquor to which fouling can be primarily attributed in the present study both the protein and polysaccharide contents in smp and the protein contents in eps of the membrane foulant increased with increasing tmp while the polysaccharide content in eps decreased along with increasing tmp especially in the later periods of stages 2 and 3 fig 3 the additions of smx and tc at 1000 μg l 1 caused higher protein secretion than that at 100 μg l 1 in stage 3 the protein concentration in the eps matrix was high 320 mg m 2 with increasing tmp fig 3b possibly because the exposure of microorganisms to antibiotics induced them to secrete more protein similar observations have been made in previous studies that the protein production in eps was more than the polysaccharide production under norfloxacin stress at 0 35 mg l 1 in a biofilm sequencing batch reactor sbr possibly because the protein secretion metabolism of microorganisms was more sensitive to norfloxacin than that of the polysaccharide secretion metabolism zheng et al 2016 in response to the negative effects of toxic chemicals in the environment the microbial communities could vary their metabolic processes and thus produce different metabolic products i e the eps matrix as a microbial metabolic product might also potentially change its composition flemming and wingender 2010 given this metabolic change adopted by microorganisms the increased protein in the eps and smp production under antibiotic stress observed in the present study might be closely related to the microbial self protective strategy i e the increased protein production could encapsulate the microorganisms that exited in sludge flocs and adhered to the membrane fouling layer and thus protect themselves from the toxicity of smx and tc 3 2 spatial and temporal distribution of args and int1 in the mbr system with the increasing smx and tc additions 3 2 1 spatial distribution of args in the activated sludge in the inoculated sludge taken from quyang sewage treatment plant shanghai china thirteen genes including three sulfonamide resistance genes suli sulii and suliii six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tetm teto tetq and tetx two erythromycin resistance genes erea and ereb and two integrase genes int1 and int2 were found to be present in relatively high abundance then these thirteen genes were targeted and amplified by pcr to access their abundance in the present study moreover to evaluate the potential and possibility of antibiotics co selection effects on the proliferation of args against different types of antibiotics abundance of erythromycin resistance genes erea were also evaluated among which five typical arg subtypes suli sulii tetc tetx and erea with high detection frequencies in pcr along the various processes were further quantified using qpcr technology the tested args were present in the influent and prevailed through each stage of the studied mbr system fig 4 and fig s1 the relative abundance of args in the activated sludge increased after the antibiotic additions fig 4 a and c which implied an enrichment of args in the mbr system under antibiotic pressure moreover the absolute abundance of most tested genes was significantly higher in the activated sludge than that in the influent and the effluent during the whole experimental period except for the tetx subtype the arg abundances in the effluent remained roughly unchanged during the whole experimental period despite a great increase in the arg absolute abundance of the activated sludge with the antibiotic additions fig 4 which provides clear evidences of the robust performance of the mbr in arg removals in the influent the absolute abundance of tetx was the highest among the args tested fig 4b and d the concentration of each arg in the influent fluctuated less than 16 during the whole experimental period except for tetc which decreased by 25 from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 4b and d in the effluent liquid samples the absolute abundances of tetc and tetx in stage 3 were 3 62 105 and 1 15 107 copies ml 1 respectively increasing by one order of magnitude after the antibiotic additions fig 4b and d the presence of tc caused proliferation and enrichment of the corresponding resistance determinants in the mbr system leading to an increase in the tet r the sum of tetracycline resistance genes concentration in the effluent for the activated sludge samples after being exposed to smx and tc the relative abundance of most tested arg subtypes showed a significant increase during both anoxic and aerobic reaction processes fig 4a and c in the anoxic unit the relative abundances of suli tetc and erea in the activated sludge increased by 0 9 0 6 and 0 8 orders of magnitude respectively from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 4a and c the relative abundances of the other two subtypes sulii and tetx both decreased by 0 1 order of magnitude in the anoxic unit which was not a significant change fig 4a and c in the subsequent aerobic unit the relative abundance of each tested arg subtype in the activated sludge increased by over 0 5 orders of magnitude expect for tetc which only increased by 0 03 orders of magnitude from stage 1 to stage 3 du et al 2015 also reported that in a municipal wastewater treatment plant with a a2 o mbr system the relative abundance of the tested args increased in the mbr tank the absolute abundance of args decreased in both anaerobic effluent and anoxic effluent but increased in the aerobic effluent and ultimately declined in the mbr effluent 3 2 2 the arg abundance of the activated sludge in the aerobic unit over experimental period the variations in the arg abundances of the activated sludge in the aerobic unit were systematically studied along with the increasing antibiotic additions to identify correlations between antibiotics and arg abundance with exposure time to antibiotics the additions of smx and tc mainly caused increases in the relative abundance of suli tetc and int1 with the extended experimental time fig 5 specifically the predominant arg subtypes were suli in stage 1 days 1 232 tetc in stage 2 days 233 242 while in stage 3 days 243 275 suli and tetc jointly occupied the dominant portion of the antibiotic resistance profile in the activated sludge fig 5 in stage 1 without exposure to antibiotic stress both the overall relative abundance of arg subtypes and each arg subtype in the activated sludge decreased with operating time fig 5a because no antibiotic resistance selective pressure was exerted on the bacterial community in stage 1 after the antibiotic additions in stages 2 and 3 the overall relative abundance of all tested args increased by 0 9 orders of magnitude from 0 07 at the end of stage 1 day 232 to 0 51 at the end of stage 3 day 275 also the individual relative abundance of most tested arg subtypes generally increased from day 233 to day 275 stages 2 3 the most remarkable increase occurred in the relative abundance of tetc which increased from an average of 8 30 10 4 in stage 1 days 1 232 to 1 12 10 1 on average in stage 2 days 235 242 increasing by over 2 orders of magnitude fig 5a in other words the relative abundance of tetc compared with that of the all target args increased by 56 after the antibiotic additions fig 5b indeed after acclimation to a long term of antibiotics exposure the proliferation of args occurred in the activated sludge it was reported that over the course of one year operation of anaerobic sbrs the concentrations of the tested args encoding tetracycline sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin increased in the activated sludge aydin et al 2015 3 2 3 correlations between different arg subtypes and int1 in the activated sludge it has been universally acknowledged that args can be transferred very rapidly and widely between microorganisms that are present in the environment through mobile genetic elements such as plasmids integrons and transposons in surface waters soils wang et al 2013 xu et al 2011 and wwtps ben shahar et al 2012 the existence of int1 integrase gene of class 1 integrons a genetic platform for arg capture could be considered as an indicator of the intercellular transfer potential of antibiotic resistance berendonk et al 2015 correspondingly the relative abundance of the tested genes could determine the potential for intercellular arg proliferation and the antibiotic resistance level of microorganisms in samples in the present study the absolute abundance of int1 increased by 0 6 orders of magnitude after the antibiotic additions from day 233 to day 275 fig 4b and d which provided a clear evidence of the high potential for horizontal gene transfer in the activated sludge of the studied mbr under antibiotic stress there was a positive correlation between the enrichment of args and int1 relative abundance table 1 specifically a strongly significant correlation was observed between the relative abundance of int1 and suli p 0 01 table 1 and a significant correlation was observed between int1 and tetc p 0 05 table 1 the overall relative abundance of sul subtypes and tet subtypes were determined as sul r and tet r respectively notably both sul r and tet r showed significant positive correlations with int1 implying the importance of horizontal transfer in their proliferation table 1 moreover erea and sul r were significantly correlated with each other table 1 suggesting that these arg subtypes might be co occurring or co selected by mobile genetic elements in the studied mbr system our findings illustrated that antibiotic stress on the bacterial community could promote the potential for horizontal gene transfer and then increase the resistant proportion of the bacterial community through environmental selection in wastewater treatment processes 3 3 cooperation of membrane and its foulants for effective removals of args it is known that the main mechanism of arg removals in mbr systems is related to the separation and retention of microorganisms by the membrane module i e args mostly exist in the intracellular form and can be effectively retained by the membrane several studies confirmed that the microbial removal capacity of mbr systems is more effective than that of conventional activated sludge treatment systems marti et al 2011 ottoson et al 2006 indicating that mbr processes are favorable for arg removals over conventional activated sludge systems because most args are located in bacterial intracellular genomes it is noteworthy that the arg distribution in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process fig 6 this portion of the total arg distribution in mbr systems has been neglected in previous studies but it can substantially contribute to arg removals in membrane treatment systems and should no longer be neglected we deduced that there are two functions of appropriate membrane fouling fig 7 despite the fact that severe membrane fouling can lead to the membrane pore blocking 1 appropriate membrane fouling can reduce the effective pore size of the membrane and thus favor the retention of more microorganisms or even smaller size dna fragments 2 eps and or smp contained in the foulants can retain a portion of free args such as extracellular args which effectively prevents a part of the args leaking from the membrane 3 3 1 fouling induced reduction of the effective pore size of the membrane in the mbr system the size of activated sludge flocs was in the range of 0 05 1 0 mm data not shown which is larger than the pore size 0 1 0 4 μm of membranes that are widely used in wastewater treatment luxmy et al 2000 a single bacterium of 0 5 1 0 μm is likely to pass through the membrane pores 0 1 0 4 μm especially when the membrane is damaged or eroded by backflushing or chemical cleaning grady et al 2011 judd 2010 moreover dna is a long thin and flexible molecule breazeal et al 2012 commonly 1 kb of dna is 0 34 μm long with 100 helical turns madigan et al 1997 and 1 nm in diameter for double stranded dna heng et al 2004 therefore free args a form of dna could hypothetically squeeze length wise through a membrane pore breazeal et al 2012 thus posing a potential human health risk the sem images of the membrane cross section proved that some membrane pores were partially blocked with the fouling matters fig 2f thus reducing the effective pore size this provides the possibility for the mbr system to retain free args fig 7 and thus reduce their potential eco environmental risk 3 3 2 mechanism of retention of args by eps and smp in the foulants the potential of eps and smp to retain free microbial cells and dna including free antibiotic resistant bacteria and args should also be considered in the contribution of membrane foulants to arg removals fig 7 there are three possible reasons why eps and smp have good capacity to retain antibiotic resistant bacteria and args first the high molecular weight and cross linked structural properties of eps and smp could lead to binding with microbial cells through complex interactions such as ion bridging interaction hydrophobic interaction and polymer entanglement to form a vast net like structure with plenty of water ding et al 2015 liu et al 2004 wang et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 reported that amphoteric eps and smp containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups in the molecular structure contributed to the separation and retention ability of foulants second the presence of colloids in wastewater systems could enhance the retention of args a previous study reported significant removals of args by membranes of 100 kda and smaller and the presence of wastewater colloids resulted in enhanced removals by larger pore size membranes which means that wastewater colloid arg interactions could facilitate arg removals by membranes breazeal et al 2012 third the possible changes in protein structure of eps and smp could be favorable for arg removals by the membrane module it was reported that amino acid compositions and secondary structures of protein in eps significantly contributed to hydrophobic interactions hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 which could further influence the adsorption ability of eps xu et al 2013 reported that eps production was not significantly influenced by sulfamethazine at 500 μg l 1 in an aerobic activated sludge system with a liquid suspended solids concentration of 2 5 g l 1 but the presence of sulfamethazine led to changes in the secondary structure of protein in eps it is possible in this study that a variation of the stretch degree for peptide chains of protein in eps and smp might be favorable for arg removals by the fouling layer possibly because of an increase in surface area available for arg retention in this study the smp and eps contents in the membrane foulants exhibited significant correlations with the arg absolute abundances in the foulants the absolute abundance of suli and tetx in foulants was significantly correlated with contents of both eps and smp table 2 specifically the protein component in eps of membrane foulants was significantly correlated with the absolute abundance of most of the tested genes in membrane foulants table 2 the protein and polysaccharide contents in both eps and smp showed more significant correlations with arg absolute abundance than with that of humic acid it is noteworthy that the absolute abundance of int1 only showed correlations with eps rather than with smp the significant correlations between the protein and polysaccharide contents of the eps and the overall eps contents with int1 the absolute abundance confirmed the important role of eps in int1 removal by the membrane process taken together combining the properties of bacterial binding and the potential to adsorb free args of eps and smp with the results of pearson correlation analysis in this study table 2 it could be speculated that eps and smp in membrane foulants played a vital role in reduction of antibiotic resistance level in the membrane effluent 3 4 robust performance of mbrs in the antibiotic resistance reduction 3 4 1 effective reduction of antibiotic resistance in the mbr although both the absolute abundance and the relative abundance of the tested args increased in the activated sludge of the aerobic membrane tank after the antibiotic additions in stages 2 and 3 section 3 2 fig 6 the arg removal performance of the membrane module arg log reduction of the membrane module eq 1 remained stable or even increased for several of the args during the experimental period fig 6b and d specifically the absolute abundance of suli decreased in the effluent although it increased in the activated sludge in the final aerobic unit membrane foulants and the polluted membrane after the additions of smx and tc fig 6b and d a similar trend was also observed for the distribution of the absolute abundance of erea in the membrane module treatment process fig 6b and d the absolute abundance of erea in the activated sludge of the aerobic tank and the membrane foulants increased by 0 5 and 0 7 orders of magnitude respectively after the additions of smx and tc while it remained roughly stable in the effluent moreover the overall absolute abundance of all tested args in the activated sludge increased from 3 29 109 copies ml 1 in stage 1 to 5 85 109 copies ml 1 in stage 3 while that in the effluent generally remained stable during the experimental period ranging from 7 54 106 copies ml 1 to 6 43 106 copies ml 1 fig 6b and d notably the sum of the total arg concentrations in both the membrane and foulants increased by 0 4 orders of magnitude in stage 3 with increases of 0 3 and 0 6 orders of magnitude in the polluted membrane and the foulants respectively fig 6b and d the above results imply that the cooperation of the membrane and the foulants contributed to the effective removals of args by the membrane module membrane filtration could play an important role in the retention of bioflocs and most free bacteria in wastewater the risk of the leakage of free args and free bacteria through membrane pores should not be ignored although it might be remedied by the foulants deposited on the membrane 3 4 2 contribution of membrane foulants to arg removals considering the size of membrane pores 0 1 μm in the present study is larger than that of dna molecules membrane foulants deposited on the membrane modules could reduce the effective pore size and therefore favor the efficient removal of free args in wastewater fig 7 from this point of view the high contents of eps and smp in membrane foulants induced by antibiotic pressure might have promoted arg removal efficiencies of the membrane module in other words the contribution of the membrane module to arg removals might have been promoted after the additions of smx and tc fig 6b and d sem images of the membrane surface confirmed that the fouling layer of which the main components are smp and eps became denser and more compact after the additions of smx and tc fig 2f and h although the increased foulant content induced by the antibiotic additions caused severe membrane fouling in the mbr its indispensable impact on the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and free args should not be ignored as mentioned in section 3 1 2 the increase in the eps and smp production under antibiotic stress was closely related to the microbial self protective strategy to protect the microorganisms from the toxicity of smx and tc table 2 microorganisms secreted more eps and smp in response to antibiotic stress with higher production of protein when compared with that of polysaccharide and humic acid fig 3 this increased eps production and especially the increased protein production stimulated by the smx and tc stress might have favored arg removals in the membrane treatment process because the dense fouling layer and the membrane per se could constitute a dual barrier against the leakage of args from the treatment system indeed the arg distribution analysis revealed that 13 25 of args in the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process was contained in the membrane foulants fig 6 membrane treatment technology is a promising method for managing the public health risks of args in wastewater effluents arg removals might even be enhanced by colloids in real world wastewaters pruden 2014 riquelme breazeal et al 2013 the colloidal foulants in mbr originate from feed substrate the release from cell lysis and the excretion of microorganism barker and stuckey 1999 our findings provide a fundamental insight into the vital role of membrane foulants in arg removals in mbr systems the removal of various args were significantly correlated with the protein polysaccharide and total contents of the eps and smp matrix although severe membrane fouling could be a challenge for mbr treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater the robust arg removals achieved by the mbr system in this study provides a promising treating process for controlling arg pollution in the environment to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that provides a comprehensive profile of the arg distribution in mbr systems including membrane foulants and elucidates the possible mechanisms of arg removals in the mbr system considering the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the demonstrated links between wwtps and args in receiving environments knowledge of arg removal mechanism in membrane processes would support the development of mbr treatment for more efficient and widespread utilization in wwtps 4 conclusions for the first time the distribution of args and removal capacity of a mbr using flat sheet membrane have been systemically examined after antibiotics exposure smx and tc paying special attention to the characteristics of membrane foulants and their contribution to arg removals the following conclusions can be delivered 1 although the smx and tc additions increased arg abundance by 0 5 1 4 orders of magnitude in the activated sludge and membrane fouling layer the arg removal performance of the membrane module was robust with the abundance of removed args in the range of 0 6 5 6 orders of magnitude 2 antibiotic residues could promote the potential for horizontal gene transfer through exerting antibiotic stress on the bacterial community in the mbr system and then increase the resistant proportion of the bacterial community through environmental selection in wastewater treatment processes 3 the distribution of args in membrane foulants accounted for 13 25 of the total absolute abundance of all tested samples in the mbr process under antibiotics stress 4 both the contents and components of smp and eps in membrane foulants were significantly correlated with arg abundance in foulants specifically protein and polysaccharide in both eps and smp showed more significant correlations with arg absolute abundance than with that of humic acid which provided solid evidences that membrane foulants indeed played an important role in arg removals during membrane treatment acknowledgements this work was supported by the national

19808,removal of nitrogen mainly in form of ammonium nh4 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a highly energy demanding process mainly due to aeration it causes costs of about half a million euros per year in an average european wwtp alternative more economical technologies for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater are required this study proves the complete anoxic conversion of ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas n2 in continuously operated bioelectrochemical systems at the litre scale the removal rate is comparable to conventional wwtps with 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 with low accumulation of no2 no3 n2o in contrast to classical aerobic nitrification the energy consumption is considerable lower 1 16 0 21 kwh kg 1 n being more than 35 times less than for the conventional

introduction wastewater treatment is a highly energy demanding process the removal of organic matter and nitrogen mainly ammonium nh4 as the main hazardous products in sewages is necessary for protecting the quality of the water bodies duce et al 2008 activated sludge treatment is the main process for treating organic matter and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 during conventional nitrification ammonium is oxidized aerobically to nitrite nitritation and then to nitrate nitritation by two functional groups of microorganisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob alternatively complete nitrification from ammonium to nitrate is performed by single microorganisms van kessel et al 2015 subsequently nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen gas usually heterotrophically using organic carbon as electron source the most relevant steps for nitrogen removal are schematically summarized in fig a2 see app a3 for details in wastewater treatment plants wwtps about 4 6 kwh kg 1n are required for aeration ekman et al 2006 this energy consumption sums up to about half a million euros per year in an average european wwtp

wwtp without considering the costs of the organic matter addition for denitrification horan et al 1994 an alternative approach for nitrogen removal is the use of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria kartal et al 2004 these bacteria can oxidize ammonium using nitrite as electron acceptor to mainly dinitrogen gas and some nitrate fig a2 the anammox process can deal with increasing nitrogen loads in a cost effective way in respect to the conventional treatment kuenen 2008 ni et al 2012 however the growth of anammox bacteria is relatively slow doubling time of 15 30 days which could be optimized to 3 days when the adequate cultivation conditions are imposed e g low solid retention time lotti et al 2015 moreover the limits of the operational conditions are narrow temperature ph and a previous aerobic nitritation process to obtain nitrite is required jetten et al 2009 the anammox technology is established with 109 full scale installations operating in the world in 2014 75 for side stream treatment of municipal wastewater lackner et al 2014 but still the stable supply of appropriate nitrite levels is the most challenging factor ma et al 2016 moreover remaining intermediate products as nitrite and nitrate entail additional treatments of the effluent avoiding the disadvantages of the so far established technologies microbial electrochemical technologies that are realized in bioelectrochemical systems bes are suggested as an alternative technology also to remove nitrogen schröder et al 2015 in this case the anode can serve as alternative electron acceptor and substitute oxygen and therewith the cost intensive aeration for nitrification so far studies investigating ammonium removal in bes were either performed under aerated conditions feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a 2013b zhan et al 2012 virdis et al 2010 or were missing controls for oxygen production qu et al 2014 or resulted in an uncomplete nitrogen balance when anoxic conditions were claimed zhan et al 2014 furthermore the dependency of the anoxic ammonium removal on electrochemical activity has never been proven and mechanistic knowledge on potential electron transfer reactions and the involved microorganisms is missing so far in addition to these bes studies the recent finding of natural anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction in soils feammox zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2012 supports the potential of an ammonium removal strategy based on bes this study shows for the first time that nitrifying bes nibes can perform the complete conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen for application relevant ammonium concentrations in continuous mode and under anoxic conditions moreover the electrochemical dependency of the different nitrogen species conversion steps is investigated and the thermodynamics for anodic ammonium oxidation are elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup three replicates of dual chamber bes reactors nibes were constructed identically and operated to remove nitrogen compounds under anoxic conditions fig 1 each nibes was a two chamber reactor with granular graphite model 00514 diameter 4 mm enviro cell germany bed packed anode electron acceptor electrode and cathode electron donor electrode which decreased the liquid volumes to 0 46 0 01 l net anodic compartment nac and 0 37 0 01 l net cathodic compartment ncc respectively see app a2 1 for technical details both compartments were separated by an anion exchange membrane ami 7001 membranes international inc usa in order to remove ammonium in the anode compartment the anode potential was set to 0 8 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she with potentiostatic control sp 50 and vmp3 bio logic france and ph 7 7 meanwhile the cathode produced hydrogen 2 1 1 inoculation and medium the anode compartments of the potentiostatically controlled nibes were inoculated with a sludge mixture of an aerobic nitrifying reactor from a wwtp in girona spain 20 of nac and a partial nitrifying reactor 20 of nac gabarró et al 2012 while the cathodes were inoculated with sludge from a denitrifying bes 40 of ncc pous et al 2013 in closed loop mode a 2 l tank was used during the inoculation while the anodic compartments contained buffer solution with ammonium and sludge the cathodic compartments contained only buffer solution with sludge after 7 days the sludge from the medium was removed and the operational conditions changed from closed loop mode to continuous mode 1 l d 1 after 17 days the current density increased and the ammonium removal in the reactors started thereby finishing the conditioning phase and marking the beginning of the operational period the anode and cathode compartment were fed with a buffer solution containing 1 2 g nahco3 10 mm pbs 1 34 g l 1 na2hpo4 and 0 30 g l 1 kh2po4 0 5 g nacl 0 1 g mgso4 7 h2o 0 015 g cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml of trace element solution rabaey et al 2005 per litre of deionized water the buffer solution of the anode compartment contained additionally 0 39 g l 1 nh4cl equivalent nitrogen concentration of 100 mg n l 1 the buffer solution was sparged with helium he for 15 min prior feeding an oxygen probe model 6050 oxygen detection limit 0 1 mg o2 l 1 mettler toledo usa was introduced in the medium while sparging to ensure anoxic conditions inside the solution fig a1 2 1 2 running conditions after a conditioning phase of 17 days the reactors were operated potentiostatically under constant flow anoxic helium sparged buffer solution with 100 mg n l 1 of ammonium was continuously supplied at 1 l d 1 in the anode compartment this ammonium concentration corresponds to upper nitrogen peak concentration detected in municipal wwtps which normally operate at lower values below 60 mg n l 1 puig et al 2010 three different flow rates were applied under constant flow conditions 1 00 0 50 and 0 25 l d 1 model 2058 watson marlow united kingdom and an internal recirculation loop 60 l d 1 model 323 e d watson marlow united kingdom was placed in each compartment accordingly the nitrogen loading rate was 223 18 g n m 3 d 1 for the main experimental period 42 days flow rate 1 00 l d 1 followed by 110 6 g n m 3 d 1 27 days flow rate 0 50 l d 1 and 54 2 g n m 3 d 1 32 days flow rate 0 25 l d 1 during the flow rate experiments the room temperature was kept constant at 23 2 c 2 2 control experiments different biotic and abiotic control experiments were performed to confirm the anoxic nitrification as a biological process the biotic experiments tested the electrochemical dependency of the process and the role of the nitrifying community for this reason open circuit voltage ocv without applied anode potential the anode does not serve as electron acceptor buffer solution without electron donor and specific inhibition allylthiourea atu experiments were performed in the ocv tests the anode potential was changed from closed circuit voltage conditions ccv fixing the anode potential at 0 8 v vs she to ocv for a period of 4 days while all other process parameters were unchanged as before the anode compartment was continuously fed at 1 l d 1 with buffer solution containing ammonium 100 mg n l 1 the ammonium concentration in the effluent was analysed at the beginning of the ocv period and after 4 days to investigate the dependency of the current density on the ammonium removal the influent ammonium concentration was gradually decreased from 100 mg n l 1 to 0 mg n l 1 by feeding the anode compartment solely with buffer solution without ammonium for 12 days at 1 l d 1 the anode potential was kept at 0 8 v vs she as before to test if the electricity driven anoxic ammonium oxidation was performed by nitrifying microorganisms their activity was inhibited by using allylthiourea atu a specific inhibitor of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo by chelating copper iizumi et al 1998 shiemke et al 2004 lehtovirta morley et al 2013 over 6 days 0 01 m of atu 98 sigma aldrich usa was added continuously with the ammonium containing buffer solution to two reactors moreover abiotic experiments were performed in batch mode applying the same recirculation flow rate as the biotic nibes oxygen production and membrane nitrogen transference no3 no2 nh4 were evaluated under ocv and at 0 8 v vs she in order to ensure anoxic conditions and measure the potential nitrogen removal from the anode compartment due to diffusion and electromigration see app a4 1 and a4 2 for details 2 3 microcosm experiments for investigating the electrochemical dependency of the different nitrogen species conversion steps tailor made single compartment bes microcosms were set up in glass tubes with a final working volume of 15 ml they contained a working and a counter electrode graphite rods cp graphite gmbh wachtberg germany with a projected surface area of 6 68 cm2 and an ag agcl reference electrode sat kcl se11 sensortechnik meinsberg germany microcosms were inoculated using 3 ml of inoculum from one nibes anode effluent and 12 ml of fresh medium based on buffer solution and were flushed daily with dinitrogen the anodic potential was fixed at 0 6 v vs she this anode potential was chosen to be lower than the parent nibes to exclude production of traces of oxygen once a stable current density was reached the medium was replaced with fresh one to remove planktonic cells and to ensure that the observations were related to the activity of cells attached to the electrode biofilm different buffer solutions were tested containing i nh4 ii nh2oh iii no2 iv nh4 nh2oh v nh2oh no2 vi nh4 no2 vii nh4 nh2oh no2 and viii buffer solution under anoxic and aerobic conditions between the different solutions the setup was rinsed a couple of times with anoxic buffer solution without any nitrogen compounds all media were applied under anoxic conditions flushing the microcosm for 10 min with dinitrogen before the experiment was started additionally aerobic conditions were tested and an abiotic microcosm without inoculation was included as control cyclic voltammetry cv was applied to identify potential extracellular electron transfer eet sites of the microbial cells attached to the anode under all conditions cv scans were performed at 1 mv s 1 in the range of 0 20 v and 0 83 v vs she four cv cycles were performed in each routine but only data from the last steady state cycle is shown cv data was analysed with soas software19 to identify the oxidation and reduction peaks fourmond et al 2009 2 4 chemical analyses liquid phase standard measurements for nitrogen compounds were performed at regular intervals according to the american public health association guidelines apha 2005 samples were obtained from the anode and cathode influent and effluent sections of the nibes reactors the ion concentration was determined using an ion chromatograph dionex ic5000 vertex technics spain equipped with a conductivity detector gas samples were taken from a methacrylate column installed occasionally on the effluent section the samples were analysed with a gas chromatograph 7820a gc system agilent spain equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and molesieve column agilent spain see app a2 3 and a2 4 for details 2 5 microbial characterization for molecular fingerprinting and sequencing samples from one nibes anode compartment were collected from the anode effluent and scratched from the graphite granules surface using a needle the samples were stored at 20 c dna extraction pcr amplification t rflp analysis and sequencing of 16s rdna were done according to koch et al 2014 for fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the microbial cells attached to the graphite surface were dislodged in an ultrasonic bath p selecta after the detachment the microbial samples were fixed and hybridized vilajeliu pons et al 2015 general and specific fluorescent probes were used to characterize the microbial community see app table a6 a7 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal performances at different flow rates all reactors showed anoxic autotrophic ammonium removal of 17 1 mg n l 1 which is 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 n 3 fig 2 table 1 gas analyses proved that 97 of removed ammonium in the anode compartment was subsequently transformed to the final product dinitrogen gas n2 in the same compartment over an operational period of 42 days table 1 the potential intermediate greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o was not detected while nitrite and nitrate were found only in low concentrations with maximum values of 0 45 mg n l 1 and 0 05 mg n l 1 respectively the increment of the ammonium removal rate correlating with the current density r2 0 78 fig 3 and the coulombic efficiency ce i e the electron yield koch and harnisch 2016 of 35 13 demonstrated the microbial electroactivity of the community noteworthy volatilization of ammonium was below 1 of the ammonium removed at the operational ph 7 7 migration through the anion exchange membrane was non existent for ammonium and negligible for nitrite and nitrate at the present concentrations app a4 2 once all three nibes reached a stable performance around 42 days different flow rates 1 00 0 50 and 0 25 l d 1 table 1 were compared to better understand the bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation process for future engineering similar ammonium removal rates of around 35 g n m 3 d 1 were achieved at 1 00 and 0 50 l d 1 table 1 see app a2 4 and a5 for details however the highest ammonium removal efficiency of 32 5 was achieved at 0 50 l d 1 and the ce was the highest at the lowest flow ces of 50 17 at 0 25 l d 1 the removal rate was reduced to 9 3 g n m 3 d 1 at 0 25 l d 1 these results show that even though the flow increased the treatment ability was not influenced although not directly comparable the removal rates are twice the number of a previously reported value under batch conditions in the study of qu et al 2014 ammonium conversion to nitrate was found at 17 g n m 3 d 1 ce of 33 working at a similar ammonium concentration however the anoxic conditions of the experiment were not ensured in a different study in which anoxic conditions were ensured 41 of the ammonium was converted to dinitrogen gas at a rate of 12 g n m 3 d 1 at 140 mgn l 1 influent concentration ce of 80 zhan et al 2014 which is only 37 5 of the ammonium removal rate achieved in the current experiments however nibes worked at application relevant ammonium removal rates being in the range of conventional treatments the ammonium removal was limited to maximum 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 with the current reactor design due to the appearance of preferential flows inside the compartment confirmed after computational fluid dynamics cfds modelling vilà rovira et al 2015 the optimization of the hydrodynamic design can improve the ammonium removal rate and treatment efficiency of the nibes the reduction of dead zones and preferential flows together with high surface availability for biomass attachment will increase the anode performance and are therefore suggested for improved reactor design 3 2 reactor performance during different control tests the idea of a potential bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation has been stated before qu et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 but had been only sparsely investigated to date e g in single reactors without any systematic investigations of the impact of electrochemical oxygen production or the formation of different nitrogen intermediates most importantly controls regarding the electrochemical dependency of the process as well as mechanistic knowledge are missing so far in order to verify the anoxic ammonium oxidation in the anode compartment of the three nibes respective control experiments were performed when applying open circuit voltage conditions ocv the anode does not serve as electron acceptor the observed ammonium removal rate was only 0 6 g n m 3 d 1 this value represents 1 7 of the ammonium removal rate under closed circuit voltage which was 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 table 1 this shows that there is a clear dependency of the anoxic ammonium removal from the applied anode potential this provides a clear indication that the ammonium removal was related to microbial electroactivity moreover when decreasing the influent ammonium concentration gradually from 100 to 0 mg n l 1 the current density decreased also gradually from 4 6 0 6 ma l 1 to 0 4 0 1 ma l 1 fig 4 supporting that the electrochemical activity was related to ammonium removal i e nh4 serving as electron donor the background current of 0 4 0 1 ma l 1 can result from the buffer solution flowing through the electrode bieganowski 2002 and is not coupled to the ammonium removal the experiments above confirmed that the electrochemical activity clearly depends on the anoxic ammonium removal oxygen was excluded as a potential alternative electron acceptor for the observed ammonium oxidation in the nibes because no oxygen production was detected in the abiotic bes app a4 1 3 3 microcosm experiments to further investigate the electrochemical dependency of the bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation as well as a potential electron transfer mechanism reactor samples of the anode compartment were studied in microcosms i e in tailor made single compartment bes pous et al 2014 after a stable current density was reached different buffer solutions with a single or several nitrogen compounds nh4 and or its removal intermediates nh2oh no2 or only buffer without nitrogen species were tested using cyclic voltammetry under anoxic and aerobic conditions n 5 app a6 including abiotic controls the microcosms fed with nh4 under anoxic conditions showed an oxidative peak at 0 73 0 06 v vs she and a reduction peak at 0 53 0 03 v vs she fig 5 table a5 afterwards the medium was changed to nh2oh to investigate the substrate of second nitrifying step in terms of cv analyses an oxidative peak appeared at 0 67 0 08 v vs she and a reduction peak appeared at 0 49 0 06 v vs she the buffer solution with no2 did not result in any peak indicating a lack of electrochemical activity of the nxr enzyme that oxidize no2 to no3 the buffer solution without nitrogen compounds did not result in any peak fig 5 the combination of multiple nitrogen compounds as nh4 nh2oh in the medium resulted in peaks at the same potentials observed with the respective single nitrogen compounds nh4 or nh2oh the abiotic microcosm confirmed that the oxidation of ammonium and hydroxylamine were not chemically catalyzed but biologically from these results it can be concluded that the oxidation of ammonium took place at an oxidative potential of 0 73 0 06 v vs she representing a thermodynamically feasible oxidation cascade to nitrite it is worth noticing that the maximum current density 4 02 0 46 μa cm 2 n 5 in the microcosms was achieved with nh2oh as electron donor whereas nh4 yielded 0 91 0 18 μa cm 2 n 5 and the abiotic control 0 075 μa cm 2 n 1 a potential coupling of ammonium oxidation to an anode was suggested by zhan et al 2014 but the study does not provide any information regarding the individual electrogenic conversion steps of ammonium and the intermediate nitrogen species the results obtained in our study suggest that hydroxylamine not ammonium was the main substrate for the electrochemical oxidation performed by the microorganisms attached to the electrodes 3 4 microbial community identification the microbial community of one nibes was characterized based on 16s rdna analysis the results show a diverse community that integrated members of different functional groups involved in the nitrogen cycle nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas genus anammox bacteria brocardia and kuenenia genera denitrifying bacteria several bacteroidetes and proteobacteria members feammox actinobacteria members and firmicutes were identified inside the anode compartment fig 6 the entire diversity of bacteria was certainly not only involved in the ammonium oxidation we suggest that they contributed to the degradation of intermediate products to dinitrogen e g anammox reaction but also simultaneous cross reactions as well as transfer of metabolites e g amino acids organic carbon compounds this hypothesis is in accordance with the coulombic efficiency 35 13 the high bacterial diversity is in agreement with previous studies on bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation where nitrosomonas europaea was identified as the major contributor to a community together with empedobacter qu et al 2014 or a minor genus in a community dominated by the denitrifying thermomonas zhan et al 2014 to confirm that the anoxic microbial electrochemical ammonium oxidation was performed by nitrifying microorganisms their activity was inhibited by adding allylthiourea atu atu is a well known inhibitor of ammonia oxidizing bacteria after adding atu to the influent the ammonium removal rate was negligible and the current density decreased from 5 2 0 3 ma l 1 to 0 7 0 2 ma l 1 fig 7 table 1 this inhibition lasted for the complete duration of atu addition 6 days during this time also neither intermediate products of ammonium removal nitrite or nitrate nor oxygen or possible oxygen sub products as oxygen peroxide h2o2 were detected verifying the microbial electrochemical activity of the nitrifying microorganisms in summary all experiments clearly showed that electroactive nitrifying microorganisms performed the anoxic autotrophic ammonium oxidation at the anode of nibes with hydroxylamine as the major substrate for the microbially catalyzed electrochemical oxidation as no accumulation of oxidized nitrogen species was found in any of the reactors further conversions to dinitrogen gas were successfully performed due to the microbial diversity in the nibes the contributing reactions were probably a mixture of anammox related reactions kartal et al 2011 van kessel et al 2015 and the activity of denitrifying bacteria by endogenous heterotrophy bernat et al 2008 or by bioelectrochemical denitrification based on interspecies electron transfer or parasitic internal currents respectively harnisch and schröder 2009 rabaey et al 2010 3 5 future applications from the application perspective nibes have to be compared to the conventional treatment strategies in terms of costs table 2 both systems nibes and conventional treatment present the same removal range and treat similar amounts of nitrogen equivalents but nibes allowed the transformation of almost all ammonium to dinitrogen gas 97 without accumulation of intermediates the operational costs of nibes were considered for a flow rate of 0 5 l d 1 to be 0 13 0 09 kwh kg 1n table 2 app a2 4 thus the utilization of a nibes can have a considerable lower energy consumption compared to the classical aerobic nitrification 4 6 kwh kg 1n aymerich et al 2015 since low nitrogen intermediate species as nitrite 0 45 mg n l 1 maximum and nitrate 0 05 mg n l 1 maximum and no nitrous oxide were detected nibes might further possess a toxicological advantage one may even speculate that the application of nibes will simplify the reactor operation in wwtps as neither air dispersers will be required for the oxidation of ammonium to intermediates nor the addition of organic carbon e g methanol to complete the conventional nitrogen treatment the nibes are also advantageous compared to the alternative anammox process 20 years of optimization of the anammox process allowed to reach higher nitrogen removal rates until 9 52 kg n m 3 d 1 phan et al 2017 as well as reduced energetic costs 1 16 0 21 kwh kg 1 n wett 2007 however it requires a previous oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by partial nitritation van dongen et al 2001 that in turn is based on high hydraulic retention times between 4 and 30 days wett 2007 and includes operational challenges ma et al 2016 therefore the easy and fast operational mode of nibes makes it a promising alternative technology to current conventional treatments the further exploration of the anoxic nitrogen removal process in nibes could enhance the treatment capacity of the system in order to be closer to the requirements for application different reactor design or increased electrode surface in order to increase biomass attachment and the substrate distribution could improve the nitrogen removal rates kim et al 2014 vilà rovira et al 2015 moreover a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and balances e g by stable isotope and nanosims analysis musat et al 2012 in future can help to further improve the process however this study already clearly demonstrates a novel and viable methodology to completely convert ammonium to dinitrogen gas under anoxic conditions 4 conclusions we provide proof of concept on a novel technology for the complete anoxic conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen using nitrifying bioelectrochemical systems the electricity driven anoxic ammonium removal was demonstrated in continuously operated reactors at the litre scale at a rate of 35 g n m 3 d 1 and under application relevant flow rates the electrochemical dependency of the process was confirmed and hydroxylamine identified as the main substrate for the microbial electrochemical oxidation a complex microbial community was detected in the nibes with nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas as key organisms for the anoxic ammonium oxidation the bioelectrochemical process requires more than 35 times less energy than the conventional process with aeration and provides further advantages since low nitrite and nitrate intermediate nitrogen species were accumulated and no n2o was detected further reactor and process engineering combined with an elucidation of the underlying microbial and electrochemical mechanisms will be needed to even further improvement accordingly nibes are a promising alternative technology for nitrogen removal in

19808,removal of nitrogen mainly in form of ammonium nh4 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a highly energy demanding process mainly due to aeration it causes costs of about half a million euros per year in an average european wwtp alternative more economical technologies for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater are required this study proves the complete anoxic conversion of

main substrate mid point potential e ox 0 67 0 08 v vs she this article proves the technical feasibility and reduction of costs for ammonium removal from wastewater investigates the underlying mechanisms and discusses future engineering needs graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system nitrogen cycle hydroxylamine microcosm cyclic voltammetry wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment is a highly energy demanding process the removal of organic matter and nitrogen mainly ammonium nh4 as the main hazardous products in sewages is necessary for protecting the quality of the water bodies duce et al 2008 activated sludge treatment is the main process for treating organic matter and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 during conventional nitrification ammonium is oxidized aerobically to nitrite nitritation and then to nitrate nitritation by two functional groups of microorganisms ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob alternatively complete nitrification from ammonium to nitrate is performed by single microorganisms van kessel et al 2015 subsequently nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen gas usually heterotrophically using organic carbon as electron source the most relevant steps for nitrogen removal are schematically summarized in fig a2 see app a3 for details in wastewater treatment plants wwtps about 4 6 kwh kg 1n are required for aeration ekman et al 2006 this energy consumption sums up to about half a million euros per year in an average european wwtp of 200 000 person equivalents with influent flow rates of 5 5 104 m3 d 1 i e costs of 0 58 0 17 kg 1n oxidized see app a2 4 for calculation this is up to one third of the total operational cost of a wwtp without considering the costs of the organic matter addition for denitrification horan et al 1994 an alternative approach for nitrogen removal is the use of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria kartal et al 2004 these bacteria can oxidize ammonium using nitrite as electron acceptor to mainly dinitrogen gas and some nitrate fig a2 the anammox process can deal with increasing nitrogen loads in a cost effective way in respect to the conventional treatment kuenen 2008 ni et al 2012 however the growth of anammox bacteria is relatively slow doubling time of 15 30 days which could be optimized to 3 days when the adequate cultivation conditions are imposed e g low solid retention time lotti et al 2015 moreover the limits of the operational conditions are narrow temperature ph and a previous aerobic nitritation process to obtain nitrite is required jetten et al 2009 the anammox technology is established with 109 full scale installations operating in the world in 2014 75 for side stream treatment of municipal wastewater lackner et al 2014 but still the stable supply of appropriate nitrite levels is the most challenging factor ma et al 2016 moreover remaining intermediate products as nitrite and nitrate entail additional treatments of the effluent avoiding the disadvantages of the so far established technologies microbial electrochemical technologies that are realized in bioelectrochemical systems bes are suggested as an alternative technology also to remove nitrogen schröder et al 2015 in this case the anode can serve as alternative electron acceptor and substitute oxygen and therewith the cost intensive aeration for nitrification so far studies investigating ammonium removal in bes were either performed under aerated conditions feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a 2013b zhan et al 2012 virdis et al 2010 or were missing controls for oxygen production qu et al 2014 or resulted in an uncomplete nitrogen balance when anoxic conditions were claimed zhan et al 2014 furthermore the dependency of the anoxic ammonium removal on electrochemical activity has never been proven and mechanistic knowledge on potential electron transfer reactions and the involved microorganisms is missing so far in addition to these bes studies the recent finding of natural anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction in soils feammox zhou et al 2016 yang et al 2012 supports the potential of an ammonium removal strategy based on bes this study shows for the first time that nitrifying bes nibes can perform the complete conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen for application relevant ammonium concentrations in continuous mode and under anoxic conditions moreover the electrochemical dependency of the different nitrogen species conversion steps is investigated and the thermodynamics for anodic ammonium oxidation are elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup three replicates of dual chamber bes reactors nibes were constructed identically and operated to remove nitrogen compounds under anoxic conditions fig 1 each nibes was a two chamber reactor with granular graphite model 00514 diameter 4 mm enviro cell germany bed packed anode electron acceptor electrode and cathode electron donor electrode which decreased the liquid volumes to 0 46 0 01 l net anodic compartment nac and 0 37 0 01 l net cathodic compartment ncc respectively see app a2 1 for technical details both compartments were separated by an anion exchange membrane ami 7001 membranes international inc usa in order to remove ammonium in the anode compartment the anode potential was set to 0 8 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she with potentiostatic control sp 50 and vmp3 bio logic france and ph 7 7 meanwhile the cathode produced hydrogen 2 1 1 inoculation and medium the anode compartments of the potentiostatically controlled nibes were inoculated with a sludge mixture of an aerobic nitrifying reactor from a wwtp in girona spain 20 of nac and a partial nitrifying reactor 20 of nac gabarró et al 2012 while the cathodes were inoculated with sludge from a denitrifying bes 40 of ncc pous et al 2013 in closed loop mode a 2 l tank was used during the inoculation while the anodic compartments contained buffer solution with ammonium and sludge the cathodic compartments contained only buffer solution with sludge after 7 days the sludge from the medium was removed and the operational conditions changed from closed loop mode to continuous mode 1 l d 1 after 17 days the current density increased and the ammonium removal in the reactors started thereby finishing the conditioning phase and marking the beginning of the operational period the anode and cathode compartment were fed with a buffer solution containing 1 2 g nahco3 10 mm pbs 1 34 g l 1 na2hpo4 and 0 30 g l 1 kh2po4 0 5 g nacl 0 1 g mgso4 7 h2o 0 015 g cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml of trace element solution rabaey et al 2005 per litre of deionized water the buffer solution of the anode compartment contained additionally 0 39 g l 1 nh4cl equivalent nitrogen concentration of 100 mg n l 1 the buffer solution was sparged with helium he for 15 min prior feeding an oxygen probe model 6050 oxygen detection limit 0 1 mg o2 l 1 mettler toledo usa was introduced in the medium while sparging to ensure anoxic conditions inside the solution fig a1 2 1 2 running conditions after a conditioning phase of 17 days the reactors were operated potentiostatically under constant flow anoxic helium sparged buffer solution with 100 mg n l 1 of ammonium was continuously supplied at 1 l d 1 in the anode compartment this ammonium concentration corresponds to upper nitrogen peak concentration detected in municipal wwtps which normally operate at lower values below 60 mg n l 1 puig et al 2010 three different flow rates were applied under constant flow conditions 1 00 0 50 and 0 25 l d 1 model 2058 watson marlow united kingdom and an internal recirculation loop 60 l d 1 model 323 e d watson marlow united kingdom was placed in each compartment accordingly the nitrogen loading rate was 223 18 g n m 3 d 1 for the main experimental period 42 days flow rate 1 00 l d 1 followed by 110 6 g n m 3 d 1 27 days flow rate 0 50 l d 1 and 54 2 g n m 3 d 1 32 days flow rate 0 25 l d 1 during the flow rate experiments the room temperature was kept constant at 23 2 c 2 2 control experiments different biotic and abiotic control experiments were performed to confirm the anoxic nitrification as a biological process the biotic experiments tested the electrochemical dependency of the process and the role of the nitrifying community for this reason open circuit voltage ocv without applied anode potential the anode does not serve as electron acceptor buffer solution without electron donor and specific inhibition allylthiourea atu experiments were performed in the ocv tests the anode potential was changed from closed circuit voltage conditions ccv fixing the anode potential at 0 8 v vs she to ocv for a period of 4 days while all other process parameters were unchanged as before the anode compartment was continuously fed at 1 l d 1 with buffer solution containing ammonium 100 mg n l 1 the ammonium concentration in the effluent was analysed at the beginning of the ocv period and after 4 days to investigate the dependency of the current density on the ammonium removal the influent ammonium concentration was gradually decreased from 100 mg n l 1 to 0 mg n l 1 by feeding the anode compartment solely with buffer solution without ammonium for 12 days at 1 l d 1 the anode potential was kept at 0 8 v vs she as before to test if the electricity driven anoxic ammonium oxidation was performed by nitrifying microorganisms their activity was inhibited by using allylthiourea atu a specific inhibitor of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo by chelating copper iizumi et al 1998 shiemke et al 2004 lehtovirta morley et al 2013 over 6 days 0 01 m of atu 98 sigma aldrich usa was added continuously with the ammonium containing buffer solution to two reactors moreover abiotic experiments were performed in batch mode applying the same recirculation flow rate as the biotic nibes oxygen production and membrane nitrogen transference no3 no2 nh4 were evaluated under ocv and at 0 8 v vs she in order to ensure anoxic conditions and measure the potential nitrogen removal from the anode compartment due to diffusion and electromigration see app a4 1 and a4 2 for details 2 3 microcosm experiments for investigating the electrochemical dependency of the different nitrogen species conversion steps tailor made single compartment bes microcosms were set up in glass tubes with a final working volume of 15 ml they contained a working and a counter electrode graphite rods cp graphite gmbh wachtberg germany with a projected surface area of 6 68 cm2 and an ag agcl reference electrode sat kcl se11 sensortechnik meinsberg germany microcosms were inoculated using 3 ml of inoculum from one nibes anode effluent and 12 ml of fresh medium based on buffer solution and were flushed daily with dinitrogen the anodic potential was fixed at 0 6 v vs she this anode potential was chosen to be lower than the parent nibes to exclude production of traces of oxygen once a stable current density was reached the medium was replaced with fresh one to remove planktonic cells and to ensure that the observations were related to the activity of cells attached to the electrode biofilm different buffer solutions were tested containing i nh4 ii nh2oh iii no2 iv nh4 nh2oh v nh2oh no2 vi nh4 no2 vii nh4 nh2oh no2 and viii buffer solution under anoxic and aerobic conditions between the different solutions the setup was rinsed a couple of times with anoxic buffer solution without any nitrogen compounds all media were applied under anoxic conditions flushing the microcosm for 10 min with dinitrogen before the experiment was started additionally aerobic conditions were tested and an abiotic microcosm without inoculation was included as control cyclic voltammetry cv was applied to identify potential extracellular electron transfer eet sites of the microbial cells attached to the anode under all conditions cv scans were performed at 1 mv s 1 in the range of 0 20 v and 0 83 v vs she four cv cycles were performed in each routine but only data from the last steady state cycle is shown cv data was analysed with soas software19 to identify the oxidation and reduction peaks fourmond et al 2009 2 4 chemical analyses liquid phase standard measurements for nitrogen compounds were performed at regular intervals according to the american public health association guidelines apha 2005 samples were obtained from the anode and cathode influent and effluent sections of the nibes reactors the ion concentration was determined using an ion chromatograph dionex ic5000 vertex technics spain equipped with a conductivity detector gas samples were taken from a methacrylate column installed occasionally on the effluent section the samples were analysed with a gas chromatograph 7820a gc system agilent spain equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and molesieve column agilent spain see app a2 3 and a2 4 for details 2 5 microbial characterization for molecular fingerprinting and sequencing samples from one nibes anode compartment were collected from the anode effluent and scratched from the graphite granules surface using a needle the samples were stored at 20 c dna extraction pcr amplification t rflp analysis and sequencing of 16s rdna were done according to koch et al 2014 for fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the microbial cells attached to the graphite surface were dislodged in an ultrasonic bath p selecta after the detachment the microbial samples were fixed and hybridized vilajeliu pons et al 2015 general and specific fluorescent probes were used to characterize the microbial community see app table a6 a7 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium removal performances at different flow rates all reactors showed anoxic autotrophic ammonium removal of 17 1 mg n l 1 which is 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 n 3 fig 2 table 1 gas analyses proved that 97 of removed ammonium in the anode compartment was subsequently transformed to the final product dinitrogen gas n2 in the same compartment over an operational period of 42 days table 1 the potential intermediate greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o was not detected while nitrite and nitrate were found only in low concentrations with maximum values of 0 45 mg n l 1 and 0 05 mg n l 1 respectively the increment of the ammonium removal rate correlating with the current density r2 0 78 fig 3 and the coulombic efficiency ce i e the electron yield koch and harnisch 2016 of 35 13 demonstrated the microbial electroactivity of the community noteworthy volatilization of ammonium was below 1 of the ammonium removed at the operational ph 7 7 migration through the anion exchange membrane was non existent for ammonium and negligible for nitrite and nitrate at the present concentrations app a4 2 once all three nibes reached a stable performance around 42 days different flow rates 1 00 0 50 and 0 25 l d 1 table 1 were compared to better understand the bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation process for future engineering similar ammonium removal rates of around 35 g n m 3 d 1 were achieved at 1 00 and 0 50 l d 1 table 1 see app a2 4 and a5 for details however the highest ammonium removal efficiency of 32 5 was achieved at 0 50 l d 1 and the ce was the highest at the lowest flow ces of 50 17 at 0 25 l d 1 the removal rate was reduced to 9 3 g n m 3 d 1 at 0 25 l d 1 these results show that even though the flow increased the treatment ability was not influenced although not directly comparable the removal rates are twice the number of a previously reported value under batch conditions in the study of qu et al 2014 ammonium conversion to nitrate was found at 17 g n m 3 d 1 ce of 33 working at a similar ammonium concentration however the anoxic conditions of the experiment were not ensured in a different study in which anoxic conditions were ensured 41 of the ammonium was converted to dinitrogen gas at a rate of 12 g n m 3 d 1 at 140 mgn l 1 influent concentration ce of 80 zhan et al 2014 which is only 37 5 of the ammonium removal rate achieved in the current experiments however nibes worked at application relevant ammonium removal rates being in the range of conventional treatments the ammonium removal was limited to maximum 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 with the current reactor design due to the appearance of preferential flows inside the compartment confirmed after computational fluid dynamics cfds modelling vilà rovira et al 2015 the optimization of the hydrodynamic design can improve the ammonium removal rate and treatment efficiency of the nibes the reduction of dead zones and preferential flows together with high surface availability for biomass attachment will increase the anode performance and are therefore suggested for improved reactor design 3 2 reactor performance during different control tests the idea of a potential bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation has been stated before qu et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 but had been only sparsely investigated to date e g in single reactors without any systematic investigations of the impact of electrochemical oxygen production or the formation of different nitrogen intermediates most importantly controls regarding the electrochemical dependency of the process as well as mechanistic knowledge are missing so far in order to verify the anoxic ammonium oxidation in the anode compartment of the three nibes respective control experiments were performed when applying open circuit voltage conditions ocv the anode does not serve as electron acceptor the observed ammonium removal rate was only 0 6 g n m 3 d 1 this value represents 1 7 of the ammonium removal rate under closed circuit voltage which was 35 10 g n m 3 d 1 table 1 this shows that there is a clear dependency of the anoxic ammonium removal from the applied anode potential this provides a clear indication that the ammonium removal was related to microbial electroactivity moreover when decreasing the influent ammonium concentration gradually from 100 to 0 mg n l 1 the current density decreased also gradually from 4 6 0 6 ma l 1 to 0 4 0 1 ma l 1 fig 4 supporting that the electrochemical activity was related to ammonium removal i e nh4 serving as electron donor the background current of 0 4 0 1 ma l 1 can result from the buffer solution flowing through the electrode bieganowski 2002 and is not coupled to the ammonium removal the experiments above confirmed that the electrochemical activity clearly depends on the anoxic ammonium removal oxygen was excluded as a potential alternative electron acceptor for the observed ammonium oxidation in the nibes because no oxygen production was detected in the abiotic bes app a4 1 3 3 microcosm experiments to further investigate the electrochemical dependency of the bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation as well as a potential electron transfer mechanism reactor samples of the anode compartment were studied in microcosms i e in tailor made single compartment bes pous et al 2014 after a stable current density was reached different buffer solutions with a single or several nitrogen compounds nh4 and or its removal intermediates nh2oh no2 or only buffer without nitrogen species were tested using cyclic voltammetry under anoxic and aerobic conditions n 5 app a6 including abiotic controls the microcosms fed with nh4 under anoxic conditions showed an oxidative peak at 0 73 0 06 v vs she and a reduction peak at 0 53 0 03 v vs she fig 5 table a5 afterwards the medium was changed to nh2oh to investigate the substrate of second nitrifying step in terms of cv analyses an oxidative peak appeared at 0 67 0 08 v vs she and a reduction peak appeared at 0 49 0 06 v vs she the buffer solution with no2 did not result in any peak indicating a lack of electrochemical activity of the nxr enzyme that oxidize no2 to no3 the buffer solution without nitrogen compounds did not result in any peak fig 5 the combination of multiple nitrogen compounds as nh4 nh2oh in the medium resulted in peaks at the same potentials observed with the respective single nitrogen compounds nh4 or nh2oh the abiotic microcosm confirmed that the oxidation of ammonium and hydroxylamine were not chemically catalyzed but biologically from these results it can be concluded that the oxidation of ammonium took place at an oxidative potential of 0 73 0 06 v vs she representing a thermodynamically feasible oxidation cascade to nitrite it is worth noticing that the maximum current density 4 02 0 46 μa cm 2 n 5 in the microcosms was achieved with nh2oh as electron donor whereas nh4 yielded 0 91 0 18 μa cm 2 n 5 and the abiotic control 0 075 μa cm 2 n 1 a potential coupling of ammonium oxidation to an anode was suggested by zhan et al 2014 but the study does not provide any information regarding the individual electrogenic conversion steps of ammonium and the intermediate nitrogen species the results obtained in our study suggest that hydroxylamine not ammonium was the main substrate for the electrochemical oxidation performed by the microorganisms attached to the electrodes 3 4 microbial community identification the microbial community of one nibes was characterized based on 16s rdna analysis the results show a diverse community that integrated members of different functional groups involved in the nitrogen cycle nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas genus anammox bacteria brocardia and kuenenia genera denitrifying bacteria several bacteroidetes and proteobacteria members feammox actinobacteria members and firmicutes were identified inside the anode compartment fig 6 the entire diversity of bacteria was certainly not only involved in the ammonium oxidation we suggest that they contributed to the degradation of intermediate products to dinitrogen e g anammox reaction but also simultaneous cross reactions as well as transfer of metabolites e g amino acids organic carbon compounds this hypothesis is in accordance with the coulombic efficiency 35 13 the high bacterial diversity is in agreement with previous studies on bioelectrochemical ammonium oxidation where nitrosomonas europaea was identified as the major contributor to a community together with empedobacter qu et al 2014 or a minor genus in a community dominated by the denitrifying thermomonas zhan et al 2014 to confirm that the anoxic microbial electrochemical ammonium oxidation was performed by nitrifying microorganisms their activity was inhibited by adding allylthiourea atu atu is a well known inhibitor of ammonia oxidizing bacteria after adding atu to the influent the ammonium removal rate was negligible and the current density decreased from 5 2 0 3 ma l 1 to 0 7 0 2 ma l 1 fig 7 table 1 this inhibition lasted for the complete duration of atu addition 6 days during this time also neither intermediate products of ammonium removal nitrite or nitrate nor oxygen or possible oxygen sub products as oxygen peroxide h2o2 were detected verifying the microbial electrochemical activity of the nitrifying microorganisms in summary all experiments clearly showed that electroactive nitrifying microorganisms performed the anoxic autotrophic ammonium oxidation at the anode of nibes with hydroxylamine as the major substrate for the microbially catalyzed electrochemical oxidation as no accumulation of oxidized nitrogen species was found in any of the reactors further conversions to dinitrogen gas were successfully performed due to the microbial diversity in the nibes the contributing reactions were probably a mixture of anammox related reactions kartal et al 2011 van kessel et al 2015 and the activity of denitrifying bacteria by endogenous heterotrophy bernat et al 2008 or by bioelectrochemical denitrification based on interspecies electron transfer or parasitic internal currents respectively harnisch and schröder 2009 rabaey et al 2010 3 5 future applications from the application perspective nibes have to be compared to the conventional treatment strategies in terms of costs table 2 both systems nibes and conventional treatment present the same removal range and treat similar amounts of nitrogen equivalents but nibes allowed the transformation of almost all ammonium to dinitrogen gas 97 without accumulation of intermediates the operational costs of nibes were considered for a flow rate of 0 5 l d 1 to be 0 13 0 09 kwh kg 1n table 2 app a2 4 thus the utilization of a nibes can have a considerable lower energy consumption compared to the classical aerobic nitrification 4 6 kwh kg 1n aymerich et al 2015 since low nitrogen intermediate species as nitrite 0 45 mg n l 1 maximum and nitrate 0 05 mg n l 1 maximum and no nitrous oxide were detected nibes might further possess a toxicological advantage one may even speculate that the application of nibes will simplify the reactor operation in wwtps as neither air dispersers will be required for the oxidation of ammonium to intermediates nor the addition of organic carbon e g methanol to complete the conventional nitrogen treatment the nibes are also advantageous compared to the alternative anammox process 20 years of optimization of the anammox process allowed to reach higher nitrogen removal rates until 9 52 kg n m 3 d 1 phan et al 2017 as well as reduced energetic costs 1 16 0 21 kwh kg 1 n wett 2007 however it requires a previous oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by partial nitritation van dongen et al 2001 that in turn is based on high hydraulic retention times between 4 and 30 days wett 2007 and includes operational challenges ma et al 2016 therefore the easy and fast operational mode of nibes makes it a promising alternative technology to current conventional treatments the further exploration of the anoxic nitrogen removal process in nibes could enhance the treatment capacity of the system in order to be closer to the requirements for application different reactor design or increased electrode surface in order to increase biomass attachment and the substrate distribution could improve the nitrogen removal rates kim et al 2014 vilà rovira et al 2015 moreover a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and balances e g by stable isotope and nanosims analysis musat et al 2012 in future can help to further improve the process however this study already clearly demonstrates a novel and viable methodology to completely convert ammonium to dinitrogen gas under anoxic conditions 4 conclusions we provide proof of concept on a novel technology for the complete anoxic conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen using nitrifying bioelectrochemical systems the electricity driven anoxic ammonium removal was demonstrated in continuously operated reactors at the litre scale at a rate of 35 g n m 3 d 1 and under application relevant flow rates the electrochemical dependency of the process was confirmed and hydroxylamine identified as the main substrate for the microbial electrochemical oxidation a complex microbial community was detected in the nibes with nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonas as key organisms for the anoxic ammonium oxidation the bioelectrochemical process requires more than 35 times less energy than the conventional process with aeration and provides further advantages since low nitrite and nitrate intermediate nitrogen species were accumulated and no n2o was detected further reactor and process engineering combined with an elucidation of the underlying microbial and electrochemical mechanisms will be needed to even further improvement accordingly nibes are a promising alternative technology for nitrogen removal in

19809,nitrate contamination in ground and surface water is a persistent problem in countries with intense agriculture the transition zone between rivers and their riparian aquifers where river water and groundwater interact may play an important role in mediating nitrate exports as it can facilitate intensive denitrification which permanently removes nitrate from the aquatic system however the in situ factors controlling riparian denitrification are not fully understood as they are often strongly linked and their effects superimpose each other in this study we present the evaluation of hydrochemical and isotopic data from a 2 year sampling period of river water and groundwater in the riparian zone along a 3rd order river in central germany based on bi and multivariate statistics spearman s rank correlation and partial least squares regression we can show that highest rates for oxygen consumption and denitrification in the riparian aquifer occur where the fraction of infiltrated river water and at the same time groundwater temperature are high river discharge and depth to groundwater are additional explanatory variables for those reaction rates but of minor importance our data and analyses suggest that at locations in the riparian aquifer which show significant river water infiltration heterotrophic microbial reactions in the riparian zone may be fueled by bioavailable organic carbon derived from the river water we conclude that interactions between rivers and riparian groundwater are likely to be a key control of nitrate removal and should be considered as a measure to mitigate high nitrate exports from agricultural catchments graphical abstract image keywords riparian zone nitrate contamination nitrate stable isotopes river groundwater

1998 rivett et al 2008 vidon and hill 2004a however denitrification rates in groundwater are not constant in space and time and are controlled by a multitude of factors rivett et al 2008 of key importance is the availability of reactants namely no3 and labile carbon for heterotrophic denitrification gift et al 2010 kaplan and newbold 2000 rivett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 and reduced sulfur and iron ii in the aquifer sediments for chemolithotrophic denitrification knöller et al 2005 schwientek et al 2008 availability of reactants in the riparian zone is facilitated by mixing of waters from different sources and of different chemical composition namely river water with high carbon concentrations and groundwater with high no3 concentrations baker and vervier 2004 hill et al 2000 vervier et al 1993 as solute transport across the river aquifer interface is mainly advective and controlled by the direction and the magnitude of the water fluxes across the river groundwater

of the denitrification process brunke and gonser 1997 diem et al 2013a finally temperature is a crucial control on the activity of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria both the seasonal variability of temperature as well as heat exchange across the river groundwater interface may either stimulate or suppress reaction rates diem et al 2013b rivett et al 2008 vieweg et al 2016 in riparian zones water flux nutrient supply and temperature variability are often interlinked in space and time balestrini et al 2016 ranalli and macalady 2010 for instance high river discharges and high groundwater level often occur during the cold season which in turn coincides with specific solute mobilization and changed river solute concentrations musolff et al 2015 consequently disentangling these factors and their impact on n turn over in riparian zones is challenging during the last decades this problem has been addressed using descriptive methods at different riparian zone types balestrini et al 2016

approach focusing on factors controlling denitrification bu et al 2017 kellogg et al 2005 and typically do not consider hydrochemical and hydrological variables at the same time providing only a limited perspective on the problem in this study we present a unique two year observational data set of spatially and temporally resolved hydrologic isotopic and river and groundwater quality variables which allows a more comprehensive assessment of the interlinked processes and controls governing riparian denitrification samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of the no3 molecule as well as for major ions do and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration simultaneously river discharge and river and groundwater levels were measured we applied bi and multivariate statistics spearman s rank correlation and partial least squares regression to the data to evaluate and rank the key factors that control denitrification activity in riparian groundwater at different distances from the river by doing so we were able to disentangle the mixed effects of seasonal temperature variations potential hydraulic controls such as river groundwater mixing river discharge and groundwater levels this way we can provide a detailed and more comprehensive view with the focus on the spatio temporal variations of aerobic respiration and denitrification and their mechanistic controls in the riparian zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site our field site is located at the selke river in central germany 51 43 37 79 n 11 18 51 0 e which is an intensive test site within the tereno harz central german lowland observatory operated by the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz wollschläger et al 2017 fig 1 a the selke river is part of the bode catchment which was part of studies on catchment scale solute export musolff et al 2015 and n dynamics mueller et al 2016 2015 at the site a 2 km long river reach of the lower selke river the mean annual discharge is 1 5 m3 s during summer base flows can be below 0 1 m3 s highest discharge is typically observed during the spring snow melt season when bankfull discharge at about 15 m3 s and associated sediment movement can occur the selke catchment covers a total area of 456 km2 forests dominate the upper parts of the catchment 35 of the total area while the lowland parts are dominated by agriculture used 53 of the area at the field site which marks the transition from the mountainous upper catchment to the flatter groundwater controlled lower catchment the 2 km long river reach is lined by a strip of riparian vegetation up to 50 m wide consisting of willow and beech trees interspersed with pasture this strip of riparian vegetation is directly bounded by agricultural fields to the north and south of the river geologically the field site is located in the northern harz foreland where sandstones and limestone of the late palaeozoic era permian regional names rotliegend and zechstein and the early mesozoic era triassic regional names buntsandstein and muschelkalk were deposited bachmann et al 2008 during the early and late cretaceous the harz was uplifted and these older sedimentary layers were eroded and steeply tilted dipping towards the north forming the northern harz boundary fault at the field site the selke river has incised into these geological units during the plio and pleistocene and coincidentally deposited alluvial sediments consisting of mainly greywacke and slate stone originating from the central east harz mountains bachmann et al 2008 core samples from the riparian zone obtained from a sonic drill direct push device enabled a characterization of the shallow sedimentary sequence in the riparian zone here an alluvial loam up to 1 2 m thick covers an alluvial aquifer up to 8 m thick the aquifer is built up of alluvial fillings that show a very heterogeneous grain size distribution ranging from silt to cobble fraction with the main fraction of coarse sand to fine gravel the base of the aquifer forms a clay silt layer that acts as an aquitard geophysical surveys at the site electrical conductivity logging direct push injection logging electrical resistivity tomography kirsch 2008 revealed that the thickness of the alluvial aquifer steadily decreases with distance from the selke river hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer material was determined by three repeated salt tracer tests in the riparian zone and sieve analysis of freeze cores taken from the riverbed the resulting k values are in the range of 1 7e 3 to 1 2e 2 m s geometric mean 3 72e 3 m s 2 2 groundwater wells in total 30 wells gwm with an inner diameter of 2 54 and 5 05 cm were drilled with by direct push sonic drill technology the wells next to the river were screened in depths between 2 and 5 m for sampling of the shallow groundwater the wells further away from the river were drilled to depth of up to 10 m below ground all wells were thoroughly developed by intense pumping the geodetic location longitude latitude elevation above sea level of the sampling points were surveyed by a differential gps in combination with a laser tachymeter trimble gps r8 we classify the 30 wells into three distance categories in order to characterize their spatial location in relation to the river these categories are based on three buffer zones covering areas with i less than 25 m distance to the river ii a distance of 25 100 m to the river and iii a distance of more than 100 m to the river the three zones are denoted as gw near gw intermediate and gw distant fig 1b 2 3 groundwater and river water sampling during the sampling period in total 596 groundwater and 94 river water samples were taken groundwater was sampled every four weeks from april 2014 until april 2016 a peristaltic pump was used to extract groundwater from the wells during groundwater pumping water was continuously analyzed for do electrical conductivity ec and ph by a portable multi parameter meter find specifications and uncertainties on these devices in table 1 groundwater samples were taken when those field parameters were steady in time surface water samples of the selke river were taken as grab samples at two locations upstream of the field site and downstream of the intensive field site here field parameters were measured directly in the river water both groundwater and river water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter and stored in a cool and dark place samples for major cations were acidified with nitric acid to prevent cation precipitation and adsorption analysis of the samples was conducted within 48 h after sampling groundwater levels were measured at each sampling date before installing the pump a ltc logger solinst ltc levellogger junior was fixed at the riverbed at the field site and was recording river stage temperature and electrical conductivity at 10 min intervals enabling a construction of a stage discharge relationship for calculating continuous river discharge meteorologic data was available from a federal weather station of the german meteorological service

listed in table 1 2 4 2 stable nitrate isotopes the isotopic signature of the no3 molecule can be used to delineate different no3 sources and to assess the impact of denitrifying activity on the no3 pool the n and oxygen isotope analyses of no3 were conducted on a gasbenchii delta v plus combination thermo after using the denitrifier method to convert no3 to n2o which enabled the simultaneous

statistical methods 2 5 1 linear mixing model in order to calculate the fraction of river water in the riparian groundwater a linear mixing model was used assuming chloride cl as a conservative solute mixing occurs between two independent endmembers mengis et al 1999 pinay et al 1998 which are in our case the river water and the groundwater distant from the river that is not affected by infiltrating river water in red color code in fig 1b the fraction of river water in the riparian groundwater f r i v in each well for each sampling date was calculated by 3 f r i v cl g w cl d i s t cl r i v cl d i s t where cl g w cl r i v and cl d i s t are the cl concentrations in the groundwater wells in between the endmembers in the river water and in the groundwater distant from the river respectively in contrast to the conservatively transported cl no3 is a reactive solute comparison of cl with no3 concentration has been a common tool in riparian studies to investigate potential removal pathways of no3 altman and parizek 1995 mengis et al 1999 pinay et al 1998 a deviation of the no3 concentration from the concentration expected from the linear mixing model could be related to no3 consumption or production by microbial reactions denitrification assimilation nitrification hill 1996 to calculate the no3 deficit or surplus i e the deviation from the expected mixing concentration in each groundwater sample first the theoretical no3 concentration in the groundwater that would be expected by pure conservative mixing no 3 m i x g w can be calculated by using the calculated river water fraction from eq 3 4 no 3 m i x g w no 3 r i v no 3 d i s t f r i v no 3 d i s t where no 3 r i v and no 3 d i s t are the no3 concentrations in the endmembers river water and groundwater distant from the river respectively subsequently the difference between the theoretically no3 concentration from eq 4 and the measured no3 concentration in each well is calculated by 5 δ no 3 g w no 3 m i x g w no 3 g w values higher than zero indicate a net no3 consumption or removal whereas values below zero indicate a no3 production furthermore the no3 deficit as a fraction of theoretical no3 concentration can be calculated as 6 no 3 g w δ no 3 g w no 3 m i x g w the method assumes that cl and no3 follow the same flow paths into the hydrological system furthermore only data sets of cl and no3 concentrations both theoretical and measured can be used that lie between the measured concentrations of the two endmembers 2 5 2 statistical analysis correlation analysis was used to characterize the nonparametric relationships between responding δ15n do and predicting variables e g water temperature discharge and among the predicting variables here we used spearman s rank correlation as concentration and discharge data are often exhibits non normal distributions and non linear relations to each other jawitz and mitchell 2011 based on the rank correlation a subset of predicting variables were used in a multivariate regression approach based on partial least squares regression pls wold et al 2001 by using the covariance structure between the variables this method is robust against collinearity among predicting variables the regression model is evaluated in terms of r2 a ranking of predicting variables defining the magnitude of influence and by the coefficient of each predicting variable defining the direction of influence for the variable ranking the vip value is used variable importance in projection only predicted variables with vip above 1 are considered as important see also musolff et al 2015 for the pls regression variables were log normalized when bivariate relations showed a clear non linear behavior for rank correlation and pls the software environment r was used 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conditions discharge of the river selke responds quickly to precipitation in the catchment and intense rain falls induce strong river discharge events fig 2 a b generally river discharge is highest in the winter and spring season whereas lowest discharges can be observed during late summer with base flow discharges around 0 2 m3 s the warm season may to october of the year 2015 was dryer than the warm season of 2014 which is also reflected in the higher frequency of river discharge events in the year 2014 during the study period five discharge events with peakflows exceeding 4 m3 s were observed groundwater levels in the vicinity of the river are generally shallow with lowest levels during late summer up to 2 m below ground and highest levels during winter 0 5 m below ground in response to intense rain fall and river discharge events groundwater levels respond quickly in the near and intermediate groundwater zone fig 2c this variability decreases with distance from the river and at some distance groundwater levels do not show any river induced variations since depth to groundwater is different at each well location because of the land topography we normalized groundwater levels in each well to the maximum and minimum groundwater levels resulting in groundwater level variations between 0 and 1 the general direction of groundwater flow is parallel to the river in a north easterly direction with little change over the year fig 2d hydraulic head differences between river stage and groundwater levels indicate that sections with river water losses to the aquifer and sections with groundwater gains alternate along the studied 2 km river reach detailed information on the groundwater surface water interaction is provided by the linear mixing model in 3 5 3 2 spatio temporal variation of physicochemical parameters river temperature and river discharge are negatively related at the field site see supporting information fig s1a due to seasonal variations in temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation the seasonal variation in temperature can also be observed in the groundwater but the amplitude is dampened and lagged with increasing distance from the river fig 3 a however mean temperatures are similar between river water and near groundwater and only increase slightly with increasing distance from the river table 2 in 2015 the warm season was on average warmer than the warm season of 2014 indicated by an average river water temperature of 13 16 c of 2014 compared to 14 05 c during 2015 dissolved oxygen concentration in river water is commonly at saturation but varies over the year due to temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in water and hence do is lowest during summer fig 3b this inverse relation of do and temperature is also visible in the near groundwater and the intermediate groundwater but shows only a slight variation in the more distant groundwater fig 3b beside this seasonal signal do increases with distance from the river from 2 mg l next to the river during summer to up to 9 mg l in the groundwater distant from the river table 2 however as the mean temperatures in river water and groundwater are similar the decreased do in the near river groundwater cannot be explained by the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in the river water and is presumably consumed by aerobic reactions the measured ph of the samples did not show a significant temporal variation river water was generally at ph 8 while all groundwater samples show a slightly lower ph of around 7 independent of the distance from river fig 3c table 2 spatio temporal variation of chloride no3 and doc concentrations mean values of cl and no3 in river and groundwater indicate a general increase in concentration from the river towards the distant groundwater fig 3d e table 2 in the river water samples a clear relationship between river discharge cl and no3 concentrations can be observed for cl the concentration decreases with increasing discharge due to dilution see supporting information fig s1b in contrast no3 concentration increases with discharge fig s1c since the highest base flow discharges occur during the cold season november to april and also because most of the discharge events occur during late winter and spring the cl concentration is lowest during winter whereas no3 is lowest during summer fig 3d e these variations in cl and no3 are also visible in the groundwater next to the river but diminish with increasing distance from the river fig 3d e doc concentrations are highest in river water compared to the groundwater concentrations table 2 variability of doc concentrations is lower in groundwater compared to the river water similar to the no3 concentration doc in river water increases with discharge fig s1d and is highest during the cold season fig 3f 3 3 isotopic signature of the no3 molecule in general highest δ15n and δ18o values in the no3 molecule occur in the near and intermediate groundwater zone during the warm season fig 4 a b in contrast the distant groundwater shows a constant and unenriched isotopic signature also river water has very low δ15n and δ18o values but shows a moderate enrichment during the warm season in river water and both in the near and intermediate groundwater a higher enrichment of δ15n and δ18o can be observed during the warm season of the year 2015 compared to the year 2014 where average air and river water temperatures were lower the dual fractionation factor of δ18o δ15n is 0 87 r2 0 80 for all groundwater samples in the near zone and 0 95 r2 0 77 in the intermediate zone fig 4c these factors are in the range of observed dual fractionation factors that indicate denitrification activity kendall and mcdonnell 1998 and have been observed in the many studies using no3 isotopic signatures aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 1990 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 peter et al 2012 for the river water samples and each single well the field based apparent enrichment factors were derived using equation eq 2 the apparent n isotope enrichment factors are in the range of 14 5 to 2 0 in the near groundwater and 6 1 to 0 73 in the intermediate zone a reliable prediction of the actual enrichment factors at the field site is not possible without a proper experimental calibration by column or batch experiments however n isotope enrichment factors for denitrification by groundwater denitrifying bacteria under controlled laboratory conditions have been reported to be in the range of 20 to 15 böttcher et al 1990 knöller et al 2011 as the highest observed apparent enrichment factor at the field site of 14 5 is within that proposed range we assume that it may represent denitrification without much interference of secondary processes any deviation of the observed apparent enrichment factors from this value indicates that additional processes such as mixing nitrification and n assimilation by plants influence the isotopic signature kendall and mcdonnell 1998 mariotti et al 1988 the observed apparent enrichment factor in the distant groundwater of around 1 indicates that denitrification does not have a significant impact here however in the river water small apparent enrichment factors were observed presumably related to the inflow of denitrified groundwater into the river isotopic data of the groundwater shows no evidence of intense nitrification the production of no3 by microbial oxidation of reduced inorganic n which would lead to depleted δ15n values kendall and mcdonnell 1998 the mineralization of organic n from decaying plants and the subsequent nitrification may add an amount of no3 comparable to catchments not affected by agricultural land use a higher extent of nitrification can be expected in the unsaturated zone below the agricultural fields because here inorganic reduced n originating from manure and fertilizer can be oxidized to no3 choi and ro 2003 cook and herczeg 2000 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 which in turn can act as the no3 end member when reaching the saturated zone in the distant groundwater 3 4 river water fractions in groundwater and no3 deficit calculations based on mixing model for 73 of all groundwater samples the mixing model was applicable the rest of the samples were excluded because here cl was temporally lower in the groundwater than in the river water see section 2 5 1 in general the fraction of river water in the groundwater suggests that river water is lost to the southern riparian zone across the entire river length of our field site fig 5 a in contrast the low river water fractions and elevated cl concentrations observed at the northern transect a suggest that here the river is gaining groundwater from the northern bank at this location in the northern part of the meander shaped site at transect b the flow conditions are alternating from losing to gaining conditions depending on the proximity of the well to the river those alternating river groundwater exchange conditions are closely linked to the n isotope signatures and the magnitude of the apparent enrichment factors the higher the river water fraction the higher is the δ15n value and also the magnitude of the apparent enrichment factors fig 5a b c for example at transect c the river is strongly losing water to the aquifer on both sides leading to very high river water fractions in the groundwater and concurrently show highest δ15n values and highest magnitudes of apparent enrichment factors in contrast at sites where the river is gaining groundwater the lowest δ15n and lowest magnitudes of apparent enrichment factors can be observed the theoretical no3 concentrations that would be expected by pure conservative mixing no 3 m i x g w eq 4 are given in fig 6 a a strong no3 deficit is visible for the bulk of the samples in both the near and the intermediate groundwater nevertheless for some sampling points a slight enrichment in no3 concentrations was calculated especially for low no3 concentrations which could indicate some nitrification activity however due to the fact that neither the isotopic data show signs of and the fact that ammonia concentrations were most of the time too low to be detected in groundwater it is unlikely that nitrification is of great importance at our field site in general the absolute values of the no3 concentrations and the no3 deficits are larger in the intermediate groundwater zone than in the near groundwater furthermore the deficit is larger during the warm season than during the cold season again depicting a strong seasonal effect the δ15n values show an increasing enrichment with increasing no3 deficit calculated by the mixing model for both groundwater in near and intermediate distance from the river fig 6b however correlation between the data derived by the two different methods is only on a fair level please note that for the fit with an r2 of 0 37 the three samples with δ15n values above 25 hollow circles in fig 6b were excluded if these three data points of extraordinary δ15n enrichment taken during the late summer 2015 are included goodness of fit is lower at r2 0 20 the reason for the deviation between the no3 deficit calculated by the mixing model and the δ15n enrichment may be due to other processes besides denitrification such as n assimilation by plants or anammox burgin and hamilton 2007 canfield et al 2010 which may lead to subordinated n depletion in the riparian zone compared to denitrification naeher et al 2015 wang et al 2012 3 5 correlation analysis and pls model results lowest do and highest δ15n compositions can be found primarily in the near and intermediate groundwater when temperature is higher than approximately 10 c figs 3a b 4a and 7a b in the river near groundwater the enrichment of δ15n is directly related to anaerobic conditions fig 7c which are required for denitrification in contrast similar temperatures in the distant groundwater did not affect do and δ15n greatly and δ15n composition is insensitive to do concentration thus the proximity to the river is an additional important factor that controls both aerobic respiration and denitrification the fraction of river water in the groundwater f r i v calculated by the linear mixing model provides additional the strongly enriched δ15n isotopic signatures mostly occur when f r i v is high fig 7d during high river discharges the enrichment of δ15n is lower fig 7e this is in line with the slight negative relationship between groundwater levels and the δ15n enrichment indicating that under high groundwater levels the δ15n enrichment is less intense fig 7f spearman s rank correlation table 3 reveals that the dynamics of do and of δ15n are negatively correlated with each other rspear 0 59 and show strong similarities with a set of other variables as well for do groundwater no3 concentrations positive water temperature negative and discharge positive are most important rspear 0 5 we also note weak correlations rspear 0 3 0 5 with distance of

river in more detail we put only those groundwater samples into a partial least square pls regression model where river water was above 80 please find further information to that threshold in the supporting information fig s2 for the pls regression groundwater temperature river discharge normalized groundwater heads and ph were taken as predictors do and δ15n as responding variables the model explained 68 3 of do variance and 67 2 of δ15n variance groundwater temperature only was identified as the most important predictor with a variable importance in prediction vip of 1 see table 4 although river discharge and groundwater temperature are correlated to each other rspear 0 73 table 3 the pls model reveals that groundwater temperature is the dominant control of do and δ15n groundwater temperature alone can explain 67 8 of the variance in do and 66 2 of the variance in δ15n using a simple exponential model in the groundwater samples with a river water fraction of more than 80 4 discussion 4 1 key controlling factors for no3 removal our results suggest an increase of denitrification activity with a growing influence of infiltrating river water on the riparian groundwater but with temperature as a key constraint the strong temperature effect on both do concentration and denitrification has frequently been observed in other studies bu et al 2017 clément et al 2003 dhondt et al 2003 diem et al 2013a peter et al 2012 vieweg et al 2016 low do concentrations are presumably caused by intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration caused by a river borne carbon source diem et al 2013a and secondly by high temperature during the warm season in turn δ15n composition increases with decreasing do concentration fig 7e which is related to the inhibition effect of do on anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification rivett et al 2008 vidon and hill 2004a many studies have reported a threshold in do concentration of around 2 mg l below which denitrification activity strongly increases see review of rivett et al 2008 which is in line with our results fig 7c we found that at losing river sections the highest δ15n values and apparent enrichment factors match the highest river water fractions in the groundwater fig 5 these results clearly indicate that i denitrification activity is highest at losing river sections as indicated by significantly elevated δ15n values and ii at losing river sections our calculated apparent enrichment factors are close to the enrichment factors observed for denitrifying bacteria than at gaining sections this indicates that at losing river sections denitrification is the major process for no3 depletion this positive effect of river proximity on denitrification activity in groundwater has also been observed in other studies addy et al 2002 devito et al 2000 mayer et al 2007 ostrom et al 2002 they hypothesized that this effect was related to the generally higher organic carbon content in the near riparian aquifer compared to the groundwater at increasing distance from the river at our field site this hypothesis can be further corroborated by the strong depletion of do by heterotrophic aerobic respiration of bioavailable carbon from the river in the near stream groundwater zone however further clarification of the potential relationship between bioavailable carbon and denitrification activity is difficult on the basis of our bulk doc concentration data which does not capture the bioavailability of carbon sources in the riparian zone brugger et al 2001 brunke and gonser 1997 hedin et al 1998 leenheer and croué 2003 furthermore the carbon may also be exposed to a potential consumption by aerobic respiration at an unknown rate for an improved evaluation of the relationship between carbon quality and denitrification carbon quality could be analyzed using methods such as parafac eimers et al 2008 kothawala et al 2015 and isotopic signature of 13c in the dissolved inorganic carbon which decreases during heterotrophic denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 hosono et al 2015 lambert et al 2011 4 2 effects of river discharge and groundwater level based on the pls model we observe a weak negative influence of river discharge on do depletion as well as of river discharge on enrichment of δ15n table 4 fig 7e this suggests that reactive activity is lower during high discharges this is in line with previous studies ostrom et al 2002 peter et al 2012 where this effect was attributed to the higher groundwater flow velocities during events leading to a shorter contact time to the sediment containing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findlay 1995 peter et al 2012 valett et al 1996 our data is in line with this hypothesis as the magnitude of hydraulic gradients between river and groundwater show a negative effect on δ15n enrichment we argue that an additional mobilization of carbon during events that may fuel aerobic respiration and denitrification is of only minor importance although a significant mobilization of carbon occurs during events eimers et al 2008 fasching et al 2015 meybeck 1982 musolff et al 2015 it does not necessarily contain a higher content of bioavailable carbon consisting of lower molecular weights like amino acids and organic acids raeke et al 2017 interestingly the pls model further reveals that besides river discharge groundwater levels also show a slightly negative correlation with δ15n enrichment table 4 fig 7f this is in contrast to several other studies which have suggested that during high groundwater levels additional carbon and no3 sources may be mobilized by groundwater tapping into upper soil layers biron et al 1999 creed et al 1996 hill et al 2000 which can result in increased denitrification activities burt et al 2002 gift et al 2010 hefting et al 2004 simmons et al 1992 however groundwater level fluctuations at our field site in the near and intermediate groundwater zone are relatively small 0 6 m and thus additional mobilization of solutes from the upper soil layer is limited 4 3 nitrate removal potential of the riparian zone the fraction of no3 removed from the mass reflected in the initial no3 concentration for each well in the near and the intermediate zone was calculated based on the linear mixing model fig 8 a section 2 5 1 and the isotopic composition combined with the apparent enrichment factor re arranging eq 2 fig 8b section 3 4 a strong seasonality can be observed over time especially for the calculated no3 deficit fraction by the linear mixing model fig 8a here the highest fractions of removal occur during the summer months july to october and in the near groundwater with varying no3 removal fractions between 15 and 75 in the intermediate zone only 20 45 variation can be observed in estimates of no3 removal based on the isotopic data this seasonality is less evident however highest no3 removal fractions were also observed in the months july and august in 2015 the lower removal fractions during the year 2014 can be explained by the lower δ15n values during this time period fig 4a furthermore compared to the linear mixing model results the isotopic method yields generally higher removal fractions for the intermediate zone which at certain times were higher than in the near groundwater zone both methods yield removal fractions that are on the order of no3 removal fractions found by other studies e g cooper 1990 puckett and hughes 2005 average no3 removal rates over the entire period of in the near and the intermediate groundwater zone were on the order of 1 0 mg n l d and 3 1 mg n l d respectively these values indicate that in the intermediate zone the absolute amount of no3 being removed is about three times higher than in the near groundwater zone whereas the percentage of removal is slightly lower in the intermediate zone which is related to the higher no3 concentrations in the intermediate groundwater these values are within the large range of observed denitrification rates for riparian zones addy et al 2002 baker and vervier 2004 kellogg et al 2005 we emphasize that based on our mixing model the no3 which is consumed in the near gw zone consists of only 20 no3 0 2 mg n l d originating from the distant gw conversely in the intermediate gw zone 60 of the denitrified no3 1 9 mg n l d originate from the distant gw therefore the intermediate gw zone is more important in terms of the absolute rate of removal of groundwater borne no3 compared to the near groundwater zone where mainly river borne no3 is removed 5 conclusions river and groundwater hydrological hydrochemical and isotopic data from a four weekly sampling campaign over a two year period were statistically evaluated to quantitatively rank the factors that control no3 concentrations and denitrification efficiency in the riparian zone close to the river groundwater hydraulics and hydrochemistry are strongly affected by river water infiltration here consumption of do and the enrichment of δ15n and δ18o of the no3 molecule provide evidence for denitrification especially during the late summer months in groundwater with a river water fraction larger than 80 temperature can explain 67 8 of the variance in do and 66 2 of the variance in δ15n using a simple exponential model these high river water fractions occur at locations where river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer losing conditions which presumably is a key driver for the supply of bioavailable carbon fueling microbial activity on average we estimated a no3 depletion on the order of 40 of the no3 concentration in the riparian aquifer within a zone of 100 m from the river in contrast to other studies our data suggests that hydrological factors that have been linked to an increased mobilization of carbon sources e g during high river discharges or high groundwater levels play a minor role for both consumption of do and denitrification expanding on previous research on denitrification in riparian zones our study emphasizes that besides temperature the interactions between river and groundwater and the resulting water and solute fluxes play a crucial role in controlling reaction rates this knowledge could provide valuable guidance for the design of river restoration measures which should ensure high connectivity between river and groundwater to

19809,nitrate contamination in ground and surface water is a persistent problem in countries with intense agriculture the transition zone between rivers and their riparian aquifers where river water and groundwater interact may play an important role in mediating nitrate exports as it can facilitate intensive denitrification which permanently removes nitrate from the aquatic system however the in situ factors controlling riparian denitrification are not fully understood as they are often strongly linked and their effects superimpose each other in this study we present the evaluation of hydrochemical and isotopic data from a 2 year sampling period of river water and groundwater in the riparian zone along a 3rd order river in central germany based on bi and multivariate statistics spearman s rank correlation and partial least squares regression we can show that highest rates for oxygen consumption and denitrification in the riparian aquifer occur where the fraction of infiltrated river water and at the same time groundwater temperature are high river discharge and depth to groundwater are additional explanatory variables for those reaction rates but of minor importance our data and analyses suggest that at locations in the riparian aquifer which show significant river water infiltration heterotrophic microbial reactions in the riparian zone may be fueled by bioavailable organic carbon derived from the river water we conclude that interactions between rivers and riparian groundwater are likely to be a key control of nitrate removal and should be considered as a measure to mitigate high nitrate exports from agricultural catchments graphical abstract image keywords riparian zone nitrate contamination nitrate stable isotopes river groundwater

1998 rivett et al 2008 vidon and hill 2004a however denitrification rates in groundwater are not constant in space and time and are controlled by a multitude of factors rivett et al 2008 of key importance is the availability of reactants namely no3 and labile carbon for heterotrophic denitrification gift et al 2010 kaplan and newbold 2000 rivett et al 2008 zarnetske et al 2011 and reduced sulfur and iron ii in the aquifer sediments for chemolithotrophic denitrification knöller et al 2005 schwientek et al 2008 availability of reactants in the riparian zone is facilitated by mixing of waters from different sources and of different chemical composition namely river water with high carbon concentrations and groundwater with high no3 concentrations baker and vervier 2004 hill et al 2000 vervier et al 1993 as solute transport across the river aquifer interface is mainly advective and controlled by the direction and the magnitude of the water fluxes across the river groundwater

of the denitrification process brunke and gonser 1997 diem et al 2013a finally temperature is a crucial control on the activity of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria both the seasonal variability of temperature as well as heat exchange across the river groundwater interface may either stimulate or suppress reaction rates diem et al 2013b rivett et al 2008 vieweg et al 2016 in riparian zones water flux nutrient supply and temperature variability are often interlinked in space and time balestrini et al 2016 ranalli and macalady 2010 for instance high river discharges and high groundwater level often occur during the cold season which in turn coincides with specific solute mobilization and changed river solute concentrations musolff et al 2015 consequently disentangling these factors and their impact on n turn over in riparian zones is challenging during the last decades this problem has been addressed using descriptive methods at different riparian zone types balestrini et al 2016

approach focusing on factors controlling denitrification bu et al 2017 kellogg et al 2005 and typically do not consider hydrochemical and hydrological variables at the same time providing only a limited perspective on the problem in this study we present a unique two year observational data set of spatially and temporally resolved hydrologic isotopic and river and groundwater quality variables which allows a more comprehensive assessment of the interlinked processes and controls governing riparian denitrification samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of the no3 molecule as well as for major ions do and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration simultaneously river discharge and river and groundwater levels were measured we applied bi and multivariate statistics spearman s rank correlation and partial least squares regression to the data to evaluate and rank the key factors that control denitrification activity in riparian groundwater at different distances from the river by doing so we were able to disentangle the mixed effects of seasonal temperature variations potential hydraulic controls such as river groundwater mixing river discharge and groundwater levels this way we can provide a detailed and more comprehensive view with the focus on the spatio temporal variations of aerobic respiration and denitrification and their mechanistic controls in the riparian zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site our field site is located at the selke river in central germany 51 43 37 79 n 11 18 51 0 e which is an intensive test site within the tereno harz central german lowland observatory operated by the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz wollschläger et al 2017 fig 1 a the selke river is part of the bode catchment which was part of studies on catchment scale solute export musolff et al 2015 and n dynamics mueller et al 2016 2015 at the site a 2 km long river reach of the lower selke river the mean annual discharge is 1 5 m3 s during summer base flows can be below 0 1 m3 s highest discharge is typically observed during the spring snow melt season when bankfull discharge at about 15 m3 s and associated sediment movement can occur the selke catchment covers a total area of 456 km2 forests dominate the upper parts of the catchment 35 of the total area while the lowland parts are dominated by agriculture used 53 of the area at the field site which marks the transition from the mountainous upper catchment to the flatter groundwater controlled lower catchment the 2 km long river reach is lined by a strip of riparian vegetation up to 50 m wide consisting of willow and beech trees interspersed with pasture this strip of riparian vegetation is directly bounded by agricultural fields to the north and south of the river geologically the field site is located in the northern harz foreland where sandstones and limestone of the late palaeozoic era permian regional names rotliegend and zechstein and the early mesozoic era triassic regional names buntsandstein and muschelkalk were deposited bachmann et al 2008 during the early and late cretaceous the harz was uplifted and these older sedimentary layers were eroded and steeply tilted dipping towards the north forming the northern harz boundary fault at the field site the selke river has incised into these geological units during the plio and pleistocene and coincidentally deposited alluvial sediments consisting of mainly greywacke and slate stone originating from the central east harz mountains bachmann et al 2008 core samples from the riparian zone obtained from a sonic drill direct push device enabled a characterization of the shallow sedimentary sequence in the riparian zone here an alluvial loam up to 1 2 m thick covers an alluvial aquifer up to 8 m thick the aquifer is built up of alluvial fillings that show a very heterogeneous grain size distribution ranging from silt to cobble fraction with the main fraction of coarse sand to fine gravel the base of the aquifer forms a clay silt layer that acts as an aquitard geophysical surveys at the site electrical conductivity logging direct push injection logging electrical resistivity tomography kirsch 2008 revealed that the thickness of the alluvial aquifer steadily decreases with distance from the selke river hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer material was determined by three repeated salt tracer tests in the riparian zone and sieve analysis of freeze cores taken from the riverbed the resulting k values are in the range of 1 7e 3 to 1 2e 2 m s geometric mean 3 72e 3 m s 2 2 groundwater wells in total 30 wells gwm with an inner diameter of 2 54 and 5 05 cm were drilled with by direct push sonic drill technology the wells next to the river were screened in depths between 2 and 5 m for sampling of the shallow groundwater the wells further away from the river were drilled to depth of up to 10 m below ground all wells were thoroughly developed by intense pumping the geodetic location longitude latitude elevation above sea level of the sampling points were surveyed by a differential gps in combination with a laser tachymeter trimble gps r8 we classify the 30 wells into three distance categories in order to characterize their spatial location in relation to the river these categories are based on three buffer zones covering areas with i less than 25 m distance to the river ii a distance of 25 100 m to the river and iii a distance of more than 100 m to the river the three zones are denoted as gw near gw intermediate and gw distant fig 1b 2 3 groundwater and river water sampling during the sampling period in total 596 groundwater and 94 river water samples were taken groundwater was sampled every four weeks from april 2014 until april 2016 a peristaltic pump was used to extract groundwater from the wells during groundwater pumping water was continuously analyzed for do electrical conductivity ec and ph by a portable multi parameter meter find specifications and uncertainties on these devices in table 1 groundwater samples were taken when those field parameters were steady in time surface water samples of the selke river were taken as grab samples at two locations upstream of the field site and downstream of the intensive field site here field parameters were measured directly in the river water both groundwater and river water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter and stored in a cool and dark place samples for major cations were acidified with nitric acid to prevent cation precipitation and adsorption analysis of the samples was conducted within 48 h after sampling groundwater levels were measured at each sampling date before installing the pump a ltc logger solinst ltc levellogger junior was fixed at the riverbed at the field site and was recording river stage temperature and electrical conductivity at 10 min intervals

pool the n and oxygen isotope analyses of no3 were conducted on a gasbenchii delta v plus combination thermo after using the denitrifier method to convert no3 to n2o which enabled the simultaneous

statistical methods 2 5 1 linear mixing model in order to calculate the fraction of river water in the riparian groundwater a linear mixing model was used assuming chloride cl as a conservative solute mixing occurs between two independent endmembers mengis et al 1999 pinay et al 1998 which are in our case the river water and the groundwater distant from the river that is not affected by infiltrating river water in red color code in fig 1b the fraction of river water in the riparian groundwater f r i v in each well for each sampling date was calculated by 3 f r i v cl g w cl d i s t cl r i v cl d i s t where cl g w cl r i v and cl d i s t are the cl concentrations in the groundwater wells in between the endmembers in the river water and in the groundwater distant from the river respectively in contrast to the conservatively transported cl no3 is a reactive solute comparison of cl with no3 concentration has been a common tool in riparian studies to investigate potential removal pathways of no3 altman and parizek 1995 mengis et al 1999 pinay et al 1998 a deviation of the no3 concentration from the concentration expected from the linear mixing model could be related to no3 consumption or production by microbial reactions denitrification assimilation nitrification hill 1996 to calculate the no3 deficit or surplus i e the deviation from the expected mixing concentration in each groundwater sample first the theoretical no3 concentration in the groundwater that would be expected by pure conservative mixing no 3 m i x g w can be calculated by using the calculated river water fraction from eq 3 4 no 3 m i x g w no 3 r i v no 3 d i s t f r i v no 3 d i s t where no 3 r i v and no 3 d i s t are the no3 concentrations in the endmembers river water and groundwater distant from the river respectively subsequently the difference between the theoretically no3 concentration from eq 4 and the measured no3 concentration in each well is calculated by 5 δ no 3 g w no 3 m i x g w no 3 g w values higher than zero indicate a net no3 consumption or removal whereas values below zero indicate a no3 production furthermore the no3 deficit as a fraction of theoretical no3 concentration can be calculated as 6 no 3 g w δ no 3 g w no 3 m i x g w the method assumes that cl and no3 follow the same flow paths into the hydrological system furthermore only data sets of cl and no3 concentrations both theoretical and measured can be used that lie between the measured concentrations of the two endmembers 2 5 2 statistical analysis correlation analysis was used to characterize the nonparametric relationships between responding δ15n do and predicting variables e g water temperature discharge and among the predicting variables here we used spearman s rank correlation as concentration and discharge data are often exhibits non normal distributions and non linear relations to each other jawitz and mitchell 2011 based on the rank correlation a subset of predicting variables were used in a multivariate regression approach based on partial least squares regression pls wold et al 2001 by using the covariance structure between the variables this method is robust against collinearity among predicting variables the regression model is evaluated in terms of r2 a ranking of predicting variables defining the magnitude of influence and by the coefficient of each predicting variable defining the direction of influence for the variable ranking the vip value is used variable importance in projection only predicted variables with vip above 1 are considered as important see also musolff et al 2015 for the pls regression variables were log normalized when bivariate relations showed a clear non linear behavior for rank correlation and pls the software environment r was used 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conditions discharge of the river selke responds quickly to precipitation in the catchment and intense rain falls induce strong river discharge events fig 2 a b generally river discharge is highest in the winter and spring season whereas lowest discharges can be observed during late summer with base flow discharges around 0 2 m3 s the warm season may to october of the year 2015 was dryer than the warm season of 2014 which is also reflected in the higher frequency of river discharge events in the year 2014 during the study period five discharge events with peakflows exceeding 4 m3 s were observed groundwater levels in the vicinity of the river are generally shallow with lowest levels during late summer up to 2 m below ground and highest levels during winter 0 5 m below ground in response to intense rain fall and river discharge events groundwater levels respond quickly in the near and intermediate groundwater zone fig 2c this variability decreases with distance from the river and at some distance groundwater levels do not show any river induced variations since depth to groundwater is different at each well location because of the land topography we normalized groundwater levels in each well to the maximum and minimum groundwater levels resulting in groundwater level variations between 0 and 1 the general direction of groundwater flow is parallel to the river in a north easterly direction with little change over the year fig 2d hydraulic head differences between river stage and groundwater levels indicate that sections with river water losses to the aquifer and sections with groundwater gains alternate along the studied 2 km river reach detailed information on the groundwater surface water interaction is provided by the linear mixing model in 3 5 3 2 spatio temporal variation of physicochemical parameters river temperature and river discharge are negatively related at the field site see supporting information fig s1a due to seasonal variations in temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation the seasonal variation in temperature can also be observed in the groundwater but the amplitude is dampened and lagged with increasing distance from the river fig 3 a however mean temperatures are similar between river water and near groundwater and only increase slightly with increasing distance from the river table 2 in 2015 the warm season was on average warmer than the warm season of 2014 indicated by an average river water temperature of 13 16 c of 2014 compared to 14 05 c during 2015 dissolved oxygen concentration in river water is commonly at saturation but varies over the year due to temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in water and hence do is lowest during summer fig 3b this inverse relation of do and temperature is also visible in the near groundwater and the intermediate groundwater but shows only a slight variation in the more distant groundwater fig 3b beside this seasonal signal do increases with distance from the river from 2 mg l next to the river during summer to up to 9 mg l in the groundwater distant from the river table 2 however as the mean temperatures in river water and groundwater are similar the decreased do in the near river groundwater cannot be explained by the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in the river water and is presumably consumed by aerobic reactions the measured ph of the samples did not show a significant temporal variation river water was generally at ph 8 while all groundwater samples show a slightly lower ph of around 7 independent of the distance from river fig 3c table 2 spatio temporal variation of chloride no3 and doc concentrations mean values of cl and no3 in river and groundwater indicate a general increase in concentration from the river towards the distant groundwater fig 3d e table 2 in the river water samples a clear relationship between river discharge cl and no3 concentrations can be observed for cl the concentration decreases with increasing discharge due to dilution see supporting information fig s1b in contrast no3 concentration increases with discharge fig s1c since the highest base flow discharges occur during the cold season november to april and also because most of the discharge events occur during late winter and spring the cl concentration is lowest during winter whereas no3 is lowest during summer fig 3d e these variations in cl and no3 are also visible in the groundwater next to the river but diminish with increasing distance from the river fig 3d e doc concentrations are highest in river water compared to the groundwater concentrations table 2 variability of doc concentrations is lower in groundwater compared to the river water similar to the no3 concentration doc in river water increases with discharge fig s1d and is highest during the cold season fig 3f 3 3 isotopic signature of the no3 molecule in general highest δ15n and δ18o values in the no3 molecule occur in the near and intermediate groundwater zone during the warm season fig 4 a b in contrast the distant groundwater shows a constant and unenriched isotopic signature also river water has very low δ15n and δ18o values but shows a moderate enrichment during the warm season in river water and both in the near and intermediate groundwater a higher enrichment of δ15n and δ18o can be observed during the warm season of the year 2015 compared to the year 2014 where average air and river water temperatures were lower the dual fractionation factor of δ18o δ15n is 0 87 r2 0 80 for all groundwater samples in the near zone and 0 95 r2 0 77 in the intermediate zone fig 4c these factors are in the range of observed dual fractionation factors that indicate denitrification activity kendall and mcdonnell 1998 and have been observed in the many studies using no3 isotopic signatures aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 1990 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 peter et al 2012 for the river water samples and each single well the field based apparent enrichment factors were derived using equation eq 2 the apparent n isotope enrichment factors are in the range of 14 5 to 2 0 in the near groundwater and 6 1 to 0 73 in the intermediate zone a reliable prediction of the actual enrichment factors at the field site is not possible without a proper experimental calibration by column or batch experiments however n isotope enrichment factors for denitrification by groundwater denitrifying bacteria under controlled laboratory conditions have been reported to be in the range of 20 to 15 böttcher et al 1990 knöller et al 2011 as the highest observed apparent enrichment factor at the field site of 14 5 is within that proposed range we assume that it may represent denitrification without much interference of secondary processes any deviation of the observed apparent enrichment factors from this value indicates that additional processes such as mixing nitrification and n assimilation by plants influence the isotopic signature kendall and mcdonnell 1998 mariotti et al 1988 the observed apparent enrichment factor in the distant groundwater of around 1 indicates that denitrification does not have a significant impact here however in the river water small apparent enrichment factors were observed presumably related to the inflow of denitrified groundwater into the river isotopic data of the groundwater shows no evidence of intense nitrification the production of no3 by microbial oxidation of reduced inorganic n which would lead to depleted δ15n values kendall and mcdonnell 1998 the mineralization of organic n from decaying plants and the subsequent nitrification may add an amount of no3 comparable to catchments not affected by agricultural land use a higher extent of nitrification can be expected in the unsaturated zone below the agricultural fields because here inorganic reduced n originating from manure and fertilizer can be oxidized to no3 choi and ro 2003 cook and herczeg 2000 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 which in turn can act as the no3 end member when reaching the saturated zone in the distant groundwater 3 4 river water fractions in groundwater and no3 deficit calculations based on mixing model for 73 of all groundwater samples the mixing model was applicable the rest of the samples were excluded because here cl was temporally lower in the groundwater than in the river water see section 2 5 1 in general the fraction of river water in the groundwater suggests that river water is lost to the southern riparian zone across the entire river length of our field site fig 5 a in contrast the low river water fractions and elevated cl concentrations observed at the northern transect a suggest that here the river is gaining groundwater from the northern bank at this location in the northern part of the meander shaped site at transect b the flow conditions are alternating from losing to gaining conditions depending on the proximity of the well to the river those alternating river groundwater exchange conditions are closely linked to the n isotope signatures and the magnitude of the apparent enrichment factors the higher the river water fraction the higher is the δ15n value and also the magnitude of the apparent enrichment factors fig 5a b c for example at transect c the river is strongly losing water to the aquifer on both sides leading to very high river water fractions in the groundwater and concurrently show highest δ15n values and highest magnitudes of apparent enrichment factors in contrast at sites where the river is gaining groundwater the lowest δ15n and lowest magnitudes of apparent enrichment factors can be observed the theoretical no3 concentrations that would be expected by pure conservative mixing no 3 m i x g w eq 4 are given in fig 6 a a strong no3 deficit is visible for the bulk of the samples in both the near and the intermediate groundwater nevertheless for some sampling points a slight enrichment in no3 concentrations was calculated especially for low no3 concentrations which could indicate some nitrification activity however due to the fact that neither the isotopic data show signs of and the fact that ammonia concentrations were most of the time too low to be detected in groundwater it is unlikely that nitrification is of great importance at our field site in general the absolute values of the no3 concentrations and the no3 deficits are larger in the intermediate groundwater zone than in the near groundwater furthermore the deficit is larger during the warm season than during the cold season again depicting a strong seasonal effect the δ15n values show an increasing enrichment with increasing no3 deficit calculated by the mixing model for both groundwater in near and intermediate distance from the river fig 6b however correlation between the data derived by the two different methods is only on a fair level please note that for the fit with an r2 of 0 37 the three samples with δ15n values above 25 hollow circles in fig 6b were excluded if these three data points of extraordinary δ15n enrichment taken during the late summer 2015 are included goodness of fit is lower at r2 0 20 the reason for the deviation between the no3 deficit calculated by the mixing model and the δ15n enrichment may be due to other processes besides denitrification such as n assimilation by plants or anammox burgin and hamilton 2007 canfield et al 2010 which may lead to subordinated n depletion in the riparian zone compared to denitrification naeher et al 2015 wang et al 2012 3 5 correlation analysis and pls model results lowest do and highest δ15n compositions can be found primarily in the near and intermediate groundwater when temperature is higher than approximately 10 c figs 3a b 4a and 7a b in the river near groundwater the enrichment of δ15n is directly related to anaerobic conditions fig 7c which are required for denitrification in contrast similar temperatures in the distant groundwater did not affect do and δ15n greatly and δ15n composition is insensitive to do concentration thus the proximity to the river is an additional important factor that controls both aerobic respiration and denitrification the fraction of river water in the groundwater f r i v calculated by the linear mixing model provides additional the strongly enriched δ15n isotopic signatures mostly occur when f r i v is high fig 7d during high river discharges the enrichment of δ15n is lower fig 7e this is in line with the slight negative relationship between groundwater levels and the δ15n enrichment indicating that under high groundwater levels the δ15n enrichment is less intense fig 7f spearman s rank correlation table 3 reveals that the dynamics of do and of δ15n are negatively correlated with each other rspear 0 59 and show strong similarities with a set of other variables as well for do groundwater no3 concentrations positive water temperature negative and discharge positive are most important rspear 0 5 we also note weak correlations rspear 0 3 0 5 with distance of the well from the river positive eh positive potassium k negative and normalized groundwater levels positive for δ15n groundwater temperature positive river discharge negative and groundwater no3 concentrations negative are most important weaker correlations were found with potassium positive normalized groundwater level negative and ph negative to investigate the effect of proximity to the river in more detail we put only those groundwater samples into a partial least square pls regression model where river water was above 80 please find further information to that threshold in the supporting information fig s2 for the pls regression groundwater temperature river discharge normalized groundwater heads and ph were taken as predictors do and δ15n as responding variables the model explained 68 3 of do variance and 67 2 of δ15n variance groundwater temperature only was identified as the most important predictor with a variable importance in prediction vip of 1 see table 4 although river discharge and groundwater temperature are correlated to each other rspear 0 73 table 3 the pls model reveals that groundwater temperature is the dominant control of do and δ15n groundwater temperature alone can explain 67 8 of the variance in do and 66 2 of the variance in δ15n using a simple exponential model in the groundwater samples with a river water fraction of more than 80 4 discussion 4 1 key controlling factors for no3 removal our results suggest an increase of denitrification activity with a growing influence of infiltrating river water on the riparian groundwater but with temperature as a key constraint the strong temperature effect on both do concentration and denitrification has frequently been observed in other studies bu et al 2017 clément et al 2003 dhondt et al 2003 diem et al 2013a peter et al 2012 vieweg et al 2016 low do concentrations are presumably caused by intense heterotrophic aerobic respiration caused by a river borne carbon source diem et al 2013a and secondly by high temperature during the warm season in turn δ15n composition increases with decreasing do concentration fig 7e which is related to the inhibition effect of do on anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification rivett et al 2008 vidon and hill 2004a many studies have reported a threshold in do concentration of around 2 mg l below which denitrification activity strongly increases see review of rivett et al 2008 which is in line with our results fig 7c we found that at losing river sections the highest δ15n values and apparent enrichment factors match the highest river water fractions in the groundwater fig 5 these results clearly indicate that i denitrification activity is highest at losing river sections as indicated by significantly elevated δ15n values and ii at losing river sections our calculated apparent enrichment factors are close to the enrichment factors observed for denitrifying bacteria than at gaining sections this indicates that at losing river sections denitrification is the major process for no3 depletion this positive effect of river proximity on denitrification activity in groundwater has also been observed in other studies addy et al 2002 devito et al 2000 mayer et al 2007 ostrom et al 2002 they hypothesized that this effect was related to the generally higher organic carbon content in the near riparian aquifer compared to the groundwater at increasing distance from the river at our field site this hypothesis can be further corroborated by the strong depletion of do by heterotrophic aerobic respiration of bioavailable carbon from the river in the near stream groundwater zone however further clarification of the potential relationship between bioavailable carbon and denitrification activity is difficult on the basis of our bulk doc concentration data which does not capture the bioavailability of carbon sources in the riparian zone brugger et al 2001 brunke and gonser 1997 hedin et al 1998 leenheer and croué 2003 furthermore the carbon may also be exposed to a potential consumption by aerobic respiration at an unknown rate for an improved evaluation of the relationship between carbon quality and denitrification carbon quality could be analyzed using methods such as parafac eimers et al 2008 kothawala et al 2015 and isotopic signature of 13c in the dissolved inorganic carbon which decreases during heterotrophic denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 hosono et al 2015 lambert et al 2011 4 2 effects of river discharge and groundwater level based on the pls model we observe a weak negative influence of river discharge on do depletion as well as of river discharge on enrichment of δ15n table 4 fig 7e this suggests that reactive activity is lower during high discharges this is in line with previous studies ostrom et al 2002 peter et al 2012 where this effect was attributed to the higher groundwater flow velocities during events leading to a shorter contact time to the sediment containing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findlay 1995 peter et al 2012 valett et al 1996 our data is in line with this hypothesis as the magnitude of hydraulic gradients between river and groundwater show a negative effect on δ15n enrichment we argue that an additional mobilization of carbon during events that may fuel aerobic respiration and denitrification is of only minor importance although a significant mobilization of carbon occurs during events eimers et al 2008 fasching et al 2015 meybeck 1982 musolff et al 2015 it does not necessarily contain a higher content of bioavailable carbon consisting of lower molecular weights like amino acids and organic acids raeke et al 2017 interestingly the pls model further reveals that besides river discharge groundwater levels also show a slightly negative correlation with δ15n enrichment table 4 fig 7f this is in contrast to several other studies which have suggested that during high groundwater levels additional carbon and no3 sources may be mobilized by groundwater tapping into upper soil layers biron et al 1999 creed et al 1996 hill et al 2000 which can result in increased denitrification activities burt et al 2002 gift et al 2010 hefting et al 2004 simmons et al 1992 however groundwater level fluctuations at our field site in the near and intermediate groundwater zone are relatively small 0 6 m and thus additional mobilization of solutes from the upper soil layer is limited 4 3 nitrate removal potential of the riparian zone the fraction of no3 removed from the mass reflected in the initial no3 concentration for each well in the near and the intermediate zone was calculated based on the linear mixing model fig 8 a section 2 5 1 and the isotopic composition combined with the apparent enrichment factor re arranging eq 2 fig 8b section 3 4 a strong seasonality can be observed over time especially for the calculated no3 deficit fraction by the linear mixing model fig 8a here the highest fractions of removal occur during the summer months july to october and in the near groundwater with varying no3 removal fractions between 15 and 75 in the intermediate zone only 20 45 variation can be observed in estimates of no3 removal based on the isotopic data this seasonality is less evident however highest no3 removal fractions were also observed in the months july and august in 2015 the lower removal fractions during the year 2014 can be explained by the lower δ15n values during this time period fig 4a furthermore compared to the linear mixing model results the isotopic method yields generally higher removal fractions for the intermediate zone which at certain times were higher than in the near groundwater zone both methods yield removal fractions that are on the order of no3 removal fractions found by other studies e g cooper 1990 puckett and hughes 2005 average no3 removal rates over the entire period of in the near and the intermediate groundwater zone were on the order of 1 0 mg n l d and 3 1 mg n l d respectively these values indicate that in the intermediate zone the absolute amount of no3 being removed is about three times higher than in the near groundwater zone whereas the percentage of removal is slightly lower in the intermediate zone which is related to the higher no3 concentrations in the intermediate groundwater these values are within the large range of observed denitrification rates for riparian zones addy et al 2002 baker and vervier 2004 kellogg et al 2005 we emphasize that based on our mixing model the no3 which is consumed in the near gw zone consists of only 20 no3 0 2 mg n l d originating from the distant gw conversely in the intermediate gw zone 60 of the denitrified no3 1 9 mg n l d originate from the distant gw therefore the intermediate gw zone is more important in terms of the absolute rate of removal of groundwater borne no3 compared to the near groundwater zone where mainly river borne no3 is removed 5 conclusions river and groundwater hydrological hydrochemical and isotopic data from a four weekly sampling campaign over a two year period were statistically evaluated to quantitatively rank the factors that control no3 concentrations and denitrification efficiency in the riparian zone close to the river groundwater hydraulics and hydrochemistry are strongly affected by river water infiltration here consumption of do and the enrichment of δ15n and δ18o of the no3 molecule provide evidence for denitrification especially during the late summer months in groundwater with a river water fraction larger than 80 temperature can explain 67 8 of the variance in do and 66 2 of the variance in δ15n using a simple exponential model these high river water fractions occur at locations where river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer losing conditions which presumably is a key driver for the supply of bioavailable carbon fueling microbial activity on average we estimated a no3 depletion on the order of 40 of the no3 concentration in the riparian aquifer within a zone of 100 m from the river in contrast to other studies our data suggests that hydrological factors that have been linked to an increased mobilization of carbon sources e g during high river discharges or high groundwater levels play a minor role for both consumption of do and denitrification expanding on previous research on denitrification in riparian zones our study emphasizes that besides temperature the interactions between river and groundwater and the resulting water and solute fluxes play a crucial role in controlling reaction rates this knowledge could provide valuable guidance for the design of river restoration measures which should ensure high connectivity between river and groundwater to
