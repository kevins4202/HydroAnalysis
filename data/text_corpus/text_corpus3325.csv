16625,to assist in the covid 19 public health guidance on a college campus daily composite wastewater samples were withdrawn at 20 manhole locations across the university of colorado boulder campus low cost autosamplers were fabricated in house to enable an economical approach to this distributed study these sample stations operated from august 25th until november 23rd during the fall 2020 semester with 1512 samples collected the concentration of sars cov 2 in each sample was quantified through two comparative reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reactions rt qpcrs these methods were distinct in the utilization of technical replicates and normalization to an endogenous control 1 higher temporal resolution compensates for supply chain or other constraints that prevent technical or biological replicates 2 the data normalized by an endogenous control agreed with the raw concentration data minimizing the utility of normalization the raw wastewater concentration values reflected sars cov 2 prevalence on campus as detected by clinical services overall combining the low cost composite sampler with a method that quantifies the sars cov 2 signal within six hours enabled actionable and time responsive data delivered to key stakeholders with daily reporting of the findings wastewater surveillance assisted in decision making during critical phases of the pandemic on

sampler building scale monitoring 1 introduction on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 a pandemic who 2020 as of june 15 2021 176 million confirmed cases have resulted in over 3 8 million deaths world health organization who clinical testing of individuals is crucial for identifying infected persons understanding infection prevalence and containing the disease but supply chain limitations and logistical challenges limit clinical testing capacity testing is therefore generally reserved for individuals either showing symptoms or likely exposed to the disease centers for disease control and prevention cdc however the etiologic agent responsible for covid 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has a significant asymptomatic percentage with some estimates of 50 mizumoto et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 oran and topol 2020 and can be transmitted by pre symptomatic and asymptomatic persons yu et al 2020 hu et al 2020 bai et al 2020 wei et al 2020 rothe et el 2020 further symptoms may take between approximately two days and two weeks with a pooled median of 95th percentile estimates in a comprehensive meta analysis reporting 13 1 days xin et al 2021 to develop post infection linton et al 2020 backer et al 2020 lauer et al 2020 and even when symptomatic individuals may not self report as a result clinical testing alone fails to identify many infected individuals before they transmit the disease to others and under represents caseload numbers utilized by officials to inform public health directives the need to address these shortcomings with a supplementary epidemiological tool was recognized early in the pandemic with a global collaborative of researchers advocating for wastewater based epidemiology wbe bivins et al 2020 wbe efficiently and non invasively monitors community metrics by sampling generated wastewater and screening for chemical and biological entities with previous success demonstrated in tracking community drug use daughton 2001 choi et al 2018 and poliovirus circulation asghar et al 2014 who 2003 hovi et al 2012 wastewater networks can be sampled at points at which discharges from community members have combined aggregating a semi anonymous signal representative of the upstream community analyzing aggregated wastewater for sars cov 2 rna therefore provides an opportunity to test entire communities within a single sample as sars cov 2 rna is present in the feces of both symptomatic jiehao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a holshue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b wu et al 2020b wölfel et al 2020 and asymptomatic tang et al 2020 lo et al 2020 han et al 2020 covid 19 infected individuals analysis of those samples offers rapid insight into infection prevalence potentially unhindered by factors such as symptom onset and the healthcare seeking behavior of individuals further whereas this aggregated testing cannot pinpoint infected individuals it can allow for more effective use of clinical testing resources for example wbe can quickly identify the regions and communities with the most infections and allow for the targeted allocation of resources to those hotspots for early and comprehensive testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic persons on a localized level hart and halden 2020 although sars cov 2 rna fecal shedding behavior has been reported as erratic walsh et al 2020 wastewater represents a complex mixture of all liquid conveyed waste exiting a premise including urinary respiratory oral and hygiene based discharges compositing multiple potential sources of viral rna an international network of researchers has detected sars cov 2 rna in their local wastewaters gonzalez et al 2020

proof of concept for wbe in the context of covid 19 monitoring and work to validate the utility of the approach these previous studies primarily sampled from wastewater treatment plants water resource recovery facilities efficient locations for obtaining population level signals monitoring the upstream sewer network and sampling at the building or microsewershed scale however enhances spatial resolution and enables more targeted surveillance and response efforts a number of building level campaigns have been implemented in response to covid 19 particularly at colleges but more experience and guidance are desired to inform their further implementation harris lovett et al 2021 here we report the wbe campaign conducted at the university of colorado boulder colorado usa we sampled up to 20 manhole locations seven days per week between august 25th and november 23rd to monitor on campus residential buildings for the presence of covid 19 to obtain economical 24 h composite samples we designed assembled and deployed low cost autosamplers we tracked the concentrations of sars cov 2 rna and control species in the wastewater using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr assays following best practices ahmed et al 2021 and reported to campus decision makers daily this campaign was coupled with weekly individualized saliva monitoring rt qpcr testing of all asymptomatic on campus residents yang et al 2021 bjorkman et al 2021 the comprehensiveness of both the wbe campaign and the clinical and saliva monitoring testing services provides a unique opportunity in evaluating the utility of building level wastewater surveillance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample locations twenty sample locations targeting the wastewater outfall captured within surface accessible manholes were prioritized to discriminate the sars cov 2 signals originating from the on campus residential buildings at the university of colorado boulder fig 1 a table 1 twenty three pumps autosamplers operated at these locations with three sites discriminating two separate flows within a single manhole overall then 23 flows from 20 manhole locations were monitored each flow roughly corresponded to an individual residential structure except for the flow that originated from the singular monitored administrative building the university housed over 6200 students in on campus residential buildings during the semester and each flow on average accounted for the wastewater generated by 450 residents range extending from 109 to 2048 residents with select residents being monitored at multiple sites the targeted manholes ranged from approximately 1 to 7 m in depth to protect the privacy of residents the presented data was anonymized with a unique label assigned to each

tubing and exterior casing fig 1 b supplemental figure 1 supplemental table 1 the samplers were positioned above ground and next to each manhole fig 1 c the wastewater inflow and overflow tubing lines were fed through the d pick of the manhole cover and the inlet strainer that resided in the underground wastewater stream was constructed from either ¼ in o d copper or ¼ in o d steel tubing with 0 157 in holes drilled into the side to achieve daily composite samples representative of flushes that occurred throughout the entire day the pumps operating at around 33 of full capacity slowly but continuously pulled and deposited wastewater into the 5 gal jerrycans collection of approximately 50 ml sub samples occurred daily between 7 am and 12 pm with power banks replaced every 48 h and ice packs replaced daily when ambient average temperatures exceeded 4 c these collection and maintenance tasks each only required the pump to be off for about 10 to 30 min and thus did not significantly detract from continuous pump operation whereas each pump was scheduled to draw about 10 l of wastewater per day the actual wastewater withdrawn was monitored at the time of sample collection by weighing the jerrycan mass with a luggage scale supplemental figure 2 supplemental table 2 the following three sub samples were collected from each sampler daily one for rna extraction and viral detection one for the determination of basic water quality parameters and one backup samplers were only turned off for entire days for the following three events a september blizzard a supply chain

total rna extracted and roughly assess the success of the extraction process supplemental table 5 2 3 3 rt qpcr two separate rt qpcr pipelines were then used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna full details fulfilling the miqe guidelines are provided as supplemental supplemental file 1 taylor et al 2010 in brief the first rt qpcr pipeline entitled surv1 was executed by the university of colorado boulder s covid surveillance laboratory simultaneously with the sampling campaign surv1 employed a multiplex assay targeting the sars cov 2 nucleocapsid n and envelope e genomic regions as well as the human rnasep transcript supplemental figures 5 6 supplemental tables 6 7 yang et al 2021 from august 28th to september 29th the n1 primer and probe set was used to detect the nucleocapsid region after september 30th the n2 primer and probe set was used instead because of supply chain constraints associated with the primer probe master mixes similar efficiencies were noted between n1 and n2 multiple technical replicates were not run the second rt qpcr pipeline entitled senb was executed in december 2020 after the fall sampling campaign had ended in this second pipeline the extracted rna samples frozen at 80 c were reevaluated for sars cov 2 rna using a wastewater specific multiplex assay detecting the following targets sars cov 2 n n2 sars cov 2 e the spiked internal control bovine coronavirus and genogroup ii f rna bacteriophage supplemental table 8 genogroup ii f rna bacteriophage was targeted to serve as a human fecal indicator cole et al 2003 to quantify the senb data standard curves were established for each run from ten fold serial dilutions ranging from 105 106 and 106 copies to 1 10 and 10 copies of sars cov 2 bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage standard per reaction respectively supplemental figure 7 supplemental tables 9 10 the lower standard amount established the limit of quantification loq the limit of detection lod was set at amplification occurring

containing 1 53 107 copies of bovine coronavirus standard per reaction assisting quantification when the bovine coronavirus spike in amount was increased from approximately 50 000 to 500 000 copies per reaction supplemental figure 9 sars cov 2 e and n2 bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage amplicons recovered from wastewater collected from the primary isolation building on september 17th 2020 were subjected to sanger sequencing at the university of colorado anschutz molecular biology core to confirm that the expected sequences were amplified the recovered amplicons matched the expected targeted sequences overall detailed protocols are provided in supplemental file 1 for both the surv1 and senb pipelines 2 4 data normalization sars cov 2 data from surv1 was normalized by subtracting because these values are logarithmic in nature the rnasep ct value from the sars cov 2 e ct value a comparative ct method common in diagnostic pcr assays dahdouh et al 2021 rowan et al 2021 the n gene was utilized to confirm trends data from senb was processed by calculating copies per liter of wastewater using the recorded masses of sample collected and concentrated supplemental table 11 and the

e s s e d the bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage signals were used to track sample variability but not to transform the concentration of sars cov 2 rna the bovine coronavirus recovery efficiency was determined by comparing the rt qpcr obtained concentration value to the extracted rna concentration of the spiked in control throughout the campaign the recovery efficiency averaged 53 30 s d october 2nd samples are masked from this analysis because they were frozen prior to extraction and a key intermediate weight was not recorded 2 5 incorporation of medical services and isolation space utilization data on campus medical services in wardenburg health performed nasal swab lyra direct sars cov 2 assays quidel corporation san diego ca usa to confirm suspected cases within the community individuals tested for suspected infection included symptomatic students students identified through contact tracing and students presumed positive based on their weekly saliva monitoring rt qpcr test results the affirmative medical services data are considered as positive detections within the residential structures and the date of each positive is used to denote the case though that date is not the date of actual infection supplemental table 12 isolation space utilization data tracked the number of beds in designated isolation spaces occupied on a given day supplemental table 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the composite samplers in general the composite samplers performed well reliably withdrawing sample mass table 1 the design achieved the objectives and provided an economical sampling unit additionally if a source of electricity is near the sample point then the cost decreases with removing the necessity of the power bank throughout the campaign concerns were noted over leakage through the small sampling port on the jerrycan and the inlet strainer either clogging or being knocked offline because of toilet paper accumulation during low flow conditions to prevent further leakage a short pvc tube was epoxied to the small sampling port and positioned such that the free end of the tube sat with a removable cap above the jerrycan several redesigns of the inlet strainer suffered similar issues as the primary design exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of flushable wipes these issues occasionally disabled continuous wastewater collection at a site for numerous hours until a team member could manually correct them unclogging and redeploying the inlet strainers remained the primary maintenance demand future surveillance campaigns may consider more permanent modifications to the flow path to enable ease of sample collection while inlet strainer issues contributed to variability in the daily withdrawn wastewater supplemental table 2 we do not believe they impaired our results clogging was uncommon among the collective set of sites and a similar wbe campaign that collected grab samples representative of a single time point rather than composite samples successfully monitored the presence of sars cov 2 betancourt et al 2021 additionally some of the variability in the withdrawn amounts is attributable not to these inlet issues but to air bubbles getting pumped with wastewater during periods of low flow 3 2 dataset summary prior to resumption of on campus activities incoming on campus residents were required to test five days prior to the scheduled move in august 17th 21st establishing the baseline an initial increase in sars cov 2 rna wastewater concentrations was detected near the beginning of the campaign fig 2 this event occurred two weeks after the labor day holiday in the usa with many traced large off campus gatherings the wastewater concentrations plateaued the week of september 15th and were in decline prior to boulder county enacting aggressive social distancing policies on september 24th fig 2 a that concentrations were already decreasing before these policies were enacted likely reflects the success of on campus testing tracing and isolation efforts the september 24th orders were enforced until october 13th and prohibited 1 anyone aged 18 to 22 years old in the city of boulder from engaging in gatherings and 2 residents in 36 nearby off campus buildings from leaving their place of residence to the maximum extent possible stay at home order boulder county public health 2020 well after the expiration of those public health orders another increase in wastewater concentrations was detected after october 31st the halloween holiday in the usa clinical services detected fewer cases on campus during this event 119 individuals from halloween until the end of monitoring as compared to the september event 530 individuals up until october 1st and this lower caseload was reflected in the nearly halved average sars cov 2 wastewater concentration 3 6 106 7 2 105 compared to 6 6 106 5 6 105 sars cov 2 copies l the similar dynamics emphasize a quantitative relationship not simply a presence or absence of viral rna correlation between the sars cov 2 caseload and the wastewater concentrations finally students vacated campus prior to november 23rd for the scheduled end of in person instruction the sars cov 2 wastewater concentration averages taken over the monitoring campaign fig 2 c largely reflect on campus prevalence fig 2 g number of reported infections within a residential structure divided by the initial census data fig 2 e when masking data from wastewater samplers that were activated later in the semester both the surv1 data and the senb data reflected the medical services data throughout the campaign fig 2 b d f h supplemental tables 7 10 12 overall the e data from the surv1 and senb pipelines are consistent when surv1 s e to rnasep ratio is compared to senb s log10 sars cov 2 copies l in a linear model lm function in r the slope of the linear model is 0 17 with an intercept of 4 88 and a residual standard error of 0 63 a multiple r2 of 0 37 and a p value 2 2 10 16 this result suggests that a single technical replicate the surv1 dataset is admissible when performing a daily monitoring campaign and when resources become limited due to either supply chain disruptions or rapid campaign expansions designed to meet the pace of emerging pandemics technical replicates are still recommended when feasible the senb dataset to avoid false reporting additionally the sars cov 2 e and n2 targets displayed a linear correlation of 0 97 in the senb data supplemental figure 10 confirming that both are suitable to track the prevalence of the virus the quantitative range of the predicted concentrations in terms of genome copies per liter of wastewater was also similar for both targets we still recommend monitoring multiple targets of different genes encoded in the genome of sars cov 2 to ensure that mutations within viral variants detectable in wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 do not immediately produce an overall false negative by interfering with primer or probe sites the reported medical services data is mirrored in the sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations detected on the same day likely reflecting the high frequency with which both wastewater sampling daily and compulsory individualized saliva monitoring testing weekly were executed but these datasets are not perfectly matched to analyze the co occurrence of an individual s positive test result with the detection of a high sars cov 2 concentration in their residential structure s wastewater on either the same day or in near temporal proximity we considered the 16 wastewater samplers not impacted by flow originating from isolating individuals a total of 1103 wastewater samples were collected from those 16 samplers over the course of the campaign 556 individuals tested positive within the residential structures served by those samplers for 547 of those positive tests the individual s test result was reported the same day a wastewater sample was collected for their residential structure corresponding to 246 wastewater samples notably the wastewater signal from structure h is duplicated in the i h signal to account for this duplication we increase the considered numbers by the number of duplicated events i e the total number of positive individuals from structure h 22 and the number of wastewater samples collected from structure i h over the days those individuals positive tests were reported 15 therefore 261 of the 1103 wastewater samples represent structures with a corresponding 569 positive population equivalents when setting the wastewater concentration that must be exceeded to indicate contribution by an infected individual at 105 106 and 107 sars cov 2 copies l a total of 521 450 and 146 expected cases 92 79 and 26 of all cases respectively are effectively captured in the wastewater sample on the day of positive testing however the specificity of using the day of 105 sars cov 2 copies l as a cutoff is low with 741 of all 1 103 67 wastewater samples exceeding this threshold and only 229 of these samples directly mapped to a positive this exceedance results from individuals shedding sars cov 2 rna prior to testing positive and individuals requiring time post identification to relocate from the residential building into the isolation space expanding the timeframe considered around a positive detection in the medical services data may lead to better association with the sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations when considering a time window of five total days surrounding the date of positive testing 48 to 72 h 67 and 92 of the samples exceeding 105 and 107 sars cov 2 copies l respectively correspond to a detected medical services positive supplemental table 14 in total 600 of the 1103 considered wastewater samples were collected within a positive s 5 day time window 92 of these samples with sars cov 2 signals below loq 468 samples were not 214 of these samples with sars cov 2 signals below loq and 35 were excluded due to an overlap with the termination of the sampling period the average wastewater concentrations for the time windows associated with a positive and the time windows not associated with a positive were 7 0 106 1 5 106 and 1 2 106 3 3 105 sars cov 2 copies l 95 confidence interval respectively with a significant kruskal wallis chi squared difference equal to 77 8 p value 2 2 10 16 this result supports the hypothesis that samples taken temporally nearer to an infection will display a higher concentration of sars cov 2 copies l wastewater than samples taken temporally farther from an infection however only 12 of the considered 16 samplers display a significant difference between their respective means time windows associated with a positive mean versus time windows not associated with a positive mean when considered individually with samplers d1 d2 h and m displaying no significant difference supplemental figure 11 over the campaign 14 13 22 and 61 infections were detected in the populations served by these four samplers respectively the d1 d2 and h samplers were established after the main peak of september cases october 15th november 1st and september 16th respectively resulting in a lower overall infection incidence and in the case of d2 relatively distributed caseloads in which 19 of the 21 possible wastewater datapoints fall within the 48 to 72 h time window of a detected positive when relating the concentration of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater to the medical services data the isolation strategy enabled further estimation of the sars cov 2 shed by infected individuals into wastewater infected individuals received temporary housing in the primary isolation building up until september 18th and after october 6th and were assigned to a secondary building in the interim fig 3 two residential structures a and b are apartment complexes which enabled infected residents to instead isolate in place isolation in these alternate structures complicated the signal in their associated wastewater flows as well as in the combined g fedcba flow the e2 cba flow is not noted given that sampler began operating after october 6th it is further noteworthy that such combined flows bias the median data fig 2 a with the contribution of a single infection potentially detected at multiple sites these complications emphasize the importance of quantifying the signal for these locations rather than relying on binary presence absence of virus determinations quantification enables the detection of temporal trends such as increasing sars cov 2 rna concentrations above the expected baseline additionally students do not proceed through the entire course of infection profiled within a given residence and shift their contribution to the isolation structures fig 3 the isolation buildings maintained a unique wastewater in which the flow did not represent a fluctuating proportion of infected individuals amongst non infected individuals these buildings were instead occupied entirely by individuals progressing through the course of the viral infection remaining empty otherwise the wastewater concentrations from the primary isolation building peaked in mid september 4 6 107 sars cov 2 copies l on september 11th and again in mid november 2 7 107 sars cov 2 copies l on november 16th fig 3 these peaks resulted from the co occurrence of disease progression and virus viral rna shedding in stool explaining the two peaks nearly identical wastewater concentrations despite different numbers of infected residents 75 and 25 respectively in this building the viral wastewater inputs of a smaller number of infected individuals were not diluted by the inputs of a corresponding larger proportion of non infected residents the isolated individuals wastewater mixed only with idle plumbing and appliance flows the peaks noted over october reflect the progression of viral shedding from individual contributions although this value will vary with the underlying characteristics of the idle flow emanating from each building from the presented data the expected maximum concentration of detectable sars cov 2 within domestic wastewater in the usa should be near 107 genome copies l considering that individuals in residences are expected to produce between 100 250 l of wastewater per day the maximum shedding per person is on the order of 1010 sars cov 2 genome copies day in agreement with schmitz et al 2021 this number additionally aligns with the upper end of identified fecal concentration ranges suggesting that individuals within these structures likely produce between 100 1000 ml of feces per day 5 103 107 6 copies ml feces foladori et al 2020 notably this analysis is corroborated by the concentrations noted in the secondary isolation building during the peak of infections in september 1 7 107 sars cov 2 copies l on september 27th from 158 infected isolating residents fig 3 the concentration of fecal matter becomes more critical when considering wider communities with industrial infiltration and other diluting contributions to wastewater in initial attempts to normalize to the varying concentrations of fecal matter within the wastewater samples the genogroup ii f bacteriophage was selected as an internal reference marker for the fall campaign to align with other sampling efforts ongoing within colorado at the microsewershed level the f bacteriophage signal displayed inconsistent geographical and temporal trends fig 4 select sites e g r q and o displayed consistently low signals within the range of 104 to 106 copies l whereas other sites e g g fedcba j and l admin displayed signals often approaching 109 copies l even more concerning sites such as c f h m and n displayed inconsistent temporal trends fluctuating over five orders of magnitude during the campaign these shifts potentially result from either changes in resident diet or interpersonal fluctuations in the gut virome minot et al 2011 the f bacteriophage was therefore replaced by the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov for the spring 2021 monitoring campaign rosario et al 2009 3 3 utility and consideration of the data throughout the fall monitoring campaign the interpretation and utility of the data varied with the prevalence of sars cov 2 within the community considering six scenarios in which the concentration of sars cov 2 is 1 absent 2 low and stable 3 low and increasing 4 high and increasing stable 5 high and decreasing and 6 decreasing to absent the daily monitoring campaign provided varying levels of support to the pandemic response wbe s utility as an early warning signal is primarily experienced in scenarios 1 2 and 3 in which early detections are the most critical for either preventing or halting community spread our campaign demonstrated this utility within the first two weeks of monitoring when high wastewater concentrations were detected for structures k p and q residents and employees in these structures were specifically contacted within 12 h of the reporting of the wastewater results and asked to submit a saliva sample for rt qpcr testing as soon as possible this testing revealed individual cases not yet discovered by routine saliva monitoring that were then successfully isolated this prevention response required the deployment of the robust and well connected testing contact tracing and isolation infrastructure when entering either scenario 4 or 5 the primary utility in wbe is in monitoring the effectiveness of public health intervention strategies employed the overall fall campaign provided an example in which the peak in sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations occurred before the social distancing order imposed by the county therefore the on campus mechanism of testing tracing and isolation was demonstrated as effective prior to a more robust and stringent social distancing order being put in place the wastewater concentration data was directly used to assess the success and viability of the interventions on campus both internally and with public health officials this monitoring better equips public health officials to determine appropriate responses with the infrastructure at hand notably with more stringent control measures likely leading to migration from campus and potentially transporting viral infections abroad and or allowing reentry of the virus from broader community acquired infections when social distancing requirements ease after the public health orders were enacted in boulder wi fi connections within residence halls decreased by 33 additionally clinical testing data later in the semester identified cases with low viral loads without an active infection highlighting cases in which progression through the disease profile occurred off campus during this recovery phase scenario 6 wastewater data also monitors individuals who may still shed viral rna even after exiting the infectious period on campus students were permitted to leave the isolation structure and return to their residences after ten days these reentry events could be detected in the wastewater e g see site o fig 2 reentries thus must also be taken into consideration to prevent shifts in policy based on a true detected signal that is not reflective of a case of concern across university campuses globally and reported within this study the utility of wastewater monitoring to support public health has been demonstrated for example coupling building level wastewater sampling two to three times per week with clinical testing has been demonstrated as an effective approach at diverse institutions such as the university of arizona arizona usa betancourt et al 2021 university of north carolina at charlotte north carolina usa gibas et al 2021 and kenyon college ohio usa barich and slonczewski 2021 at hope college michigan usa travis et al 2021 implemented a higher collection frequency by sampling from nine on campus residential zones every weekday in these campaigns wastewater samples indicating infection prevalence led to clinical testing of all individuals associated with the flagged buildings populations subject to university specific decision frameworks all found wbe to be a valuable tool for disease containment often noting wastewater surveillance s utility for identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals 4 conclusions with the wide range of fluctuations in daily habits surrounding toilet flushes and personal hygiene behaviors combined with rapid changes in viral loads daily monitoring becomes critical to track the prevalence of pathogens within building scale wastewater the demonstrated monitoring campaign informed on the emergence of likely new infections within given residential structures notably during the first two weeks of operation and the effectiveness of on campus interventions the utility of these data relied on being in concert with robust medical services and individualized saliva monitoring testing providing the ability to translate from community monitoring to intervention resulting from the success of the operation of this wastewater monitoring network this study concluded that 1 economical solutions are readily assembled for operating composite samplers 2 daily samples enable informed decisions and monitoring of the success of interventions on campus and 3 wastewater data provides substantial and unique benefit when surveying community health at multiple stages in a disease outbreak combined wastewater monitoring provides a flexible and

16625,to assist in the covid 19 public health guidance on a college campus daily composite wastewater samples were withdrawn at 20 manhole locations across the university of colorado boulder campus low cost autosamplers were fabricated in house to enable an economical approach to this distributed study these sample stations operated from august 25th until november 23rd during the fall 2020 semester with 1512 samples collected the concentration of sars cov 2 in each sample was quantified through two comparative reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reactions rt qpcrs these methods were distinct in the utilization of technical replicates and normalization to an endogenous control 1 higher temporal resolution compensates for supply chain or other constraints that prevent technical or biological replicates 2 the data normalized by an endogenous control agreed with the raw concentration data minimizing the utility of normalization the raw wastewater concentration values reflected sars cov 2 prevalence on campus as detected by clinical services overall combining the low cost composite sampler with a method that quantifies the sars cov 2 signal within six hours enabled actionable and time responsive data delivered to key stakeholders with daily reporting of the findings wastewater surveillance assisted in decision making during critical phases of the pandemic on campus from detecting individual cases within populations ranging from 109 to 2048 individuals to monitoring the success of on campus interventions graphical abstract tracking sars cov 2 in on campus

sampler building scale monitoring 1 introduction on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 a pandemic who 2020 as of june 15 2021 176 million confirmed cases have resulted in over 3 8 million deaths world health organization who clinical testing of individuals is crucial for identifying infected persons understanding infection prevalence and containing the disease but supply chain limitations and logistical challenges limit clinical testing capacity testing is therefore generally reserved for individuals either showing symptoms or likely exposed to the disease centers for disease control and prevention cdc however the etiologic agent responsible for covid 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has a significant asymptomatic percentage with some estimates of 50 mizumoto et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 oran and topol 2020 and can be transmitted by pre symptomatic and asymptomatic persons yu et al 2020 hu et al 2020 bai et al 2020 wei et al 2020 rothe et el 2020 further symptoms may take between approximately two days and two weeks with a pooled median of 95th percentile estimates in a comprehensive meta analysis reporting 13 1 days xin et al 2021 to develop post infection linton et al 2020 backer et al 2020 lauer et al 2020 and even when symptomatic individuals may not self report as a result clinical testing alone fails to identify many infected individuals before they transmit the disease to others and under represents caseload numbers utilized by officials to inform public health directives the need to address these shortcomings with a supplementary epidemiological tool was recognized early in the pandemic with a global collaborative of researchers advocating for wastewater based epidemiology wbe bivins et al 2020 wbe efficiently and non invasively monitors community metrics by sampling generated wastewater and screening for chemical and biological entities with previous success demonstrated in tracking community drug use daughton 2001 choi et al 2018 and poliovirus circulation asghar et al 2014 who 2003 hovi et al 2012 wastewater networks can be sampled at points at which discharges from community members have combined aggregating a semi anonymous signal representative of the upstream community analyzing aggregated wastewater for sars cov 2 rna therefore provides an opportunity to test entire communities within a single sample as sars cov 2 rna is present in the feces of both symptomatic jiehao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a holshue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b wu et al 2020b wölfel et al 2020 and asymptomatic tang et al 2020 lo et al 2020 han et al 2020 covid 19 infected individuals analysis of those samples offers rapid insight into infection prevalence potentially unhindered by factors such as symptom onset and the healthcare seeking behavior of individuals further whereas this aggregated testing cannot pinpoint infected individuals it can allow for more effective use of clinical testing resources for example wbe can quickly identify the regions and communities with the most infections and allow for the targeted allocation of resources to those hotspots for early and comprehensive testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic persons on a localized level hart and halden 2020 although sars cov 2 rna fecal shedding behavior has been reported as erratic walsh et al 2020 wastewater represents a complex mixture of all liquid conveyed waste exiting a premise including urinary respiratory oral and hygiene based discharges compositing multiple potential sources of viral rna an international network of researchers has detected sars cov 2 rna in their local wastewaters gonzalez et al 2020

proof of concept for wbe in the context of covid 19 monitoring and work to validate the utility of the approach these previous studies primarily sampled from wastewater treatment plants water resource recovery facilities efficient locations for obtaining population level signals monitoring the upstream sewer network and sampling at the building or microsewershed scale however enhances spatial resolution and enables more targeted surveillance and response efforts a number of building level campaigns have been implemented in response to covid 19 particularly at colleges but more experience and guidance are desired to inform their further implementation harris lovett et al 2021 here we report the wbe campaign conducted at the university of colorado boulder colorado usa we sampled up to 20 manhole locations seven days per week between august 25th and november 23rd to monitor on campus residential buildings for the presence of covid 19 to obtain economical 24 h composite samples we designed assembled and deployed low cost autosamplers we tracked the concentrations of sars cov 2 rna and control species in the wastewater using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr assays following best practices ahmed et al 2021 and reported to campus decision makers daily this campaign was coupled with weekly individualized saliva monitoring rt qpcr testing of all asymptomatic on campus residents yang et al 2021 bjorkman et al 2021 the comprehensiveness of both the wbe campaign and the clinical and saliva monitoring testing services provides a unique opportunity in evaluating the utility of building level wastewater surveillance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample locations twenty sample locations targeting the wastewater outfall captured within surface accessible manholes were prioritized to discriminate the sars cov 2 signals originating from the on campus residential buildings at the university of colorado boulder fig 1 a table 1 twenty three pumps autosamplers operated at these locations with three sites discriminating two separate flows within a single manhole overall then 23 flows from 20 manhole locations were monitored each flow roughly corresponded to an individual residential structure except for the flow that originated from the singular monitored administrative building the university housed over 6200 students in on campus residential buildings during the semester and each flow on average accounted for the wastewater generated by 450 residents range extending from 109 to 2048 residents with select residents being monitored at multiple sites the targeted manholes ranged from approximately 1 to 7 m in depth to protect the privacy of residents the presented data was anonymized with a unique label assigned to each

tubing and exterior casing fig 1 b supplemental figure 1 supplemental table 1 the samplers were positioned above ground and next to each manhole fig 1 c the wastewater inflow and overflow tubing lines were fed through the d pick of the manhole cover and the inlet strainer that resided in the underground wastewater stream was constructed from either ¼ in o d copper or ¼ in o d steel tubing with 0 157 in holes drilled into the side to achieve daily composite samples representative of flushes that occurred throughout the entire day the pumps operating at around 33 of full capacity slowly but continuously pulled and deposited wastewater into the 5 gal jerrycans collection of approximately 50 ml sub samples occurred daily between 7 am and 12 pm with power banks replaced every 48 h and ice packs replaced daily when ambient average temperatures exceeded 4 c these collection and maintenance tasks each only required the pump to be off for about 10 to 30 min and thus did not significantly detract from continuous pump operation whereas each pump was scheduled to draw about 10 l of wastewater per day the actual wastewater withdrawn was monitored at the time of sample collection by weighing the jerrycan mass with a luggage scale supplemental figure 2 supplemental table 2 the following three sub samples were collected from each sampler daily one for rna extraction and viral detection one for the determination of basic water quality parameters and one backup samplers were only turned off for entire days for the following three events a september blizzard a supply chain

total rna extracted and roughly assess the success of the extraction process supplemental table 5 2 3 3 rt qpcr two separate rt qpcr pipelines were then used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna full details fulfilling the miqe guidelines are provided as supplemental supplemental file 1 taylor et al 2010 in brief the first rt qpcr pipeline entitled surv1 was executed by the university of colorado boulder s covid surveillance laboratory simultaneously with the sampling campaign surv1 employed a multiplex assay targeting the sars cov 2 nucleocapsid n and envelope e genomic regions as well as the human rnasep transcript supplemental figures 5 6 supplemental tables 6 7 yang et al 2021 from august 28th to september 29th the n1 primer and probe set was used to detect the nucleocapsid region after september 30th the n2 primer and probe set was used instead because of supply chain constraints associated with the primer probe master mixes similar efficiencies were noted between n1 and n2 multiple technical replicates were not run the second rt qpcr pipeline entitled senb was executed in december 2020 after the fall sampling campaign had ended in this second pipeline the extracted rna samples frozen at 80 c were reevaluated for sars cov 2 rna using a wastewater specific multiplex assay detecting the following targets sars cov 2 n n2 sars cov 2 e the spiked internal control bovine coronavirus and genogroup ii f rna bacteriophage supplemental table 8 genogroup ii f rna bacteriophage was targeted to serve as a human fecal indicator cole et al 2003 to quantify the senb data standard curves were established for each run from ten fold serial dilutions ranging from 105 106 and 106 copies to 1 10 and 10 copies of sars cov 2 bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage standard per

per reaction supplemental figure 9 sars cov 2 e and n2 bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage amplicons recovered from wastewater collected from the primary isolation building on september 17th 2020 were subjected to sanger sequencing at the university of colorado anschutz molecular biology core to confirm that the expected sequences were amplified the recovered amplicons matched the expected targeted sequences overall detailed protocols are provided in supplemental file 1 for both the surv1 and senb pipelines 2 4 data normalization sars cov 2 data from surv1 was normalized by subtracting because these values are logarithmic in nature the rnasep ct value from the sars cov 2 e ct value a comparative ct method common in diagnostic pcr assays dahdouh et al 2021 rowan et al 2021 the n gene was utilized to confirm trends data from senb was processed by calculating copies per liter of wastewater using the recorded masses of sample collected and concentrated supplemental table 11 and the

e s s e d the bovine coronavirus and f bacteriophage signals were used to track sample variability but not to transform the concentration of sars cov 2 rna the bovine coronavirus recovery efficiency was determined by comparing the rt qpcr obtained concentration value to the extracted rna concentration of the spiked in control throughout the campaign the recovery efficiency averaged 53 30 s d october 2nd samples are masked from this analysis because they were frozen prior to extraction and a key intermediate weight was not recorded 2 5 incorporation of medical services and isolation space utilization data on campus medical services in wardenburg health performed nasal swab lyra direct sars cov 2 assays quidel corporation san diego ca usa to confirm suspected cases within the community individuals tested for suspected infection included symptomatic students students identified through contact tracing and students presumed positive based on their weekly saliva monitoring rt qpcr test results the affirmative medical services data are considered as positive detections within the residential structures and the date of each positive is used to denote the case though that date is not the date of actual infection supplemental table 12 isolation space utilization data tracked the number of beds in designated isolation spaces occupied on a given day supplemental table 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the composite samplers in general the composite samplers performed well reliably withdrawing sample mass table 1 the design achieved the objectives and provided an economical sampling unit additionally if a source of electricity is near the sample point then the cost decreases with removing the necessity of the power bank throughout the campaign concerns were noted over leakage through the small sampling port on the jerrycan and the inlet strainer either clogging or being knocked offline because of toilet paper accumulation during low flow conditions to prevent further leakage a short pvc tube was epoxied to the small sampling port and positioned such that the free end of the tube sat with a removable cap above the jerrycan several redesigns of the inlet strainer suffered similar issues as the primary design exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of flushable wipes these issues occasionally disabled continuous wastewater collection at a site for numerous hours until a team member could manually correct them unclogging and redeploying the inlet strainers remained the primary maintenance demand future surveillance campaigns may consider more permanent modifications to the flow path to enable ease of sample collection while inlet strainer issues contributed to variability in the daily withdrawn wastewater supplemental table 2 we do not believe they impaired our results clogging was uncommon among the collective set of sites and a similar wbe campaign that collected grab samples representative of a single time point rather than composite samples successfully monitored the presence of sars cov 2 betancourt et al 2021 additionally some of the variability in the withdrawn amounts is attributable not to these inlet issues but to air bubbles getting pumped with wastewater during periods of low flow 3 2 dataset summary prior to resumption of on campus activities incoming on campus residents were required to test five days prior to the scheduled move in august 17th 21st establishing the baseline an initial increase in sars cov 2 rna wastewater concentrations was detected near the beginning of the campaign fig 2 this event occurred two weeks after the labor day holiday in the usa with many traced large off campus gatherings the wastewater concentrations plateaued the week of september 15th and were in decline prior to boulder county enacting aggressive social distancing policies on september 24th fig 2 a that concentrations were already decreasing before these policies were enacted likely reflects the success of on campus testing tracing and isolation efforts the september 24th orders were enforced until october 13th and prohibited 1 anyone aged 18 to 22 years old in the city of boulder from engaging in gatherings and 2 residents in 36 nearby off campus buildings from leaving their place of residence to the maximum extent possible stay at home order boulder county public health 2020 well after the expiration of those public health orders another increase in wastewater concentrations was detected after october 31st the halloween holiday in the usa clinical services detected fewer cases on campus during this event 119 individuals from halloween until the end of monitoring as compared to the september event 530 individuals up until october 1st and this lower caseload was reflected in the nearly halved average sars cov 2 wastewater concentration 3 6 106 7 2 105 compared to 6 6 106 5 6 105 sars cov 2 copies l the similar dynamics emphasize a quantitative relationship not simply a presence or absence of viral rna correlation between the sars cov 2 caseload and the wastewater concentrations finally students vacated campus prior to november 23rd for the scheduled end of in person instruction the sars cov 2 wastewater concentration averages taken over the monitoring campaign fig 2 c largely reflect on campus prevalence fig 2 g number of reported infections within a residential structure divided by the initial census data fig 2 e when masking data from wastewater samplers that were activated later in the semester both the surv1 data and the senb data reflected the medical services data throughout the campaign fig 2 b d f h supplemental tables 7 10 12 overall the e data from the surv1 and senb pipelines are consistent when surv1 s e to rnasep ratio is compared to senb s log10 sars cov 2 copies l in a linear model lm function in r the slope of the linear model is 0 17 with an intercept of 4 88 and a residual standard error of 0 63 a multiple r2 of 0 37 and a p value 2 2 10 16 this result suggests that a single technical replicate the surv1 dataset is admissible when performing a daily monitoring campaign and when resources become limited due to either supply chain disruptions or rapid campaign expansions designed to meet the pace of emerging pandemics technical replicates are still recommended when feasible the senb dataset to avoid false reporting additionally the sars cov 2 e and n2 targets displayed a linear correlation of 0 97 in the senb data supplemental figure 10 confirming that both are suitable to track the prevalence of the virus the quantitative range of the predicted concentrations in terms of genome copies per liter of wastewater was also similar for both targets we still recommend monitoring multiple targets of different genes encoded in the genome of sars cov 2 to ensure that mutations within viral variants detectable in wastewater crits christoph et al 2021 do not immediately produce an overall false negative by interfering with primer or probe sites the reported medical services data is mirrored in the sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations detected on the same day likely reflecting the high frequency with which both wastewater sampling daily and compulsory individualized saliva monitoring testing weekly were executed but these datasets are not perfectly matched to analyze the co occurrence of an individual s positive test result with the detection of a high sars cov 2 concentration in their residential structure s wastewater on either the same day or in near temporal proximity we considered the 16 wastewater samplers not impacted by flow originating from isolating individuals a total of 1103 wastewater samples were collected from those 16 samplers over the course of the campaign 556 individuals tested positive within the residential structures served by those samplers for 547 of those positive tests the individual s test result was reported the same day a wastewater sample was collected for their residential structure corresponding to 246 wastewater samples notably the wastewater signal from structure h is duplicated in the i h signal to account for this duplication we increase the considered numbers by the number of duplicated events i e the total number of positive individuals from structure h 22 and the number of wastewater samples collected from structure i h over the days those individuals positive tests were reported 15 therefore 261 of the 1103 wastewater samples represent structures with a corresponding 569 positive population equivalents when setting the wastewater concentration that must be exceeded to indicate contribution by an infected individual at 105 106 and 107 sars cov 2 copies l a total of 521 450 and 146 expected cases 92 79 and 26 of all cases respectively are effectively captured in the wastewater sample on the day of positive testing however the specificity of using the day of 105 sars cov 2 copies l as a cutoff is low with 741 of all 1 103 67 wastewater samples exceeding this threshold and only 229 of these samples directly mapped to a positive this exceedance results from individuals shedding sars cov 2 rna prior to testing positive and individuals requiring time post identification to relocate from the residential building into the isolation space expanding the timeframe considered around a positive detection in the medical services data may lead to better association with the sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations when considering a time window of five total days surrounding the date of positive testing 48 to 72 h 67 and 92 of the samples exceeding 105 and 107 sars cov 2 copies l respectively correspond to a detected medical services positive supplemental table 14 in total 600 of the 1103 considered wastewater samples were collected within a positive s 5 day time window 92 of these samples with sars cov 2 signals below loq 468 samples were not 214 of these samples with sars cov 2 signals below loq and 35 were excluded due to an overlap with the termination of the sampling period the average wastewater concentrations for the time windows associated with a positive and the time windows not associated with a positive were 7 0 106 1 5 106 and 1 2 106 3 3 105 sars cov 2 copies l 95 confidence interval respectively with a significant kruskal wallis chi squared difference equal to 77 8 p value 2 2 10 16 this result supports the hypothesis that samples taken temporally nearer to an infection will display a higher concentration of sars cov 2 copies l wastewater than samples taken temporally farther from an infection however only 12 of the considered 16 samplers display a significant difference between their respective means time windows associated with a positive mean versus time windows not associated with a positive mean when considered individually with samplers d1 d2 h and m displaying no significant difference supplemental figure 11 over the campaign 14 13 22 and 61 infections were detected in the populations served by these four samplers respectively the d1 d2 and h samplers were established after the main peak of september cases october 15th november 1st and september 16th respectively resulting in a lower overall infection incidence and in the case of d2 relatively distributed caseloads in which 19 of the 21 possible wastewater datapoints fall within the 48 to 72 h time window of a detected positive when relating the concentration of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater to the medical services data the isolation strategy enabled further estimation of the sars cov 2 shed by infected individuals into wastewater infected individuals received temporary housing in the primary isolation building up until september 18th and after october 6th and were assigned to a secondary building in the interim fig 3 two residential structures a and b are apartment complexes which enabled infected residents to instead isolate in place isolation in these alternate structures complicated the signal in their associated wastewater flows as well as in the combined g fedcba flow the e2 cba flow is not noted given that sampler began operating after october 6th it is further noteworthy that such combined flows bias the median data fig 2 a with the contribution of a single infection potentially detected at multiple sites these complications emphasize the importance of quantifying the signal for these locations rather than relying on binary presence absence of virus determinations quantification enables the detection of temporal trends such as increasing sars cov 2 rna concentrations above the expected baseline additionally students do not proceed through the entire course of infection profiled within a given residence and shift their contribution to the isolation structures fig 3 the isolation buildings maintained a unique wastewater in which the flow did not represent a fluctuating proportion of infected individuals amongst non infected individuals these buildings were instead occupied entirely by individuals progressing through the course of the viral infection remaining empty otherwise the wastewater concentrations from the primary isolation building peaked in mid september 4 6 107 sars cov 2 copies l on september 11th and again in mid november 2 7 107 sars cov 2 copies l on november 16th fig 3 these peaks resulted from the co occurrence of disease progression and virus viral rna shedding in stool explaining the two peaks nearly identical wastewater concentrations despite different numbers of infected residents 75 and 25 respectively in this building the viral wastewater inputs of a smaller number of infected individuals were not diluted by the inputs of a corresponding larger proportion of non infected residents the isolated individuals wastewater mixed only with idle plumbing and appliance flows the peaks noted over october reflect the progression of viral shedding from individual contributions although this value will vary with the underlying characteristics of the idle flow emanating from each building from the presented data the expected maximum concentration of detectable sars cov 2 within domestic wastewater in the usa should be near 107 genome copies l considering that individuals in residences are expected to produce between 100 250 l of wastewater per day the maximum shedding per person is on the order of 1010 sars cov 2 genome copies day in agreement with schmitz et al 2021 this number additionally aligns with the upper end of identified fecal concentration ranges suggesting that individuals within these structures likely produce between 100 1000 ml of feces per day 5 103 107 6 copies ml feces foladori et al 2020 notably this analysis is corroborated by the concentrations noted in the secondary isolation building during the peak of infections in september 1 7 107 sars cov 2 copies l on september 27th from 158 infected isolating residents fig 3 the concentration of fecal matter becomes more critical when considering wider communities with industrial infiltration and other diluting contributions to wastewater in initial attempts to normalize to the varying concentrations of fecal matter within the wastewater samples the genogroup ii f bacteriophage was selected as an internal reference marker for the fall campaign to align with other sampling efforts ongoing within colorado at the microsewershed level the f bacteriophage signal displayed inconsistent geographical and temporal trends fig 4 select sites e g r q and o displayed consistently low signals within the range of 104 to 106 copies l whereas other sites e g g fedcba j and l admin displayed signals often approaching 109 copies l even more concerning sites such as c f h m and n displayed inconsistent temporal trends fluctuating over five orders of magnitude during the campaign these shifts potentially result from either changes in resident diet or interpersonal fluctuations in the gut virome minot et al 2011 the f bacteriophage was therefore replaced by the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov for the spring 2021 monitoring campaign rosario et al 2009 3 3 utility and consideration of the data throughout the fall monitoring campaign the interpretation and utility of the data varied with the prevalence of sars cov 2 within the community considering six scenarios in which the concentration of sars cov 2 is 1 absent 2 low and stable 3 low and increasing 4 high and increasing stable 5 high and decreasing and 6 decreasing to absent the daily monitoring campaign provided varying levels of support to the pandemic response wbe s utility as an early warning signal is primarily experienced in scenarios 1 2 and 3 in which early detections are the most critical for either preventing or halting community spread our campaign demonstrated this utility within the first two weeks of monitoring when high wastewater concentrations were detected for structures k p and q residents and employees in these structures were specifically contacted within 12 h of the reporting of the wastewater results and asked to submit a saliva sample for rt qpcr testing as soon as possible this testing revealed individual cases not yet discovered by routine saliva monitoring that were then successfully isolated this prevention response required the deployment of the robust and well connected testing contact tracing and isolation infrastructure when entering either scenario 4 or 5 the primary utility in wbe is in monitoring the effectiveness of public health intervention strategies employed the overall fall campaign provided an example in which the peak in sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations occurred before the social distancing order imposed by the county therefore the on campus mechanism of testing tracing and isolation was demonstrated as effective prior to a more robust and stringent social distancing order being put in place the wastewater concentration data was directly used to assess the success and viability of the interventions on campus both internally and with public health officials this monitoring better equips public health officials to determine appropriate responses with the infrastructure at hand notably with more stringent control measures likely leading to migration from campus and potentially transporting viral infections abroad and or allowing reentry of the virus from broader community acquired infections when social distancing requirements ease after the public health orders were enacted in boulder wi fi connections within residence halls decreased by 33 additionally clinical testing data later in the semester identified cases with low viral loads without an active infection highlighting cases in which progression through the disease profile occurred off campus during this recovery phase scenario 6 wastewater data also monitors individuals who may still shed viral rna even after exiting the infectious period on campus students were permitted to leave the isolation structure and return to their residences after ten days these reentry events could be detected in the wastewater e g see site o fig 2 reentries thus must also be taken into consideration to prevent shifts in policy based on a true detected signal that is not reflective of a case of concern across university campuses globally and reported within this study the utility of wastewater monitoring to support public health has been demonstrated for example coupling building level wastewater sampling two to three times per week with clinical testing has been demonstrated as an effective approach at diverse institutions such as the university of arizona arizona usa betancourt et al 2021 university of north carolina at charlotte north carolina usa gibas et al 2021 and kenyon college ohio usa barich and slonczewski 2021 at hope college michigan usa travis et al 2021 implemented a higher collection frequency by sampling from nine on campus residential zones every weekday in these campaigns wastewater samples indicating infection prevalence led to clinical testing of all individuals associated with the flagged buildings populations subject to university specific decision frameworks all found wbe to be a valuable tool for disease containment often noting wastewater surveillance s utility for identifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals 4 conclusions with the wide range of fluctuations in daily habits surrounding toilet flushes and personal hygiene behaviors combined with rapid changes in viral loads daily monitoring becomes critical to track the prevalence of pathogens within building scale wastewater the demonstrated monitoring campaign informed on the emergence of likely new infections within given residential

16626,in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr tetrasphaera can potentially be an abundant and important polyphosphate accumulating organism pao however ongoing questions remain concerning its storage compounds phosphorus p removal capabilities and metabolic behaviour this study investigated each of these points in an enriched tetrasphaera culture 95 biovolume the enriched tetrasphaera culture fermented amino acids while also converting and storing diverse amino acids as aspartic and glutamic acid within cells subsequent intracellular consumption of these two amino acids during the aerobic phase supports their importance in the metabolism of tetrasphaera polyhydroxyalkanoate pha cycling was also observed in this study in contrast to some previous studies on tetrasphaera while exhibiting anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic uptake the highly enriched tetrasphaera culture was unable to completely remove phosphorus in sequencing batch reactors sbr cycles with an average removal efficiency of 72 3 7 8 this is unlike a previous study containing both tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 which regularly performed complete phosphorus removal under otherwise similar operational conditions at efficiencies of 99 notably the phylodiversity of organisms belonging to tetrasphaera was substantially different in the present work consisting mainly of organisms within clade 2 likely impacting pha cycling these results suggest that the contribution of tetrasphaera towards p removal is highly dependent on the composition of its clades within this microbial group and an observed higher abundance of tetrasphaera in wwtps does not necessarily imply overall higher p removal this study improves our understanding of the role of tetrasphaera within ebpr systems and key factors impacting its metabolism keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal polyphosphate accumulating organisms accumulibacter tetrasphaera amino acids polyhydroxyalkanoate 1 introduction tetrasphaera and accumulibacter are polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos known to facilitate enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr while the importance of accumulibacter as a pao has been recognised over the past few decades increased attention has been placed on tetrasphaera and is the focus of this study due to the genus observed abundance globally in full scale wastewater treatment plants dueholm et al 2021 saunders et al 2015 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 exhibiting aspects of the pao phenotype consisting of anaerobic phosphorus release induced by carbon consumption with subsequent phosphorus uptake under aerobic conditions tetrasphaera has demonstrated considerable differences to accumulibacter with respect to preference of carbon source and storage compounds produced consumed under anaerobic aerobic conditions liu et al 2019 both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter possess the polyphosphate kinase 1 gene ppk1 which catalyses the synthesis of polyphosphate poly p and the polyphosphate kinase 2 gene ppk2 which facilitates the degradation of poly p and subsequent production of atp kristiansen et al 2013 mcmahon et al 2002 it is established that accumulibacter paos leverage the hydrolysis of stored poly p and often glycogen to drive organic carbon uptake and generate poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions pha is oxidised to facilitate growth and replenish polyphosphate and glycogen pools under aerobic conditions smolders et al 1995 while accumulibacter is known to take up primarily volatile fatty acids vfas tetrasphaera have demonstrated a preference to ferment alternative carbon sources such as glucose and amino acids aa however specific anaerobic and aerobic transformations involved in tetrasphaera metabolism particularly regarding the cycling of storage products are still unclear liu et al 2019 pha while of high importance in accumulibacter metabolism has been suggested to not be cycled by tetrasphaera fernando et al 2019 found that pha storage by tetrasphaera was undetected with raman microspectroscopy while the pha synthase phac gene is absent in some of the tetrasphaera isolates it is suggested to be present in t japonica t vanveenii and t veronensis liu et al 2019 considering the diversity of tetrasphaera organisms in ebpr plants is quite large particularly in side stream plant configurations nguyen et al 2011 onnis hayden et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it is not clear if pha can be completely ruled out of the metabolism of tetrasphaera moreover much of the previous work concerning tetrasphaera metabolism has focussed specifically on cultures of t elongata fernando et al 2019 herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 glycogen a storage polymer of recognised importance in accumulibacter metabolism oehmen et al 2007 has also been found to be cycled by tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 rubio rincón et al 2019 supported by the presence of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis genes in tetrasphaera isolates kristiansen et al 2013 when fed with a sugar substrate such as glucose glycogen is produced anaerobically and subsequently used aerobically for p uptake and biomass growth kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 the anaerobic amino acid metabolism by tetrasphaera has been suggested to include storage of amino acids in addition to fermentation herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 when fed labelled glycine under anaerobic conditions accumulation of intracellular glycine was observed including conversion to other amino acids nguyen et al 2015 marques et al 2017 observed using microautoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridisation mar fish that tetrasphaera was specifically responsible for anaerobic amino acid consumption within a culture enriched in tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 amino acids such as glutamate valine phenylalanine aspartate and proline were detected in the cells after anaerobic conditions through gas chromatography gc though quantification of the storage products was not performed in that study as proteins and thus amino acids can comprise close to 35 of the organic matter present in wastewater nielsen et al 2010 an understanding of the role of these substrates in tetrasphaera metabolism is needed particularly the quantification of storage products when fed multiple amino acids anaerobically fermentation products such as succinate lactate acetate and propionate have also been found to be produced by tetrasphaera herbst et al 2019 kong et al 2008 nielsen et al 2012 marques et al 2017 demonstrated that organisms such as accumulibacter paos and competibacter gaos could survive on fermentation products produced by tetrasphaera indeed the need to understand the synergistic relationship between the two pao groups is becoming increasingly recognised nielsen et al 2019 where the role of amino acids in the metabolism of tetrasphaera is a limiting factor towards achieving this objective using raman spectroscopy fernando et al 2019 indicated that while accumulibacter could store three times as much poly p as compared to t elongata cells tetrasphaera could contribute to a significant portion of phosphorus removal when sufficient numbers are present since tetrasphaera often out number accumulibacter particularly in side stream ebpr plants muszynski and zaleska radziwill 2015 onnis hayden et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the impact of tetrasphaera in ebpr may be of high importance to p removal the enriched culture of marques et al 2017 with both tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 was able to achieve high p removal 99 assuming that pha utilisation was carried out exclusively by accumulibacter the amount of pha cycled in that study suggested that tetrasphaera performed much of the p removal in that system approximately 80 the tetrasphaera biovolume structure observed by marques et al 2017 comprised predominantly of clade 1 38 5 1 4 clade 3 31 0 4 3 with negligible clade 2 2 as measured by tet 1 266 tet3 645 and tet2 174 tet2 892 probes respectively nguyen et al 2011 phylogenetically tetrasphaera and accumulibacter both consist of multiple clades tetrasphaera has thus far been suggested to consist of three clades as characterised by nguyen et al 2011 recently kolakovic et al 2021 established a relationship between the specific accumulibacter identity and the p removal performance of certain sub clusters within accumulibacter clade iic however the impact of tetrasphaera clade composition on ebpr performance has not previously been evaluated in this study we investigate the impact of tetrasphaera clade diversity on p removal by exposing an enriched tetrasphaera 80 biovolume inoculum from marques et al 2018 to anaerobic aerobic conditions with casein amino acids as the carbon source in the feed the performance of this reactor was compared to a previous study by marques et al 2017 which assessed an enriched tetrasphaera culture under similar conditions although with a different microbial community composition additionally the role of amino acids in the anaerobic metabolism of an enriched tetrasphaera culture through the extracellular and intracellular quantification of amino acids was evaluated to the best of our knowledge this is the first study designed to examine the impact of variation in tetrasphaera clade diversity on p removal performance moreover it quantitatively examines the anaerobic aerobic intracellular metabolism of tetrasphaera with amino acids and improves our understanding of their role in ebpr 2 material and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr operation an sbr with 2l of working volume was inoculated with a mixed culture obtained from the study of marques et al 2018 the sbr was fed with sodium casein hydrolysate henceforth referred to as casein as the carbon source where the operational cycle was similar to that described in marques et al 2017 briefly the 8 h cycle consisted of an anaerobic phase 4 h settling phase 45 min decant phase 15 min and aerobic phase 3 h mineral medium with carbon source a was fed continuously during the first 3h of the anaerobic phase while mineral and phosphate medium b was fed in the first 5 min of the aerobic phase the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt were 16 h and 20 days respectively anaerobic and aerobic conditions were obtained through bubbling argon and air respectively during the settling and decant phases bubbling of argon and air were turned off ph was controlled at 7 1 0 1

acquired from the setubal ebpr plant located in portugal ww was maintained at less than 4 c prior to the tests to limit biological activity and consumption of substrate three batch reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were used to perform the 8 h cycles with 4 h anaerobic 1 h settling decant where biomass was centrifuged and washed twice to prevent any organic carbon entering the aerobic phase see below for more details and 3 h aerobic phases similarly to the parent sbr the batch tests were inoculated with 400 ml of sludge from the parent sbr collected at the end of the aerobic phase sludge was washed twice with mineral media without carbon source after centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min the sludge was re suspended to a final volume of 150 ml using mineral media all solutions were bubbled with argon before starting the tests to ensure anaerobic conditions mineral medium a 100 ml and phosphate solution b 150 ml were added with the sludge to the batch reactor vessel culture media ph was adjusted to 7 0 prior to carbon source addition 100 ml which represented the commencement of the batch test the stirring rate was 300 rpm the temperature was maintained by a water bath at 20 1ºc and ph was controlled at 7 1 0 1 at the end of the anaerobic phase 4 h the reactor content was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with mineral medium without carbon source the sludge was re suspended with a final volume of 350 ml with 100 ml of mineral media without carbon source and 250 ml of distilled water before starting the aerobic phase 3 h 150 ml of

acid mixture the organic carbon and mineral medium solutions were adjusted to a ph of 7 4 and 7 0 respectively and autoclaved as described for sbr operation batch test 3 real wastewater influent was

then 32 μl of bstfa aldrich usa was added and the sample was incubated for 125 min at 35 c 2 5 microbial characterisation the microbial composition of the sbr was assessed by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish according to amann 1995 fish quantification qfish was performed by image analysis with a zeiss lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope further details are described in marques et al 2017 2 6 stoichiometric and kinetic calculations the anaerobic maintenance coefficient of tetrasphaera was calculated from batch tests fed without carbon source in marques et al 2017 the anaerobic glycogen consumption rate in the batch test where no carbon was present measured 13 93 c mmol c mol h the atp production from glycogen degradation was taken to be 0 5 atp mmol c mmol glycogen identical to that used in marques et al 2017 and normalised to the tetrasphaera abundance of 70 biovolume as measured by qfish 2 7 energetic assessment atp balances were performed for the anerobic aerobic batch tests utilising stickland reactions developed by ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 shown in table 1 as ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 do not present degradation pathways specifically for ornithine asparagine glutamine or citrulline the available full genomes of tetrasphaera isolates t australiensis t elongata t japonica and t jenkinsii were examined for possible degradation pathways using the microscope platform vallenet et al 2019 and bioinformatics pathway tools karp et al 2017 a summary of pathways can be found in table s2 of the supplementary material four assumptions were made based on the presence of common genes in the four genomes ornithine is assumed to be degraded through the glutamate pathway via acetylornithine transaminase ec 2 6 1 11 asparagine is assumed to be hydrolysed to aspartate and ammonia through a putative asparaginase ec 3 5 1 1 gene glutamine can be converted to glutamate through a reaction with 2 oxoglutarate and nadh via glutamate synthase ec 1 4 1 13 and citrulline can be phosphorylated to form l ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate via citrulline phosphorylase ec 2 1 3 3 3 results 3 1 microbial composition of the enriched culture the culture in this study seeded from the system operated by marques et al 2018 was fed strictly casein hydrolysate and operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions fish quantification was carried out on day 210 of sbr operation using probes outlined in table 2 and revealed a very high enrichment of tetrasphaera 95 a decline in the presence of competibacter super gaomix and defluviicoccus super dfmix gaos to 2 and reduction of accumulibacter paomix population to 0 5 was observed as compared to previous work the tetrasphaera population comprised a mixture of 3 clades however it consisted primarily of clade 2 organisms as identified by probes tet2 892 59 5 10 7 and tet2 174 8 7 2 4 some representative images taken for qfish are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material it should be highlighted that the culture from marques et al 2017 was used as the inoculum in marques et al 2018 which observed an increase in tetrasphaera population from 70 to 80 during that study most poignantly however is a significant shift in tetrasphaera clades between marques et al 2017 marques et al 2018 and this study operated under near identical conditions as this study the culture obtained by marques et al 2017 consisted of 70 tetrasphaera and 22 accumulibacter with negligible competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos interestingly though the bulk of the tetrasphaera population from marques et al 2017 consisted of clade 1 and 3 organisms with negligible clade 2 organisms present in contrast to results seen in this study and marques et al 2018 where a distinct dominance of clade 2 tetrasphaera organisms were found it is possible that the anoxic conditions employed by marques et al 2018 contributed towards the shift in tetrasphaera clades between studies while elucidation of how operational factors impact the enrichment of tetrasphaera clades was considered outside the scope of the present study understanding the impact of operational conditions on p removal by tetrasphaera is of key importance towards better optimising full scale ebpr applications potentially improving process stability future work related to this topic is recommended 3 2 sbr performance sbr cycle data from the 95 tetrasphaera culture henceforth referred to as 95 tet obtained in this study and marques et al 2017 with a 70 tetrasphaera 22 accumulibacter culture henceforth referred to as 70 tet 22 acc were analysed to understand the performance differences between cultures as previously noted both sbr cultures were fed strictly casein and operated under identical conditions consistent with marques et al 2017 anaerobic phosphorus release was observed when a mixture of amino acids was fed to this 95 tet culture although considerably lower anaerobic phosphorus release to carbon uptake 0 19 0 04 p mmol c mmol was obtained as compared to marques et al 2017 0 35 0 08 p mmol c mmol as shown in table 4 moreover a notable difference in the rate of aerobic phosphorus uptake can be seen between the cultures as shown in fig 1 and table 3 the aerobic p uptake rate observed during the first hour in this 95 tet reactor was less than half of that observed in the 70 tet 22 acc culture table 3 comparing p uptake across the full aerobic period a slower rate and incomplete uptake of p was observed in this work while near complete uptake in the first hour was seen in the 70 tet 22 acc culture while both cultures consisted of large populations of tetrasphaera only the 70 tet 22 acc culture was observed to take up phosphorus completely under aerobic conditions fig 2 shows the anaerobic toc uptake as well as the anaerobic aerobic p glycogen and pha profiles of the 95 tet culture captured from a cycle study performed on day 196 of the reactor operation anaerobic glycogen consumption 0 31 0 14 c mmol c mmol observed in this work was on average similar to that of the 70 tet 22 acc reactor although slightly higher aerobic glycogen storage was obtained in the present culture table 4 likely at the expense of polyphosphate storage under aerobic conditions as suggested by the lower p uptake anaerobic poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha production 0 13 0 18 c mmol c mmol and aerobic consumption was detected in this work which was not significantly different than that observed in the 70 tet 22 acc culture 0 15 0 04 c mmol c mmol there were no notable differences in the sbr volatile suspended solids concentration between this work and marques et al 2017 as shown in table 4 which was also fed the same cod concentration in the form of casein the anaerobic aerobic utilisation of glycogen and pha of both 95 tet and 70 tet 22 acc cultures were shown to be statistically similar in table 4 there is however a distinct difference between the 95 tet and 70 tet 22 acc cultures with respect to anaerobic aerobic phosphorus utilisation and polyphosphate storage in the sludge table 4 suggesting the 95 tet culture may be less reliant on phosphorus in their metabolism notably neither poly β hydroxybutyrate phb nor poly β hydroxy 2 methylvalerate ph2mv were cycled in the 95 tet culture unlike the study of marques et al 2017 performance profiles for the 95 tet culture for day 99 and 211 of operation can be found in figs s1 and s2 of the supplementary material respectively while the average and standard deviation of the anaerobic and aerobic activity across multiple cycles of operation is shown in table 4 the impact of other organisms in this culture on the observations of carbon uptake glycogen consumption or pha production cannot be completely discounted while the production of pha by the small amount of non tetrasphaera pao or gao cannot be ruled out assuming that the 1 5 of accumulibacter competibacter and defluviicoccus measured in the sludge behaved according to the acetate gao model by zeng et al 2003 or propionate gao model by oehmen et al 2006 non tetrasphaera related pao or gao in this culture could contribute no greater than 30 of the pha produced anaerobically moreover this result assumes acetate or propionate was generated anaerobically and immediately taken up by these other pao or gao as accumulation of vfas was never detected in these tests overall the experimental results support the suggestion that tetrasphaera related organisms were responsible for the bulk of the pha production observed from amino acid uptake in this culture future work is recommended to assess pha production by different tetrasphaera clades as it is frequently considered to be negligible for tetrasphaera in ebpr despite accumulibacter clade iif and defluviicoccus cluster 3 demonstrating the capacity to take up amino acids mcilroy and seviour 2009 qiu et al 2019 it is also considered unlikely both subgroups would have significantly contributed to anaerobic carbon consumption in this work based on the low abundance of each organism as measured by qfish 3 3 batch test results to validate the performance observed in the parent sbr as well as the role of pha in the amino acid metabolism of tetrasphaera batch tests were carried out using casein hydrolysate a mixture of 22 aa and real wastewater the aa batch test can be considered an extension of the parent sbr operation based on its similarity to the casein feed of the parent reactor while the purpose of the casein batch test was to assess the repeatability of the results from the parent reactor as well as its comparability with the aa batch test each of these tests was also compared to the culture behaviour with real wastewater feed to associate functional observations with microbial diversity the batch tests were performed over 7 days coinciding with day 205 211 of the parent sbr operation and qfish analysis was performed on day 210 to assess the microbial community during this period of operation it should be noted that during the 4 5 h period during batch tests biomass was settled decanted and washed with mineral media to prevent excess organic carbon entering the aerobic phase as detailed in the methods and materials section 2 2 3 3 1 casein and amino acid batch test casein and a 22 aa mixture was fed to the 95 tet enriched culture anaerobic and aerobic transformations of phosphorus glycogen and pha were analysed as well as the anaerobic carbon substrate consumption results of each batch test are shown in fig 3 with similar performance profiles being observed both casein and aa batch tests exhibited a similar anaerobic p release to carbon uptake ratio of 0 21 p mmol c mmol and 0 19 p mmol c mmol respectively likewise a similar trend in aerobic phosphorus uptake rate was shown along the test table 3 demonstrating consistency with sbr data obtained with the 95 tet culture similar to results in the 95 tet sbr cycles anaerobic pha production and aerobic consumption were observed in both casein and aa batch tests overall these results demonstrate that the highly enriched 95 tet culture behaved similarly under anaerobic and aerobic conditions when being fed casein hydrolysate or amino acids moreover pha was produced as a storage compound by the 95 tet culture when fed casein and aa where the pha composition consisted exclusively of phv as also observed in the parent sbr tables 4 and 5 3 3 2 real wastewater batch test to determine if the enriched 95 tet culture performs differently when fed a composite carbon source the culture was tested under similar conditions to the casein and aa experiments and was fed with raw wastewater from an ebpr plant located in setubal performance results from the wastewater batch test are shown in fig 4 when fed wastewater the 95 tet culture exhibited greater p release to carbon uptake 0 34 p mmol c mmol compared to the casein and aa batch tests and also increased p uptake 1 35 p mmol l despite consuming less carbon source anaerobically 7 8 c mmol l as compared to casein and aa batch tests table 5 notably lower anaerobic glycogen consumption and aerobic production was also observed in the ww batch test as compared to the casein and aa however consistent with sbr cycle results as well as the casein and aa batch tests the 95 tet culture also displayed anaerobic production and aerobic consumption of pha specifically phv when fed wastewater overall the batch test results indicate the metabolism of tetrasphaera behaves similarly when fed like substrates casein and aa although a notable shift occurs when an increased diversity of carbon sources consisting of carbohydrates lipids and volatile fatty acids were available anaerobically ww however even in the presence of a more diverse substrate composition ww the 95 tet culture was unable to perform net phosphorus removal suggesting that the presence of at least some members of tetrasphaera clade 2 may not be beneficial to ebpr 3 4 individual amino acid analysis individual aa transformations were monitored in the 22 c mmol l aa batch test in both the medium and intracellularly at the start and end of the anerobic and aerobic phases to uncover more about the amino acid metabolism of tetrasphaera the preference of tetrasphaera for specific amino acids as well as the identity of the stored aa were assessed fig 5 depicts transformations of the top 12 amino acids consumed by the 95 tet culture in the 22 aa batch test consumption of amino acids from the bulk media can be observed on the left hand axis where proline was completely taken up from the feed solution 1 cmmol l greater than 80 of glycine lysine tyrosine arginine cysteine was also observed to be consumed in the anaerobic phase overall 12 5 c mmol l of the 22 c mmol l solution was consumed to understand the individual transformations of amino acids on completion of the anaerobic and aerobic phases intracellular storage of amino acids was also measured and are also shown in fig 5 the raw data for all 22 amino acid transformations including consumption from the bulk media as well as intracellular storage levels at the end of the anaerobic and aerobic phase can be found in table s3 of the supplementary material interestingly 0 61 c mmol l of glutamic acid and 0 66 c mmol l of aspartic acid were consumed from the initial bulk media however much higher concentrations of both amino acids are present intracellularly at the end of the anaerobic phase measuring 1 86 c mmol l and 1 16 c mmol l respectively this observation suggests that under anaerobic conditions amino acids were preferentially converted to these two amino acids by the 95 tet culture these experimental observations are consistent with results observed by nguyen et al 2015 who suggested that t elongata produced and stored some glutamate under anaerobic conditions while being fed labelled glycine in addition to the observed glycine storage found in that study the anaerobic storage of free amino acids was observed to total 4 7 c mmol l in the subsequent aerobic phase 4 2 c mmol l were observed to be consumed with some conservation of glutamic and aspartic acid measuring 0 32 c mmol aa l and 0 15 c mmol aa l respectively the substantial cycling of these two amino acids in the anaerobic and aerobic phases suggests that they are key storage compounds in the amino acid metabolism of this 95 tetrasphaera culture to validate the existence of such pathways the genomes of available tetrasphaera isolates were examined using the microscope platform vallenet et al 2019 and bioinformatics pathway tools software karp et al 2017 results demonstrate that multiple amino acids can be degraded directly to glutamate via α ketoglutarate with some amino acids degraded to aspartate and others to pyruvate as summarised in table s2 of the supplementary material the presence of these genes has also been found in isolated clade 2 organisms t australiensis and t jenkinsii anaerobically several of the reactions are energetically favourable with the production of atp as depicted in fig 6 aerobically both glutamate and aspartate can readily re enter the tca cycle glutamate can re enter via α ketoglutarate and aspartate via oxaloacetate generating redox equivalents for atp production via oxidative phosphorylation or proceeding towards glycogen kristiansen et al 2013 3 5 energetic assessment to assess the coherency of the experimental data obtained in this study processes leading to atp production and consumption were examined and compared to investigate potential atp production from fermentation of amino acids atp production based on stickland reactions was summarised for each amino acid see table 1 and later compared with the total atp generated and consumed table 6 a detailed assessment is available in table s4 of the supplementary material based on atp generated from the fermentation of amino acids as well as the hydrolysis of poly p and glycolysis the total amount of atp produced was estimated to be 4 05 atp mmol l in the reactor clearly both poly p hydrolysis and fermentation represent the most substantial sources of atp generated by tetrasphaera with respect to cellular processes requiring atp consumption tetrasphaera could be utilising atp for amino acid transport as illustrated in fig 6 similar to that observed in accumulibacter smolders et al 1994b and also for cell maintenance purposes prokaryotes can transport amino acids into the cell via two main systems primary transporters termed abc cassettes which utilise atp to drive transport and secondary transporters driven by transmembrane electrochemical gradients hosie and poole 2001 jung et al 2006 madigan et al 2014 saier 2000 while it is impractical to determine the exact amount of amino acids transported into the cell via each transport system it is likely that a portion of amino acids are being transported through atp binding cassettes and thus consuming atp while others are being transported via secondary systems higgins and linton 2004 and george and jones 2012 suggest the atp substrate stoichiometric ratio for abc cassettes is 1 2 moles of atp required per mole of substrate transported across the cell membrane however more recent studies by lycklama a nijeholt et al 2018 on the glnpq abc importer for asparagine glutamine and glutamate suggest 2 moles of atp for transport by that system more work is required to characterise the range of prokaryote abc transporter systems nevertheless for the purposes of this study a composite atp requirement of 1 mol atp per mol of amino acid uptake was assumed to account for both the primary transport process based on abc cassettes and secondary transport process not requiring atp based on this assumption the energy required for transport equates to 2 89 atp mmol l since the combined total of amino acids taken up by the culture under anaerobic conditions in this batch test on a millimole basis was 12 5 c mmol l which equates to 2 89 mmol l the anaerobic maintenance coefficient of tetrasphaera was estimated based on kinetic data taken from marques et al 2017 to be 0 00488 atp mol c mol h approximately twice that observed by accumulibacter at 0 00235 atp mol c mol h see methods for calculation details the overall anaerobic energy balance comparing the reactions involving anaerobic atp production versus atp consumption is presented in table 6 the atp balance closed within 97 which is in very close agreement and suggests that the main atp producing and consuming reactions summarised in table 6 correspond well to those employed by the biomass furthermore closing of the atp balance supports the applicability of the assumption regarding the transport energetic requirement for the enriched culture of tetrasphaera 4 discussion it has been previously found that tetrasphaera have the potential to store similar amounts of poly p per cell on a volumetric basis as accumulibacter fernando et al 2019 and enriched tetrasphaera cultures have also shown the capacity for efficient p removal when fed amino acids fernando et al 2019 however the findings from this work demonstrate that a highly enriched tetrasphaera culture comprising predominantly clade 2 organisms are unable to carry out complete phosphorus removal when fed a mixture of amino acids nor when fed with raw wastewater as observed in the ww batch test a previous enrichment of tetrasphaera and accumulibacter showed that the tetrasphaera was an important contributor to p removal approx 80 of the total but this microbial group was mostly comprised of clades 1 and 3 in that study marques et al 2018 this result suggests that the composition of the tetrasphaera clades in an ebpr system play a crucial role in the extent and efficiency of phosphorus removal fig 7 compares the p removal performance of the ebpr system relative to the presence of tetrasphaera clades and accumulibacter in the present and previously studied tetrasphaera enrichments outcomes from this work suggest that clade 2 organisms which dominated this 95 tetrasphaera culture appear to prefer fermenting amino acids for atp generation but also storing two key amino acids namely glutamate and aspartate although this culture was observed to cycle poly p to a lesser extent than the 70 tet 22 acc culture of marques et al 2017 it is suggested that poly p still plays a crucial role in the metabolism of this 95 tet culture as a likely source of atp enabling amino acid uptake under anaerobic conditions notwithstanding this is the first work that identifies glutamic and aspartic acid as being key compounds in the anaerobic metabolism of tetrasphaera with both amino acids retained intracellularly at the completion of the anaerobic phase at greater concentrations than were taken up from the feed the pathways present in the t australiensis and t jenkinsii genomes allow for the direct conversion of several amino acids to glutamate and aspartate supporting the observations in this study further work should be carried out to examine and characterise the metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera including primary and secondary transport systems moreover understanding how the metabolism of tetrasphaera behaves in the presence of the mixed substrates found in wastewater also requires further study despite pha being previously excluded as a storage product of tetrasphaera phv cycling was observed in this work in both the sbr and in batch tests when fed casein aa and wastewater it is important to emphasise that the bulk of experimental knowledge currently available and commonly attributed to the tetrasphaera genus has disproportionality focused on t elongata fernando et al 2019 herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 which belongs to clade 1 moreover nouioui et al 2018 has suggested that clade 1 be reclassified out of tetrasphaera and into the phycicoccus genus calling into question if t elongata is truly a representative genome for the genus additionally the raman marker utilised by fernando et al 2019 was at 1726 cm 1 and is specific to poly β hydroxybutyrate phb majed and gu 2010 and would not account for other pha homopolymers such as poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phv is particularly difficult to measure by raman as no pure standard exists jost et al 2017 majed and gu 2010 as such caution is required when generalising metabolic traits to the whole tetrasphaera genus as phv is clearly being cycled by this 95 tet culture dominated by organisms belonging to tetrasphaera clade 2 while phv has primarily been associated with the uptake of propionate as a carbon source in pao metabolism or with acetate or propionate uptake by gaos oehmen et al 2007 recent studies also suggest that amino acids can contribute to the production of phv in accumulibacter qiu et al 2019 in the amino acid metabolism of this tetrasphaera culture phv formation could be utilised as both a carbon sink and means to balance the reducing equivalents under anaerobic conditions aerobically phv would be oxidised similar to accumulibacter to generate atp to facilitate growth replenish glycogen and store poly p overall this study improves our understanding of tetrasphaera metabolism from amino acids particularly regarding the storage products amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate as well as phv and the impact of tetrasphaera clade composition on aerobic p removal performance this knowledge will be highly valuable in future design and optimisation studies of ebpr systems where this group of organisms is often present in substantial abundance but rarely intentionally exploited as a means to improve p removal performance 5 conclusion a highly enriched culture of 95 tetrasphaera was obtained through anaerobic aerobic cycling when fed with a mixture of amino acids the culture was comprised mostly of clade 2 organisms with some clade 3 and a low fraction of clade 1 and with negligible accumulibacter paos competibacter gaos or defluviicoccus gaos present poorer phosphorus removal performance was observed in the sbr and batch tests with this culture as compared to other enriched tetrasphaera cultures and suggests p removal efficiency could be impacted by the tetrasphaera clade present notably phv cycling was observed in this work when the 95 tetrasphaera culture was fed casein a 22 amino acid mixture and raw wastewater it is suggested that the tetrasphaera organisms which dominated this culture ferment amino acids but also store free amino acids as glutamate and aspartate significant storage of these amino acids was observed at the conclusion of the anaerobic phase and were consumed aerobically although lower poly p cycling is observed in this work in comparison to other pao systems poly p is still considered to be a key storage compound by this culture hydrolysis of poly p could help facilitate anaerobic amino acid uptake through atp binding cassettes and aid in satisfying the anaerobic maintenance requirement with support from the atp produced via fermentation this work increases our knowledge on the functional diversity of the tetrasphaera genus and provides a basis for assessing its impact on ebpr system performance

16626,in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr tetrasphaera can potentially be an abundant and important polyphosphate accumulating organism pao however ongoing questions remain concerning its storage compounds phosphorus p removal capabilities and metabolic behaviour this study investigated each of these points in an enriched tetrasphaera culture 95 biovolume the enriched tetrasphaera culture fermented amino acids while also converting and storing diverse amino acids as aspartic and glutamic acid within cells subsequent intracellular consumption of these two amino acids during the aerobic phase supports their importance in the metabolism of tetrasphaera polyhydroxyalkanoate pha cycling was also observed in this study in contrast to some previous studies on tetrasphaera while exhibiting anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic uptake the highly enriched tetrasphaera culture was unable to completely remove phosphorus in sequencing batch reactors sbr cycles with an average removal efficiency of 72 3 7 8 this is unlike a previous study containing both tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 which regularly performed complete phosphorus removal under otherwise similar operational conditions at efficiencies of 99 notably the phylodiversity of organisms belonging to tetrasphaera was substantially different in the present work consisting mainly of organisms within clade 2 likely impacting pha cycling these results suggest that the contribution of tetrasphaera towards p removal is highly dependent on the composition of its clades within this microbial group and an observed higher abundance of tetrasphaera in wwtps does not necessarily imply overall higher p removal this study improves our understanding of the role of tetrasphaera within ebpr systems and key factors impacting its metabolism keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal polyphosphate accumulating organisms accumulibacter tetrasphaera amino acids polyhydroxyalkanoate 1 introduction tetrasphaera and accumulibacter are polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos known to facilitate enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr while the importance of accumulibacter as a pao has been recognised over the past few decades increased attention has been placed on tetrasphaera and is the focus of this study due to the genus observed abundance globally in full scale wastewater treatment plants dueholm et al 2021 saunders et al 2015 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 exhibiting aspects of the pao phenotype consisting of anaerobic phosphorus release induced by carbon consumption with subsequent phosphorus uptake under aerobic conditions tetrasphaera has demonstrated considerable differences to accumulibacter with respect to preference of carbon source and storage compounds produced consumed under anaerobic aerobic conditions liu et al 2019 both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter possess the polyphosphate kinase 1 gene ppk1 which catalyses the synthesis of polyphosphate poly p and the polyphosphate kinase 2 gene ppk2 which facilitates the degradation of poly p and subsequent production of atp kristiansen et al 2013 mcmahon et al 2002 it is established that accumulibacter paos leverage the hydrolysis of stored poly p and often glycogen to drive organic carbon uptake and generate poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions pha is oxidised to facilitate growth and replenish polyphosphate and glycogen pools under aerobic conditions smolders et al 1995 while accumulibacter is known to take up primarily volatile fatty acids vfas tetrasphaera have demonstrated a preference to ferment alternative carbon sources such as glucose and amino acids aa however specific anaerobic and aerobic transformations involved in tetrasphaera metabolism particularly regarding the cycling of storage products are still unclear liu et al 2019 pha while of high importance in accumulibacter metabolism has been suggested to not be cycled by tetrasphaera fernando et al 2019 found that pha storage by tetrasphaera was undetected with raman microspectroscopy while the pha synthase phac gene is absent in some of the tetrasphaera isolates it is suggested to be present in t japonica t vanveenii and t veronensis liu et al 2019 considering the diversity of tetrasphaera organisms in ebpr plants is quite large particularly in side stream plant configurations nguyen et al 2011 onnis hayden et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it is not clear if pha can be completely ruled out of the metabolism of tetrasphaera moreover much of the previous work concerning tetrasphaera metabolism has focussed specifically on cultures of t elongata fernando et al 2019 herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 glycogen a storage polymer of recognised importance in accumulibacter metabolism oehmen et al 2007 has also been found to be cycled by tetrasphaera kristiansen et al 2013 rubio rincón et al 2019 supported by the presence of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis genes in tetrasphaera isolates kristiansen et al 2013 when fed with a sugar substrate such as glucose glycogen is produced anaerobically and subsequently used aerobically for p uptake and biomass growth kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 the anaerobic amino acid metabolism by tetrasphaera has been suggested to include storage of amino acids in addition to fermentation herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 when fed labelled glycine under anaerobic conditions accumulation of intracellular glycine was observed including conversion to other amino acids nguyen et al 2015 marques et al 2017 observed using microautoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridisation mar fish that tetrasphaera was specifically responsible for anaerobic amino acid consumption within a culture enriched in tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 amino acids such as glutamate valine phenylalanine aspartate and proline were detected in the cells after anaerobic conditions through gas chromatography gc though quantification of the storage products was not performed in that study as proteins and thus amino acids can comprise close to 35 of the organic matter present in wastewater nielsen et al 2010 an understanding of the role of these substrates in tetrasphaera metabolism is needed particularly the quantification of storage products when fed multiple amino acids anaerobically fermentation products such as succinate lactate acetate and propionate have also been found to be produced by tetrasphaera herbst et al 2019 kong et al 2008 nielsen et al 2012 marques et al 2017 demonstrated that organisms such as accumulibacter paos and competibacter gaos could survive on fermentation products produced by tetrasphaera indeed the need to understand the synergistic relationship between the two pao groups is becoming increasingly recognised nielsen et al 2019 where the role of amino acids in the metabolism of tetrasphaera is a limiting factor towards achieving this objective using raman spectroscopy fernando et al 2019 indicated that while accumulibacter could store three times as much poly p as compared to t elongata cells tetrasphaera could contribute to a significant portion of phosphorus removal when sufficient numbers are present since tetrasphaera often out number accumulibacter particularly in side stream ebpr plants muszynski and zaleska radziwill 2015 onnis hayden et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the impact of tetrasphaera in ebpr may be of high importance to p removal the enriched culture of marques et al 2017 with both tetrasphaera 70 and accumulibacter 22 was able to achieve high p removal 99 assuming that pha utilisation was carried out exclusively by accumulibacter the amount of pha cycled in that study suggested that tetrasphaera performed much of the p removal in that system approximately 80 the tetrasphaera biovolume structure observed by marques et al 2017 comprised predominantly of clade 1 38 5 1 4 clade 3 31 0 4 3 with negligible clade 2 2 as measured by tet 1 266 tet3 645 and tet2 174 tet2 892 probes respectively nguyen et al 2011 phylogenetically tetrasphaera and accumulibacter both consist of multiple clades tetrasphaera has thus far been suggested to consist of three clades as characterised by nguyen et al 2011 recently kolakovic et al 2021 established a relationship between the specific accumulibacter identity and the p removal performance of certain sub clusters within accumulibacter clade iic however the impact of tetrasphaera clade composition on ebpr performance has not previously been evaluated in this study we investigate the impact of tetrasphaera clade diversity on p removal by exposing an enriched tetrasphaera 80 biovolume inoculum from marques et al 2018 to anaerobic aerobic conditions with casein amino acids as the carbon source in the feed the performance of this reactor was compared to a previous study by marques et al 2017 which assessed an enriched tetrasphaera culture under similar conditions although with a different microbial community composition additionally the role of amino acids in the anaerobic metabolism of an enriched tetrasphaera culture through the extracellular and intracellular quantification of amino acids was evaluated to the best of our knowledge this is the first study designed to examine the impact of variation in tetrasphaera clade diversity on p removal performance moreover it quantitatively examines the anaerobic aerobic intracellular metabolism of tetrasphaera with amino acids and improves our understanding of their role in ebpr 2 material and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr operation an sbr with 2l of working volume was inoculated with a mixed culture obtained from the study of marques et al 2018 the sbr was fed with sodium casein hydrolysate henceforth referred to as casein as the carbon source where the operational cycle was similar to that described in marques et al 2017 briefly the 8 h cycle consisted of an anaerobic phase 4 h settling phase 45 min decant phase 15 min and aerobic phase 3 h mineral medium with carbon source a was fed continuously during the first 3h of the anaerobic phase while mineral and phosphate medium b was fed in the first 5 min of the aerobic phase the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt were 16 h and 20 days respectively

acquired from the setubal ebpr plant located in portugal ww was maintained at less than 4 c prior to the tests to limit biological activity and consumption of substrate three batch reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were used to perform the 8 h cycles with 4 h anaerobic 1 h settling decant where biomass was centrifuged and washed twice to prevent any organic carbon entering the

a water bath at 20 1ºc and ph was controlled at 7 1 0 1 at the end of the anaerobic phase 4 h the reactor content was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with mineral medium without carbon source the sludge was re suspended with a final volume of 350 ml with 100 ml of mineral media without carbon source and 250 ml of distilled water before starting the aerobic phase 3 h 150 ml of

enriched culture the culture in this study seeded from the system operated by marques et al 2018 was fed strictly casein hydrolysate and operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions fish quantification was carried out on day 210 of sbr operation using probes outlined in table 2 and revealed a very high enrichment of tetrasphaera 95 a decline in the presence of competibacter super gaomix and defluviicoccus super dfmix gaos to 2 and reduction of accumulibacter paomix population to 0 5 was observed as compared to previous work the tetrasphaera population comprised a mixture of 3 clades however it consisted primarily of clade 2 organisms as identified by probes tet2 892 59 5 10 7 and tet2 174 8 7 2 4 some representative images taken for qfish are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material it should be highlighted that the culture from marques et al 2017 was used as the inoculum in marques et al 2018 which observed an increase in tetrasphaera population from 70 to 80 during that study most poignantly however is a significant shift in tetrasphaera clades between marques et al 2017 marques et al 2018 and this study operated under near identical conditions as this study the culture obtained by marques et al 2017 consisted of 70 tetrasphaera and 22 accumulibacter with negligible competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos interestingly though the bulk of the tetrasphaera population from marques et al 2017 consisted of clade 1 and 3 organisms with negligible clade 2 organisms present in contrast to results seen in this study and marques et al 2018 where a distinct dominance of clade 2 tetrasphaera organisms were found it is possible that the anoxic conditions employed by marques et al 2018 contributed towards the shift in tetrasphaera clades between studies while elucidation of how operational factors impact the enrichment of tetrasphaera clades was considered outside the scope of the present study understanding the impact of operational conditions on p removal by tetrasphaera is of key importance towards better optimising full scale ebpr applications potentially improving process stability future work related to this topic is recommended 3 2 sbr performance sbr cycle data from the 95 tetrasphaera culture henceforth referred to as 95 tet obtained in this study and marques et al 2017 with a 70 tetrasphaera 22 accumulibacter culture henceforth referred to as 70 tet 22 acc were analysed to understand the performance differences between cultures as previously noted both sbr cultures were fed strictly casein and operated under identical conditions consistent with marques et al 2017 anaerobic phosphorus release was observed when a mixture of amino acids was fed to this 95 tet culture although considerably lower anaerobic phosphorus release to carbon uptake 0 19 0 04 p mmol c mmol was obtained as compared to marques et al 2017 0 35 0 08 p mmol c mmol as shown in table 4 moreover a notable difference in the rate of aerobic phosphorus uptake can be seen between the cultures as shown in fig 1 and table 3 the aerobic p uptake rate observed during the first hour in this 95 tet reactor was less than half of that observed in the 70 tet 22 acc culture table 3 comparing p uptake across the full aerobic period a slower rate and incomplete uptake of p was observed in this work while near complete uptake in the first hour was seen in the 70 tet 22 acc culture while both cultures consisted of large populations of tetrasphaera only the 70 tet 22 acc culture was observed to take up phosphorus completely under aerobic conditions fig 2 shows the anaerobic toc uptake as well as the anaerobic aerobic p glycogen and pha profiles of the 95 tet culture captured from a cycle study performed on day 196 of the reactor operation anaerobic glycogen consumption 0 31 0 14 c mmol c mmol observed in this work was on average similar to that of the 70 tet 22 acc reactor although slightly higher aerobic glycogen storage was obtained in the present culture table 4 likely at the expense of polyphosphate storage under aerobic conditions as suggested by the lower p uptake anaerobic poly β hydroxyalkanoate pha production 0 13 0 18 c mmol c mmol and aerobic consumption was detected in this work which was not significantly different than that observed in the 70 tet 22 acc culture 0 15 0 04 c mmol c mmol there were no notable differences in the sbr volatile suspended solids concentration between this work and marques et al 2017 as shown in table 4 which was also fed the same cod concentration in the form of casein the anaerobic aerobic utilisation of glycogen and pha of both 95 tet and 70 tet 22 acc cultures were shown to be statistically similar in table 4 there is however a distinct difference between the 95 tet and 70 tet 22 acc cultures with respect to anaerobic aerobic phosphorus utilisation and polyphosphate storage in the sludge table 4 suggesting the 95 tet culture may be less reliant on phosphorus in their metabolism notably neither poly β hydroxybutyrate phb nor poly β hydroxy 2 methylvalerate ph2mv were cycled in the 95 tet culture unlike the study of marques et al 2017 performance profiles for the 95 tet culture for day 99 and 211 of operation can be found in figs s1 and s2 of the supplementary material respectively while the average and standard deviation of the anaerobic and aerobic activity across multiple cycles of operation is shown in table 4 the impact of other organisms in this culture on the observations of carbon uptake glycogen consumption or pha production cannot be completely discounted while the production of pha by the small amount of non tetrasphaera pao or gao cannot be ruled out assuming that the 1 5 of accumulibacter competibacter and defluviicoccus measured in the sludge behaved according to the acetate gao model by zeng et al 2003 or propionate gao model by oehmen et al 2006 non tetrasphaera related pao or gao in this culture could contribute no greater than 30 of the pha produced anaerobically moreover this result assumes acetate or propionate was generated anaerobically and immediately taken up by these other pao or gao as accumulation of vfas was never detected in these tests overall the experimental results support the suggestion that tetrasphaera related organisms were responsible for the bulk of the pha production observed from amino acid uptake in this culture future work is recommended to assess pha production by different tetrasphaera clades as it is frequently considered to be negligible for tetrasphaera in ebpr despite accumulibacter clade iif and defluviicoccus cluster 3 demonstrating the capacity to take up amino acids mcilroy and seviour 2009 qiu et al 2019 it is also considered unlikely both subgroups would have significantly contributed to anaerobic carbon consumption in this work based on the low abundance of each organism as measured by qfish 3 3 batch test results to validate the performance observed in the parent sbr as well as the role of pha in the amino acid metabolism of tetrasphaera batch tests were carried out using casein hydrolysate a mixture of 22 aa and real wastewater the aa batch test can be considered an extension of the parent sbr operation based on its similarity to the casein feed of the parent reactor while the purpose of the casein batch test was to assess the repeatability of the results from the parent reactor as well as its comparability with the aa batch test each of these tests was also compared to the culture behaviour with real wastewater feed to associate functional observations with microbial diversity the batch tests were performed over 7 days coinciding with day 205 211 of the parent sbr operation and qfish analysis was performed on day 210 to assess the microbial community during this period of operation it should be noted that during the 4 5 h period during batch tests biomass was settled decanted and washed with mineral media to prevent excess organic carbon entering the aerobic phase as detailed in the methods and materials section 2 2 3 3 1 casein and amino acid batch test casein and a 22 aa mixture was fed to the 95 tet enriched culture anaerobic and aerobic transformations of phosphorus glycogen and pha were analysed as well as the anaerobic carbon substrate consumption results of each batch test are shown in fig 3 with similar performance profiles being observed both casein and aa batch tests exhibited a similar anaerobic p release to carbon uptake ratio of 0 21 p mmol c mmol and 0 19 p mmol c mmol respectively likewise a similar trend in aerobic phosphorus uptake rate was shown along the test table 3 demonstrating consistency with sbr data obtained with the 95 tet culture similar to results in the 95 tet sbr cycles anaerobic pha production and aerobic consumption were observed in both casein and aa batch tests overall these results demonstrate that the highly enriched 95 tet culture behaved similarly under anaerobic and aerobic conditions when being fed casein hydrolysate or amino acids moreover pha was produced as a storage compound by the 95 tet culture when fed casein and aa where the pha composition consisted exclusively of phv as also observed in the parent sbr tables 4 and 5 3 3 2 real wastewater batch test to determine if the enriched 95 tet culture performs differently when fed a composite carbon source the culture was tested under similar conditions to the casein and aa experiments and was fed with raw wastewater from an ebpr plant located in setubal performance results from the wastewater batch test are shown in fig 4 when fed wastewater the 95 tet culture exhibited greater p release to carbon uptake 0 34 p mmol c mmol compared to the casein and aa batch tests and also increased p uptake 1 35 p mmol l despite consuming less carbon source anaerobically 7 8 c mmol l as compared to casein and aa batch tests table 5 notably lower anaerobic glycogen consumption and aerobic production was also observed in the ww batch test as compared to the casein and aa however consistent with sbr cycle results as well as the casein and aa batch tests the 95 tet culture also displayed anaerobic production and aerobic consumption of pha specifically phv when fed wastewater overall the batch test results indicate the metabolism of tetrasphaera behaves similarly when fed like substrates casein and aa although a notable shift occurs when an increased diversity of carbon sources consisting of carbohydrates lipids and volatile fatty acids were available anaerobically ww however even in the presence of a more diverse substrate composition ww the 95 tet culture was unable to perform net phosphorus removal suggesting that the presence of at least some members of tetrasphaera clade 2 may not be beneficial to ebpr 3 4 individual amino acid analysis individual aa transformations were monitored in the 22 c mmol l aa batch test in both the medium and intracellularly at the start and end of the anerobic and aerobic phases to uncover more about the amino acid metabolism of tetrasphaera the preference of tetrasphaera for specific amino acids as well as the identity of the stored aa were assessed fig 5 depicts transformations of the top 12 amino acids consumed by the 95 tet culture in the 22 aa batch test consumption of amino acids from the bulk media can be observed on the left hand axis where proline was completely taken up from the feed solution 1 cmmol l greater than 80 of glycine lysine tyrosine arginine cysteine was also observed to be consumed in the anaerobic phase overall 12 5 c mmol l of the 22 c mmol l solution was consumed to understand the individual transformations of amino acids on completion of the anaerobic and aerobic phases intracellular storage of amino acids was also measured and are also shown in fig 5 the raw data for all 22 amino acid transformations including consumption from the bulk media as well as intracellular storage levels at the end of the anaerobic and aerobic phase can be found in table s3 of the supplementary material interestingly 0 61 c mmol l of glutamic acid and 0 66 c mmol l of aspartic acid were consumed from the initial bulk media however much higher concentrations of both amino acids are present intracellularly at the end of the anaerobic phase measuring 1 86 c mmol l and 1 16 c mmol l respectively this observation suggests that under anaerobic conditions amino acids were preferentially converted to these two amino acids by the 95 tet culture these experimental observations are consistent with results observed by nguyen et al 2015 who suggested that t elongata produced and stored some glutamate under anaerobic conditions while being fed labelled glycine in addition to the observed glycine storage found in that study the anaerobic storage of free amino acids was observed to total 4 7 c mmol l in the subsequent aerobic phase 4 2 c mmol l were observed to be consumed with some conservation of glutamic and aspartic acid measuring 0 32 c mmol aa l and 0 15 c mmol aa l respectively the substantial cycling of these two amino acids in the anaerobic and aerobic phases suggests that they are key storage compounds in the amino acid metabolism of this 95 tetrasphaera culture to validate the existence of such pathways the genomes of available tetrasphaera isolates were examined using the microscope platform vallenet et al 2019 and bioinformatics pathway tools software karp et al 2017 results demonstrate that multiple amino acids can be degraded directly to glutamate via α ketoglutarate with some amino acids degraded to aspartate and others to pyruvate as summarised in table s2 of the supplementary material the presence of these genes has also been found in isolated clade 2 organisms t australiensis and t jenkinsii anaerobically several of the reactions are energetically favourable with the production of atp as depicted in fig 6 aerobically both glutamate and aspartate can readily re enter the tca cycle glutamate can re enter via α ketoglutarate and aspartate via oxaloacetate generating redox equivalents for atp production via oxidative phosphorylation or proceeding towards glycogen kristiansen et al 2013 3 5 energetic assessment to assess the coherency of the experimental data obtained in this study processes leading to atp production and consumption were examined and compared to investigate potential atp production from fermentation of amino acids atp production based on stickland reactions was summarised for each amino acid see table 1 and later compared with the total atp generated and consumed table 6 a detailed assessment is available in table s4 of the supplementary material based on atp generated from the fermentation of amino acids as well as the hydrolysis of poly p and glycolysis the total amount of atp produced was estimated to be 4 05 atp mmol l in the reactor clearly both poly p hydrolysis and fermentation represent the most substantial sources of atp generated by tetrasphaera with respect to cellular processes requiring atp consumption tetrasphaera could be utilising atp for amino acid transport as illustrated in fig 6 similar to that observed in accumulibacter smolders et al 1994b and also for cell maintenance purposes prokaryotes can transport amino acids into the cell via two main systems primary transporters termed abc cassettes which utilise atp to drive transport and secondary transporters driven by transmembrane electrochemical gradients hosie and poole 2001 jung et al 2006 madigan et al 2014 saier 2000 while it is impractical to determine the exact amount of amino acids transported into the cell via each transport system it is likely that a portion of amino acids are being transported through atp binding cassettes and thus consuming atp while others are being transported via secondary systems higgins and linton 2004 and george and jones 2012 suggest the atp substrate stoichiometric ratio for abc cassettes is 1 2 moles of atp required per mole of substrate transported across the cell membrane however more recent studies by lycklama a nijeholt et al 2018 on the glnpq abc importer for asparagine glutamine and glutamate suggest 2 moles of atp for transport by that system more work is required to characterise the range of prokaryote abc transporter systems nevertheless for the purposes of this study a composite atp requirement of 1 mol atp per mol of amino acid uptake was assumed to account for both the primary transport process based on abc cassettes and secondary transport process not requiring atp based on this assumption the energy required for transport equates to 2 89 atp mmol l since the combined total of amino acids taken up by the culture under anaerobic conditions in this batch test on a millimole basis was 12 5 c mmol l which equates to 2 89 mmol l the anaerobic maintenance coefficient of tetrasphaera was estimated based on kinetic data taken from marques et al 2017 to be 0 00488 atp mol c mol h approximately twice that observed by accumulibacter at 0 00235 atp mol c mol h see methods for calculation details the overall anaerobic energy balance comparing the reactions involving anaerobic atp production versus atp consumption is presented in table 6 the atp balance closed within 97 which is in very close agreement and suggests that the main atp producing and consuming reactions summarised in table 6 correspond well to those employed by the biomass furthermore closing of the atp balance supports the applicability of the assumption regarding the transport energetic requirement for the enriched culture of tetrasphaera 4 discussion it has been previously found that tetrasphaera have the potential to store similar amounts of poly p per cell on a volumetric basis as accumulibacter fernando et al 2019 and enriched tetrasphaera cultures have also shown the capacity for efficient p removal when fed amino acids fernando et al 2019 however the findings from this work demonstrate that a highly enriched tetrasphaera culture comprising predominantly clade 2 organisms are unable to carry out complete phosphorus removal when fed a mixture of amino acids nor when fed with raw wastewater as observed in the ww batch test a previous enrichment of tetrasphaera and accumulibacter showed that the tetrasphaera was an important contributor to p removal approx 80 of the total but this microbial group was mostly comprised of clades 1 and 3 in that study marques et al 2018 this result suggests that the composition of the tetrasphaera clades in an ebpr system play a crucial role in the extent and efficiency of phosphorus removal fig 7 compares the p removal performance of the ebpr system relative to the presence of tetrasphaera clades and accumulibacter in the present and previously studied tetrasphaera enrichments outcomes from this work suggest that clade 2 organisms which dominated this 95 tetrasphaera culture appear to prefer fermenting amino acids for atp generation but also storing two key amino acids namely glutamate and aspartate although this culture was observed to cycle poly p to a lesser extent than the 70 tet 22 acc culture of marques et al 2017 it is suggested that poly p still plays a crucial role in the metabolism of this 95 tet culture as a likely source of atp enabling amino acid uptake under anaerobic conditions notwithstanding this is the first work that identifies glutamic and aspartic acid as being key compounds in the anaerobic metabolism of tetrasphaera with both amino acids retained intracellularly at the completion of the anaerobic phase at greater concentrations than were taken up from the feed the pathways present in the t australiensis and t jenkinsii genomes allow for the direct conversion of several amino acids to glutamate and aspartate supporting the observations in this study further work should be carried out to examine and characterise the metabolic pathways of tetrasphaera including primary and secondary transport systems moreover understanding how the metabolism of tetrasphaera behaves in the presence of the mixed substrates found in wastewater also requires further study despite pha being previously excluded as a storage product of tetrasphaera phv cycling was observed in this work in both the sbr and in batch tests when fed casein aa and wastewater it is important to emphasise that the bulk of experimental knowledge currently available and commonly attributed to the tetrasphaera genus has disproportionality focused on t elongata fernando et al 2019 herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 which belongs to clade 1 moreover nouioui et al 2018 has suggested that clade 1 be reclassified out of tetrasphaera and into the phycicoccus genus calling into question if t elongata is truly a representative genome for the genus additionally the raman marker utilised by fernando et al 2019 was at 1726 cm 1 and is specific to poly β hydroxybutyrate phb majed and gu 2010 and would not account for other pha homopolymers such as poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phv is particularly difficult to measure by raman as no pure standard exists jost et al 2017 majed and gu 2010 as such caution is required when generalising metabolic traits to the whole tetrasphaera genus as phv is clearly being cycled by this 95 tet culture dominated by organisms belonging to tetrasphaera clade 2 while phv has primarily been associated with the uptake of propionate as a carbon source in pao metabolism or with acetate or propionate uptake by gaos oehmen et al 2007 recent studies also suggest that amino acids can contribute to the production of phv in accumulibacter qiu et al 2019 in the amino acid metabolism of this tetrasphaera culture phv formation could be utilised as both a carbon sink and means to balance the reducing equivalents under anaerobic conditions aerobically phv would be oxidised similar to accumulibacter to generate atp to facilitate growth replenish glycogen and store poly p overall this study improves our understanding of tetrasphaera metabolism from amino acids particularly regarding the storage products amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate as well as phv and the impact of tetrasphaera clade composition on aerobic p removal performance this knowledge will be highly valuable in future design and optimisation studies of ebpr systems where this group of organisms is often present in substantial abundance but rarely intentionally exploited as a means to improve p removal performance 5 conclusion a highly enriched culture of 95 tetrasphaera was obtained through anaerobic aerobic cycling when fed with a mixture of amino acids the culture was comprised mostly of clade 2 organisms with some clade 3 and a low fraction of clade 1 and with negligible accumulibacter paos competibacter gaos or defluviicoccus gaos present poorer phosphorus removal performance was observed in the sbr and batch tests with this culture as compared to other enriched tetrasphaera cultures and suggests p removal efficiency could be impacted by the tetrasphaera clade present notably phv cycling was observed in this work when the 95 tetrasphaera culture was fed casein a 22 amino acid mixture and raw wastewater it is suggested that the tetrasphaera organisms which dominated this culture ferment amino acids but also store free amino acids as glutamate and aspartate significant storage of these amino acids was observed at the conclusion of the anaerobic phase and were consumed aerobically although lower poly p cycling is observed in this work in comparison to other pao systems poly p is still considered to be a key storage compound by this culture hydrolysis of poly p could help facilitate anaerobic amino acid uptake through atp binding cassettes and aid in satisfying the anaerobic maintenance requirement with support from the atp produced via fermentation this work increases our knowledge on the functional diversity of the tetrasphaera genus and provides a basis for assessing its impact on ebpr system performance

16627,non sewered sanitation is currently dependant upon pit latrine emptying the safety of which is compromised by the high costs of faecal sludge transport to centralised treatment facilities transport in turn is hindered by the complex rheology of pit latrine sludge this study therefore characterised the compressional rheology of fresh faeces and modelled the implications for passive gravity or mechanical forced solid liquid separation this informs on the viability of decentralising dewatering for more efficient volume reduction and improving the economics of transportation the gel point ϕg is the solids concentration where the material has a networked structure and signifies the point when mechanical intervention is required for further solid liquid separation for fresh faeces ϕg ranged between 6 3 and 15 6 total solids ts concentration this is significantly higher than the ϕg observed for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities and it implies that passive gravity driven processes can suffice to improve localised dewatering the kinetics of passive sedimentation of faecal material were modelled and illustrate thickening from 3 to 10 ts concentration in 0 5 h this highlights that early intervention to thicken faeces while fresh can improve solid liquid separation efficiency filtration of fresh faeces was characterised by lengthy cake filtration times and comparably short compression times more similar to mineral slurries than to wastewater sludge consequently fresh faeces presented improved dewatering characteristics supporting higher final cake solids concentrations and improved dewatering kinetics by complementing thickening with 300 kpa filtration a 1 4 cm thick 25 ts product could be achieved in 24 h investigation of matrix properties highlighted that increased conductivity e g exposure to urine negatively influenced dewaterability an effect which could be mitigated by introducing solid liquid separation earlier the thermodynamically favourable compressional rheology of fresh faeces has identified that focussing on localised dewatering could radically improve the economics of faecal sludge management primarily through reducing transport costs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thickening compressive yield stress solids diffusivity hindered settling function pressure filtration 1 introduction non sewered sanitation solutions such as pit latrines and septic tanks serve one third of the world s population acting as an affordable alternative to conventional wastewater treatment these systems function as intermediate storage facilities requiring emptying and transport to centralised facilities for safe treatment simple thickening and dewatering processes such as drying beds are generally used to minimise sludge volume through removing excess water before the faecal sludge can be applied to downstream processes tayler 2018 dewatered solids can then be dried or pasteurised for safe environmental disposal brockmann 1973 naidoo et al 2020 septien et al 2018b however in the urban setting only 22 of pit latrine sludge is safely managed blackett et al 2014 leading to enteric pathogenic contamination of community water resources resulting in diarrhoea responsible for the highest illness and morbidity rates worldwide unicef and who 2015 with safely managed sanitation practices it is projected that up to 88 of diarrhoea related deaths could be prevented unicef and who 2015 the emptying and transport stages represent significant inhibitors in the faecal sludge management chain due to the difficulty of mixing and pumping aged compacted sludges reported to have densities of up to 1750 kg m 3 radford and sugden 2014 high water volumes are added to dilute sludge to over 95 water to enable emptying via pumping basamykina et al 2020 gold et al 2016 septien et al 2018a strande et al 2014 this practice economically compromises the transport stage estimated to represent 25 of faecal sludge management costs steiner et al 2002 multistage transport is frequently practiced in urban areas with sludge transferred via small capacity vehicles to sludge storage stations onto larger tankers and then transported for disposal or treatment mikhael et al 2014 such transport practices also require multiple pumping stages to transfer silted sludge between stages incurring further costs mikhael et al 2014 this extended complex and intensive transport practice represents one of the key challenges to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs of safely managed sanitation for all by 2030 united nations 2018 one approach to resolving the challenge of sludge transport in faecal sludge management is to intervene at community scale by locally dewatering fresher unconsolidated faecal sludge with a focus on reducing sludge volume whilst also transforming its rheological properties into an easier to handle material e g a dry friable product this improves the economics of emptying and transport as well as reducing pathogenic risk brockmann 1973 naidoo et al 2020 also the nutrient and organic rich solid fraction could provide local economic opportunities for nutrient or energy recovery eshetu moges et al 2018 forbis stokes et al 2016 harder et al 2019 onabanjo et al 2016 as such small footprint community based intervention strategies that reduce emptying and transport fees could enable a shift towards sustainable faecal sludge management mikhael et al 2014 to facilitate decentralised solid liquid separation at community scale and within densely populated areas mechanical dewatering technologies such as centrifuges and mechanical presses more commonly applied for municipal wastewater sludges novak 2006 provide a low footprint high efficiency alternative to the currently adopted large scale long duration drying beds basamykina et al 2020 gold et al 2016 such modularity allows for adaptation to population growth which is predicted to reach 9 8 billion by 2030 hilal and wright 2018 united nations 2017 however organic rich faecal sludges whether encountered in centralised municipal wastewater facilities or decentralised sanitation infrastructure are recognised as difficult to dewater which could compromise economic feasibility gold et al 2018 semiyaga et al 2016 skinner et al 2015 ward et al 2019 poor dewaterability for wastewater sludges is often associated with hydrolysis mechanisms under long term storage as well as exposure to viscous shear during transport christensen et al 2015 the impact of storage time and shear on dewaterability of faecal material specifically is not yet elucidated however there may be potential advantages to rejecting faecal sludge storage and instead focussing on concentrating fresh faecal material which has been subject to less dispersion by shear history or hydrolytic effects to the best of the authors knowledge the dewaterability of fresh faeces has yet to be characterised conventional methods to determine the dewaterability of faecal matrices such as municipal wastewater and non sewered sanitation sludges are based on empirical techniques such as capillary suction time and single pressure filtration or centrifugation tests that provide the rate and extent of dewatering respectively chen et al 2010 gold et al 2018 2016 liu et al 2013 semiyaga et al 2017 ward et al 2019 these tests provide a relative comparison between material properties but they are not sufficiently rigorous to enable dewatering technology design chen et al 2010 gold et al 2018 2016 liu et al 2013 semiyaga et al 2017 ward et al 2019 the design and operation of dewatering processes requires that material dewaterability is described as a function of solids concentration and applied pressure compressional rheology first described by buscall and white buscall and white 1987 provides a phenomenological approach to solid liquid separation where the compressive strength py compressive yield stress and rate of dewatering inversely related to hindered settling function r of a networked matrix are functions of solids concentration in this description there is a critical solids concentration known as the gel point ϕg this is the minimum solids concentration at which the suspended solids particles form a continuously networked structure with an inherent strength or yield stress the compressive yield stress py is the pressure required for the networked solids matrix to yield and compress py is a strong function of solids concentration varying from zero at ϕg and rising exponentially as the solids concentration increases the hindered settling function r is defined as a resistance of liquid to flow around the solid particles at low solids concentrations and through the solids network structure at higher solids concentrations r varies exponentially increasing by 8 16 orders of magnitude from low to high solids concentrations these physical properties define dewaterability aspects of a particulate matrix these material properties have been previously used to characterise compressible inorganic matrices de kretser et al

collected from consenting anonymous volunteers through a regime approved by the cranfield university research ethics system cures project id 8488 faeces were categorised into stool types according to bristol stool scale bss 1 7 as described by heaton et al 1992 table 1 types 1 3 which represent hard dense lumps bss 1 lumpy sausage bss 2 and cracked sausage bss 3 were combined due to low sample masses diarrhoea bss 7 was not encountered during sampling type 4 which is shaped as a smooth sausage is the most frequent faecal type heaton et al 1992 this was hence selected as a control to investigate the impact of big undigested food particles through the use of maceration and to assess the role of conductivity by combining faeces with urine blackwater samples were prepared by combining urine with bss 4 faeces briefly mixing 1000 rpm 30 s with a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane for analysis of maceration impact samples were processed at 3000 rpm for 30 s using an ika t50 digital ultra turrax homogeniser with a s50n w65sk cutting head ika england ltd oxford uk faeces and urine samples were sealed and stored at 4 ºc with physico chemical analysis completed and dewaterability tests initiated no more than a week after collection to maintain freshness faecal liquid fraction in order to characterise the dewaterability of faeces across a range of solids concentrations the faecal liquid fraction properties faecal liquor were required to calculate particle interactions at different solids concentrations due to the high solids content of faeces extracting sufficient liquor from individual samples was not viable therefore six faeces samples representing bss 1 6 were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 12 h

according to appendix a all dewatering calculations and modelling were performed with solids concentration represented on a volumetric basis as solids volume fraction ϕ 2 2 gravitational batch settling tests transient batch settling tests tracking the sediment liquid interface height over time were analysed based on a previously verified method lester et al 2005 usher et al 2013 using a kynch 1952 type analysis to determine settling velocity u m s 1 as a function of solids concentration the hindered settling function r is determined from the settling velocity using the following

using a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane and diluted within 500 ml of the saline solution or urine bss 4 urine in a glass measuring cylinder the cylinder was sealed with parafilm and turned upside down to re suspend the matrix before starting the test as soon as the cylinder was upright the change in sediment liquid interface height was recorded over 48 h until the height stabilised 2 3 stepped pressure filtration mechanical intervention is required to overcome network stress and enable dewaterability characterisation at solids concentrations well above the gel point constant pressure filtration techniques were developed by landman and white landman et al 1995 landman and white 1997 to quantify py and r at solids concentrations exceeding ϕg using a series of single pressure filtration tests at different pressures each test requires more of the same sample which for faeces is limited and is susceptible to changes in physico chemical properties over the extended time periods between tests in order to decrease characterisation time de kretser et al 2001 and usher et al 2001 optimised and validated a stepped pressure filtration method where multiple pressures can be characterised in two experiments a permeability test and compressibility test for stepped pressure filtration tests this study has utilised an automated filtration rig comprised of an analogous design fig s1 b the rig was controlled and data analysed using the accompanying labview software in a compressibility test a piston applies a constant pressure δp onto a suspension contained within a compression cylinder at initial solids volume fraction ϕ0 and initial height h0 liquid permeates through a porous membrane at the base of the cylinder where a cake builds until it reaches the piston face and then consolidates to the maximum solids concentration ϕ ϕ0h0 h where p y ϕ δ p such that h is the final equilibrium height the pressure is then stepped and the material consolidated to equilibrium at a number of pressures fig 1 a in a stepped pressure permeability test the slope dt dv2 1 β2 during bed formation is determined for a number of pressures δp where the operational parameters time t specific filtrate volume v and filtration parameter β2 are recorded each pressure is stepped once a stable slope is reached fig 1b the hindered settling function r is then calculated using the gradient of a curve fit of β2 vs δp and the ϕ values from the compressibility tests using the following equation 3 r ϕ 2 d β 2 δ p 1 ϕ 0 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 another section of the same faeces sample used for the batch settling test was simultaneously characterised in the filtration tests faecal samples were briefly mixed 1000 rpm 30 s with the saline solution or urine at a 1 2 faeces to solution w w ratio to nominally represent the gel point of the samples this was performed using a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane before subjecting samples to filtration this sample preparation was critical to avoid air gaps and allow for a uniform volume 50 ml when loaded into the filtration rig based on previous evidence the short mixing time imparted insufficient shear to disrupt the coarse particle structure during sample preparation ravndal et al 2019 the quicker permeability test was always conducted first on a sub sample as it allowed for the subsequent compressibility test to start less than a week after sample collection on another sub sample maintaining faeces freshness different pressures for both tests were tested within the same sub sample as the stepped pressure filtration rig allowed for a change in pressure without opening the system both compressibility and permeability tests were programmed with set pressures of 20 50 120 and 300 kpa the final cake height was consistently higher than the recommended minimum of 5 mm ensuring that the linear encoder resolution of 10 μm did not compromise accuracy de kretser et al 2001 usher et al 2001 and also ensuring that coarse chunks of material are less likely to compromise tests by bridging between the membrane and the piston verification of method accuracy prior to completion of analysis was conducted with a bss4 macerated sample for which ts values at 50 kpa py ts 50 kpa varied by 3 8 ts between replicates and gel point 1 across replicates 2 4 combining data into curve fits the compressive yield stress py data from filtration tests were fitted to a functional form described by lester et al 2005 and then ϕg initially estimated using eq 2 was adjusted until the compressive yield stress curve was exactly consistent with the final height of the settling test see crust 2017 for details the hindered settling function r data from both settling and filtration tests were combined and fitted using an interpolation function over the full range of solids concentration data from the initial settling test concentration to the final concentration achieved at the highest filtration pressure the data were exponentially extrapolated outside this range for very low and very high solids concentrations py and r curve fits were then combined into a single term known as the solids diffusivity d to illustrate the overall dewaterability landman et al 1995 4 d ϕ d p y ϕ d ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r ϕ where

defined above in eq 4 and u ϕ is the settling velocity function related to the hindered settling function r ϕ by eq 1 a range of initial solids concentrations ts 0 1 1 3 10 and 25 ts were used with initial saline diluted faeces heights h0 350 35 11 7 3 5 and 1 4 cm where all scenarios used the same amount of solid material nominally 1 cm at 35 ts for example if the initial solids concentration is 10 ts the initial height scales to 3 5 cm the relevant sediment and piston heights were predicted as a function of time until no more dewatering could occur from these heights the average solids concentrations were calculated and graphed to show the influence of the material initial solids concentration and dewatering method on the rate and extent of dewatering the passive gravity batch settling predictions used a semi implicit finite difference algorithm to numerically solve a second order discretisation of eq 5 to predict the solids concentration distribution as a function of time the algorithm simulated a simple 1 d batch settling scenario with the sediment liquid interface height h where ϕ ϕ0 recorded until sedimentation and consolidation of the networked bed ceased at an equilibrium solids concentration distribution the method has been previously validated by usher et al 2006 is detailed in spehar 2014 and was adapted from algorithms described by burger and karlsen 2001 the number of height elements used in the computations varied from 50 to 1600 to balance computation time and accuracy the centrifugal settling predictions used a semi implicit finite difference algorithm to numerically solve a discretised radial coordinate variant of eq 5 over time the algorithm simulated a 1 d batch centrifugation process for a thin tube with an outer radius rmax of 0 25 m and a rotation speed of 1000 rpm with the sediment liquid interface height h rmax r where ϕ ϕ0 recorded over time until equilibrium the number of elements used in the computations varied from 50 to 1600 to balance computation time and accuracy the method is described in usher et al 2013 and was adapted from algorithms developed by bürger and concha 2001 the filtration modelling predictions used a runge kutta algorithm to numerically solve a simplified discretisation of eq 5 over time with a moving boundary condition and gravity removed such that 6 ϕ t d z d ϕ ϕ z where ϕ is the solids volume

batch filtration process where the material is consolidated over time by movement of a piston towards a membrane permeable to liquor but not to suspended solids the piston membrane gap h is recorded over time until consolidation ceases at equilibrium the algorithm was developed described and validated by stickland et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of fresh faeces dewaterability to other compressible matrices to characterise the compressive yield stress py hindered settling function r and solids diffusivity d curve fits were produced by combining settling data at low solids concentrations with pressure filtration data from high solids concentrations stickland et al 2008 skinner et al 2015 data was first interpreted using suspended solids volume fraction ϕ in accordance with the analytical approach proposed by buscall and white 1987 but are presented as total solids fractions on a mass basis ts as this parameter is more commonly employed to characterise wastewater suspensions the gel points ϕg of fresh faeces were determined to have ts concentrations of 6 2 7 2 13 9 and 15 6 for bristol stool scales of 6 5 4 and 1 3 respectively fig 2 fig s1 a where bss1 3 was physically characterised by a consolidated structure and bss6 a mushier stool tending toward diarrhoea table 1 these ts concentrations represent the point at which these suspensions form an inter connected particle network capable of supporting their own weight harbour et al 2001 dewatering data of thickened waste activated sludge twas 81 vs obtained from skinner et al 2015 was overlaid to compare the dewatering behaviour of fresh faeces and that of sludge from centralised infrastructure the gel point for twas was 2 4 ts which is comparable to literature 2 3 pileggi et al 2019 the lower ϕg of waste activated sludge is generally attributed to the density of intact bacterial cells that introduce a relatively high eps fraction creating a heterogeneous stable colloidal complex which may promote the early onset of networking christensen et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 for ts concentrations exceeding ϕg the network strength is sufficient to exhibit a yield stress harbour et al 2001 once subjected to an applied load i e a compressive yield stress usher 2002 the ts concentration corresponding to ϕg therefore signifies the transition between passive sedimentation and mechanical intervention to facilitate compressional stress and is indicated where each trend intersects the x axis fig 2 when subjected to an applied compressive pressure the py ts of fresh faeces increased significantly with an increase in ts concentration on this semi logarithmic plot fig 2 table s3 to illustrate py ts were recorded for faeces characterised as bss4 of 50 120 and 300 kpa at ts concentrations of 35 40 and 49 respectively this demonstrates the maximum solids concentration that can be achieved at these pressures this can be explained by the increase in volume fraction in this plot represented by ts which increases the number of interparticle linkages and as such the py ts until it reaches an equilibrium with the applied pressure harbour et al 2001 the compressive yield stress values of the different fresh faeces were compared at a fixed applied compressive pressure 50 kpa fig 3 a and a strong correlation between py ts for fresh faeces and the initial faecal solids concentration was identified the initial solids concentration is in turn broadly related to bss lewis and heaton 1997 and appears also to inform on the ϕg fig 3b this correlation is intuitive as the compressive yield stress is a direct measure of the strength of the bonds between particles in a flocculated suspension under pressure green et al 1996 whilst twas displays higher py ts than faecal material within the lower ts range due to the lesser ϕg py ts at higher ts concentrations are broadly comparable to py ts of the bss4 it was observed that the compressive yield stress exhibited by bss4 at higher ts concentrations was lower than for bss1 3 and bss6 fig 2 the bss4 structure represents the transition between these two sample types exhibiting the structure of bss1 3 with consolidating properties more comparable to bss6 this synergy providing easiest passage through the human gut we suggest these preferred material properties maybe responsible for the lower material strength for bss4 but this would require a more quantitative and specific study of material rheology and chemical analysis to provide such confirmation the hindered settling function r ts is the hydrodynamic resistance to flow of liquor through a particulate suspension as a function of solids volume fraction herein plotted as ts fig 4 a and 5 b for lower ts concentrations 20 ts faeces characterised by a more consolidated structure bss1 3 exhibited a comparatively low r ts whereas a considerably higher r ts was identified for bss4 6 to illustrate an r ts of 1 108 and 3 109 kg s 1 m 3 was recorded for bss1 3 and bss4 respectively corresponding to a ts concentration of 10 the hindered settling function can be interpreted as either particle transport through a liquid or liquid past a collection of particles and is thus applicable to the full range of solids concentrations from very dilute to very concentrated suspensions usher 2002 the r ts for twas was markedly higher than fresh faeces within a considerably more dilute range indicating that this more disperse suspension exhibits more resistance to flow the resistance to flow experienced with waste activated sludge has been postulated to arise from interstitial water water physically and chemically bound in cells and cell structures e g eps in addition to more complex colligative properties christensen et al 2015 a comparable gradient in r ts versus ts to twas was identified within the lower ts concentration range for the more disperse faecal suspensions bss4 6 where such structural characteristics are acknowledged to hinder both settling and filterability christensen et al 2015 this agrees with the hindered passive sedimentation of fresh faeces where a negative correlation between eps and ϕg was observed fig 3c although further investigation is required to discern the impact of eps from that of undigested food products for each organic suspension a plateau in r ts was reached at ts concentrations of 20 to 30 corresponding to between 1 1015 and 1 1016 kg s 1 m 3 mineral slurry bauxite residue data obtained from usher et al 2013 was overlaid to compare with a less complex and more homogenous suspension the mineral slurry ϕg solids concentration was distinctively higher at 27 6 ts and an r ts of less than 1 1011 kg s 1 m 3 was determined at 50 ts diffusivity d combines the competing effects of compressibility and permeability into a single term to fully characterise filtration when gravitational forces are no longer significant harbour et al 2001 usher 2002 the initial sharp phase of the slope corresponds to batch settling with the secondary phase of the slope related to the applied compressive pressure leading to cake filtration and subsequently compression fig 4b and 5c for fresh faeces the d ts gradient is generally positive above 20 kpa applied compressive pressure with extended cake formation and truncated cake compression mineral slurry filtration exhibits comparable behaviour where the d ts gradient is positive and filtration curves exhibit extended cake formation with high average solids concentrations close to the equilibrium concentrations enabling relatively truncated cake compression de kretser et al 2001 stickland 2015 usher et al 2001 this contradicts filtration behaviour of twas which was characterised by a considerably lower d ts indicative of a less dewaterable suspension more specifically at pressures corresponding to the region of decreasing d ts dewatering was relatively slow near the membrane causing the filter cake to form at a lower average solids concentration that fills the cavity relatively soon after which an extended compression phase begins this is characteristic of organically rich municipal wastewater sludges dairy effluent and algal biomass scales et al 2004 skinner et al 2015 stickland 2015 stickland et al 2008 studer 2008 wall 2008 skinner et al 2015 hypothesised that the extended compression zone characteristic of twas and primary sludge is attributed to the extensive cross linked polymeric network in which cellular and particulate components are embedded the eps fraction is up to 80 of wastewater sludge activated sludge biomass neyens and baeyens 2003 this results in a compressible and impermeable layer forming on the membrane surface during filtration which prevents a homogeneous solids gradient during cake formation and causes a typical non linear behaviour during water expulsion until py ts equilibrium is reached for comparison biomass constitutes up to 50 of fresh faeces rose et al 2015 3 2 impact of urine and maceration on faeces dewaterability fresh faeces are a heterogeneous mixture that in addition to comprising of bacteria and cellular material as the dominant organic fraction are also comprised of undigested food residue i e fibre and an inorganic salt fraction penn et al 2018 un masticated food particles present a unique challenge owing to their macroscopic scale 5 mm and ability to disrupt the networked structure suspension conductivity from enteric salts or downstream mixing with urine as in decentralised infrastructure such as pit latrines have been reported to negatively influence the dewaterability of aged faecal sludge semiyaga et al 2016 ward et al 2017 2019 the significance of these unique properties to dewatering was therefore studied using fresh faeces characterised as bss4 table 1 and having a ts concentration of 13 9 at ϕg the addition of urine slightly reduced ϕg to 9 1 ts and as such a higher py ts is exhibited by fresh faeces mixed with urine bss4 urine versus fresh faeces bss4 fig 5a at higher solids concentrations 30 ts and applied pressures 20 kpa the difference in py ts between bss4 urine and bss4 becomes less apparent to illustrate a py ts of 300 kpa was observed at ts concentrations of 46 9 and 49 0 for bss4 urine and bss4 respectively for suspensions characterised by ts concentrations ϕg similar values for r ts were recorded for bss4 urine and bss4 fig 5b however once compressive pressure is applied to overcome py ts for ts concentrations ϕg the presence of urine introduces a greater hydrodynamic resistance which in turn reduces the overall diffusivity compared to bss4 fig s 5c whilst the d ts curve for bss4 urine was characterised by a comparable trend to other fresh faeces a lower gradient for the positive fraction of the d ts slope was observed resulting in a diffusivity of around an order of magnitude lower at an applied compressive pressure of 300 kpa analysis of the liquid faecal liquor fraction and urine determined comparable conductivities of 12 6 ms cm 1 and 13 04 ms cm 1 respectively table s1 and s2 however when combined with faeces during preparation the conductivity increased to 14 56 ms cm 1 comparable to conductivities reported for aged public toilet faecal sludge ward et al 2019 whilst divalent cations are recognised to improve dewaterability through encouraging bridging yin et al 2004 urine is dominated by monovalent ions e g na putnam 1971 which are known to reduce dewaterability christensen et al 2015 the increased r ts of bss4 urine could therefore be attributable to the increase in faecal liquor dissolved solids 3 4 wt ds which negatively impacts permeability usher 2002 importantly the ϕg filtration and compression characteristics of bss4 urine can still be regarded as more favourable than conventional wastewater suspensions managed through dewatering with centralised infrastructure maceration was applied to disrupt undigested food particles e g fibre the effect of which was a shift in the distribution of coarse particles from the 4 75 mm fraction to the 1 mm size fraction as demonstrated by an increase in the 1 mm size fraction from 44 to 60 on a weight basis fig s2 maceration was observed to reduce the compressive yield stress relative to bss4 whilst the impact of maceration on permeability r ts was less evident this is comparable to observations by semiyaga et al 2016 where particles greater than 1 mm correlated negatively with the extent of dewatering for faecal sludge from unlined pit latrines at higher applied pressures d ts for bss4 maceration is similar to bss4 fig 5c the reduced difference for high applied pressures where py ts converges at comparable solids concentrations could be associated with exceeding the stress required to compress the rigid macro particles such as seeds and corn kernels even in non macerated samples at 300 kpa maceration only increases the py solids concentrations by 0 7 ts suggesting that high pressure dewatering processes such as filter presses which typically operate from 500 kpa lenntech 2020 can negate the requirement for maceration pre treatment for improved dewaterability at higher solids concentrations however maceration was observed to introduce critical structural transformation at lower ts concentrations and applied compressive pressures this was evidenced by an increase in ϕg from 13 9 to 16 7 ts fig 5a which indicates that maceration maybe beneficial for improving faecal material thickening processes 3 3 modelling dewatering processes a range of initial solids concentrations ts 0 1 1 3 10 and 25 w w were used with initial saline diluted faeces heights that scaled to ensure all scenarios used the same amount of solid material nominally 1 cm at 35 ts for the passive gravity thickening process 1 3 and 10 ts were selected as representative of ts concentrations encountered downstream of a toilet accepting urine faeces and flush water collectively urine and faeces only and the average faeces ϕg respectively fig 6 a table s4 a scenario with 25 initial ts concentration was excluded from the passive gravity thickening modelling as this is beyond the gel point observed for faecal material and hence unattainable by passive gravity thickening for fresh faeces bss4 table 1 initial ts concentrations of 1 and 3 achieve a ts concentration comparable to the gel point around 10 within around 30 min with the 3 and 10 initial ts concentrations consolidating to a final concentration of 14 ts after 1 day the 1 initial ts concentration consolidates to the same tss concentration but a lower ts concentration due to the lower ds concentration imposed by flush water dilution in comparison it takes more than 10 days to settle and consolidate from 1 to 2 ts secondary treatment waste activated sludge twas due to the lower gel point and slower settling rate for centrifugation initial ts concentrations of 3 and 10 were selected for fresh faeces assuming an initial settling stage the centrifuge conditions were 1000 rpm with a 0 25 m outer radius fig 6b table s4 faeces settle to form a sediment at or above ϕg after 1 h and then consolidate to a final concentration of 19 ts in around 12 h irrespective of the initial solids concentration for reference the twas was characterised by an initial ts concentration of 3 consolidating to 5 but over a prohibitive timescale of 10 days higher centrifugation rotational speed was demonstrated with fresh faeces operated at 3000 rpm and increased dewatering rate by a factor of 10 and to a higher ts concentration of 25 in comparison to the organic matrices the mineral slurry is able to reach to a final solids concentration of 52 ts in 1 min when subjected to pressure filtration at 300 kpa fresh faeces can form a cake of 50 ts as observed experimentally fig s3 modelling experimental results determined that after 5 8 17 and 550 days 50 ts can be achieved for starting ts concentrations of 25 10 3 and 0 1 respectively fig 6c table s4 a value of 0 1 ts was utilised as an example of urine and faeces diluted with a significant volume of flushwater which coincides with ts in untreated domestic sewage metcalf and eddy 2013 this demonstrates the importance of a two stage dewatering intervention for this permeability limited process where an initial solids liquid separation close to source could reduce capital scale cost and energy demand of a second centralised dewatering unit to illustrate in order to reach 25 35 ts an increase in initial ts from 3 to 10 approaching ϕg decreases filtration time by a factor of 2 10 due to the reduced scale of decentralised infrastructure using pressure filtration with hold times of several days may not be prohibitive for implementation however higher pressures are often applied for typical filter presses 500 1500 kpa lenntech 2020 an increase of which could assist in reducing hold up time 4 outlook impact of human faeces rheology on dewatering to the best of our knowledge fresh faeces is the only known organic wastewater matrix to exhibit elongated cake filtration coupled with short compression this indicates that a high solids concentration product can be achieved within a shorter time frame this may be explained by the shear and compression history of faeces as they have been subject to effective compression and dehydration by the colon before discharge lewis and heaton 1997 shear and compression history are known to influence network strength and as such the py ts of the matrix green et al 1996 this is opposed to observations reported for wastewater sludge twas and primary skinner et al 2015 and may result from different structural properties of fresh faeces with more compact aggregates known to advantage dewaterability christensen et al 2015 when subject to viscous shear as in the case of piped sewerage transport to a centralised works aggregate erosion occurs increasing single cell number and reducing particle size that has been demonstrated to reduce permeability sludge storage in anaerobic conditions has been shown to inhibit dewatering due to the apparent hydrolysis of bound eps christensen et al 2015 these irreversible structural changes occurring during transport and storage may help explain why a lower gel point and different dewatering behaviour are observed for wastewater sludge and faecal material fig 2 4 that are ultimately of similar organic origin 5 conclusions the compressional rheology of fresh faeces has been characterised to determine whether earlier dewatering can improve decentralised sanitation the gel point for fresh faeces ranged between 6 3 and 15 6 ts concentration which is significantly higher than for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities this implies that the use of passive gravity driven separation for fresh faces can produce a concentrated matrix and reduce transportation volume modelling confirmed the efficacy of gravity driven separation with thickening from 3 to 10 ts concentration requiring 0 5 h this is significant as it suggests that a 70 reduction in water content can be achieved using simple low cost technology that could be applied at community or even single household scale rheological characteristics of dewatering such as gel point and compressive yield stress could be broadly related to bristol stool scale further research to decouple the impact of eps originating from undigested food products from those of faeces could also provide insight into the differentiation observed similar to centralised wastewater sludge an increase in eps content resulted in network onset at lower total solids concentrations however when subjected to mechanical filtration benefits of handling fresh faecal material were observed with a more concentrated cake formed in a shorter time period this is supported by modelling which illustrated that initial thickening with 300 kpa filtration could achieve a 1 4 cm thick 25 ts product in 24 h such performance is only enabled by the unique kinetic and compressive yield stress properties of fresh faeces which if used to inform localised dewatering could change the practical and economic viability of community scale faecal solids management further research to elucidate the ageing profile of faeces in terms of compressional rheology would be beneficial to identify the trade off between storage and dewaterability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16627,non sewered sanitation is currently dependant upon pit latrine emptying the safety of which is compromised by the high costs of faecal sludge transport to centralised treatment facilities transport in turn is hindered by the complex rheology of pit latrine sludge this study therefore characterised the compressional rheology of fresh faeces and modelled the implications for passive gravity or mechanical forced solid liquid separation this informs on the viability of decentralising dewatering for more efficient volume reduction and improving the economics of transportation the gel point ϕg is the solids concentration where the material has a networked structure and signifies the point when mechanical intervention is required for further solid liquid separation for fresh faeces ϕg ranged between 6 3 and 15 6 total solids ts concentration this is significantly higher than the ϕg observed for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities and it implies that passive gravity driven processes can suffice to improve localised dewatering the kinetics of passive sedimentation of faecal material were modelled and illustrate thickening from 3 to 10 ts concentration in 0 5 h this highlights that early intervention to thicken faeces while fresh can improve solid liquid separation efficiency filtration of fresh faeces was characterised by lengthy cake filtration times and comparably short compression times more similar to mineral slurries than to wastewater sludge consequently fresh faeces presented improved dewatering characteristics supporting higher final cake solids concentrations and improved dewatering kinetics by complementing thickening with 300 kpa filtration a 1 4 cm thick 25 ts product could be achieved in 24 h investigation of matrix properties highlighted that increased conductivity e g exposure to urine negatively influenced dewaterability an effect which could be mitigated by introducing solid liquid separation earlier the thermodynamically favourable compressional rheology of fresh faeces has identified that focussing on localised dewatering could radically improve the economics of faecal sludge management primarily

introduction non sewered sanitation solutions such as pit latrines and septic tanks serve one third of the world s population acting as an affordable alternative to conventional wastewater treatment these systems function as intermediate storage facilities requiring emptying and transport to centralised facilities for safe treatment simple thickening and dewatering processes such as drying beds

opportunities for nutrient or energy recovery eshetu moges et al 2018 forbis stokes et al 2016 harder et al 2019 onabanjo et al 2016 as such small footprint community based intervention strategies that reduce emptying and transport fees could enable a shift towards sustainable faecal sludge management mikhael et al 2014 to facilitate decentralised solid liquid separation at community scale and within densely populated areas mechanical dewatering technologies such as centrifuges and mechanical presses more commonly applied for municipal wastewater sludges novak 2006 provide a low footprint high efficiency alternative to the currently adopted large scale long duration drying beds basamykina et al 2020 gold et al 2016 such modularity allows for adaptation to population growth which is predicted to reach 9 8 billion by 2030 hilal and wright 2018 united nations 2017 however organic rich faecal sludges whether encountered in centralised municipal wastewater facilities or decentralised sanitation infrastructure are recognised as difficult to dewater which could compromise economic feasibility gold et al 2018 semiyaga et al 2016 skinner et al 2015 ward et al 2019 poor dewaterability for wastewater sludges is often associated with hydrolysis mechanisms under long term storage as well as exposure to viscous shear during transport christensen et al 2015 the impact of storage time and shear on dewaterability of faecal material specifically is not yet elucidated however there may be potential advantages to rejecting faecal sludge storage and instead focussing on concentrating fresh faecal material which has been subject to less dispersion by shear history or hydrolytic effects to the best of the authors knowledge the dewaterability of fresh faeces has yet to be characterised conventional methods to determine the dewaterability of faecal matrices such as municipal wastewater and non sewered sanitation sludges are based on empirical techniques such as capillary suction time and single pressure filtration or centrifugation tests that provide the rate and extent of dewatering respectively chen et al 2010 gold et al 2018 2016 liu et al 2013 semiyaga et al 2017 ward et al 2019 these tests provide a relative comparison between material properties but they are not sufficiently rigorous to enable dewatering technology design chen et al 2010 gold et al 2018 2016 liu et al 2013 semiyaga et al 2017 ward et al 2019 the design and operation of dewatering processes requires that material dewaterability is described as a function of solids concentration and applied pressure compressional rheology first described by buscall and white buscall and white 1987 provides a phenomenological approach to solid liquid separation where the compressive strength py compressive yield stress and rate of dewatering inversely related to hindered settling function r of a networked matrix are functions of solids concentration in this description there is a critical solids concentration known as the gel point ϕg this is the minimum solids concentration at which the suspended solids particles form a continuously networked structure with an inherent strength or yield stress the compressive yield stress py is the pressure required for the networked solids matrix to yield and compress py is a strong function of solids concentration varying from zero at ϕg and rising exponentially as the solids concentration increases the hindered settling function r is defined as a resistance of liquid to flow around the solid particles at low solids concentrations and through the solids network structure at higher solids concentrations r varies exponentially increasing by 8 16 orders of magnitude from low to high solids concentrations these physical properties define dewaterability aspects of a particulate matrix these material properties have been previously used to characterise compressible inorganic matrices de kretser et al

2008 wall 2008 in this study this phenomenological approach is applied to characterise the compressional rheology of fresh faeces to inform on the practical viability of decentralising dewatering

hvistendahl karlsen 2001 spehar 2014 usher and scales 2005 centrifugation bürger and concha 2001 usher et al 2013 and filtration processes stickland et al 2006 to confirm the feasibility of community scale dewatering interventions through a breadth of technical approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and characterisation of fresh faeces and urine faeces sampling faecal samples were collected from consenting anonymous volunteers through a regime approved by the cranfield university research ethics system cures project id 8488 faeces were categorised into stool types according to bristol stool scale bss 1 7 as described by heaton et al 1992 table 1 types 1 3 which represent hard dense lumps bss 1 lumpy sausage bss 2 and cracked sausage bss 3 were combined due to low sample masses diarrhoea bss 7 was not encountered during sampling type 4 which is shaped as a smooth sausage is the most frequent faecal type heaton et al 1992 this was hence selected as a control to investigate the impact of big undigested food particles through the use of maceration and to assess the role of conductivity by combining faeces with urine blackwater samples were prepared by combining urine with bss 4 faeces briefly mixing 1000 rpm 30 s with a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane for analysis of maceration impact samples were processed at 3000 rpm for 30 s using an ika t50 digital ultra turrax homogeniser with a s50n w65sk cutting head ika england ltd oxford uk faeces and urine samples were sealed and stored at 4 ºc with physico chemical analysis completed and dewaterability tests initiated no more than a week after collection to maintain freshness faecal liquid fraction in order to characterise the dewaterability of faeces across a range of solids concentrations the faecal liquid fraction properties faecal liquor were required to calculate particle interactions at different solids concentrations due to the high solids content of faeces extracting sufficient liquor from individual samples was not viable therefore six faeces samples representing bss 1 6 were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 12 h sorvall legend rt thermo scientific loughborough uk to extract sufficient volume to determine the general faecal liquor properties summarised in table s1 as a substitute for faecal liquor dilution of faeces was carried out by using a saline solution of the same conductivity 7 61 g l 1 nacl 12 62 ms cm 1 this was to prevent cell lysis from osmotic pressure a liquor substitute was similarly utilised and verified by stickland et al 2008 for wastewater liquor all but one sample were diluted with the saline solution urine was used instead of the saline solution to dilute faeces when determining the impact of a blackwater matrix on faeces dewaterability sample bss 4 urine table s2 physico chemical characterisation further properties of the faecal samples were measured to diagnose the dewatering behaviour of different sample types these included the determination of extracellular polymeric substances eps through protein and carbohydrate concentrations and chemical oxygen demand after a 0 2 µm filter codsoluble protein concentrations were measured using the modified lowry method uv750 nm lowry et al 1951 with bovine serum albumin bsa sigma aldrich uk as the standard carbohydrate concentrations were measured using the dubois phenol sulphuric acid method uv490 nm dubois et al 1956 with glucose sigma aldrich uk as the reference standard quantification of protein and carbohydrates was achieved by spectrophotometry nova60 photometer vwr uk and chemical oxygen demand was analysed using a merck vial test kit merck kgaa darmstadt germany undiluted faecal samples were first prepared by combining 5 g of undiluted faeces in 50 ml of deionised water conductivity was obtained using a probe jenway 4330 cole parmer staffordshire uk particle size distribution of pre and post macerated faeces involved filtering the sample through gradation sieves with mesh sizes of 1 2 3 35 and 4 75 mm to capture the macro particle fraction total solids ts volatile solids vs fraction of ts total suspended solids tss and liquor dissolved solids after filtration ds were determined using standard wastewater methods apha 2012 and used to calculate the solids volume fraction ϕ according to appendix a all dewatering calculations and modelling were performed with solids concentration represented on a volumetric basis as solids volume fraction ϕ 2 2 gravitational batch settling tests transient batch settling tests tracking the sediment liquid interface height over time were analysed based on a previously verified method lester et al 2005 usher et al 2013 using a kynch 1952 type analysis to determine settling velocity u m s 1 as a function of solids concentration the hindered settling function r is determined from the settling velocity using the following relation 1 r ϕ δ ρ g 1 ϕ 2 u ϕ where δρ ρsolid ρliquor is the solid liquor density difference u is the settling velocity m s 1 and g is gravitational acceleration m s 2 the final equilibrium sediment height is used in the determination of ϕg and py ts near ϕg lester et al 2005 stickland 2015 usher 2002 such that the final average solids concentration ϕav provides an estimate of the gel point 2 ϕ g ϕ av ϕ 0 h 0 h where ϕ0 and h0 are the initial solids volume fraction and height while h is the final equilibrium height between 40 to 60 g of a fresh sample were briefly mixed at 1000 rpm for 30 s using a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane and diluted within 500 ml of the saline solution or urine bss 4 urine in a glass measuring cylinder the cylinder was sealed with parafilm and turned upside down to re suspend the matrix before starting the test as soon as the cylinder was upright the change in sediment liquid interface height was recorded over 48 h until the height stabilised 2 3 stepped pressure filtration mechanical intervention is required to overcome network stress and enable dewaterability characterisation at solids concentrations well above the gel point constant pressure filtration techniques were developed by landman and white landman et al 1995 landman and white 1997 to quantify py and r at solids concentrations exceeding ϕg using a series of single pressure filtration tests at different pressures each test requires more of the same sample which for faeces is limited and is susceptible to changes in physico chemical properties over the extended time periods between tests in order to decrease characterisation time de kretser et al 2001 and usher et al 2001 optimised and validated a stepped pressure filtration method where multiple pressures can be characterised in two experiments a permeability test and compressibility test for stepped pressure filtration tests this study has utilised an automated filtration rig comprised of an analogous design fig s1 b the rig was controlled and data analysed using the accompanying labview software in a compressibility test a piston applies a constant pressure δp onto a suspension contained within a compression cylinder at initial solids volume fraction ϕ0 and initial height h0 liquid permeates through a porous membrane at the base of the cylinder where a cake builds until it reaches the piston face and then consolidates to the maximum solids concentration ϕ ϕ0h0 h where p y ϕ δ p such that h is the final equilibrium height the pressure is then stepped and the material consolidated to equilibrium at a number of pressures fig 1 a in a stepped pressure permeability test the slope dt dv2 1 β2 during bed formation is determined for a number of pressures δp where the operational parameters time t specific filtrate volume v and filtration parameter β2 are recorded each pressure is stepped once a stable slope is reached fig 1b the hindered settling function r is then calculated using the gradient of a curve fit of β2 vs δp and the ϕ values from the compressibility tests using the following equation 3 r ϕ 2 d β 2 δ p 1 ϕ 0 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 another section of the same faeces sample used for the batch settling test was simultaneously characterised in the filtration tests faecal samples were briefly mixed 1000 rpm 30 s with the saline solution or urine at a 1 2 faeces to solution w w ratio to nominally represent the gel point of the samples this was performed using a haake viscotester iq rheometer thermo electron karlsruhe germany with a fl22 4b ss vane before subjecting samples to filtration this sample preparation was critical to avoid air gaps and allow for a uniform volume 50 ml when loaded into the filtration rig based on previous evidence the short mixing time imparted insufficient shear to disrupt the coarse particle structure during sample preparation ravndal et al 2019 the quicker permeability test was always conducted first on a sub sample as it allowed for the subsequent compressibility test to start less than a week after sample collection on another sub sample maintaining faeces freshness different pressures for both tests were tested within the same sub sample as the stepped pressure filtration rig allowed for a change in pressure without opening the system both compressibility and permeability tests were programmed with set pressures of 20 50 120 and 300 kpa the final cake height was consistently higher than the recommended minimum of 5 mm ensuring that the linear encoder resolution of 10 μm did not compromise accuracy de kretser et al 2001 usher et al 2001 and also ensuring that coarse chunks of material are less likely to compromise tests by bridging between the membrane and the piston verification of method accuracy prior to completion of analysis was conducted with a bss4 macerated sample for which ts values at 50 kpa py ts 50 kpa varied by 3 8 ts between replicates and gel point 1 across replicates 2 4 combining data into curve fits the compressive yield stress py data from filtration tests were fitted to a functional form described by lester et al 2005 and then ϕg initially estimated using eq 2 was adjusted until the compressive yield stress curve was exactly consistent with the final height of the settling test see crust 2017 for details the hindered settling function r data from both settling and filtration tests were combined and fitted using an interpolation function over the full range of solids concentration data from the initial settling test concentration to the final concentration achieved at the highest filtration pressure the data were exponentially extrapolated outside this range for very low and very high solids concentrations py and r curve fits were then combined into a single term known as the solids diffusivity d to illustrate the overall dewaterability landman et al 1995 4 d ϕ d p y ϕ d ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r ϕ where ϕ is the solids volume fraction 2 5 modelling process modelling was conducted to compare the predicted dewatering performance of faeces against wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 and mineral slurry usher et al 2013 literature data in passive gravity settling and mechanical units e g centrifugation and filtration the one dimensional differential equation that describes these processes in linear coordinates is given below landman and white 1994 5 ϕ t d z d ϕ ϕ z ϕ u ϕ where ϕ is the solids volume fraction t is time z is a length coordinate such as height d ϕ is the solids diffusivity function defined above in eq 4 and u ϕ is the settling velocity function related to the hindered settling function r ϕ by eq 1 a range of initial solids concentrations ts 0 1 1 3 10 and 25 ts were used with initial saline diluted faeces heights h0 350 35 11 7 3 5 and 1 4 cm where all scenarios used the same amount of solid material nominally 1 cm at 35 ts for example if the initial solids concentration is 10 ts the initial height scales to 3 5 cm the relevant sediment and piston heights were predicted as a function of time until no more dewatering could occur from these heights the average solids concentrations were calculated and graphed to show the influence of the material initial solids concentration and dewatering method on the rate and extent of dewatering the passive gravity batch settling predictions used a semi implicit finite difference algorithm to numerically solve a second order discretisation of eq 5 to predict the solids concentration distribution as a function of time the algorithm simulated a simple 1 d batch settling scenario with the sediment liquid interface height h where ϕ ϕ0 recorded until sedimentation and consolidation of the networked bed ceased at an equilibrium solids concentration distribution the method has been previously validated by usher et al 2006 is detailed in spehar 2014 and was adapted from algorithms described by burger and karlsen 2001 the number of height elements used in the computations varied from 50 to 1600 to balance computation time and accuracy the centrifugal settling predictions used a semi implicit finite difference algorithm to numerically solve a discretised radial coordinate variant of eq 5 over time the algorithm simulated a 1 d batch centrifugation process for a thin tube with an outer radius rmax of 0 25 m and a rotation speed of 1000 rpm with the sediment liquid interface height h rmax r where ϕ ϕ0 recorded over time until equilibrium the number of elements used in the computations varied from 50 to 1600 to balance computation time and accuracy the method is described in usher et al 2013 and was adapted from algorithms developed by bürger and concha 2001 the filtration modelling predictions used a runge kutta algorithm to numerically solve a simplified discretisation of eq 5 over time with a moving boundary condition and gravity removed such that 6 ϕ t d z d ϕ ϕ z where ϕ is the solids volume fraction t is time z is a length coordinate representing distance from the filter cloth d ϕ is the solids diffusivity function defined above in eq 4 the algorithm simulated a 300 kpa pressure in a 1 d batch filtration process where the material is consolidated over time by movement of a piston towards a membrane permeable to liquor but not to suspended solids the piston membrane gap h is recorded over time until consolidation ceases at equilibrium the algorithm was developed described and validated by stickland et al 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of fresh faeces dewaterability to other compressible matrices to characterise the compressive yield stress py hindered settling function r and solids diffusivity d curve fits were produced by combining settling data at low solids concentrations with pressure filtration data from high solids concentrations stickland et al 2008 skinner et al 2015 data was first interpreted using suspended solids volume fraction ϕ in accordance with the analytical approach proposed by buscall and white 1987 but are presented as total solids fractions on a mass basis ts as this parameter is more commonly employed to characterise wastewater suspensions the gel points ϕg of fresh faeces were determined to have ts concentrations of 6 2 7 2 13 9 and 15 6 for bristol stool scales of 6 5 4 and 1 3 respectively fig 2 fig s1 a where bss1 3 was physically characterised by a consolidated structure and bss6 a mushier stool tending toward diarrhoea table 1 these ts concentrations represent the point at which these suspensions form an inter connected particle network capable of supporting their own weight harbour et al 2001 dewatering data of thickened waste activated sludge twas 81 vs obtained from skinner et al 2015 was overlaid to compare the dewatering behaviour of fresh faeces and that of sludge from centralised infrastructure the gel point for twas was 2 4 ts which is comparable to literature 2 3 pileggi et al 2019 the lower ϕg of waste activated sludge is generally attributed to the density of intact bacterial cells that introduce a relatively high eps fraction creating a heterogeneous stable colloidal complex which may promote the early onset of networking christensen et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 for ts concentrations exceeding ϕg the network strength is sufficient to exhibit a yield stress harbour et al 2001 once subjected to an applied load i e a compressive yield stress usher 2002 the ts concentration corresponding to ϕg therefore signifies the transition between passive sedimentation and mechanical intervention to facilitate compressional stress and is indicated where each trend intersects the x axis fig 2 when subjected to an applied compressive pressure the py ts of fresh faeces increased significantly with an increase in ts concentration on this semi logarithmic plot fig 2 table s3 to illustrate py ts were recorded for faeces characterised as bss4 of 50 120 and 300 kpa at ts concentrations of 35 40 and 49 respectively this demonstrates the maximum solids concentration that can be achieved at these pressures this can be explained by the increase in volume fraction in this plot represented by ts which increases the number of interparticle linkages and as such the py ts until it reaches an equilibrium with the applied pressure harbour et al 2001 the compressive yield stress values of the different fresh faeces were compared at a fixed applied compressive pressure 50 kpa fig 3 a and a strong correlation between py ts for fresh faeces and the initial faecal solids concentration was identified the initial solids concentration is in turn broadly related to bss lewis and heaton 1997 and appears also to inform on the ϕg fig 3b this correlation is intuitive as the compressive yield stress is a direct measure of the strength of the bonds between particles in a flocculated suspension under pressure green et al 1996 whilst twas displays higher py ts than faecal material within the lower ts range due to the lesser ϕg py ts at higher ts concentrations are broadly comparable to py ts of the bss4 it was observed that the compressive yield stress exhibited by bss4 at higher ts concentrations was lower than for bss1 3 and bss6 fig 2 the bss4 structure represents the transition between these two sample types exhibiting the structure of bss1 3 with consolidating properties more comparable to bss6 this synergy providing easiest passage through the human gut we suggest these preferred material properties maybe responsible for the lower material strength for bss4 but this would require a more quantitative and specific study of material rheology and chemical analysis to provide such confirmation the hindered settling function r ts is the hydrodynamic resistance to flow of liquor through a particulate suspension as a function of solids volume fraction herein plotted as ts fig 4 a and 5 b for lower ts concentrations 20 ts faeces characterised by a more consolidated structure bss1 3 exhibited a comparatively low r ts whereas a considerably higher r ts was identified for bss4 6 to illustrate an r ts of 1 108 and 3 109 kg s 1 m 3 was recorded for bss1 3 and bss4 respectively corresponding to a ts concentration of 10 the hindered settling function can be interpreted as either particle transport through a liquid or liquid past a collection of particles and is thus applicable to the full range of solids concentrations from very dilute to very concentrated suspensions usher 2002 the r ts for twas was markedly higher than fresh faeces within a considerably more dilute range indicating that this more disperse suspension exhibits more resistance to flow the resistance to flow experienced with waste activated sludge has been postulated to arise from interstitial water water physically and chemically bound in cells and cell structures e g eps in addition to more complex colligative properties christensen et al 2015 a comparable gradient in r ts versus ts to twas was identified within the lower ts concentration range for the more disperse faecal suspensions bss4 6 where such structural characteristics are acknowledged to hinder both settling and filterability christensen et al 2015 this agrees with the hindered passive sedimentation of fresh faeces where a negative correlation between eps and ϕg was observed fig 3c although further investigation is required to discern the impact of eps from that of undigested food products for each organic suspension a plateau in r ts was reached at ts concentrations of 20 to 30 corresponding to between 1 1015 and 1 1016 kg s 1 m 3 mineral slurry bauxite residue data obtained from usher et al 2013 was overlaid to compare with a less complex and more homogenous suspension the mineral slurry ϕg solids concentration was distinctively higher at 27 6 ts and an r ts of less than 1 1011 kg s 1 m 3 was determined at 50 ts diffusivity d combines the competing effects of compressibility and permeability into a single term to fully characterise filtration when gravitational forces are no longer significant harbour et al 2001 usher 2002 the initial sharp phase of the slope corresponds to batch settling with the secondary phase of the slope related to the applied compressive pressure leading to cake filtration and subsequently compression fig 4b and 5c for fresh faeces the d ts gradient is generally positive above 20 kpa applied compressive pressure with extended cake formation and truncated cake compression mineral slurry filtration exhibits comparable behaviour where the d ts gradient is positive and filtration curves exhibit extended cake formation with high average solids concentrations close to the equilibrium concentrations enabling relatively truncated cake compression de kretser et al 2001 stickland 2015 usher et al 2001 this contradicts filtration behaviour of twas which was characterised by a considerably lower d ts indicative of a less dewaterable suspension more specifically at pressures corresponding to the region of decreasing d ts dewatering was relatively slow near the membrane causing the filter cake to form at a lower average solids concentration that fills the cavity relatively soon after which an extended compression phase begins this is characteristic of organically rich municipal wastewater sludges dairy effluent and algal biomass scales et al 2004 skinner et al 2015 stickland 2015 stickland et al 2008 studer 2008 wall 2008 skinner et al 2015 hypothesised that the extended compression zone characteristic of twas and primary sludge is attributed to the extensive cross linked polymeric network in which cellular and particulate components are embedded the eps fraction is up to 80 of wastewater sludge activated sludge biomass neyens and baeyens 2003 this results in a compressible and impermeable layer forming on the membrane surface during filtration which prevents a homogeneous solids gradient during cake formation and causes a typical non linear behaviour during water expulsion until py ts equilibrium is reached for comparison biomass constitutes up to 50 of fresh faeces rose et al 2015 3 2 impact of urine and maceration on faeces dewaterability fresh faeces are a heterogeneous mixture that in addition to comprising of bacteria and cellular material as the dominant organic fraction are also comprised of undigested food residue i e fibre and an inorganic salt fraction penn et al 2018 un masticated food particles present a unique challenge owing to their macroscopic scale 5 mm and ability to disrupt the networked structure suspension conductivity from enteric salts or downstream mixing with urine as in decentralised infrastructure such as pit latrines have been reported to negatively influence the dewaterability of aged faecal sludge semiyaga et al 2016 ward et al 2017 2019 the significance of these unique properties to dewatering was therefore studied using fresh faeces characterised as bss4 table 1 and having a ts concentration of 13 9 at ϕg the addition of urine slightly reduced ϕg to 9 1 ts and as such a higher py ts is exhibited by fresh faeces mixed with urine bss4 urine versus fresh faeces bss4 fig 5a at higher solids concentrations 30 ts and applied pressures 20 kpa the difference in py ts between bss4 urine and bss4 becomes less apparent to illustrate a py ts of 300 kpa was observed at ts concentrations of 46 9 and 49 0 for bss4 urine and bss4 respectively for suspensions characterised by ts concentrations ϕg similar values for r ts were recorded for bss4 urine and bss4 fig 5b however once compressive pressure is applied to overcome py ts for ts concentrations ϕg the presence of urine introduces a greater hydrodynamic resistance which in turn reduces the overall diffusivity compared to bss4 fig s 5c whilst the d ts curve for bss4 urine was characterised by a comparable trend to other fresh faeces a lower gradient for the positive fraction of the d ts slope was observed resulting in a diffusivity of around an order of magnitude lower at an applied compressive pressure of 300 kpa analysis of the liquid faecal liquor fraction and urine determined comparable conductivities of 12 6 ms cm 1 and 13 04 ms cm 1 respectively table s1 and s2 however when combined with faeces during preparation the conductivity increased to 14 56 ms cm 1 comparable to conductivities reported for aged public toilet faecal sludge ward et al 2019 whilst divalent cations are recognised to improve dewaterability through encouraging bridging yin et al 2004 urine is dominated by monovalent ions e g na putnam 1971 which are known to reduce dewaterability christensen et al 2015 the increased r ts of bss4 urine could therefore be attributable to the increase in faecal liquor dissolved solids 3 4 wt ds which negatively impacts permeability usher 2002 importantly the ϕg filtration and compression characteristics of bss4 urine can still be regarded as more favourable than conventional wastewater suspensions managed through dewatering with centralised infrastructure maceration was applied to disrupt undigested food particles e g fibre the effect of which was a shift in the distribution of coarse particles from the 4 75 mm fraction to the 1 mm size fraction as demonstrated by an increase in the 1 mm size fraction from 44 to 60 on a weight basis fig s2 maceration was observed to reduce the compressive yield stress relative to bss4 whilst the impact of maceration on permeability r ts was less evident this is comparable to observations by semiyaga et al 2016 where particles greater than 1 mm correlated negatively with the extent of dewatering for faecal sludge from unlined pit latrines at higher applied pressures d ts for bss4 maceration is similar to bss4 fig 5c the reduced difference for high applied pressures where py ts converges at comparable solids concentrations could be associated with exceeding the stress required to compress the rigid macro particles such as seeds and corn kernels even in non macerated samples at 300 kpa maceration only increases the py solids concentrations by 0 7 ts suggesting that high pressure dewatering processes such as filter presses which typically operate from 500 kpa lenntech 2020 can negate the requirement for maceration pre treatment for improved dewaterability at higher solids concentrations however maceration was observed to introduce critical structural transformation at lower ts concentrations and applied compressive pressures this was evidenced by an increase in ϕg from 13 9 to 16 7 ts fig 5a which indicates that maceration maybe beneficial for improving faecal material thickening processes 3 3 modelling dewatering processes a range of initial solids concentrations ts 0 1 1 3 10 and 25 w w were used with initial saline diluted faeces heights that scaled to ensure all scenarios used the same amount of solid material nominally 1 cm at 35 ts for the passive gravity thickening process 1 3 and 10 ts were selected as representative of ts concentrations encountered downstream of a toilet accepting urine faeces and flush water collectively urine and faeces only and the average faeces ϕg respectively fig 6 a table s4 a scenario with 25 initial ts concentration was excluded from the passive gravity thickening modelling as this is beyond the gel point observed for faecal material and hence unattainable by passive gravity thickening for fresh faeces bss4 table 1 initial ts concentrations of 1 and 3 achieve a ts concentration comparable to the gel point around 10 within around 30 min with the 3 and 10 initial ts concentrations consolidating to a final concentration of 14 ts after 1 day the 1 initial ts concentration consolidates to the same tss concentration but a lower ts concentration due to the lower ds concentration imposed by flush water dilution in comparison it takes more than 10 days to settle and consolidate from 1 to 2 ts secondary treatment waste activated sludge twas due to the lower gel point and slower settling rate for centrifugation initial ts concentrations of 3 and 10 were selected for fresh faeces assuming an initial settling stage the centrifuge conditions were 1000 rpm with a 0 25 m outer radius fig 6b table s4 faeces settle to form a sediment at or above ϕg after 1 h and then consolidate to a final concentration of 19 ts in around 12 h irrespective of the initial solids concentration for reference the twas was characterised by an initial ts concentration of 3 consolidating to 5 but over a prohibitive timescale of 10 days higher centrifugation rotational speed was demonstrated with fresh faeces operated at 3000 rpm and increased dewatering rate by a factor of 10 and to a higher ts concentration of 25 in comparison to the organic matrices the mineral slurry is able to reach to a final solids concentration of 52 ts in 1 min when subjected to pressure filtration at 300 kpa fresh faeces can form a cake of 50 ts as observed experimentally fig s3 modelling experimental results determined that after 5 8 17 and 550 days 50 ts can be achieved for starting ts concentrations of 25 10 3 and 0 1 respectively fig 6c table s4 a value of 0 1 ts was utilised as an example of urine and faeces diluted with a significant volume of flushwater which coincides with ts in untreated domestic sewage metcalf and eddy 2013 this demonstrates the importance of a two stage dewatering intervention for this permeability limited process where an initial solids liquid separation close to source could reduce capital scale cost and energy demand of a second centralised dewatering unit to illustrate in order to reach 25 35 ts an increase in initial ts from 3 to 10 approaching ϕg decreases filtration time by a factor of 2 10 due to the reduced scale of decentralised infrastructure using pressure filtration with hold times of several days may not be prohibitive for implementation however higher pressures are often applied for typical filter presses 500 1500 kpa lenntech 2020 an increase of which could assist in reducing hold up time 4 outlook impact of human faeces rheology on dewatering to the best of our knowledge fresh faeces is the only known organic wastewater matrix to exhibit elongated cake filtration coupled with short compression this indicates that a high solids concentration product can be achieved within a shorter time frame this may be explained by the shear and compression history of faeces as they have been subject to effective compression and dehydration by the colon before discharge lewis and heaton 1997 shear and compression history are known to influence network strength and as such the py ts of the matrix green et al 1996 this is opposed to observations reported for wastewater sludge twas and primary skinner et al 2015 and may result from different structural properties of fresh faeces with more compact aggregates known to advantage dewaterability christensen et al 2015 when subject to viscous shear as in the case of piped sewerage transport to a centralised works aggregate erosion occurs increasing single cell number and reducing particle size that has been demonstrated to reduce permeability sludge storage in anaerobic conditions has been shown to inhibit dewatering due to the apparent hydrolysis of bound eps christensen et al 2015 these irreversible structural changes occurring during transport and storage may help explain why a lower gel point and different dewatering behaviour are observed for wastewater sludge and faecal material fig 2 4 that are ultimately of similar organic origin 5 conclusions the compressional rheology of fresh faeces has been characterised to determine whether earlier dewatering can improve decentralised sanitation the gel point for fresh faeces ranged between 6 3 and 15 6 ts concentration which is significantly higher than for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities this implies that the use of passive gravity driven separation for fresh faces can produce a concentrated matrix and reduce transportation volume modelling confirmed the efficacy of gravity driven separation with thickening from 3 to 10 ts concentration requiring 0 5 h this is significant as it suggests that a 70 reduction in water content can be achieved using simple low cost technology that could be applied at community or even single household scale rheological characteristics of dewatering such as gel point and compressive yield stress could be broadly related to bristol stool scale further research to decouple the impact of eps originating from undigested food products from those of faeces could also provide insight into the differentiation observed similar to centralised wastewater sludge an increase in eps content resulted in network onset at lower total solids concentrations however when subjected to mechanical filtration benefits of handling fresh faecal material were observed with a more concentrated cake formed in a shorter time period this is supported by modelling which illustrated that initial thickening with 300 kpa filtration could achieve a 1 4 cm thick 25 ts product in 24 h such performance is only enabled by the unique kinetic and compressive yield stress properties of fresh faeces which if used to inform localised dewatering could change the practical and economic viability of community scale faecal solids management further research to elucidate the ageing profile of faeces in terms of compressional rheology would be beneficial to identify the trade off between storage and dewaterability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16628,heat recovery from wastewater is a robust and straightforward strategy to reduce water related energy consumption its implementation though requires a careful assessment of its impacts across the entire wastewater system as adverse effects on the water and resource recovery facility and competition among heat recovery strategies may arise a model based assessment of heat recovery from wastewater therefore implies extending the modeling spatial scope with the aim of enabling thermal hydraulic simulations from the household tap along its entire flow path down to the wastewater resource recovery facility with this aim in mind we propose a new modeling framework interfacing thermal hydraulic simulations of i households ii private lateral connections and iii the main public sewer network applying this framework to analyze the fate of wastewater heat budgets in a swiss catchment we find that heat losses in lateral connections are large and cannot be overlooked in any thermal hydraulic analysis due to the high temperature low flow wastewater characteristics maximizing heat losses to the environment further we find that implementing shower drain heat recovery devices in 50 of the catchment s households lower the wastewater temperature at the recovery facility significantly less only 0 3 k than centralized in sewer heat recovery due to a significant thermal damping effect induced by lateral connections and secondary sewer lines in building technologies are thus less likely to adversely affect biological wastewater treatment processes the proposed open source modeling framework can be applied to any other catchment we thereby hope to enable more efficient heat recovery strategies maximizing energy harvesting while minimising impacts on biological wastewater treatment keywords energy harvesting household wastewater private connection sewer networks thermal hydraulic analysis wastewater temperature 1 introduction wastewater streams in sewer networks have long been considered for their energy carrying potential the recovery of organic carbon allows for the production of biogas and the recovery of water contained heat originating from hot water for domestic uses like showering and laundering has the potential to increase the energy efficiency of the overall urban water cycle frijns et al 2013 centralized heat recovery systems such as heat pumps implemented in sewer networks or water resource recovery facilities wrrf have been investigated since the 1980s lindström 1985 wade et al 1979 their impact on wastewater temperatures at the inflow of wrrfs and consequently on biological treatment processes is now widely recognized kollmann et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2016 neugebauer et al 2015 wanner et al 2005 more recently in building heat recovery systems especially shower drain heat recovery technologies have been gaining traction notably due to their simplicity and efficient use of high temperature wastewater flows bertrand et al 2017a cooperman et al 2011 mcnabola and shields 2013 meggers and leibundgut 2011 spriet and mcnabola 2019 wong et al 2010 however the systemic implications of these technologies both on wrrf processes and the performance of centralized heat recovery systems located downstream in the sewer network are still unclear sitzenfrei et al 2017 for instance have warned that in building heat recovery systems may lead to significant competition with sewer level heat recovery reducing the potential of the latter technology because the implementation of in building heat recovery technologies can hardly be regulated being located in private buildings they emphasize that robust strategies are required for the efficient management of heat recovery along the urban water cycle other authors have highlighted the need to expand the temporal scope in order to understand the seasonal impact of these technologies on wastewater temperatures cipolla and maglionico 2014 wärff et al 2020 in addition to expanding the temporal scope of thermal hydraulic investigations studying the impacts of in building alterations for instance an energy efficiency measure or a heat recovery installation requires an additional extension of their spatial scope some authors have led network wide analyzes in the context of sewer level heat recovery abdel aal et al 2018 2019 however existing thermal hydraulic studies did not simulate the entirety of the sewer network from the household appliance to the treatment plant either because the thermal hydraulic modeling tool for instance tempest dürrenmatt and wanner 2014 did not allow to do so sitzenfrei et al 2017 or because the focus of the study did not require in building thermal hydraulic processes to be simulated e g abdel aal et al 2018 important thermal hydraulic components in upstream sections of the network are thus being overlooked or at least simplified one such component is private lateral connection pipes which connect households to public sewer lines and are hypothesized as potential hotspots for heat loss from households streams indeed the cumulated length of small and uninsulated lateral connection pipes commonly amounts up to two times the length of the public sewer network berger et al 2016 we propose a framework that allows for model based investigations across entire systems i e from wastewater sources households to sinks at which point it is finally treated wrrf the novel framework combines two modeling tools i waterhub hadengue et al 2020 for the stochastic simulation of in building thermal hydraulic processes and ii swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 a network scale thermal hydraulic model based on the well known epa swmm for the simulation of thermal hydraulics in lateral connection pipes and the public sewer network we apply this framework on a median scale swiss city located 12 km northeast of zurich the case selection was motivated by the extensive sensor network deployed in the catchment blumensaat et al 2021 providing real world temperature and flow observations for the validation of the modeling framework using this framework we evaluate i the importance of accurate simulations of private lateral connection pipes and ii the influence of in building heat recovery on wrrf temperatures through various scenario analyzes 2 materials and methods in the sections below we detail each step of the workflow developed for this study the data used for individual components of the modeling framework described hereinafter are described in table s1 of the supplementary material methodological details are separated as follows i the development of a novel framework to simulate thermal hydraulic processes in sewers with a full network perspective from the wastewater source households to the sink wrrf section 2 1 ii the calibration and validation of a model using observed data from the urban catchment of fehraltorf switzerland section 2 2 iii investigations of the influence of private lateral connections pipes connecting building drains to the public sewer network on thermal processes in sewer networks section 2 3 iv the assessment of the influence of in building shower drain heat recovery devices on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf section 2 4 the workflow allowed us to run scenario analyzes on upstream levels of the catchment households and private lateral connections and compare the results against a reference model validated with observed data 2 1 modeling framework we propose a modeling framework combining building level and network level tools to simulate the fate of wastewater temperature and flow from households to wrrfs the schematic structure of the framework is shown in fig 1 in sub model a the flow and temperature of wastewater produced by households is modeled using the waterhub modeling framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 in sub model b the outputs of sub model a i e wastewater thermal hydrographs produced by households are used as inputs to lateral connections modeled with swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 ultimately in sub model c we aggregate thermal hydrographs from the lateral connections of sub model b and set the results as input to every residential node i e the inlet of secondary sewer lines of a main network model developed in swmm heat we simulate sub models a and b with a time resolution of one second thus accounting for small frequent domestic water consumption events that are known to be important for the simulation of in building heat flows hadengue et al 2020 marini et al 2021 in sub model c a time resolution of 5 s is used to improve computational efficiency the modeling framework can be applied for the simulation of any catchment here we use it to simulate the sewer network of the municipality of fehraltorf in the canton of zurich switzerland in the following sections we provide methodological details specific to each sub model a b and c with a focus on the fehraltorf catchment 2 1 1 modeling of households sub model a we used the waterhub modeling framework for the thermal hydraulic simulation of households the framework provides i a stochastic water consumption simulation tool generating single water consumption events at one second time resolutions based on real or assumed consumption data and ii a thermal hydraulic simulation tool of domestic hot water systems in the modelica language mattsson and elmqvist 1997 the combination of these tools allows for the simulation of thermal hydrographs i e wastewater temperature and flow resolved time series of single households in this study households in fehraltorf were modeled upon a reference domestic hot water system typically found in swiss households fig 2 we simulated a basic plumbing layout four water pipes losing heat to their surroundings connected the tank boiler to appliances requiring hot water length 5 m and diameter ½ in no insulation for the stochastic simulation of water demand the hydrogen tool from the waterhub framework was used to perform poisson processes on appliance resolved consumption curves and event profiles found in the literature ableitner et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017a 2017b butler et al 1995 friedler and butler 1996 kenway et al 2012 pakula and stamminger 2014 for each appliance the consumption curves were scaled to swiss averages svgw 2015 to reflect a water consumption without outdoor uses of 136 l cap 1 d 1 for full details on the procedure we refer to descriptions of the waterhub framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 lastly we sampled the number of inhabitants from a distribution ranging from one to five provided by the federal office of statistics with a mean of 2 3 inhabitants per household bundesamt für statistik 2018 the number of households in fehraltorf was back calculated from dry weather flows provided for each residential node see section 2 1 3 assuming 2 3 inhabitants per household and a per capita consumption of 136 l d 1 bundesamt für statistik 2018 svgw 2015 the calculation resulted in 9306 inhabitants distributed in 4046 simulated households we note that these numbers are not identical to the fehraltorf census data 6500 inhabitants in 2700 households consuming an estimated 187 l cap 1 d 1 but we found that this discrepancy had only marginal consequences on the simulated flow and temperature time series in the main sewer network results are provided in the supplementary material fig s4 for comparison 2 1 2 modeling of lateral connections sub model b the foul sewage of households is transported to the public sewer network through private lateral connection pipes hereafter referred to simply as lateral connections little information is available on the hydraulic and or thermal influence of lateral connections on sewage temperatures and flow rates in public sewer lines islam et al 2012 post et al 2016 we modeled lateral connections using single stretch swmm heat models with uniform sampling for length diameter and slope characteristics to account for real world variability each lateral connection had its characteristics sampled only once and reused throughout the study the robustness of this statistical approach increases with the number of lateral connections in the system but its practicality and ability to take into account real world variability made it the preferred approach we defined sampling ranges based on the few available studies and taking the limitations of the swmm heat with regard to computational instabilities into consideration which we describe in the paragraphs below two studies have driven our range choices islam et al 2012 have collected data from surveys sent to municipalities and consulting companies in the united states canada and in the city of berlin germany as the only european city and thus topographically closer to our modeled catchment we only considered values from berlin post et al 2016 have investigated lateral connections from the hague and rotterdam in the netherlands table 1 summarizes sampling ranges used in this study in our modeling of the fehraltorf catchment lateral connection pipes were considered pvc pipes with manning s roughness coefficient equal to 0 011 cf asce 1982 we calculated pipe thicknesses to meet the requirements for drain pvc pipes pn7 5 from the norm din en 1452 1999 for lateral connections we considered a sewer headspace temperature and soil temperature of 13 c see supplementary material section 3 2 in swmm heat computational instabilities in temperature computations arise at very low water volumes in hydraulic links i e pipes see details in figueroa et al 2021 swmm heat thus sets a fixed lower volume threshold at one litre below this value the water temperature is not calculated accurate simulations of single household wastewater flows are thus difficult due to their intrinsically transient nature to overcome the challenge we introduced constraints on both input flows and model characteristics of lateral connections to maximise the water volume in hydraulic links of each lateral connection first input flows from several households were aggregated to decrease the number of zero flow periods to achieve this we generated batches of households connected to a single lateral connection based on their cumulated flow within a given batch we set when possible the cumulated flow to an amount greater than 2750 l d 1 a value found to be a good compromise to prevent low water volumes and yet provide a realistic number of households connected to each lateral connection thereby representing a multi household building on average 11 households were connected to every one of the 356 lateral connections in the catchment with a standard deviation of 2 5 households per lateral connection to further limit the impact of low flow periods we introduced a constant base flow of 0 0005 l s 1 as a lower limit for flow inputs with a temperature equal to soil temperature in this study 13 c this arbitrary base flow increased the total wastewater volume by roughly 1 which we considered negligible in the overall water balance second we constrained the spatial discretisation of lateral connection models lateral connection pipes were simulated with a maximum granularity of 15 m i e every lateral connection is split into several sections of 15 m each the shortest possible pipe being 15 m long these constraints did not prevent periods of non simulated temperature entirely but significantly increased the stability of the simulations on average 16 of the cumulative flow from households representing about 5 of the wrrf inflow could not be associated with a simulated temperature value and were thus set to soil temperature additional figures and details are provided in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s2 the soil temperature assumption stems from the reasoning that when in pipe water volumes are very small water forms a thin film at the bottom of the pipe thus maximizing heat losses due to high surface to volume ratios despite the difficulty of quantifying the uncertainty this assumption induces in our model we see it as having a negligible impact on temperatures at the treatment plant indeed the contribution of these low flow periods to the total heat budget at the wrrf is close to negligible in the order of 3 when the temperature is set to 13 c i e soil temperature around lateral connections 2 1 3 modeling the public sewer network sub model c our study focuses on the combined sewer network of fehraltorf which is equipped with sensors gathering thermal hydraulic data at high spatiotemporal resolutions blumensaat et al 2021 for our analysis we implemented sewer infrastructure data i e a link node network of 415 manholes interconnected by 412 conduits into swmm heat the gravity driven system receives two wastewater transfer flows from neighbouring municipalities rumlikon russikon see the schematic representation in fig 3 and carries those together with sewage from fehraltorf to the wrrf our study targets dry weather conditions i e it exclusively considers municipal wastewater industrial wastewater including commercial wastewater and groundwater infiltration flows transfer flows from the two adjacent municipalities account for 36 of the total wastewater inflow at the treatment plant groundwater infiltration contributes up to 15 and industrial wastewater to about 21 the rest 28 is residential wastewater from households located within the municipality of fehraltorf swmm heat is based on the widespread epa swmm hydraulic model the thermal hydraulic model computes the temperature at each time step based on a heat balance equation taking into account i conduction heat transfer at the wastewater pipe soil interface ii latent heat transfer between wastewater and sewer headspace and iii the convective heat transfer between wastewater and sewer headspace figueroa et al 2021 model parameters such as pipe material thickness diameter slope and surrounding soil thermal characteristics were set according to cadaster data or following assumptions from the literature we provide a summary of the main model parameters in the supplementary material table s3 based on observations in the fehraltorf catchment for the month of april corresponding to the calibration and validation periods see section 2 2 and additional modeling analyzes we set the soil temperature to 11 c groundwater infiltrations for lack of any data source were set equal to the soil temperature moreover motivated by observations in fehraltorf we set the sewer headspace temperature to 12 c extended details are given in the supplementary material section 3 2 other model inputs were defined as follows wastewater transfer flows we used measured thermal hydraulic time series to represent the contribution of the two neigbouring municipalities rumlikon and russikon groundwater infiltration sewer infiltration of groundwater is accounted for as spatially distributed inflow rates ranging from 0 0005 l s 1 non zero for numerical stability to 0 925 l s 1 these groundwater infiltration rates are based on night minimum flow analyzes of own measurements at the catchment boundary transfer flows f02 f03 and at the inflow of the wrrf f00 details are given in the supplementary material section 3 6 the temperature of sewer infiltration was set to a constant value according to the soil temperature industrial dischargers inflows to the industrial nodes were simulated as daily rectangular pulses with flow values ranging from 0 02 to 6 l s 1 the pulse schedule and temperature was calibrated manually see section 2 2 a textile producing company discharging hot wastewater into the public sewer constitutes an exception flow and temperature were here simulated with a rectangular pulse set to 6 l s 1 and 30 c respectively following related field measurements the daily schedule was identical to that calibrated for the other industrial contributors household wastewater flows we aggregated thermal hydraulic time series from the outputs of sub model b see section 2 1 2 for every residential node in the network water flows were summed while corresponding average temperature values were computed using a weighted mean method 2 2 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated by comparing the simulated flow and temperature curves with the observed flow and temperature at three locations along the main collector in the fehraltorf system upstream mostly residential wastewater flows midstream mixed industrial residential wastewater and at the inlet of the wrrf located downstream cf fig 3 we compared simulated with observed time series in april 2019 i e for two periods of persistent dry weather conditions 8 10th april for calibration 15 19th april for validation a period of persistent dry weather is hereby defined as a period with no runoff efficient rainfall in the preceeding 72 h until the next rain the main reasons for choosing the period of april 2019 were i non extreme but still somewhat critical wastewater temperatures for biological wastewater treatment european spring time after the cold weather period ii the occurence of two sufficiently long periods of dry weather in the same season iii the availability of consistent input and observed data with all other model parameters and inputs either derived from measurements or from cadaster data as described in section 2 1 3 we manually calibrated two remaining model parameters the daily schedule of industrial contributors including the main textile industry was calibrated such that the morning flow and corresponding temperature rise and the evening fall best fit the observations the daily schedule for the industrial rectangular pulses was thereafter set to 7 00 20 00 while settings are applied to all industrial contributors the influence of this schedule is predominent for locations downstream of the discharge point of the textile industry i e midstream and wrrf we calibrated the temperature of industrial wastewater flows such that the simulated temperature would best fit the observed temperature curves between 10 00 and 17 00 we set it to 18 c during daytime we quantified the model performance through the evaluation of absolute and relative differences between simulated and observed data for a range of flow and temperature characteristics total cumulative flow volume period average flow and temperature and 2 h average of flow and temperature during the night minimum flow period between 2 00 and 4 00 additionally we calculated one goodness of fit metric the root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr following guidelines from moriasi et al 2007 1 r s r r m s e s t d o b s i y i o b s y i s i m 2 i y i o b s y 2 here rmse refers to the root mean square error and stdobs to the standard deviation of the observations we note that april 19th a public holiday was excluded from the goodness of fit assessment since the model only reflects flow and temperature patterns from typical weekdays for the following scenario analyzes we refer to the validated model describing the status quo uniquely as the reference model 2 3 influence of lateral connections using the reference model as a basis we evaluated the influence of changing properties of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in this regard we simulated didactical scenarios with lateral connections of incrementally increasing lengths for the validation period 15 19th april 2019 starting at 0 m no lateral connection i e direct discharge from household to the public sewer network we systematically increased the length of the 356 lateral connections in fehraltorf in steps of 15 m 0 15 30 45 60 m this corresponds to an incremental increase in the total sewer network length from 17 06 km 0 m in 5 25 km steps 15 m up to 38 06 km 60 m as a comparison the reference model total length is 27 56 km 17 06 km main network 10 5 km lateral connections at each step we compared flow and temperature characteristics described in section 2 2 with results from the reference model from these characteristics we derived the temperature changes induced by the varying lateral connection lengths 2 4 in building heat recovery to investigate the influence of in building heat recovery technologies on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf we modified the household model described in section 2 1 1 through the addition of a shower drain heat recovery device a commercially available technology used for the preheating of cold water streams using shower drain water the heat recovery model implemented is a spatially discretized counter flow heat exchanger with 10 ideally mixed nodes its effective heat recovery potential for the preheating of cold water from shower drain water is 8 10 kw comparable to commercially available devices joulia 2017 the heat exchanger cools down shower drain water by roughly 12 14 k and transfers heat to the cold water stream typically heating up by more than 20 k for more details on the heat exchanger model and discussion of its performance we refer to the publication by hadengue et al 2020 we investigated various spatially randomized market penetration levels 25 50 75 and 100 of the 4046 households located in fehraltorf as described in section 2 1 3 these households are responsible for 28 of the total wastewater inflow at the wrrf under the assumption that wastewater flows from rumlikon and russikon consist only of residential 85 and groundwater infiltration 15 sources implementing these heat recovery technologies in fehraltorf thus influences at most only 50 of the total number of households in the whole catchment in the 100 market penetration scenario similar to the lateral connection scenarios the flow and temperature characteristics described in 2 2 were compared to results from the reference model 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation we assessed the performance of the entire modeling framework by comparing the output of sub model c with flow rates and temperatures measured at several locations along with the main collector in the pilot catchment upstream midstream and at the wrrf see fig 3 with this we provide spatially differentiated evidence of the model s ability to reflect the thermal hydraulic dynamics of wastewater within a real world sewer network 3 1 1 results qualitative evaluation the results indicate that simulated sewage flows and temperatures follow closely the dynamics observed during dry weather conditions fig 4 diurnal flow dynamics i e morning peak mid day valley and lower evening peak are precisely reproduced at all three different locations along the main collector observed and simulated temperature time series show a slightly different and less consistent pattern while the upstream location represents a typical residential dominated peak valley peak pattern the midstream and wrrf locations show the impact of industrial wastewater flows estimated through a rectangular pulse temperature pattern we note that for the upstream location dominated by residential wastewater flows morning peak temperatures are overestimated by 4 5 k further downstream at the inflow of the wrrf this overestimation is still visible although less pronounced interestingly a clear mismatch between observed and simulated time series appears on friday april 19th 2019 as it was a public holiday industries were thus not operating and it is likely that water consumption habits were not identical to typical working days see fig 4b this operational shutdown is deliberately left unconsidered in the model for the first four days of the validation period april 15 to 18th representing typical weekdays however we report an overall match between simulated and observed time series 3 1 2 results quantitative evaluation as reported in table 2 the selected flow and temperature characteristics confirm the visual match in the validation period simulations yield an average flow within 1 of the observed data at the wrrf with a deviation of only 0 27 l s 1 at the two upstream locations though simulations overestimate the average flow by over 12 mostly due to the overestimation of the morning peak simulated night minimum flows primarily driven by groundwater infiltration fall within 15 of the observed values at the wrrf 19 90 versus 23 14 l s 1 in terms of temperature both simulated average temperature and simulated night minimum temperature fall within 0 5 k at most 2 9 relative deviation of the observed values at all three locations rsr values confirm the satisfactory fit for flow dynamics range 0 51 0 76 the goodness of fit regarding temperature dynamics is less good range 0 68 1 32 but these values are heavily biased by the morning peak overestimation indeed ignoring the 06 00 10 00 morning period we find a satisfactory performance of the model with a rsr range of 0 63 1 03 the full results are available in the supplementary material table s4 3 1 3 discussion diurnal dynamics we consider the validated model to be a viable reference case for the analyzes presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 below we adequately simulate flow and temperature dynamics at three different locations in the catchment with reasonable rsr values and flow and temperature characteristics falling within acceptable ranges when compared with observed data nevertheless the discrepancy with regard to morning peak temperatures requires a thorough discussion causes for the morning peak temperature overestimation are assumed to be manifold first the peak is a consequence of the hot morning showers simulated in the waterhub sub model a showering patterns from the literature see section 2 1 1 represent showering habits of a different spatio temporal context 1987 butler et al 1995 friedler and butler 1996 although these curves represent to our knowledge some of the best available data it is likely that they do not adequately reflect the current showering habits in fehraltorf second the model simulates showers as ideal processes i e no evaporation or heat losses however a side study using the empirical heat loss model developed by wong et al 2010 and used in other studies sitzenfrei et al 2017 showed no significant reduction in the morning peak temperature indicating that in shower processes are not major drivers of morning peak discrepancy further details are available in the supplementary material fig s3 third the latent heat transfer evaporation model part of swmm heat is likely to yield inaccurate results in the extreme case of low flow small pipes with large temperature gradients like shower drain water entering a lateral connection pipe more details are available in the description of swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 it is not possible to quantify the error induced by the evaporation model but it may explain part of the overestimation of morning shower peak temperatures finally we are likely to underestimate the number of lateral connections present in fehraltorf constraints imposed on the simulation of lateral connections see section 2 1 2 led to on average 11 households connected to one connection pipe a large number of connected households means a reduction in the influence of heat transfer processes in lateral connections on the network thermal hydraulics 3 2 influence of lateral connections we assessed the influence of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in sewer networks by comparing the reference case to five scenarios of varying lateral connection lengths starting at zero no lateral connections residential wastewater flows directly into the sewer network we increased the length of connections in 15 m steps up to 60 m 3 2 1 results influence of lateral connections fig 5 shows the resulting temperature distributions at the wrrf for april 15 18 2019 contrary to pure hydraulic considerations where peripheral elements are generally considered less relevant lateral connections appear to have a significant influence on the temperature the average temperature at the wrrf increases by 0 8 k in the scenario without lateral connections when all households in fehraltorf are equipped with relatively short lateral sewers 15 m the difference in average temperature with the reference case drops to 0 2 k the average temperature at the wrrf asymptotically decreases further with increasing length results from fig 5 are in line with our understanding of basic physical processes driving heat dispersion dynamics in pipes first lateral sewers are smaller and thinner than main sewers thus increasing heat transfer to the surrounding soil when the difference between bulk liquid and soil temperature is large which is often the case with incoming household wastewater second wastewater inflow rates are usually small with high surface to volume ratios thin films of water and thus further increasing heat transfer to surrounding media it is thus no surprise that taking lateral connections into account is critical to obtain accurate simulations of wastewater temperatures in sewer networks 3 2 2 discussion realistic lateral connection models the lack of catchment specific data for water consumption building types and lateral connection characteristics makes a thorough validation of the household and lateral connection models impossible we therefore cannot draw quantitative conclusions about the real influence of lateral connection on a sewer network s thermal hydraulic processes rather the objective of this study is to alert to the importance of providing realistic physically based simulations of lateral connections when performing network scale thermal hydraulic investigations we note that the influence of lateral connections on thermal hydraulic processes depends largely on the i seasonal ii temporal and ii spatial context of the catchment i seasonal context a clear limitation of our study is to focus on a single week in april 2019 although seasonal effects are expected to modify heat transfer processes due to varying in sewer headspace air soil and groundwater temperatures we speculate however that the influence of lateral connections on wrrf temperatures would increase in winter due to the larger temperature gradients between wastewater and soil and thus coincide with critically low wastewater temperatures at the wrrf in contrast in summer when wastewater temperatures are not critical their influence would decrease due to generally lower temperature gradients this discussion is closely linked to the thermal damping effect in lateral connections discussed in section 3 3 3 ii temporal context wet weather periods may lead to increased groundwater infiltration rates in addition to additional runoff water thus modifying the relative importance of lateral connections in the total heat budget lastly during weekends we may expect different water consumption behaviors and a reduced influence from industrial flows further modifying contributions to the total heat budget at the wrrf iii spatial context descriptions of lateral connection characteristics slope depth diameter length surrounding media etc are scarce in the literature however they were shown to vary widely from location to location islam et al 2012 post et al 2016 topographical specificities of the catchment under investigation may thus strongly influence analyzes like the one presented here extending our investigations to consider alternate spatiotemporal contexts goes beyond the scope of this study nevertheless the discussion above highlights the importance of simulating lateral connections realistically when investigating thermal processes in sewer networks we emphasize this further by acknowledging that results from fig 5 are overall likely to underestimate heat losses in lateral connections first the scenarios presented with varying lateral connection lengths affect only residential wastewater in the fehraltorf catchment i e only 28 of the total inflow to the wrrf we can thus infer that in catchments with smaller industrial wastewater or groundwater infiltration flow rates lateral connections have an increased influence on the network s thermal hydraulic processes second as described in section 3 1 3 the number and total length of lateral connections in the model is likely lower than in reality given that typical lengths are within the same range as the total length of the public sewer network results from fig 5 may thus underestimate the real influence of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in the sewer network 3 3 influence of in building heat recovery 3 3 1 results influence of in building heat recovery as shown in fig 6 shower level heat recovery influences mean wastewater temperatures at the wrrf inflow only marginally when 25 of the fehraltorf households are equipped with the technology the mean temperature drops by less than 0 1 k the drop increases to 0 3 k in the 100 market penetration scenario although average temperatures are not significantly influenced by shower level heat recovery we observe an impact on temperature distribution shapes the high temperature but less frequent peaks are shaved off reducing the temperature range maximum temperatures in the reference case reach roughly 20 c whereas maximum temperatures in the 100 market penetration scenario remain well below 18 c these results tend to disagree with the scarce literature on the topic sitzenfrei et al 2017 for instance report a maximum temperature decrease of 1 2 1 3 k at the wrrf after the installation of in building heat recovery devices in the catchment upstream with 100 market penetration in this regard we discuss important perspectives to challenge and explain our results in sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 below 3 3 2 discussion catchment context in the fehraltorf catchment and during the dry weather period in april 2019 under consideration we estimate that 21 of wastewater inflows at the wrrf stem from industrial or commercial sources and 15 from groundwater infiltrations these flows both contribute significantly to the overall heat budget when neglecting industrial inflows in our simulations the average temperature at the wrrf drops by 1 3 k from 14 8 to 13 5 c for the reference case the prominent role of industrial wastewater flows in the fehraltorf catchment may not reflect typical spatial contexts of other catchments it may thus appear reasonable to infer that this context explains the limited impact of in building heat recovery on wrrf temperatures this is however not the case the average temperature difference between the reference case and the 100 market penetration scenario simulated without industrial sources is 0 3 k identical to the difference of 0 3 k reported when considering industrial wastewater echoing the discussion from section 3 2 2 we argue as other authors do that a thorough assessment of the spatio temporal context of a given catchment is critical for accurate assessments of thermal hydraulic alterations to the system kollmann et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2016 neugebauer et al 2015 3 3 3 discussion thermal damping we have seen that specificities of the fehraltorf catchment do not explain results from fig 6 indeed regardless of the catchment context lateral connections and secondary sewer lines of the network are major heat sinks and thus act as thermal dampers because of the non linearity of heat transfer rates to the surrounding soil emphasized by the magnitude of heat losses in small uninsulated pipes a thermal alteration to the heat budget of households e g heat recovery is not propagated linearly into the heat budget of the wrrf located downstream this is clearly visible in the total heat budget difference between the reference case and the 100 market penetration scenario fig 7 at household level the difference is 16 8 mwh over the course of four typical weekdays april 15 18 2019 this value reflects the amount of heat recovered with shower level heat exchangers and represents a 16 reduction in the heat demand of households in line with estimates from the literature e g kenway et al 2019 estimate a 22 energy reduction for hot water production at the outlet of lateral connections the difference is 11 3 mwh decreasing by 33 due to the non linearity of heat transfer processes in lateral connection pipes lastly at the inflow of the wrrf the heat budget difference is 8 0 mwh less than half the difference at household level in other words the thermal damping induced by lateral connections mostly and the sewer network significantly reduces the influence of in building heat recovery technologies on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf we thus anticipate in building heat recovery to have significantly fewer adverse effects than centralized heat recovery strategies upstream of treatment plants for the same amount of recovered heat on water treatment processes in wrrfs in the case of fehraltorf if we neglect thermal damping effects entirely and simply reduce the heat budget at the inflow of the wrrf by 16 8 mwh i e the effective amount of heat recovered in households upstream the average temperature at the wrrf would decrease by approximately 0 9 k compared to 0 3 k as reported in fig 6 this temperature drop is much closer to the 0 8 k decrease reported by sitzenfrei et al 2017 in a similar market penetration scenario i e the 60 market penetration scenario whereas these authors have concluded that in building heat recovery may lead to large performance drops in centralized heat recovery systems and water treatment processes we argue that thermal damping from lateral connections largely mitigates this risk the accurate assessment of thermal alterations at building level thus relies on the detection and quantification of thermal damping effects stemming from lateral connections and secondary sewer lines 4 conclusion the thermal hydraulic modeling framework proposed adequately reproduces the evolution of wastewater temperatures from the source households to the sink wrrf in a real world catchment the framework allows systemic investigations of thermal hydraulic modifications made to the system for instance heat recovery from wastewater or changes in water consumption behaviors by taking into account the full catchment context we used it to explore the influence of in building heat recovery devices implementing shower heat recovery in 50 of the households in the swiss municipality of fehraltorf reduced the heat demand of the targeted households by 16 during the spring period studied the consequent wastewater temperature decrease at the wrrf inflow was 0 3 k in comparison a large scale in sewer heat recovery strategy at the wrrf inflow is estimated to decrease the wastewater average temperature by up to 0 9 k for the same amount of recovered heat we identified lateral connections connecting households to the public sewer network as hotspots for heat loss to the environment and thus major drivers of wastewater temperatures in the sewer network downstream lateral connections act as major thermal dampers thermal alterations in households are not propagated linearly in the system downstream in this context heat recovery targeting high temperature wastewater flows in the household does not significantly impact temperatures downstream such impacts are considerably smaller than in sewer heat recovery applications due to the large variability in lateral connection characteristics and the lack of publicly available information on this infrastructure further research is required to support this finding we argue for an adaptive flexible and location dependent integration of heat recovery technologies in areas where households are not the only contributors to wastewater entering the wrrf we encourage the recovery of heat at the source where recovery is technically easier and where the impact on wastewater temperatures and thus on wastewater treatment is minimized declaration of competing interest the authors

16628,heat recovery from wastewater is a robust and straightforward strategy to reduce water related energy consumption its implementation though requires a careful assessment of its impacts across the entire wastewater system as adverse effects on the water and resource recovery facility and competition among heat recovery strategies may arise a model based assessment of heat recovery from wastewater therefore implies extending the modeling spatial scope with the aim of enabling thermal hydraulic simulations from the household tap along its entire flow path down to the wastewater resource recovery facility with this aim in mind we propose a new modeling framework interfacing thermal hydraulic simulations of i households ii private lateral connections and iii the main public sewer network applying this framework to analyze the fate of wastewater heat budgets in a swiss catchment we find that heat losses in lateral connections are large and cannot be overlooked in any thermal hydraulic analysis due to the high temperature low flow wastewater characteristics maximizing heat losses to the environment further we find that implementing shower drain heat recovery devices in 50 of the catchment s households lower the wastewater temperature at the recovery facility significantly less only 0 3 k than centralized in sewer heat recovery due to a significant thermal damping effect induced by lateral connections and secondary sewer lines in building technologies are thus less likely to adversely affect biological wastewater treatment processes the proposed open source modeling framework can be applied to any other catchment we thereby hope to enable more efficient heat recovery strategies maximizing energy harvesting while minimising impacts on biological wastewater treatment keywords energy harvesting household wastewater private connection sewer networks thermal hydraulic analysis wastewater temperature 1 introduction wastewater streams in sewer networks have long been considered for their energy carrying potential the recovery of organic carbon allows for the production of biogas and the recovery of water contained heat originating from hot water for domestic uses like showering and laundering has the potential to increase the energy efficiency of the overall urban water cycle frijns et al 2013 centralized heat recovery systems such as heat pumps implemented in sewer networks or water resource recovery facilities wrrf have been investigated since the 1980s lindström 1985 wade et al 1979 their impact on wastewater temperatures at the inflow of wrrfs and consequently on biological treatment processes is now widely recognized kollmann et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2016 neugebauer et al 2015 wanner et al 2005 more recently in building heat recovery systems especially shower drain heat recovery technologies have been gaining traction notably due to their simplicity and efficient use of high temperature wastewater flows bertrand et al 2017a cooperman et al 2011 mcnabola and shields 2013 meggers and leibundgut 2011 spriet and mcnabola 2019 wong et al 2010 however the systemic implications of these technologies both on wrrf processes and the performance of centralized heat recovery systems located downstream in the sewer network are still unclear sitzenfrei et al 2017 for instance have warned that in building heat recovery systems may lead to significant competition with sewer level heat recovery reducing the potential of the latter technology because the implementation of in building heat recovery technologies can hardly be regulated being located in private buildings they emphasize that robust strategies are required for the efficient management of heat recovery along the urban water cycle other authors have highlighted the need to expand the temporal scope in order to understand the seasonal impact of these technologies on wastewater temperatures cipolla and maglionico 2014 wärff et al 2020 in addition to expanding the temporal scope of thermal hydraulic investigations studying the impacts of in building alterations for instance an energy efficiency measure or a heat recovery installation requires an additional extension of their spatial scope some authors have led network wide analyzes in the context of sewer level heat recovery abdel aal et al 2018 2019 however existing thermal hydraulic studies did not simulate the entirety of the sewer network from the household appliance to the treatment plant either because the thermal hydraulic modeling tool for instance tempest dürrenmatt and wanner 2014 did not allow to do so sitzenfrei et al 2017 or because the focus of the study did not require in building thermal hydraulic processes to be simulated e g abdel aal et al 2018 important thermal hydraulic components in upstream sections of the network are thus being overlooked or at least simplified one such component is private lateral connection pipes which connect households to public sewer lines and are hypothesized as potential hotspots for heat loss from households streams indeed the cumulated length of small and uninsulated lateral connection pipes commonly amounts up to two times the length of the public sewer network berger et al 2016 we propose a framework that allows for model based investigations across entire systems i e from wastewater sources households to sinks at which point it is finally treated wrrf the novel framework combines two modeling tools i waterhub hadengue et al 2020 for the stochastic simulation of in building thermal hydraulic processes and ii swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 a network scale thermal hydraulic model based on the well known epa swmm for the simulation of thermal hydraulics in lateral connection pipes and the public sewer network we apply this framework on a median scale swiss city located 12 km northeast of zurich the case selection was motivated by the extensive sensor network deployed in the catchment blumensaat et al 2021 providing real world temperature and flow observations for the validation of the modeling framework using this framework we evaluate i the importance of accurate simulations of private lateral connection pipes and ii the influence of in building heat recovery on wrrf temperatures through various scenario analyzes 2 materials and methods in the sections below we detail each step of the workflow developed for this study the data used for individual components of the modeling framework described hereinafter are described in table s1 of the supplementary material methodological details are separated as follows i the development of a novel framework to simulate thermal hydraulic processes in sewers with a full network perspective from the wastewater source households to the sink wrrf section 2 1 ii the calibration and validation of a model using observed data from the urban catchment of fehraltorf switzerland section 2 2 iii investigations of the influence of private lateral connections pipes connecting building drains to the public sewer network on thermal processes in sewer networks section 2 3 iv the assessment of the influence of in building shower drain heat recovery devices on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf section 2 4 the workflow allowed us to run scenario analyzes on upstream levels of the catchment households and private lateral connections and compare the results against a reference model validated with observed data 2 1 modeling framework we propose a modeling framework combining building level and network level tools to simulate the fate of wastewater temperature and flow from households to wrrfs the schematic structure of the framework is shown in fig 1 in sub model a the flow and temperature of wastewater produced by households is modeled using the waterhub modeling framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 in sub model b the outputs of sub model a i e wastewater thermal hydrographs produced by households are used as inputs to lateral connections modeled with swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 ultimately in sub model c we aggregate thermal hydrographs from the lateral connections of sub model b and set the results as input to every residential node i e the inlet of secondary sewer lines of a main network model developed in swmm heat we simulate sub models a and b with a time resolution of one second thus accounting for small frequent domestic water consumption events that are known to be important for the simulation of in building heat flows hadengue et al 2020 marini et al 2021 in sub model c a time resolution of 5 s is used to improve computational efficiency the modeling framework can be applied for the simulation of any catchment here we use it to simulate the sewer network of the municipality of fehraltorf in the canton of zurich switzerland in the following sections we provide methodological details specific to each sub model a b and c with a focus on the fehraltorf catchment 2 1 1 modeling of households sub model a we used the waterhub modeling framework for the thermal hydraulic simulation of households the framework provides i a stochastic water consumption simulation tool generating single water consumption events at one second time resolutions based on real or assumed consumption data and ii a thermal hydraulic simulation tool of domestic hot water systems in the modelica language mattsson and elmqvist 1997 the combination of these tools allows for the simulation of thermal hydrographs i e wastewater temperature and flow resolved time series of single households in this study households in fehraltorf were modeled upon a reference domestic hot water system typically found in swiss households fig 2 we simulated a basic plumbing layout four water pipes losing heat to their surroundings connected the tank boiler to appliances requiring hot water length 5 m and diameter ½ in no insulation for the stochastic simulation of water demand the hydrogen tool from the waterhub framework was used to perform poisson processes on appliance resolved consumption curves and event profiles found in the literature ableitner et al 2016 bertrand et al 2017a 2017b butler et al 1995 friedler and butler 1996 kenway et al 2012 pakula and stamminger 2014 for each appliance the consumption curves were scaled to swiss averages svgw 2015 to reflect a water consumption without outdoor uses of 136 l cap 1 d 1 for full details on the procedure we refer to descriptions of the waterhub framework hadengue et al 2019 2020 lastly we sampled the number of inhabitants from a distribution ranging from one to five provided by the federal office of statistics with a mean of 2 3 inhabitants per household bundesamt für statistik 2018 the number of households in fehraltorf was back calculated from dry weather flows provided for each residential node see section 2 1 3 assuming 2 3 inhabitants per household and a per capita consumption of 136 l d 1 bundesamt für statistik 2018 svgw 2015 the calculation resulted in 9306 inhabitants distributed in 4046 simulated households we note that these numbers are not identical to the fehraltorf census data 6500 inhabitants in 2700 households consuming an estimated 187 l cap 1 d 1 but we found that this discrepancy had only marginal consequences on the simulated flow and temperature time series in the main sewer network results are provided in the supplementary material fig s4 for comparison 2 1 2 modeling of lateral connections sub model b the foul sewage of households is transported to the public sewer network through private lateral connection pipes hereafter referred to simply as lateral connections little information is available on the hydraulic and or thermal influence of lateral connections on sewage temperatures and flow rates in public sewer lines islam et al 2012 post et al 2016 we modeled lateral connections using single stretch swmm heat models with uniform sampling for length diameter and slope characteristics to account for real world variability each lateral connection had its characteristics sampled only once and reused throughout the study the robustness of this statistical approach increases with the number of lateral connections in the system but its practicality and ability to take into account real world variability made it the preferred approach we defined sampling ranges based on the few available studies and taking the limitations of the swmm heat with regard to computational instabilities into consideration which we describe in the paragraphs below two studies have driven our range choices islam et al 2012 have collected data from surveys sent to municipalities and consulting companies in the united states canada and in the city of berlin germany as the only european city and thus topographically closer to our modeled catchment we only considered values from berlin post et al 2016 have investigated lateral connections from the hague and rotterdam in the netherlands table 1 summarizes sampling ranges used in this study in our modeling of the fehraltorf catchment lateral connection pipes were considered pvc pipes with manning s roughness coefficient equal to 0 011 cf asce 1982 we calculated pipe thicknesses to meet the requirements for drain pvc pipes pn7 5 from the norm din en 1452 1999 for lateral connections we considered a sewer headspace temperature and soil temperature of 13 c see supplementary material section 3 2 in swmm heat computational instabilities in temperature computations arise at very low water volumes in hydraulic links i e pipes see details in figueroa et al 2021 swmm heat thus sets a fixed lower volume threshold at one litre below this value the water temperature is not calculated accurate simulations of single household wastewater flows are thus difficult due to their intrinsically transient nature to overcome the challenge we introduced constraints on both input flows and model characteristics of lateral connections to maximise the water volume in hydraulic links of each lateral connection first input flows from several households were aggregated to decrease the number of zero flow periods to achieve this we generated batches of households connected to a single lateral connection based on their cumulated flow within a given batch we set when possible the cumulated flow to an amount greater than 2750 l d 1 a value found to be a good compromise to prevent low water volumes and yet provide a realistic number of households connected to each lateral connection thereby representing a multi household building on average 11 households were connected to every one of the 356 lateral connections in the catchment with a standard deviation of 2 5 households per lateral connection to further limit the impact of low flow periods we introduced a constant base flow of 0 0005 l s 1 as a lower limit for flow inputs with a temperature equal to soil temperature in this study 13 c this arbitrary base flow increased the total wastewater volume by roughly 1 which we considered negligible in the overall water balance second we constrained the spatial discretisation of lateral connection models lateral connection pipes were simulated with a maximum granularity of 15 m i e every lateral connection is split into several sections of 15 m each the shortest possible pipe being 15 m long these constraints did not prevent periods of non simulated temperature entirely but significantly increased the stability of the simulations on average 16 of the cumulative flow from households representing about 5 of the wrrf inflow could not be associated with a simulated temperature value and were thus set to soil temperature additional figures and details are provided in the supplementary material fig s1 and table s2 the soil temperature assumption stems from the reasoning that when in pipe water volumes are very small water forms a thin film at the bottom of the pipe thus maximizing heat losses due to high surface to volume ratios despite the difficulty of quantifying the uncertainty this assumption induces in our model we see it as having a negligible impact on temperatures at the treatment plant indeed the contribution of these low flow periods to the total heat budget at the wrrf is close to negligible in the order of 3 when the temperature is set to 13 c i e soil temperature around lateral connections 2 1 3 modeling the public sewer network sub model c our study focuses on the combined sewer network of fehraltorf which is equipped with sensors gathering thermal hydraulic data at high spatiotemporal resolutions blumensaat et al 2021 for our analysis we implemented sewer infrastructure data i e a link node network of 415 manholes interconnected by 412 conduits into swmm heat the gravity driven system receives two wastewater transfer flows from neighbouring municipalities rumlikon russikon see the schematic representation in fig 3 and carries those together with sewage from fehraltorf to the wrrf our study targets dry weather conditions i e it exclusively considers municipal wastewater industrial wastewater including commercial wastewater and groundwater infiltration flows transfer flows from the two adjacent municipalities account for 36 of the total wastewater inflow at the treatment plant groundwater infiltration contributes up to 15 and industrial wastewater to about 21 the rest 28 is residential wastewater from households located within the municipality of fehraltorf swmm heat is based on the widespread epa swmm hydraulic model the thermal hydraulic model computes the temperature at each time step based on a heat balance equation taking into account i conduction heat transfer at the wastewater pipe soil interface ii latent heat transfer between wastewater and sewer headspace and iii the convective heat transfer between wastewater and sewer headspace figueroa et al 2021 model parameters such as pipe material thickness diameter slope and surrounding soil thermal characteristics were set according to cadaster data or following assumptions from the literature we provide a summary of the main model parameters in the supplementary material table s3 based on observations in the fehraltorf catchment for the month of april corresponding to the calibration and validation periods see section 2 2 and additional modeling analyzes we set the soil temperature to 11 c groundwater infiltrations for lack of any data source were set equal to the soil temperature moreover motivated by observations in fehraltorf we set the sewer headspace temperature to 12 c extended details are given in the supplementary material section 3 2 other model inputs were defined as follows wastewater transfer flows we used measured thermal hydraulic time series to represent the contribution of the two neigbouring municipalities rumlikon and russikon groundwater infiltration sewer infiltration of groundwater is accounted for as spatially distributed inflow rates ranging from 0 0005 l s 1 non zero for numerical stability to 0 925 l s 1 these groundwater infiltration rates are based on night minimum flow analyzes of own measurements at the catchment boundary transfer flows f02 f03 and at the inflow of the wrrf f00 details are given in the supplementary material section 3 6 the temperature of sewer infiltration was set to a constant value according to the soil temperature industrial dischargers inflows to the industrial nodes were simulated as daily rectangular pulses with flow values ranging from 0 02 to 6 l s 1 the pulse schedule and temperature was calibrated manually see section 2 2 a textile producing company discharging hot wastewater into the public sewer constitutes an exception flow and temperature were here simulated with a rectangular pulse set to 6 l s 1 and 30 c respectively following related field measurements the daily schedule was identical to that calibrated for the other industrial contributors household wastewater flows we aggregated thermal hydraulic time series from the outputs of sub model b see section 2 1 2 for every residential node in the network water flows were summed while corresponding average temperature values were computed using a weighted mean method 2 2 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated by comparing the simulated flow and temperature curves with the observed flow and temperature at three locations along the main collector in the fehraltorf system upstream mostly residential wastewater flows midstream mixed industrial residential wastewater and at the inlet of the wrrf located downstream cf fig 3 we compared simulated with observed time series in april 2019 i e for two periods of persistent dry weather conditions 8 10th april for calibration 15 19th april for validation a period of persistent dry weather is hereby defined as a period with no runoff efficient rainfall in the preceeding 72 h until the next rain the main reasons for choosing the period of april 2019 were i non extreme but still somewhat critical wastewater temperatures for biological wastewater treatment european spring time after the cold weather period ii the occurence of two sufficiently long periods of dry weather in the same season iii the availability of consistent input and observed data with all other model parameters and inputs either derived from measurements or from cadaster data as described in section 2 1 3 we manually calibrated two remaining model parameters the daily schedule of industrial contributors including the main textile industry was calibrated such that the morning flow and corresponding temperature rise and the evening fall best fit the observations the daily schedule for the industrial rectangular pulses was thereafter set to 7 00 20 00 while settings are applied to all industrial contributors the influence of this schedule is predominent for locations downstream of the discharge point of the textile industry i e midstream and wrrf we calibrated the temperature of industrial wastewater flows such that the simulated temperature would best fit the observed temperature curves between 10 00 and 17 00 we set it to 18 c during daytime we quantified the model performance through the evaluation of absolute and relative differences between simulated and observed data for a range of flow and temperature characteristics total cumulative flow volume period average flow and temperature and 2 h average of flow and temperature during the night minimum flow period between 2 00 and 4 00 additionally we calculated one goodness of fit metric the root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr following guidelines from moriasi et al 2007 1 r s r r m s e s t d o b s i y i o b s y i s i m 2 i y i o b s y 2 here rmse refers to the root mean square error and stdobs to the standard deviation of the observations we note that april 19th a public holiday was excluded from the goodness of fit assessment since the model only reflects flow and temperature patterns from typical weekdays for the following scenario analyzes we refer to the validated model describing the status quo uniquely as the reference model 2 3 influence of lateral connections using the reference model as a basis we evaluated the influence of changing properties of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in this regard we simulated didactical scenarios with lateral connections of incrementally increasing lengths for the validation period 15 19th april 2019 starting at 0 m no lateral connection i e direct discharge from household to the public sewer network we systematically increased the length of the 356 lateral connections in fehraltorf in steps of 15 m 0 15 30 45 60 m this corresponds to an incremental increase in the total sewer network length from 17 06 km 0 m in 5 25 km steps 15 m up to 38 06 km 60 m as a comparison the reference model total length is 27 56 km 17 06 km main network 10 5 km lateral connections at each step we compared flow and temperature characteristics described in section 2 2 with results from the reference model from these characteristics we derived the temperature changes induced by the varying lateral connection lengths 2 4 in building heat recovery to investigate the influence of in building heat recovery technologies on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf we modified the household model described in section 2 1 1 through the addition of a shower drain heat recovery device a commercially available technology used for the preheating of cold water streams using shower drain water the heat recovery model implemented is a spatially discretized counter flow heat exchanger with 10 ideally mixed nodes its effective heat recovery potential for the preheating of cold water from shower drain water is 8 10 kw comparable to commercially available devices joulia 2017 the heat exchanger cools down shower drain water by roughly 12 14 k and transfers heat to the cold water stream typically heating up by more than 20 k for more details on the heat exchanger model and discussion of its performance we refer to the publication by hadengue et al 2020 we investigated various spatially randomized market penetration levels 25 50 75 and 100 of the 4046 households located in fehraltorf as described in section 2 1 3 these households are responsible for 28 of the total wastewater inflow at the wrrf under the assumption that wastewater flows from rumlikon and russikon consist only of residential 85 and groundwater infiltration 15 sources implementing these heat recovery technologies in fehraltorf thus influences at most only 50 of the total number of households in the whole catchment in the 100 market penetration scenario similar to the lateral connection scenarios the flow and temperature characteristics described in 2 2 were compared to results from the reference model 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation we assessed the performance of the entire modeling framework by comparing the output of sub model c with flow rates and temperatures measured at several locations along with the main collector in the pilot catchment upstream midstream and at the wrrf see fig 3 with this we provide spatially differentiated evidence of the model s ability to reflect the thermal hydraulic dynamics of wastewater within a real world sewer network 3 1 1 results qualitative evaluation the results indicate that simulated sewage flows and temperatures follow closely the dynamics observed during dry weather conditions fig 4 diurnal flow dynamics i e morning peak mid day valley and lower evening peak are precisely reproduced at all three different locations along the main collector observed and simulated temperature time series show a slightly different and less consistent pattern while the upstream location represents a typical residential dominated peak valley peak pattern the midstream and wrrf locations show the impact of industrial wastewater flows estimated through a rectangular pulse temperature pattern we note that for the upstream location dominated by residential wastewater flows morning peak temperatures are overestimated by 4 5 k further downstream at the inflow of the wrrf this overestimation is still visible although less pronounced interestingly a clear mismatch between observed and simulated time series appears on friday april 19th 2019 as it was a public holiday industries were thus not operating and it is likely that water consumption habits were not identical to typical working days see fig 4b this operational shutdown is deliberately left unconsidered in the model for the first four days of the validation period april 15 to 18th representing typical weekdays however we report an overall match between simulated and observed time series 3 1 2 results quantitative evaluation as reported in table 2 the selected flow and temperature characteristics confirm the visual match in the validation period simulations yield an average flow within 1 of the observed data at the wrrf with a deviation of only 0 27 l s 1 at the two upstream locations though simulations overestimate the average flow by over 12 mostly due to the overestimation of the morning peak simulated night minimum flows primarily driven by groundwater infiltration fall within 15 of the observed values at the wrrf 19 90 versus 23 14 l s 1 in terms of temperature both simulated average temperature and simulated night minimum temperature fall within 0 5 k at most 2 9 relative deviation of the observed values at all three locations rsr values confirm the satisfactory fit for flow dynamics range 0 51 0 76 the goodness of fit regarding temperature dynamics is less good range 0 68 1 32 but these values are heavily biased by the morning peak overestimation indeed ignoring the 06 00 10 00 morning period we find a satisfactory performance of the model with a rsr range of 0 63 1 03 the full results are available in the supplementary material table s4 3 1 3 discussion diurnal dynamics we consider the validated model to be a viable reference case for the analyzes presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 below we adequately simulate flow and temperature dynamics at three different locations in the catchment with reasonable rsr values and flow and temperature characteristics falling within acceptable ranges when compared with observed data nevertheless the discrepancy with regard to morning peak temperatures requires a thorough discussion causes for the morning peak temperature overestimation are assumed to be manifold first the peak is a consequence of the hot morning showers simulated in the waterhub sub model a showering patterns from the literature see section 2 1 1 represent showering habits of a different spatio temporal context 1987 butler et al 1995 friedler and butler 1996 although these curves represent to our knowledge some of the best available data it is likely that they do not adequately reflect the current showering habits in fehraltorf second the model simulates showers as ideal processes i e no evaporation or heat losses however a side study using the empirical heat loss model developed by wong et al 2010 and used in other studies sitzenfrei et al 2017 showed no significant reduction in the morning peak temperature indicating that in shower processes are not major drivers of morning peak discrepancy further details are available in the supplementary material fig s3 third the latent heat transfer evaporation model part of swmm heat is likely to yield inaccurate results in the extreme case of low flow small pipes with large temperature gradients like shower drain water entering a lateral connection pipe more details are available in the description of swmm heat figueroa et al 2021 it is not possible to quantify the error induced by the evaporation model but it may explain part of the overestimation of morning shower peak temperatures finally we are likely to underestimate the number of lateral connections present in fehraltorf constraints imposed on the simulation of lateral connections see section 2 1 2 led to on average 11 households connected to one connection pipe a large number of connected households means a reduction in the influence of heat transfer processes in lateral connections on the network thermal hydraulics 3 2 influence of lateral connections we assessed the influence of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in sewer networks by comparing the reference case to five scenarios of varying lateral connection lengths starting at zero no lateral connections residential wastewater flows directly into the sewer network we increased the length of connections in 15 m steps up to 60 m 3 2 1 results influence of lateral connections fig 5 shows the resulting temperature distributions at the wrrf for april 15 18 2019 contrary to pure hydraulic considerations where peripheral elements are generally considered less relevant lateral connections appear to have a significant influence on the temperature the average temperature at the wrrf increases by 0 8 k in the scenario without lateral connections when all households in fehraltorf are equipped with relatively short lateral sewers 15 m the difference in average temperature with the reference case drops to 0 2 k the average temperature at the wrrf asymptotically decreases further with increasing length results from fig 5 are in line with our understanding of basic physical processes driving heat dispersion dynamics in pipes first lateral sewers are smaller and thinner than main sewers thus increasing heat transfer to the surrounding soil when the difference between bulk liquid and soil temperature is large which is often the case with incoming household wastewater second wastewater inflow rates are usually small with high surface to volume ratios thin films of water and thus further increasing heat transfer to surrounding media it is thus no surprise that taking lateral connections into account is critical to obtain accurate simulations of wastewater temperatures in sewer networks 3 2 2 discussion realistic lateral connection models the lack of catchment specific data for water consumption building types and lateral connection characteristics makes a thorough validation of the household and lateral connection models impossible we therefore cannot draw quantitative conclusions about the real influence of lateral connection on a sewer network s thermal hydraulic processes rather the objective of this study is to alert to the importance of providing realistic physically based simulations of lateral connections when performing network scale thermal hydraulic investigations we note that the influence of lateral connections on thermal hydraulic processes depends largely on the i seasonal ii temporal and ii spatial context of the catchment i seasonal context a clear limitation of our study is to focus on a single week in april 2019 although seasonal effects are expected to modify heat transfer processes due to varying in sewer headspace air soil and groundwater temperatures we speculate however that the influence of lateral connections on wrrf temperatures would increase in winter due to the larger temperature gradients between wastewater and soil and thus coincide with critically low wastewater temperatures at the wrrf in contrast in summer when wastewater temperatures are not critical their influence would decrease due to generally lower temperature gradients this discussion is closely linked to the thermal damping effect in lateral connections discussed in section 3 3 3 ii temporal context wet weather periods may lead to increased groundwater infiltration rates in addition to additional runoff water thus modifying the relative importance of lateral connections in the total heat budget lastly during weekends we may expect different water consumption behaviors and a reduced influence from industrial flows further modifying contributions to the total heat budget at the wrrf iii spatial context descriptions of lateral connection characteristics slope depth diameter length surrounding media etc are scarce in the literature however they were shown to vary widely from location to location islam et al 2012 post et al 2016 topographical specificities of the catchment under investigation may thus strongly influence analyzes like the one presented here extending our investigations to consider alternate spatiotemporal contexts goes beyond the scope of this study nevertheless the discussion above highlights the importance of simulating lateral connections realistically when investigating thermal processes in sewer networks we emphasize this further by acknowledging that results from fig 5 are overall likely to underestimate heat losses in lateral connections first the scenarios presented with varying lateral connection lengths affect only residential wastewater in the fehraltorf catchment i e only 28 of the total inflow to the wrrf we can thus infer that in catchments with smaller industrial wastewater or groundwater infiltration flow rates lateral connections have an increased influence on the network s thermal hydraulic processes second as described in section 3 1 3 the number and total length of lateral connections in the model is likely lower than in reality given that typical lengths are within the same range as the total length of the public sewer network results from fig 5 may thus underestimate the real influence of lateral connections on wastewater temperatures in the sewer network 3 3 influence of in building heat recovery 3 3 1 results influence of in building heat recovery as shown in fig 6 shower level heat recovery influences mean wastewater temperatures at the wrrf inflow only marginally when 25 of the fehraltorf households are equipped with the technology the mean temperature drops by less than 0 1 k the drop increases to 0 3 k in the 100 market penetration scenario although average temperatures are not significantly influenced by shower level heat recovery we observe an impact on temperature distribution shapes the high temperature but less frequent peaks are shaved off reducing the temperature range maximum temperatures in the reference case reach roughly 20 c whereas maximum temperatures in the 100 market penetration scenario remain well below 18 c these results tend to disagree with the scarce literature on the topic sitzenfrei et al 2017 for instance report a maximum temperature decrease of 1 2 1 3 k at the wrrf after the installation of in building heat recovery devices in the catchment upstream with 100 market penetration in this regard we discuss important perspectives to challenge and explain our results in sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 below 3 3 2 discussion catchment context in the fehraltorf catchment and during the dry weather period in april 2019 under consideration we estimate that 21 of wastewater inflows at the wrrf stem from industrial or commercial sources and 15 from groundwater infiltrations these flows both contribute significantly to the overall heat budget when neglecting industrial inflows in our simulations the average temperature at the wrrf drops by 1 3 k from 14 8 to 13 5 c for the reference case the prominent role of industrial wastewater flows in the fehraltorf catchment may not reflect typical spatial contexts of other catchments it may thus appear reasonable to infer that this context explains the limited impact of in building heat recovery on wrrf temperatures this is however not the case the average temperature difference between the reference case and the 100 market penetration scenario simulated without industrial sources is 0 3 k identical to the difference of 0 3 k reported when considering industrial wastewater echoing the discussion from section 3 2 2 we argue as other authors do that a thorough assessment of the spatio temporal context of a given catchment is critical for accurate assessments of thermal hydraulic alterations to the system kollmann et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2016 neugebauer et al 2015 3 3 3 discussion thermal damping we have seen that specificities of the fehraltorf catchment do not explain results from fig 6 indeed regardless of the catchment context lateral connections and secondary sewer lines of the network are major heat sinks and thus act as thermal dampers because of the non linearity of heat transfer rates to the surrounding soil emphasized by the magnitude of heat losses in small uninsulated pipes a thermal alteration to the heat budget of households e g heat recovery is not propagated linearly into the heat budget of the wrrf located downstream this is clearly visible in the total heat budget difference between the reference case and the 100 market penetration scenario fig 7 at household level the difference is 16 8 mwh over the course of four typical weekdays april 15 18 2019 this value reflects the amount of heat recovered with shower level heat exchangers and represents a 16 reduction in the heat demand of households in line with estimates from the literature e g kenway et al 2019 estimate a 22 energy reduction for hot water production at the outlet of lateral connections the difference is 11 3 mwh decreasing by 33 due to the non linearity of heat transfer processes in lateral connection pipes lastly at the inflow of the wrrf the heat budget difference is 8 0 mwh less than half the difference at household level in other words the thermal damping induced by lateral connections mostly and the sewer network significantly reduces the influence of in building heat recovery technologies on wastewater temperatures at the wrrf we thus anticipate in building heat recovery to have significantly fewer adverse effects than centralized heat recovery strategies upstream of treatment plants for the same amount of recovered heat on water treatment processes in wrrfs in the case of fehraltorf if we neglect thermal damping effects entirely and simply reduce the heat budget at the inflow of the wrrf by 16 8 mwh i e the effective amount of heat recovered in households upstream the average temperature at the wrrf would decrease by approximately 0 9 k compared to 0 3 k as reported in fig 6 this temperature drop is much closer to the 0 8 k decrease reported by sitzenfrei et al 2017 in a similar market penetration scenario i e the 60 market penetration scenario whereas these authors have concluded that in building heat recovery may lead to large performance drops in centralized heat recovery systems and water treatment processes we argue that thermal damping from lateral connections largely mitigates this risk the accurate assessment of thermal alterations at building level thus relies on the detection and quantification of thermal damping effects stemming from lateral connections and secondary sewer lines 4 conclusion the thermal hydraulic modeling framework proposed adequately reproduces the evolution of wastewater temperatures from the source households to the sink wrrf in a real world catchment the framework allows systemic investigations of thermal hydraulic modifications made to the system for instance heat recovery from wastewater or changes in water consumption behaviors by taking into account the full catchment context we used it to explore the influence of in building heat recovery devices implementing shower heat recovery in 50 of the households in the swiss municipality of fehraltorf reduced the heat demand of the targeted households by 16 during the spring period studied the consequent wastewater temperature decrease at the wrrf inflow was 0 3 k in comparison a large scale in sewer heat recovery strategy at the wrrf inflow is estimated to decrease the wastewater average temperature by up to 0 9 k for the same amount of recovered heat we identified lateral connections connecting households to the public sewer network as hotspots for heat loss to the environment and thus major drivers of wastewater temperatures in the sewer network downstream lateral connections act as major thermal dampers thermal alterations in households are not propagated linearly in the system downstream in this context heat recovery targeting high temperature wastewater flows in the household does not significantly impact temperatures downstream such impacts are considerably smaller than in sewer heat recovery applications due to the large variability in lateral connection characteristics and the lack of publicly available information on this infrastructure further research is required to support this finding we argue for an adaptive flexible and location dependent integration of heat recovery technologies in areas where households are not the only contributors to wastewater entering the wrrf we encourage the recovery of heat at the source where recovery is technically easier and where the impact on wastewater temperatures and thus on wastewater treatment is minimized declaration of competing interest the authors

16629,co2 exchanges across the water air interface in rivers and lakes are currently believed to be responsible for the dominant share of global aquatic co2 emissions the gas transfer velocity k600 is the key factor that constrains the co2 fluxes it is also the most problematic to establish because of its high spatial and temporal variability here we have evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics in k600 values and their physical and chemical controlling processes by gas tracer and floating chamber fc methods in three reaches of a low gradient stream channel guancun surface stream gss in a karst terrain in subtropical southwestern china in december 2016 and march july and september 2017 the k600 values were highly variable in space and time in this small stream physical processes including the velocity of the stream and its slope were found to control the variations of k600 the k600 values recorded in the dry season march and december were at minimal levels due to very slow flow and gentle slope and were also affected by complexation in the solute enriched waters the characteristics high ph and low turbulence of gentle streams in carbonate karst areas are conducive to such complexation which is of great significance in the limiting co2 degassing in such regions we have obtained the first k600 prediction model for small streams in subtropical karst regions in conclusion we present a comprehensive approach for predicting the k600 values in small channels by comparison of independent sf6 gas tracer and floating chamber methods graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords co2 transfer velocity seasonal and spatial variations physical processes chemical enhancement low gradient stream karst areas 1 introduction the importance of the output of carbon from aquatic systems has been emphasized in terrestrial carbon balance assessments at a range of spatial and temporal scales richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 dinsmore et al 2010 carbon transferred from terrestrial sources into aquatic systems is largely 1 stored in accumulations of sediments or 2 exported downstream or 3 taken up as co2 that is released into the atmosphere by degassing sawakuchi et al 2017 show that more than half of the terrestrial carbon entering rivers and streams is degassed into the atmosphere in addition open streams are the primary outlets for groundwater that will often carry larger amounts of dissolved gases co2 ch4 rn etc generating excess degassing because of the big differences between their concentrations in the water and the open atmosphere therefore accurate quantification of stream channel co2 emission is a key part of regional carbon budgeting at present many methods can be used to estimate the co2 flux including the floating chamber method fc thin boundary layer method tbl and gas tracer method plus micrometeorological and remote sensing inversion methods unesco ihaghg 2010 however due to the differences in the monitoring techniques the environments and research objectives none of them are perfect the tbl method is currently the most widely used due to its simplicity and rapidity calculating the flux using semi empirical equations based on pco2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide and co2 transfer velocity k600 unesco ihaghg 2010 pco2 one of the two key parameters in these equations is much more straightforward to measure in aquatic system than the k600 value which is neither simple nor direct due to the highly varying nature of correlating factors e g wind wanninkhof et al 2009 alin et al 2011 waves ulseth et al 2019 surfactants salter et al 2011 heat flux berg and pace 2017 penetrative convection crill et al 1988 and surface turbulence etc zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 the k 600 value thus depends on the complicated hydrographic features of a river channel wallin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 rather than pco2 it directly determines the magnitude of co2 flux across the water air interface and thus the accuracy of its estimation requires special attention raymond and cole 2001 wallin et al 2011 it is well recognized that turbulence drives gas exchange at the water air interface as a consequence k 600 model estimates in streams are often based on turbulence related geomorphic and hydraulic variables zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 the channel slope is considered to be the primary hydraulic property controlling gas exchange with the velocity of flow being secondary because of its dependence on the combination of channel slope and channel topography tsivoglou and neal 1976 classically k600 has been modeled as a function of current velocity and channel slope alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 hall and ulseth 2020 in addition many models have attempted to predict k600 using width depth index w d wallin et al 2011 discharge width q w liu et al 2017 and or stream depth d raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 for a variety of streams and large rivers all with varying success more comprehensive hydraulic analyses have incorporated the reynolds number froude number and stream bed roughness raymond et al 2012 long et al 2015 additionally the relationship between energy dissipation rates turbulence and k600 has been established by estimation or direct measurement of the former zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 hall and ulseth 2020 although a series of physical and empirical equations describing relationships between k600 and stream hydraulics have been developed the high residual variation in k600 due to the highly temporally and spatially variable show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations for a single stream what methods to use is still a great challenge to predict the k600 values accurately which also constrains the scaling k600 values are most often considered to be controlled by physical processes but the biological respiration and chemical reactions should also be considered when estimating gas exchange rates hall and ulseth 2020 these metabolic processes contribute some fraction of greenhouse gas release from flowing water and result in a clear link between metabolism and gas flux hotchkiss et al 2015 however the effect of respiration is likely negligible because the time scale over which gas exchange is measured is much shorter than that which is pertains to respiration duvert et al 2018 in contrast the chemically reactive co2 can bypass the rate limiting molecular diffusion step by reacting in the boundary layer wanninkhof and knox 1996 the reaction time constants being of the same order of magnitude as the transfer time of the co2 molecules from the liquid boundary layer to the air schulz et al 2006 therefore chemical reaction is also important for co2 exchange however the influence of chemical enhancement on the prediction of k600 values is still poorly understood there are 3066 subterranean rivers with an annual natural water resource of about 18 08 billion m3 in china and 736 karst springs with a discharge of more than 100 l s in guangxi zhuang autonomous region china yuan et al 1991 in karst areas many surface streams headwaters are groundwater stream continuum because they are only fed by a karst spring or a subterranean stream pu et al 2019 which represents important sources of carbon dioxide co2 in addition the groundwater stream continuum is a hot spot for carbon emissions because it possibly change the carbon balance of the aquatic and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems oviedo vargas et al 2015 looman et al 2016 pu et al 2017 duvert et al 2018 at present research on k600 values is concentrated chiefly in tropical and temperate regions and less on streams in subtropical or specifically in karstic areas from a carbon cycle perspective karst streams have notably higher dic and pco2 than others and affected by seasonality in precipitation may have higher k600 values li et al 2018 however the lack of a reference k600 values and its monitoring methods restricts the accurate estimation of co2 flux in the groundwater stream continuum of karst areas especially some evidences from china li et al 2018 therefore to reveal the characteristics of spatiotemporal variation and its physical and chemical controls on k600 values and to explore the appropriate k600 prediction method in a typical low order headstream four experiments with different monitoring strategies were undertaken in three reaches of karst stream channel using gas tracer and floating chamber methods 2 study area the guancun surface

each experiment as a first step two blank water samples were collected glass bottle 63 ml with reverse rubber stoppers at each site to determine the background value of sf6 the mixed tracer was then poured into the stream water at g1 thirty water samples were collected at each monitoring site at appropriate time intervals as the conductivity rose reached a peak value and receded to background value the sealed glass sampling bottles were completely immersed 10 cm under the water surfaces to fill them without leaving bubbles all samples were packed upside down to prevent air leakage and transported to the laboratory sf6 was separated from the water by the headspace balance method 20 ml argon gas was injected into the water sample and the same volume of water sample discharged the

injection approach to determining k600 sf 6 k600 after the tracer was injected at 0 min the starting time the sf6 concentration in the stream in all four experiments decreased linearly with time along

throughout the year discharge q showed the same seasonal variations as the velocity of flow but with the different spatial trend r3 r2 r1 water depth d in r2 and r3 showed a clear pattern september july march december that was correlated with the rainfall the water depth of r1 was lower than that in r2 and r3 in december march and june but there was a significant increase in september and it was

and εd displayed the trend r2 r1 r3 but it was r2 r3 r1 in the case of re table 2 4 5 model description we revisited many key parameters of equations cited in the literature and fitted them with the k600 values obtained by fc and sf6 injection approach using linear and multiple regression analyses three groups of seven fitting equations with six main parameters were set up the first group used velocity and slope terms models 1 and 2 table 3 the second utilized slope velocity and stream width models 3 and 4 and the final three velocity slope discharge and depth models 5 7 we found that three general types of models did an adequate performance in predicting k600 discussed in detail below 5 discussion 5 1 physicochemical processes controlling k600 5 1 1 physical processes as channel slope increases more turbulent mixing leads to water surface replacement and increase in the gas exchange rates tsivoglou and neal 1976 wallin et al 2011 hall and madinger 2018 from the spatiotemporal perspective slope is more often used to explain the spatial changes rather than the temporal changes compared to model 1 model 2 that included channel slope showed a decrease in r2 in sf6 injection and the floating chamber this is probably due to the limited variations in channel slope along the gss indicating that the effect of slope may be small in the seasonal variations of k600 in a single low order flow generally discharge q controls k600 because water velocity and depth vary with changing discharge in a stream if its channel cross section remains constant i e k600 may increase with increasing discharge because this increases the velocity in a simple stream maurice et al 2017 mcdowell and johnson 2018 however both the k600 values obtained from sf6 injection and fc basically decreased with the increase of discharge and water velocity through the models 5 6 and 7 in group 3 table 3 similarly models 6 and 7 with a water depth term d predicted an increase in the k600 values however this is contrary to theory of turbulent dissipation that k600 should decrease with increasing depth raymond et al 2012 therefore although our predictive models including water depth and or discharge improved r2 and decreased the error of our predictions of k600 depth and discharge were not used to predict gas exchange although based on the theory we believe that they should models 3 is consistent with the dissipation theory in which the k600 values decrease with increasing water depth however the velocity of flow can explain 69 and 72 of the variance in k600 measured by sf6 and fc approaches respectively and no variations for fc approach occurred in models 3 and 4 with the water depth and width terms added in contrast model 4 with its water depth and width terms yielded the highest variance 88 in k600 measured by the sf6 approach however this is also contrary to theory of turbulent dissipation clearly for sf6 and fc approaches the strongest correlations both came from models that included a flow velocity term generally these empirical models have large prediction errors even within a catchment much of the k600 variation is not explained by slope and velocity wallin et al 2011 hall and ulseth 2020 i e while the models may display low parameter error due to there being many data points there is much residual error in figs 5a 5b and 6 the residuals from these predict models are close to being normally distributed and are random with respect to the fitted values the models that include velocity of flow best explain the k600 value indicating that the gas transfer rate may be mainly controlled by this variable in gss which is also consistent with the leading role of εd even though the effect of slope may be weakened 5 1 2 chemical processes the role of chemical reactions enhancing co2 gas exchanges across the water air interface has been widely explored e g bolin 1960 hoover and berkshire 1969 keller 1994 wanninkhof and knox 1996 the hydration reactions of co2 with hydroxide ions and water molecules in the boundary layer serve to steepen the concentration gradient of the gas and so reduce the effective depth of the mass boundary layer thus leading to an enhancement in the transfer velocity smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 komori et al 2011 generally hydration of co2 is a relatively slow process and its enhancement is thought to be important only when turbulent forcing is weak and as a consequence the amount of time available for transport across the mass boundary layer is relatively large strong chemical enhancement of mass flux is also associated with higher ph conditions hoover and berkshire 1969 smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 for example the enhancements can be ten or more times above the unenhanced flux in individual freshwater systems with high ph and low wind speeds emerson 1975 smith 1985 in summary the chemical enhancement co2 is dependent upon ph and the stagnant layer thickness the gss is a typical karst low order stream with relatively high ph 7 72 0 18 and low turbulent forcing so the chemical enhancement of co2 may play an important role except for that of keller 1994 all the models utilize the stagnant boundary layer model keller 1994 found that chemical enhancement in the stagnant boundary model is slightly less than in a film replacement model danckwerts 1970 we chose to use the h b model established by hoover and berkshire 1969 for calculating the chemical enhancement factor α because of its simplicity and relative accuracy this model is a function of the stagnant layer thickness the ph the co2 molecular diffusivity rate and co2 hydration rate the chemical enhancement factor for the h b model can be expressed as hoover and berkshire 1969 wanninkhof and knox 1996 14 α t t 1 tan fz fz with 15 f r t d m 1 0 5 16 r k c o 2 k o h o h 17 t 1 α h 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 α h 18 z d m k 1 where k c o 2 is the hydration rate constant for the reaction c o 2 h 2 o h hco 3 s l k o h is the rate constant for reaction c o 2 o h hco 3 l mol s α h is the activity coefficient for the hydrogen ion 10 ph d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient for co2 1 6 10 5 cm2 s k 1 and k 2 are the first and second apparent dissociation constants for carbonic acid table 4 and z is the stagnant layer thickness table 4 gordon et al 2004 from table 4 the averaged chemical enhancement factor values α are 1 44 0 13 2 93 0 73 1 005 0 002 and 1 001 0 002 respectively in december march july and september in the gss spatially the chemical enhancement factor α maintained the trend r1 r2 r3 throughout the year with averaged values of 1 41 0 60 for r1 1 59 0 83 for r2 and 1 78 1 31 for r3 increasing turbulence should decrease the stagnant layer thickness and thus accelerate gas flux smith 1985 therefore the influence chemical enhancement is almost negligible in july and september because the stagnant layer thickness is smaller due to the greater turbulence table 2 combining with the lower ph in contrast such enhancement plays an important role in the dry season due to the thicker stagnant layer and higher ph therefore chemical enhancement is controlled by the high ph and thick stagnant layer in gss which is consistent with previous conclusions a similar phenomenon also appears in the chemical enhancement variations in the river reaches table 4 our measured chemical reinforcement of co2 exchanges in gss also follows the h b theory being significantly enhanced at low gas transfer velocities but not at high gas transfer speeds according to the calculated results of enhancement in gss the k600 values obtained by the sf6 method were undoubtedly overestimated in march and december due to obviously higher α with 2 93 0 73 and 1 44 0 13 but not by the fc method table 4 this is also consistent with the finding that the k600 values measured by the sf6 method are greater than those by the fc method table 1 although chemical enhancement has a minor effect on sea air gas exchange of co2 under average oceanic turbulence conditions and is not significant to the global co2 flux in that situation wanninkhof and knox 1996 its influences cannot be neglected in certain regions for example the calculated co2 enhancement amounts to 4 8 of the total exchange in the equatorial co2 source regions wanninkhof and knox 1996 the effect could be as high as 15 regionally around the atlantic and up to 27 on a basin scale keller 1994 by contrast this effect may play more important role in alkaline closed basin lakes river basins with low turbulence and high biological productivity and other sheltered and quiet regions hoover and berkshire 1969 smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 for example hoover and berkshire 1969 found that the predicted chemical enhancement of co2 exchange rates at high ph of 6 5 are 10 76 higher than the unenhanced rates in the wind tunnel experiments even this enhancement is ubiquitous in the alkaline closed basin lakes and up to 300 wanninkhof and knox 1996 in the specific case of co2 there can be a strong chemical enhancement of mass flux associated with ph and thickness of boundary layer generally the ph of water bodies in karst areas is high schuler et al 2020 and the slope of low channel streams is small which both are conducive to chemical enhancement therefore in low channel streams in karst areas we must not only pay attention to the physical processes controlling co2 transfer velocities but also consider the effects of chemical enhancement 5 2 the applicability of the fc and sf6 injection approaches the gas tracer and floating chamber are the two main approaches to quantifying the k600 value in streams campeau et al 2014 natchimuthu et al 2017 kokic et al 2018 however they are not suitable for all types of stream channels and discharge conditions because both have their limitations for example the uneven mixing and operational complexity of gas tracer methods constrain their application in large and deep rivers clark et al 1995 kokic et al 2018 for low order streams however the use of a volatile gas tracer has been the chief means of estimating k600 due to its ease of operation kokic et al 2018 in addition this method has the further advantage of estimating k600 over a stream reach at a similar spatial scale to that of the turnover length of the gas in question hall and ulseth 2020 sf6 is usually used as a tracer because it is biologically and chemically inert in water so the only factor governing its concentration in surface waters is physical exchange with the atmosphere the fc method is widely used in the study of k600 at the water air interface due to its ease of operation and precise measurements however this method also limits the accurate estimation of k600 values because it forms a microenvironment within the chamber that may alter turbulence at the water air interface cole et al 2010 more specifically this microenvironment dampens the influence of wind and other factors affecting the boundary layer thereby inhibiting the gas transfer in turbulent environments matthews et al 2003 to the contrary however fc physical disturbance of the boundary layer may act to enhance gas transfer on calm water bodies the mode of deployment of floating chambers is also debatable kokic et al 2018 the drifting chamber is best deployed for larger and deeper streams and rivers because the water surface is more homogeneous but in environments with weak currents in the water but with high winds it is necessary to anchor the chamber frankignoulle et al 1996 lorke et al 2015 found that anchored chambers can disturb the in stream turbulence which in turn enhances k600 estimates in stream studies the floating chamber that drifts on the water surface can generate gas fluxes up to five times higher than in chambers whose walls extend to some depth into the water truly isolating the trapped air matthews et al 2003 therefore in this study we extended the chamber walls down approximately 3 cm into the water additionally we added heat insulation material to the chamber and placed the battery fuel outside of it to reduce the impact of temperature rise to monitor the co2 concentration changes in real time and reduce human interference and errors we used the online monitoring instrument egm5 pp systems usa connected to the floating chamber with tygon tubing in a closed loop floating chambers can potentially receive co2 by both diffusive flux and by ebullition bubbling if bubbles enter the chamber midway through a run the co2 concentration will increase suddenly matthews et al 2003 from fig 7 the increases in co2 concentration were relatively stable and the slope of the concentration increase over time were straight with no apparent disturbance occurring throughout any of the monitoring it should be noted that ulseth et al 2019 found that switching from turbulent diffusive to bubble mediated exchange may occur at k600 150 cm h in streams similarly the maximum k600 without bubble entrainment was 150 cm h in the experiments in laboratory flumes moog and jirka 1999 the k600 values we obtained with the fc and sf6 methods are much lower than this threshold table 1 finally the slope of gss is less than 0 005 and the velocity of flow is very low 0 14 m s in march and december the white water associated with fast turbulent flow standing waves etc was rarely seen fig s1 therefore we believe that the influence of bubbles in gss is small except for bubbles the selection of the n value in the eq 7 may affect the accuracy of the sf6 injection method when the boundary layer approximates by a smooth surface with very little wind n 0 67 in contrast n 0 5 is adopted for a rough water surface at moderate wind speeds jähne et al 1987 although the wind speed is low at the gss the water surface tends to be rough due to the influence of stream slope and turbulence a single value of 0 5 represents somewhat extreme conditions unlikely to occur in this particular environment matthews et al 2003 therefore we chose n 0 57 0 07 to recalculate conditions typically found in small ponds with slightly roughened surfaces clark et al 1995 however this range of only 5 is not enough to span the difference between k600 estimates based on the fc and sf6 approaches overall excluding the influence of air bubbles and the selection of n values sf6 worked well as a gas exchange tracer in small water bodies and we have a high level of confidence in the k600 values determined by the method although the anchored chamber method may overestimate k600 in the gss with its relatively calm waters we chose it for research due to the narrow shallow nature of the channel and the lush aquatic vegetation in it on the whole the k600 values measured by fc and sf6 show significant positive correlation are of the same magnitude and consistent with each other when the turbulence was very small in march and december the k600 obtained by the anchored fc may be overestimated due to the anchored fc will enhance the in stream turbulence lorke et al 2015 however the k600 values obtained by the anchored fc were much smaller than those measured from sf6 method indicating the chemical reactions occurring in the floating chamber but not in sf6 gas tracer in contrast the decreased thickness of the boundary layer due to greater turbulence in july and september resulted in reduced chemical complexation the k600 values obtained by the fc method were greater than those of the sf6 method therefore the fc method can determine the range of variations of k600 values in the gss the upper limit and lower limits in addition it can represent the effects of chemical complexation at low wind speeds in low order streams very well in karst areas the sf6 method can better capture the physical processes that affect the k600 values as the gas moves with the flowing water to generalize where there are no measured values we can now approximate k600 values for low order streams in karst areas with high confidence 5 3 the comparatively low gas exchange velocities of low energy channels in karst areas here we use only the fc k600 results because as shown they can be taken to measure both the upper and the lower limits of gas transfer along the gss as expected k600 values were relatively low with an average of 5 83 7 73 m d these k600 values are equivalent to the values of other low energy streams reported by raymond et al 2012 the k600 values reported for alpine ulseth et al 2019 subalpine peter et al 2014 schelker et al 2016 and other streams with steep channel slopes maurice et al 2017 hall and madinger 2018 mcdowell and johnson 2018 are much higher than the gss values being 5 90 times greater in contrast however the gss k600 values are five times greater than reported in the oceans three to fifteen times greater than in ponds and lakes wanninkhof et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 holgerson and raymond 2016 overall the averaged k600 value of this low order stream in a sub tropical karst area is at the same level as other reported low order channel flows elsewhere but is at a relatively high level in comparison with many other water bodies around the world as emphasized above it is the turbulence that drives gas exchange at the water air interface in streams and most rivers tsivoglou and neal 1976 ulseth et al 2019 hall and ulseth 2020 as a proxy for turbulence the energy dissipation rate εd is often used to scale and predict the gas exchange raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 used breakpoint regression to analyze the simple linear relationships between εd and k600 across hundreds of streams having a wide range of geomorphological and hydraulic characteristics a nonlinear relationship between ln k600 and ln εd was found where ln k600 3 10 0 35 ln εd for εd 0 02 m2 s3 and ln k600 6 43 1 18 95 ci 1 10 1 30 ln εd for εd 0 02 m2 s3 adopting these values 78 of the variability in k600 in all of the streams was explained by the εd from fig 8 a significant linear relationship between the k600 and εd was found in gss which conforms to the linear relationship defined by ulseth et al 2019 when εd 0 02 m2 s3 however the k600 values of the gss also fall within the k600 range reported by raymond et al 2012 the turbulence εs greatly increases due to bed friction when εd 0 02 m2 s3 and probably forms bubbles to improve gas exchange rates ulseth et al 2019 clearly εd in the gss is much less than 0 02 m2 s3 so the gas exchange rates were less affected by bubbles to generalize although significant temporal and spatial differences were found in the gss k600 values those values still fall within the wider range reported by raymond et al 2012 for other low order streams and rivers and also follow the linear relationship between k600 and εd recorded in the latter therefore no matter the differing regional climatic geomorphic etc constraints it is the turbulence that always drives k600 variations in river systems for an individual or particular type of stream or river however the characteristics of the study site must be considered in any k600 investigation hall and ulseth 2020 for example in the low order stream in a karst area that was selected for this study the gss although the co2 transfer velocity was controlled by the turbulence it was also much affected by chemical complexation in the high concentrations of solutes in the water especially during the steady conditions of the dry season in particular these co2 exchange velocities in recorded in the gss in march and december are among the lowest reported for stream and river ecosystem as the results plotted in fig 8 show very clearly of course the model obtained from the gss may be constrained by the small size of this system and so may not predict results in larger rivers in karst areas raymond et al 2012 liu et al 2017 wallin et al 2018 however here we provide a usable k600 value predictive model to determine the credible range of k600 values in low gradient channels in carbonate karst areas we also enlarge the scope for predicting co2 exchange velocities in low gradient channels in karst and other areas by employing and comparing the gas tracer method with the fc method to verify each other 6 conclusion in general gas exchange rates in streams can display high variability spatially and temporally due to the variations occurring in the slope depth and velocity of the water flow the high variability is strongly related to measures of εd at these spatiotemporal scales as in previous studies the co2 exchange velocities along the gss that we investigated here are controlled by river turbulence that is mainly due to channel slope and the velocity of flow and that exhibits significant seasonal and spatial changes the gss k600 values belong to the global eigenvalue range for low gradient streams and rivers however the co2 degassing velocities in this site were also constrained by the chemical complexation that occurs in gentle karst streams with low turbulence and high ph especially during the dry season when water levels are stable the k600 values we measured in march and december are among the lowest degassing rates yet reported in any streams and rivers worldwide complexation may play an important role in limiting co2 degassing in karst areas in the gss the fc method and the sf6 injection method could be used together to better explore the impact of the physical and chemical processes and to delineate the range of co2 exchange velocities upper and lower limits however because the model predicts relationships from a gentle stream channel in a carbonate karst area its application to larger rivers may produce significant errors we also do not recommend scaling our results to large rivers in karst regions at this time because the importance of wind speed and other factors may be significantly increased we suggest that increasing the volume of data of from different ecosystems and at larger spatial scales in karst areas will be effective means to accurately quantify the k600 values credit authorship contribution statement tao zhang conceptualization methodology

16629,co2 exchanges across the water air interface in rivers and lakes are currently believed to be responsible for the dominant share of global aquatic co2 emissions the gas transfer velocity k600 is the key factor that constrains the co2 fluxes it is also the most problematic to establish because of its high spatial and temporal variability here we have evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics in k600 values and their physical and chemical controlling processes by gas tracer and floating chamber fc methods in three reaches of a low gradient stream channel guancun surface stream gss in a karst terrain in subtropical southwestern china in december 2016 and march july and september 2017 the k600 values were highly variable in space and time in this small stream physical processes including the velocity of the stream and its slope were found to control the variations of k600 the k600 values recorded in the dry season march and december were at minimal levels due to very slow flow and gentle slope and were also affected by complexation in the solute enriched waters the characteristics high ph and low turbulence of gentle streams in carbonate karst areas are conducive to such complexation which is of great significance in the limiting co2 degassing in such regions we have obtained the first k600 prediction model for small streams in subtropical karst regions in conclusion we present a comprehensive approach for predicting the k600 values in small channels by comparison of independent sf6 gas tracer and floating chamber methods graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords co2 transfer velocity seasonal and spatial variations physical processes chemical enhancement low gradient stream karst areas 1 introduction the importance of the output of carbon from aquatic systems has been emphasized in terrestrial carbon balance assessments at a range of spatial and temporal scales richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 dinsmore et al 2010 carbon transferred from terrestrial sources into aquatic systems is largely 1 stored in accumulations of sediments or 2 exported downstream or 3 taken up as co2 that is released into the atmosphere by degassing sawakuchi et al 2017 show that more than half of the terrestrial carbon entering rivers and streams is degassed into the atmosphere in addition open streams are the primary outlets for groundwater that will often carry larger amounts of dissolved gases co2 ch4 rn etc generating excess degassing because of the big differences between their concentrations in the water and the open atmosphere therefore accurate quantification of stream channel co2 emission is a key part of regional carbon budgeting at present many methods can be used to estimate the co2 flux including the floating chamber method fc thin boundary layer method tbl and gas tracer method plus micrometeorological and remote sensing inversion methods unesco ihaghg 2010 however due to the differences in the monitoring techniques the environments and research objectives none of them are perfect the tbl method is currently the most widely used due to its simplicity and rapidity calculating the flux using semi empirical equations based on pco2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide and co2 transfer velocity k600 unesco ihaghg 2010 pco2 one of the two key parameters in these equations is much more straightforward to measure in aquatic system than the k600 value which is neither simple nor direct due to the highly varying nature of correlating factors e g wind wanninkhof et al 2009 alin et al 2011 waves ulseth et al 2019 surfactants salter et al 2011 heat flux berg and pace 2017 penetrative convection crill et al 1988 and surface turbulence etc zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 the k 600 value thus depends on the complicated hydrographic features of a river channel wallin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 rather than pco2 it directly determines the magnitude of co2 flux across the water air interface and thus the accuracy of its estimation requires special attention raymond and cole 2001 wallin et al 2011 it is well recognized that turbulence drives gas exchange at the water air interface as a consequence k 600 model estimates in streams are often based on turbulence related geomorphic and hydraulic variables zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 the channel slope is considered to be the primary hydraulic property controlling gas exchange with the velocity of flow being secondary because of its dependence on the combination of channel slope and channel topography tsivoglou and neal 1976 classically k600 has been modeled as a function of current velocity and channel slope alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 hall and ulseth 2020 in addition many models have attempted to predict k600 using width depth index w d wallin et al 2011 discharge width q w liu et al 2017 and or stream depth d raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 for a variety of streams and large rivers all with varying success more comprehensive hydraulic analyses have incorporated the reynolds number froude number and stream bed roughness raymond et al 2012 long et al 2015 additionally the relationship between energy dissipation rates turbulence and k600 has been established by estimation or direct measurement of the former zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 hall and ulseth 2020 although a series of physical and empirical equations describing relationships between k600 and stream hydraulics have been developed the high residual variation in k600 due to the highly temporally and spatially variable show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations for a single stream what methods to use is still a great challenge to predict the k600 values accurately which also constrains the scaling k600 values are most often considered to be controlled by physical processes but the biological respiration and chemical reactions should also be considered when estimating gas exchange rates hall and ulseth 2020 these metabolic processes contribute some fraction of greenhouse gas release from flowing water and result in a clear link between metabolism and gas flux hotchkiss et al 2015 however the effect of respiration is likely negligible because the time scale over which gas exchange is measured is much shorter than that which is pertains to respiration duvert et al 2018 in contrast the chemically reactive co2 can bypass the rate limiting molecular diffusion step by reacting in the boundary layer wanninkhof and knox 1996 the reaction time constants being of the same order of magnitude as the transfer time of the co2 molecules from the liquid boundary layer to the air schulz et al 2006 therefore chemical reaction is also important for co2 exchange however the influence of chemical enhancement on the prediction of k600 values is still poorly understood there are 3066 subterranean rivers with an annual natural water resource of about 18 08 billion m3 in china and 736 karst springs with a discharge of more than 100 l s in guangxi zhuang autonomous region china yuan et al 1991 in karst areas many surface streams headwaters are groundwater stream continuum because they are only fed by a karst spring or a subterranean stream pu et al 2019 which represents important sources of carbon dioxide co2 in addition the groundwater stream continuum is a hot spot for carbon emissions because it possibly change the carbon balance of the aquatic and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems oviedo vargas et al 2015 looman et al 2016 pu et al 2017 duvert et al 2018 at present research on k600 values is concentrated chiefly in tropical and temperate regions and less on streams in subtropical or specifically in karstic areas from a carbon cycle perspective karst streams have notably higher dic and pco2 than others and affected by seasonality in precipitation may have higher k600 values li et al 2018 however the lack of a reference k600 values and its monitoring methods restricts the accurate estimation of co2 flux in the groundwater stream continuum of karst areas especially some evidences from china li et al 2018 therefore to reveal the characteristics of spatiotemporal variation and its physical and chemical controls on k600 values and to explore the appropriate k600 prediction method in a typical low order headstream four experiments with different monitoring strategies were undertaken in three reaches of karst stream channel using gas tracer and floating chamber methods 2 study area the guancun surface

each experiment as a first step two blank water samples were collected glass bottle 63 ml with reverse rubber stoppers at each site to determine the background value of sf6 the mixed tracer was then poured into the stream water at g1 thirty water samples were collected at each monitoring site at appropriate time intervals as the conductivity rose reached a peak value and receded to background

transported to the laboratory sf6 was separated from the water by the headspace balance method 20 ml argon gas was injected into the water sample and the same volume of water sample discharged the water sample was inverted for 48 h until the sf6 concentration in the water and gas reached a balance in the bottle ten milliliter of headspace gas was then discharged into a gas chromatograph ecd

injection approach to determining k600 sf 6 k600 after the tracer was injected at 0 min the starting time the sf6 concentration in the stream in all four experiments decreased linearly with time along the flow path fig 3 the trend steepened with increasing discharge and velocity of flow r2 0 99 p 0 01 for example in the december experiment when both discharge and velocity were at their lowest sf6 concentration at g2 g3 g4 and g5 reached their peak steady state values in elapsed times of 25 38 172 and 271 min respectively in contrast sf6 concentration reached their maximum values in only 4 11 26 and 33 min respectively in the september experiment when discharge and velocity of flow were greatest in the gss fig s1 the k600 values measured in all gss reaches using sf6 injections sf6 k600 ranged from 0 444 to 13 394 m d in the four experiments respectively table 1 and fig 4 high spatiotemporal variability in k600 was observed with very high values for the months with large discharges and rapid water flow by season the averaged sf6 k 600 values were 2 007 1 081 m d in july 11 194 3 686 m d in september 1 030 0 655 m d in december 2016 and 2 842 1 889 m d in march 2017 comparing the river reaches except in september the sf6 k600 values in r2 were significantly higher than in r1 and r3 table 1 and fig 4 4 2 floating chamber approach to determining k 600 fc k600 the k600 values measured by the fc approach fc k600 ranged from 0 185 to 21 910 m d temporally and spatially greatest seasonal variation was observed in the september 2016 measurements with very high fc k600 averaged values of 16 465 8 328 m d the lowest values were 0 581 0 088 m d in december 2016 and 0 246 0 059 m d in march 2017 spatially the fc k600 values displayed only slight changes in march july and december due to very low k600 in all of the gss reaches c v 24 strong variation occurred in september over the full year the average fc k600 values in r2 7 138 9 543 m d and r3 7 196 10 168 m d are similar and both are significantly greater than in r1 3 151 3 214 m d 4 3 comparison of the sf6 injection and fc approaches to determining k600 the k600 values obtained by the two methods in gss exhibited significant seasonal and spatial variations the k600 values over the full length of about 474 m along the reaches showed many substantial changes table 2 the results from fc and sf6 experiments corresponded well with each other being positively correlated at a significant level r2 0 47 p 0 05 fig 4 from fig 4 and table 1 the averaged ratio ε of fc k600 sf6 k600 was 1 50 1 51 indicating that the k600 measured by the fc method was greater than that of the sf6 injections throughout the year however the variability of ε was high in all four monitoring experiments standard deviation of 1 51 i e the different k600 methods displayed much temporal and spatial heterogeneity from the seasonal perspective the fc k600 values were greater than those obtained by the sf6 injections at the relatively high flow velocities and discharges of july and september but smaller in the lower velocities and discharges of march and december spatially the averaged ε values were 1 33 1 36 1 38 1 44 and 1 79 2 06 over reaches r1 r2 and r3 respectively indicating that the k600 values obtained from the fc method were greater than those of sf6 injection 4 4 variation of stream hydraulic parameters water temperature changes during the project year matched the air temperatures but with the much smaller range of only 2 1 c table 2 stream width w change was small c v 16 the stream flow velocity ν exhibited obvious seasonal variations with low averaged values of 0 076 0 032 m s and 0 064 0 066 m s in march and december and higher averaged values of 0 153 0 019 m s and 0 287 0 072 m s in july and september respectively the velocities of flow in the reaches trended r2 r1 r3 with averaged values of 0 127 0 085 m s 0 152 0 083 m s and 0 156 0 155 m s respectively throughout the year discharge q showed the same seasonal variations as the velocity of flow but with the different spatial trend r3 r2 r1 water depth d in r2 and r3 showed a clear pattern september july march december that was correlated with the rainfall the water depth of r1 was lower than that in r2 and r3 in december march and june but there was a significant increase in september and it was then higher due to the recent rain table 2 the channel slope changed very little over the observations 0 005 with r3 being slightly greater than r1 and r2 table 2 the εs showed same spatial r1 r2 r3 trend as slope the εd fr and re changed obviously and seasonally declining in march and december and increasing in july and september in conjunction with flow discharge and velocity spatially the fr and εd displayed the trend r2 r1 r3 but it was r2 r3 r1 in the case of re table 2 4 5 model description we revisited many key parameters of equations cited in the literature and fitted them with the k600 values obtained by fc and sf6 injection approach using linear and multiple regression analyses three groups of seven fitting equations with six main parameters were set up the first group used velocity and slope terms models 1 and 2 table 3 the second utilized slope velocity and stream width models 3 and 4 and the final three velocity slope discharge and depth models 5 7 we found that three general types of models did an adequate performance in predicting k600 discussed in detail below 5 discussion 5 1 physicochemical processes controlling k600 5 1 1 physical processes as channel slope increases more turbulent mixing leads to water surface replacement and increase in the gas exchange rates tsivoglou and neal 1976 wallin et al 2011 hall and madinger 2018 from the spatiotemporal perspective slope is more often used to explain the spatial changes rather than the temporal changes compared to model 1 model 2 that included channel slope showed a decrease in r2 in sf6 injection and the floating chamber this is probably due to the limited variations in channel slope along the gss indicating that the effect of slope may be small in the seasonal variations of k600 in a single low order flow generally discharge q controls k600 because water velocity and depth vary with changing discharge in a stream if its channel cross section remains constant i e k600 may increase with increasing discharge because this increases the velocity in a simple stream maurice et al 2017 mcdowell and johnson 2018 however both the k600 values obtained from sf6 injection and fc basically decreased with the increase of discharge and water velocity through the models 5 6 and 7 in group 3 table 3 similarly models 6 and 7 with a water depth term d predicted an increase in the k600 values however this is contrary to theory of turbulent dissipation that k600 should decrease with increasing depth raymond et al 2012 therefore although our predictive models including water depth and or discharge improved r2 and decreased the error of our predictions of k600 depth and discharge were not used to predict gas exchange although based on the theory we believe that they should models 3 is consistent with the dissipation theory in which the k600 values decrease with increasing water depth however the velocity of flow can explain 69 and 72 of the variance in k600 measured by sf6 and fc approaches respectively and no variations for fc approach occurred in models 3 and 4 with the water depth and width terms added in contrast model 4 with its water depth and width terms yielded the highest variance 88 in k600 measured by the sf6 approach however this is also contrary to theory of turbulent dissipation clearly for sf6 and fc approaches the strongest correlations both came from models that included a flow velocity term generally these empirical models have large prediction errors even within a catchment much of the k600 variation is not explained by slope and velocity wallin et al 2011 hall and ulseth 2020 i e while the models may display low parameter error due to there being many data points there is much residual error in figs 5a 5b and 6 the residuals from these predict models are close to being normally distributed and are random with respect to the fitted values the models that include velocity of flow best explain the k600 value indicating that the gas transfer rate may be mainly controlled by this variable in gss which is also consistent with the leading role of εd even though the effect of slope may be weakened 5 1 2 chemical processes the role of chemical reactions enhancing co2 gas exchanges across the water air interface has been widely explored e g bolin 1960 hoover and berkshire 1969 keller 1994 wanninkhof and knox 1996 the hydration reactions of co2 with hydroxide ions and water molecules in the boundary layer serve to steepen the concentration gradient of the gas and so reduce the effective depth of the mass boundary layer thus leading to an enhancement in the transfer velocity smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 komori et al 2011 generally hydration of co2 is a relatively slow process and its enhancement is thought to be important only when turbulent forcing is weak and as a consequence the amount of time available for transport across the mass boundary layer is relatively large strong chemical enhancement of mass flux is also associated with higher ph conditions hoover and berkshire 1969 smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 for example the enhancements can be ten or more times above the unenhanced flux in individual freshwater systems with high ph and low wind speeds emerson 1975 smith 1985 in summary the chemical enhancement co2 is dependent upon ph and the stagnant layer thickness the gss is a typical karst low order stream with relatively high ph 7 72 0 18 and low turbulent forcing so the chemical enhancement of co2 may play an important role except for that of keller 1994 all the models utilize the stagnant boundary layer model keller 1994 found that chemical enhancement in the stagnant boundary model is slightly less than in a film replacement model danckwerts 1970 we chose to use the h b model established by hoover and berkshire 1969 for calculating the chemical enhancement factor α because of its simplicity and relative accuracy this model is a function of the stagnant layer thickness the ph the co2 molecular diffusivity rate and co2 hydration rate the chemical enhancement factor for the h b model can be expressed as hoover and berkshire 1969 wanninkhof and knox 1996 14 α t t 1 tan fz fz with 15 f r t d m 1 0 5 16 r k c o 2 k o h o h 17 t 1 α h 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 α h 18 z d m k 1 where k c o 2 is the hydration rate constant for the reaction c o 2 h 2 o h hco 3 s l k o h is the rate constant for reaction c o 2 o h hco 3 l mol s α h is the activity coefficient for the hydrogen ion 10 ph d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient for co2 1 6 10 5 cm2 s k 1 and k 2 are the first and second apparent dissociation constants for carbonic acid table 4 and z is the stagnant layer thickness table 4 gordon et al 2004 from table 4 the averaged chemical enhancement factor values α are 1 44 0 13 2 93 0 73 1 005 0 002 and 1 001 0 002 respectively in december march july and september in the gss spatially the chemical enhancement factor α maintained the trend r1 r2 r3 throughout the year with averaged values of 1 41 0 60 for r1 1 59 0 83 for r2 and 1 78 1 31 for r3 increasing turbulence should decrease the stagnant layer thickness and thus accelerate gas flux smith 1985 therefore the influence chemical enhancement is almost negligible in july and september because the stagnant layer thickness is smaller due to the greater turbulence table 2 combining with the lower ph in contrast such enhancement plays an important role in the dry season due to the thicker stagnant layer and higher ph therefore chemical enhancement is controlled by the high ph and thick stagnant layer in gss which is consistent with previous conclusions a similar phenomenon also appears in the chemical enhancement variations in the river reaches table 4 our measured chemical reinforcement of co2 exchanges in gss also follows the h b theory being significantly enhanced at low gas transfer velocities but not at high gas transfer speeds according to the calculated results of enhancement in gss the k600 values obtained by the sf6 method were undoubtedly overestimated in march and december due to obviously higher α with 2 93 0 73 and 1 44 0 13 but not by the fc method table 4 this is also consistent with the finding that the k600 values measured by the sf6 method are greater than those by the fc method table 1 although chemical enhancement has a minor effect on sea air gas exchange of co2 under average oceanic turbulence conditions and is not significant to the global co2 flux in that situation wanninkhof and knox 1996 its influences cannot be neglected in certain regions for example the calculated co2 enhancement amounts to 4 8 of the total exchange in the equatorial co2 source regions wanninkhof and knox 1996 the effect could be as high as 15 regionally around the atlantic and up to 27 on a basin scale keller 1994 by contrast this effect may play more important role in alkaline closed basin lakes river basins with low turbulence and high biological productivity and other sheltered and quiet regions hoover and berkshire 1969 smith 1985 wanninkhof and knox 1996 for example hoover and berkshire 1969 found that the predicted chemical enhancement of co2 exchange rates at high ph of 6 5 are 10 76 higher than the unenhanced rates in the wind tunnel experiments even this enhancement is ubiquitous in the alkaline closed basin lakes and up to 300 wanninkhof and knox 1996 in the specific case of co2 there can be a strong chemical enhancement of mass flux associated with ph and thickness of boundary layer generally the ph of water bodies in karst areas is high schuler et al 2020 and the slope of low channel streams is small which both are conducive to chemical enhancement therefore in low channel streams in karst areas we must not only pay attention to the physical processes controlling co2 transfer velocities but also consider the effects of chemical enhancement 5 2 the applicability of the fc and sf6 injection approaches the gas tracer and floating chamber are the two main approaches to quantifying the k600 value in streams campeau et al 2014 natchimuthu et al 2017 kokic et al 2018 however they are not suitable for all types of stream channels and discharge conditions because both have their limitations for example the uneven mixing and operational complexity of gas tracer methods constrain their application in large and deep rivers clark et al 1995 kokic et al 2018 for low order streams however the use of a volatile gas tracer has been the chief means of estimating k600 due to its ease of operation kokic et al 2018 in addition this method has the further advantage of estimating k600 over a stream reach at a similar spatial scale to that of the turnover length of the gas in question hall and ulseth 2020 sf6 is usually used as a tracer because it is biologically and chemically inert in water so the only factor governing its concentration in surface waters is physical exchange with the atmosphere the fc method is widely used in the study of k600 at the water air interface due to its ease of operation and precise measurements however this method also limits the accurate estimation of k600 values because it forms a microenvironment within the chamber that may alter turbulence at the water air interface cole et al 2010 more specifically this microenvironment dampens the influence of wind and other factors affecting the boundary layer thereby inhibiting the gas transfer in turbulent environments matthews et al 2003 to the contrary however fc physical disturbance of the boundary layer may act to enhance gas transfer on calm water bodies the mode of deployment of floating chambers is also debatable kokic et al 2018 the drifting chamber is best deployed for larger and deeper streams and rivers because the water surface is more homogeneous but in environments with weak currents in the water but with high winds it is necessary to anchor the chamber frankignoulle et al 1996 lorke et al 2015 found that anchored chambers can disturb the in stream turbulence which in turn enhances k600 estimates in stream studies the floating chamber that drifts on the water surface can generate gas fluxes up to five times higher than in chambers whose walls extend to some depth into the water truly isolating the trapped air matthews et al 2003 therefore in this study we extended the chamber walls down approximately 3 cm into the water additionally we added heat insulation material to the chamber and placed the battery fuel outside of it to reduce the impact of temperature rise to monitor the co2 concentration changes in real time and reduce human interference and errors we used the online monitoring instrument egm5 pp systems usa connected to the floating chamber with tygon tubing in a closed loop floating chambers can potentially receive co2 by both diffusive flux and by ebullition bubbling if bubbles enter the chamber midway through a run the co2 concentration will increase suddenly matthews et al 2003 from fig 7 the increases in co2 concentration were relatively stable and the slope of the concentration increase over time were straight with no apparent disturbance occurring throughout any of the monitoring it should be noted that ulseth et al 2019 found that switching from turbulent diffusive to bubble mediated exchange may occur at k600 150 cm h in streams similarly the maximum k600 without bubble entrainment was 150 cm h in the experiments in laboratory flumes moog and jirka 1999 the k600 values we obtained with the fc and sf6 methods are much lower than this threshold table 1 finally the slope of gss is less than 0 005 and the velocity of flow is very low 0 14 m s in march and december the white water associated with fast turbulent flow standing waves etc was rarely seen fig s1 therefore we believe that the influence of bubbles in gss is small except for bubbles the selection of the n value in the eq 7 may affect the accuracy of the sf6 injection method when the boundary layer approximates by a smooth surface with very little wind n 0 67 in contrast n 0 5 is adopted for a rough water surface at moderate wind speeds jähne et al 1987 although the wind speed is low at the gss the water surface tends to be rough due to the influence of stream slope and turbulence a single value of 0 5 represents somewhat extreme conditions unlikely to occur in this particular environment matthews et al 2003 therefore we chose n 0 57 0 07 to recalculate conditions typically found in small ponds with slightly roughened surfaces clark et al 1995 however this range of only 5 is not enough to span the difference between k600 estimates based on the fc and sf6 approaches overall excluding the influence of air bubbles and the selection of n values sf6 worked well as a gas exchange tracer in small water bodies and we have a high level of confidence in the k600 values determined by the method although the anchored chamber method may overestimate k600 in the gss with its relatively calm waters we chose it for research due to the narrow shallow nature of the channel and the lush aquatic vegetation in it on the whole the k600 values measured by fc and sf6 show significant positive correlation are of the same magnitude and consistent with each other when the turbulence was very small in march and december the k600 obtained by the anchored fc may be overestimated due to the anchored fc will enhance the in stream turbulence lorke et al 2015 however the k600 values obtained by the anchored fc were much smaller than those measured from sf6 method indicating the chemical reactions occurring in the floating chamber but not in sf6 gas tracer in contrast the decreased thickness of the boundary layer due to greater turbulence in july and september resulted in reduced chemical complexation the k600 values obtained by the fc method were greater than those of the sf6 method therefore the fc method can determine the range of variations of k600 values in the gss the upper limit and lower limits in addition it can represent the effects of chemical complexation at low wind speeds in low order streams very well in karst areas the sf6 method can better capture the physical processes that affect the k600 values as the gas moves with the flowing water to generalize where there are no measured values we can now approximate k600 values for low order streams in karst areas with high confidence 5 3 the comparatively low gas exchange velocities of low energy channels in karst areas here we use only the fc k600 results because as shown they can be taken to measure both the upper and the lower limits of gas transfer along the gss as expected k600 values were relatively low with an average of 5 83 7 73 m d these k600 values are equivalent to the values of other low energy streams reported by raymond et al 2012 the k600 values reported for alpine ulseth et al 2019 subalpine peter et al 2014 schelker et al 2016 and other streams with steep channel slopes maurice et al 2017 hall and madinger 2018 mcdowell and johnson 2018 are much higher than the gss values being 5 90 times greater in contrast however the gss k600 values are five times greater than reported in the oceans three to fifteen times greater than in ponds and lakes wanninkhof et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 holgerson and raymond 2016 overall the averaged k600 value of this low order stream in a sub tropical karst area is at the same level as other reported low order channel flows elsewhere but is at a relatively high level in comparison with many other water bodies around the world as emphasized above it is the turbulence that drives gas exchange at the water air interface in streams and most rivers tsivoglou and neal 1976 ulseth et al 2019 hall and ulseth 2020 as a proxy for turbulence the energy dissipation rate εd is often used to scale and predict the gas exchange raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 used breakpoint regression to analyze the simple linear relationships between εd and k600 across hundreds of streams having a wide range of geomorphological and hydraulic characteristics a nonlinear relationship between ln k600 and ln εd was found where ln k600 3 10 0 35 ln εd for εd 0 02 m2 s3 and ln k600 6 43 1 18 95 ci 1 10 1 30 ln εd for εd 0 02 m2 s3 adopting these values 78 of the variability in k600 in all of the streams was explained by the εd from fig 8 a significant linear relationship between the k600 and εd was found in gss which conforms to the linear relationship defined by ulseth et al 2019 when εd 0 02 m2 s3 however the k600 values of the gss also fall within the k600 range reported by raymond et al 2012 the turbulence εs greatly increases due to bed friction when εd 0 02 m2 s3 and probably forms bubbles to improve gas exchange rates ulseth et al 2019 clearly εd in the gss is much less than 0 02 m2 s3 so the gas exchange rates were less affected by bubbles to generalize although significant temporal and spatial differences were found in the gss k600 values those values still fall within the wider range reported by raymond et al 2012 for other low order streams and rivers and also follow the linear relationship between k600 and εd recorded in the latter therefore no matter the differing regional climatic geomorphic etc constraints it is the turbulence that always drives k600 variations in river systems for an individual or particular type of stream or river however the characteristics of the study site must be considered in any k600 investigation hall and ulseth 2020 for example in the low order stream in a karst area that was selected for this study the gss although the co2 transfer velocity was controlled by the turbulence it was also much affected by chemical complexation in the high concentrations of solutes in the water especially during the steady conditions of the dry season in particular these co2 exchange velocities in recorded in the gss in march and december are among the lowest reported for stream and river ecosystem as the results plotted in fig 8 show very clearly of course the model obtained from the gss may be constrained by the small size of this system and so may not predict results in larger rivers in karst areas raymond et al 2012 liu et al 2017 wallin et al 2018 however here we provide a usable k600 value predictive model to determine the credible range of k600 values in low gradient channels in carbonate karst areas we also enlarge the scope for predicting co2 exchange velocities in low gradient channels in karst and other areas by employing and comparing the gas tracer method with the fc method to verify each other 6 conclusion in general gas exchange rates in streams can display high variability spatially and temporally due to the variations occurring in the slope depth and velocity of the water flow the high variability is strongly related to measures of εd at these spatiotemporal scales as in previous studies the co2 exchange velocities along the gss that we investigated here are controlled by river turbulence that is mainly due to channel slope and the velocity of flow and that exhibits significant seasonal and spatial changes the gss k600 values belong to the global eigenvalue range for low gradient streams and rivers however the co2 degassing velocities in this site were also constrained by the chemical complexation that occurs in gentle karst streams with low turbulence and high ph especially during the dry season when water levels are stable the k600 values we measured in march and december are among the lowest degassing rates yet reported in any streams and rivers worldwide complexation may play an important role in limiting co2 degassing in karst areas in the gss the fc method and the sf6 injection method could be used together to better explore the impact of the physical and chemical processes and to delineate the range of co2 exchange velocities upper and lower limits however because the model predicts relationships from a gentle stream channel in a carbonate karst area its application to larger rivers may produce significant errors we also do not recommend scaling our results to large rivers in karst regions at this time because the importance of wind speed and other factors may be significantly increased we suggest that increasing the volume of data of from different ecosystems and at larger spatial scales in karst areas will be effective means to accurately quantify the k600 values credit authorship contribution statement tao zhang conceptualization methodology
