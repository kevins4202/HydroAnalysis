4905,global changes in land use and land cover lulc and climate are expected to have profound impacts on water dynamics which are key for human wellbeing however we still lack understanding of how changes in climate patterns and lulc are likely to interact and govern the hydrology at the watershed level in tropical regions in the future here we assessed the contribution of changes in weather patterns and lulc on the hydrology of a watershed in southeast of brazil between 1990 and 2015 using the swat model in addition we explored the likely impacts of two contrasting lulc scenarios green road versus fossil fuel on the hydrology in 2045 under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 the watershed witnessed an increase in precipitation and streamflow in combination with an expansion of forest cover and coffee production while surface runoff 5 2 mm year 1 and water yield 252 mm year 1 increased soil water 24 6 mm year 1 and evapotranspiration 15 7 mm year 1 decreased the analysis indicated that changes in climate patterns are the main drivers of historical water dynamics in the region compared with fossil fuel scenario the increase in forest area in the green road scenario will lead to a decrease in surface runoff and consequently in water yield favouring water infiltration and soil erosion control and buffer against extreme precipitation events therefore the socioeconomic and public policies underlying the green road scenario that favour the expansion of forests can direct sustainable future water

the production of feed food and fibre and is also a vital component of natural ecosystems falkenmark and rockström 2006 understanding how climate and anthropogenic changes will affect water dynamics is crucial to manage and safeguard water provision in the future climatic patterns and land use land cover lulc changes are the most important drivers of water dynamics costa et al 2003 chien et al 2013 neupane and kumar 2015 worldwide these factors have been subject to changes over the last decades and most likely even more so in the coming decades foley et al 2005 ipcc 2018 this is particularly relevant for mountainous areas in the tropics where lulc changes in combination with steep slopes can result in strongly fluctuating water dynamics potentially resulting in erosion and unpredictable streamflow muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 suescún et al 2019 although the separate effect of climate and lulc changes on water dynamics have been studied worldwide chen et al 2020 dey and mishra 2017 quantitative information about the interactive effect of lulc and climate change scenarios on water dynamics in tropical mountain regions is still scarce marhaento et al 2018 the southeast mountain region of brazil witnessed intense lulc changes in the last decades and the decrease in precipitation patterns since 2012 has affected the water availability for millions of people in urban and rural areas soriano et al 2016 in contrast in january 2020 heavy precipitations events of up to 957 mm month led to intense flooding and landslides inmet 2020 impacts of weather extremes can be aggravated or buffered by lulc changes which together may influence the water dynamics such as infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration brown et al 2011 although a few studies analysed the historic streamflow in the southeast brazilian mountain region pereira et al 2016a 2016b bressiani et al 2015 the effects of lulc change and climate on water dynamics are still poorly understood in contrast to the amazon biome that lost about 65 million hectares since 1985 and still is facing ongoing deforestation mapbiomas 2019 the southeast mountain region in the atlantic forest biome has experienced an increase in forest cover mainly due to government measures against deforestation and the intensification of agriculture gomes et al 2020 forest intercepts rain and limits the speed of water surface runoff on slopes reducing soil erosion and enhancing water infiltration while the benefits of forests on controlling surface runoff are well documented the influence of increasing forest cover on water yield is less clear filoso et al 2017 in tropical areas characterised by rainy seasons followed by dry seasons insights into the impact of lulc changes on water dynamics is essential to inform management to reduce soil erosion in the rain season and sustain water availability in the dry season indeed a recent study in the zona da mata of minas gerais in brazil found that farmers perceived the provision of water as the most important ecosystem service teixeira et al 2018 therefore a better understanding of the separate effects of lulc and weather patterns on water dynamics can inform policy and management for sustainable water management disentangling the effects of lulc changes and climate change on water dynamics is challenging especially in heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes in tropical areas marhaento et al 2017 climate projections indicate that changes in temperature and precipitation can be anticipated across the globe ipcc 2018 which will have important implications for water dynamics and associated ecosystem services while the monitoring and analysis of long term hydrological data can provide important insights how lulc changes of the past have influenced streamflow zhang et al 2014 modelling allows for the integration of environmental and climate variables in order to explore water dynamics under scenarios of climate and lulc changes lópez moreno et al 2014 giri et al 2019 the swat model is used worldwide to model the hydrological dynamics in watersheds of varying size and contexts molina navarro et al 2018 tamm et al 2018 rani and sreekesh 2019 and to separate the individual effects of lulc changes and weather variables guo et al 2016 wang et al 2016 combining information about impacts of lulc changes on hydrology and projections of climate change allows the exploration of plausible scenarios for future water dynamics although simulations of deforestation and reforestation show that forest can reduce surface runoff and increase minimum streamflow in southeast brazil pereira et al 2016b de oliveira et al 2018 these have not been linked to policy and management actions for ensuring sustainable water dynamics in the future the aim of this study is to assess the relationship between historical changes in lulc and climate patterns on water dynamics and to explore impacts of future scenarios of lulc and climate changes on water dynamics in a watershed in the southeast of brazil specifically we aimed to i describe the historical trend of temperature precipitation and streamflow between 1990 and 2015 ii unravel the contributions of lulc and climate patterns on streamflow and water dynamics in this region and iii explore the impacts of contrasting scenarios of lulc under climate change on the water dynamics in 2045 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the muriaé river basin covering an area of 5 717 km2 in the southeast of the atlantic forest biome brazil fig 1 the altitude of the studied basin ranges from 113 m to almost 2000 m the climate is subtropical humid with mean temperature of 21 c and annual precipitation of 1300 mm the main soil types in the watershed are ferrasols and acrisols covering more than 80 of the area the main lulc types are pasture forest and coffee the region has been subject to major changes in lulc in the last three decades in contrast to many other tropical areas during the period 1986 2015 the region witnessed a decrease of pasture area from 76 to 58 and an increase in forest cover from 18 to 24 and coffee area from 3 to 11 gomes et al 2020 streamflow and precipitation data were obtained from six gauging stations from agência nacional das águas ana hidroweb and climate data were derived from three meteorological stations in or near the study area located in viçosa 698 m caparaó 843 m and itaperuna 113 m fig 1 appendix 1 2 2 swat model and input data we used swat to analyse how changes in lulc and weather affect water dynamics in the muriaé river basin swat simulates the hydrology based on the water balance concept eq 1 1 sw t s w r day q i e a p i qr i where sw is soil water content mm t is time rday is the amount of precipitation mm qi is the amount of surface runoff mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration mm pi is the amount of percolation mm and qri the amount of return flow mm for a detailed description of the components of the swat model we refer to neitsch et al 2011 the timestep for the model was one month swat delineates sub basins which are further divided in hydrologic response units hrus each hru represents a spatial unit with unique lulc soil type and slope characteristics we used maps of lulc of 1995 and 2015 with 30 30 m resolution to represent the dynamics of lulc change in the muriaé river basin from 1990 to 2015 fig 2 a b the lulc maps were developed using the random forest algorithm classification from images from landsat satellite 5 and 8 and had a performance of 0 90 for kappa and 0 93 for accuracy gomes et al 2020 the detailed lulc changes in quantitative terms in the sub basins are described in appendix 2 we used the map of 1995 to represent the period between 1990 and 2004 baseline period while the lulc map from 2015 represented the period between 2005 and 2015 the lulc maps contained six classes swat land use codes forest frst coffee coff pasture past urban area urhd eucalyptus plantations euca and campos rupestres a scrub grassy vegetation on rocks rngb for swat modelling we used the soil classes derived from the soil maps from the states of minas gerais and rio de janeiro fig 2c feam 2010 embrapa 2016 to account for the local tropical context strauch and volk 2013 dos santos et al 2018 we adjusted the swat vegetation index parameters as suggested by pereira et al 2016a b and used the soil physical hydraulic properties of each local soil class from the national soil survey randambrasil at a 1 1 000 000 scale radambrasil 1983 cooper et al 2005 the slope map was derived from the digital elevation model using arcgis software and was classified into five classes 0 8 8 15 15 25 25 45 and 45 fig 2d we used daily climatic records of precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from three meteorological stations fig 1 however data on solar radiation was only available for the station in viçosa from 2005 to 2015 therefore we used the solar radiation data from 2005 to 2015 to derive a predictive model using the random forests algorithm and the maximum temperature air humidity and daily daylight hours as explanatory variables to predict solar radiation for the three meteorological stations from 1990 to 2015 appendix 3 2 3 swat calibration validation and sensitivity analysis we simulated the streamflow in the muriaé river basin between 1990 and 2015 we calibrated the monthly streamflow for the period of 1990 1999 with the initial three years set as the model spin up period 1990 1992 with the observed streamflow from the upstream gauging station number 4 fig 3 we selected this gauging station since it is located upstream and is the most representative for the watershed abbaspour et al 2015 the spin up period is an essential step to obtain a representative state of the model for the watershed hydrology kim et al 2018 next we validated the model for the period 2000 2015 for model validation we used two performance indicators i the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 with the classification 0 75 nse 1 00 very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory nse 0 50 unsatisfactory and ii the percent bias pbias with values below 25 considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 aiming to identify the most important parameters that influence streamflow we conducted a global sensitivity analysis using p value 0 001 as a threshold for this purpose we used the swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the most sensitive parameters to changes in the historic streamflow were sol k sol awc cn2 alpha bf recharge dp and gw delay appendix 4 these parameters were estimated for the sub basin 4 and regionalized to the entire watershed which contained 612 hydrologic response units for the lulc map of 1995 and 780 for the map of 2015 the observed and simulated monthly average streamflow of gauging station 4 in the calibration period 1993 1999 were 15 42 11 02 and 16 04 9 70 mm respectively the performance indicators of the swat model for this period were 0 72 for nse and 3 3 for pbias in the validation period 2000 2015 the measured and simulated average monthly streamflow were 18 13 94 and 18 20 11 25 mm respectively and the performance indicators were 0 71 for nse and 20 4 for pbias the performance of the swat model for calibration and validation was good according to the performance criteria of moriasi et al 2007 2 4 historical trend analysis of hydro climatic variables we used the non parametric mann kendall test to identify significant trends in the annual time series of mean temperature precipitation and streamflow from 1990 to 2015 this rank based statistical method is extensively applied to series data and performs with robustness for non normally distributed data van belle and hughes 1984 guo et al 2016 here we conducted an uncertainty analysis using a 95 confidence interval i e 1 96 of the standard normal distribution 2 5 disentangling lulc and weather effects we used the separation method to assess the relative contribution of changes in lulc and variation in weather variables on historical water yield surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration dey and mishra 2017 we evaluated four simulations s1 s2 s3 and s4 consisting of pairwise combinations of two contrasting lulc maps 1995 vs 2015 and two climate data periods 1990 2004 vs 2005 2015 table 1 the contrast between s3 and s1 reflects the effect of variation in climate on water dynamics while the contrast between s4 and s3 indicated the effect of lulc change table 2 the difference between s4 and s1 represents the combined effect of changes in lulc and climate on water dynamics the relative impact of changes in climate was calculated as ec s3 s1 s4 s1 100 and changes in lulc as el s4 s3 s4 s1 100 2 6 future lulc and climatic scenarios to explore the effect of lulc changes and climate variability on hydrology for 2045 we developed three scenarios the baseline fossil fuel and green road the baseline scenario was based on the lulc map of 2015 while the green road and fossil fuel were based on projected lulc maps for two contrasting local scenarios consistent with the global socioeconomic shared pathways gomes et al 2020 the percentage forest area in the baseline lulc scenario is 24 while in the green road scenario forest area will expand to 39 and in the fossil fuel scenario the forest area will decrease to 18 and replaced mainly by pastures and coffee plantations fig 4 table 2 the three lulc scenarios were coupled with a climatic projection from 2020 to 2045 which was based on the global representative forcing pathway rcp 8 5 scenario of the hadgem2 es model a limitation of rcp scenarios is that the temperature and precipitation data have a coarse spatial resolution and are unsuitable for the finer resolution of our study therefore we used bias corrected climate projections from 2020 to 2045 generated with the change factor approach for this purpose the current hadgem2 es output values were subtracted from the simulated values for the future resulting in climate anomalies which were then added to the historic database for daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation resulting in future climate database from 2020 to 2045 tabor williams 2010 navarro racines and tarapues 2015 for the period 2035 2045 the mean temperature is expected to increase from 21 6 c to 22 9 c and precipitation will increase with 42 43 mm year 1 compared with the period of 2005 2015 3 results 3 1 historical trend analysis meteorological records from 1990 to 2015 indicate that the mean air temperature showed a significant increasing trend z 2 81 p 0 004 from 1990 to 2015 while there was no significant trend in precipitation and streamflow in this period precipitation z 0 48 p 0 62 streamflow z 0 06 p 0 54 fig 5 the mean air temperature varied from 21 6 c 3 5 between 1990 and 2004 to 22 4 c 2 9 between 2005 and 2015 fig 5 and appendix 5 3 2 disentangling effects of lulc and climate on historical hydrological variables the simulations s1 and s4 showed that the streamflow in the sub basins increased on average by 15 8 m3s 1 between 1990 and 2015 table 3 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 the simulated precipitation increased by 348 mm year 1 in the sub basins 1 2 and 6 while no changes were observed for sub basins 3 4 and 5 appendix 6 at the watershed level surface runoff of water increased by 5 2 mm year 1 as compared to the baseline period with a relative contribution of 155 by climate and 55 by lulc changes fig 6 a the drivers of surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 2 showed contrasting patterns compared to sub basin 3 and 4 the surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 2 were on average 8 mm year 1 higher than in the baseline period as a result of climatic changes 155 1 contribution and lulc changes 55 1 contribution on the other hand in sub basins 3 and 4 surface runoff increased by 3 6 mm year 1 with contributions from changes in lulc of 71 and 14 in sub basins 3 and 4 respectively water yields in the impacted period 2005 2015 increased on average by 252 mm year 1 as compared to the baseline period 1990 2004 as result of climate variability 97 and lulc changes 3 fig 6b at the sub basin level the effect of lulc was positive in sub basins 4 3 8 5 9 2 and 6 7 7 and negative in sub basins 1 0 6 2 0 3 and 3 1 7 at the overall watershed level the soil water content and evapotranspiration showed similar patterns with decreases of 24 6 and 15 7 mm year 1 respectively fig 6c d the change in soil water was due to climate variability 605 5 and lulc changes 505 5 while climate and lulc contributed 59 and 41 respectively to the decrease in evapotranspiration in contrast to the other sub basins sub basin 1 showed an increase of 27 6 mm year 1 in soil water and 63 8 in evapotranspiration fig 6c and d on the other hand in sub basin 3 soil water decreased by 56 2 mm year 1 and evapotranspiration by 98 3 mm year 1 fig 6c and d 3 3 exploring future water dynamic scenarios the green road and fossil fuel scenarios under the rcp 8 5 climate scenario resulted in contrasting hydrology outcomes in 2045 compared with the baseline scenario fig 7 in the fossil fuel scenario increases in water yield 1 5 surface runoff 10 7 soil water 1 2 and a decrease in evapotranspiration 1 9 are expected in contrast in the green road scenario decreases in water yield 3 and soil water 3 6 and increases in surface runoff 3 8 and evapotranspiration 4 2 may be anticipated the water yield tends to increase in all sub basin under the fossil fuel scenario in 2045 with increases up to 2 4 in sub basin 6 fig 7a in contrast in the green road scenario the water yield decreased by 4 4 in sub basin 5 fig 7b surface runoff is expected to increase in all sub basins for the fossil fuel scenario up to 15 in sub basins 2 and 3 fig 7c in the green road scenario surface runoff increased by up to 9 3 in sub basins 2 3 4 and 5 and decreased in sub basins 1 2 5 and 6 1 7 fig 7d soil water increased by up to 2 5 in the fossil fuel scenario fig 7e and decreased by 6 3 in the green road scenario fig 7f evapotranspiration showed a contrasting trend compared to soil water evaporation decreased by as much as 3 3 in the fossil fuel scenario fig 7g and increased by as much as 5 6 in the green road scenario fig 7h 4 discussion in this study we explored the effect of historic lulc changes on the hydrology in a sub tropical watershed between 1990 and 2015 and explored the potential consequences of future scenarios of lulc changes and climate for hydrological dynamics in 2045 our key messages are i the simulated river streamflow increased by 60 from 1990 to 2004 to 2005 2015 which was mostly explained by changes in climate patterns ii the contribution of lulc on the hydrology at the sub basin level depends strongly on climate conditions and iii scenarios for 2045 indicate that lulc changes can have a strong impact on water dynamics the simulated increase in river streamflow 15 8 m3s 1 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 was mainly attributed to the increase in the annual precipitation 348 mm rather than lulc changes we also found that surface runoff and water yield increased while the soil water and evapotranspiration decreased in the study period however it is difficult to link specific changes in lulc types appendix 2 to changes in streamflow for instance while the increase in forest area tend to decrease surface runoff and increase evapotranspiration expansion of urban areas is associated with increased surface runoff and decreased evapotranspiration in general forests can increase the water infiltration and groundwater recharge lopes et al 2020 ouyang et al 2019 and afforestation has been associated with reduced water yield and river streamflow due to increased evapotranspiration filoso et al 2017 in the last decades water management has mostly focussed on surface water such as streamflow of rivers however it is important to also consider soil water and the water flow by evapotranspiration which are essential to maintain ecosystem functioning falkenmark and rockström 2006 for instance although soil water can decrease with expansion of forests area higher rates of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis from trees can increase the frequency of precipitation and also improve human health by filtering pollution from the air ellison et al 2012 nowak et al 2014 therefore future studies on the effects of lulc changes on hydrology at the watershed level should go beyond the analysis of streamflow or water yield and also focus on soil water and evapotranspiration that are related to natural processes and the maintenance of ecosystem functions and services such information can complement our understanding of the effects of lulc changes on the water cycle and how this influences human wellbeing the analysis of the water balance at the sub basin level shows that the contribution of lulc on key hydrological variables depends on the actual weather conditions in cases of increased precipitation about 436 mm year 1 in sub basins 1 and 2 the climate was the most important driver of the increase in surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration while lulc changes were associated with a decrease of surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration fig 6 in contrast when there were no significant changes in precipitation lulc changes were the most important driver of increases of surface runoff and of decreases of soil water and evapotranspiration sub basins 3 and 4 our findings align with those of li et al 2016 2009 and shang et al 2019 who also identified changes in climate as main drivers of hydrology in various contexts lulc changes can be considered as a moderator of water dynamics which is strongly related to the quantity of precipitation in the environment global studies show that afforestation in drier areas has a stronger negative effect on water yield than in humid regions jackson et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 therefore to improve the future management of water resources we should take in consideration contrasting simulations for a specific lulc type combined with future projections of climate changes the fossil fuel and green road scenarios indicated contrasting outcomes for the hydrological dynamics in 2045 compared with the baseline scenario the fossil fuel scenario with 18 of forest is expected to result in increased water yields surface runoff and soil water contents and decreased evapotranspiration in contrast in the green road scenario which entails an increase of forest cover to 39 of the total area may lead to decreased water yields reduced surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 6 and increased evapotranspiration although the fossil fuel and green road scenarios involve changes in multiple lulc types as compared to the baseline scenario the most pronounced changes involve forest area table 1 this allowed us to explore the effect of forest on hydrological variables in general the green road scenario was associated with higher evapotranspiration and lower surface runoff water yield and soil water content compared to the fossil fuel scenario forest canopies can intercept about 20 of precipitation sari et al 2016 lulc scenarios developed with the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model in the same region as our study supported our finding that increases in forest areas are associated with increased evapotranspiration and decreased surface runoff soil water and water yields alvarenga et al 2016 for instance our analysis indicated that forest areas are associated with reduced surface runoff which can enhance water infiltration and reduce soil erosion and therefore land degradation didoné et al 2015 forests may also mitigate impacts of extreme climatic events that are predicted to happen more often in the future ipcc 2018 such as the precipitation up to 957 mm recorded in january 2020 causing severe flooding and landslides in some parts of our study region inmet 2020 while exploring the consequences of trajectories of socioeconomic development and public policies on water dynamics is complex and fraught with uncertainties our scenarios provide plausible and quantitative indications of what might happen if these scenarios unfold in the future the green road and fossil fuel lead to strongly contrasting water dynamics in the future highlighting the need for well informed policies for land and water management we encountered several challenges and limitations in our attempts to separate the effects of climate and lulc change on historic water dynamics and to explore hydrological dynamics in the future based on combined lulc and climate change scenarios first we lacked historical records of solar radiation and addressed this issue by estimating these data using the random forests algorithm second we used only one climate model hadgem2 es for exploring the future climatic conditions we identified that climate was the main driver of water dynamics between 1990 and 2015 and for future studies we recommend using multiple climatic models to explore the effects of different projections of precipitation patterns on the hydrology third our study did not explore the monthly dynamics of the streamflow in the same region of our study cecílio et al 2019 found that increasing forest cover in the upper areas of a basin can increase the minimum streamflow while the afforestation close to watercourses might reduce the minimum streamflow finally our study focused on streamflow water dynamics and we did not consider groundwater dynamics such as lateral flow and aquifer recharge although groundwater dynamics are important to understand the complete hydrology cycle in mountain regions a meaningful analysis of groundwater movement and aquifer recharge would require a more detailed approach melaku and wang 2019 shao et al 2019 for instance the combination of swat and the modflow model has been used to estimate surface groundwater interactions and recharge rates bailey et al 2016 semiromi and koch 2019 loukika et al 2020 therefore we recommend future studies to explore surface groundwater interactions and the monthly variation of hydrological variables to improve our understanding of the effects of lulc changes on water dynamics in the region 5 conclusions in this study we disentangled the effects of climate and lulc changes on historic and future water dynamics the analysis revealed that changes in climate patterns were the main drivers of historical water dynamics in the region furthermore the green road and fossil fuel scenarios with their specific socioeconomic narratives and associated lulc changes indicated strongly contrasting outcomes on hydrology in the study area the analysis of these scenarios indicated that an increase in forest area is expected to decrease surface runoff and the associated water yield and may mitigate the impacts of extreme precipitation events therefore socioeconomic development and public policies that favour the conservation and expansion of forest may contribute to watersheds to cope with weather extremes that are predicted to be more

4905,global changes in land use and land cover lulc and climate are expected to have profound impacts on water dynamics which are key for human wellbeing however we still lack understanding of how changes in climate patterns and lulc are likely to interact and govern the hydrology at the watershed level in tropical regions in the future here we assessed the contribution of changes in weather patterns and lulc on the hydrology of a watershed in southeast of brazil between 1990 and 2015 using the swat model in addition we explored the likely impacts of two contrasting lulc scenarios green road versus fossil fuel on the hydrology in 2045 under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 the watershed witnessed an increase in precipitation and streamflow in combination with an expansion of forest cover and coffee production while surface runoff 5 2 mm year 1 and water yield 252 mm year 1 increased soil water 24 6 mm year 1 and evapotranspiration 15 7 mm year 1 decreased the analysis indicated that changes in climate patterns are the main drivers of historical water dynamics in the region compared with fossil fuel scenario the increase in forest area in the green road scenario will lead to a decrease in surface runoff and consequently in water yield favouring water infiltration and soil erosion control and buffer against extreme precipitation events therefore the socioeconomic and public policies underlying the green road scenario that favour the expansion of forests can direct sustainable future water

inform management to reduce soil erosion in the rain season and sustain water availability in the dry season indeed a recent study in the zona da mata of minas gerais in brazil found that farmers perceived the provision of water as the most important ecosystem service teixeira et al 2018 therefore a better understanding of the separate effects of lulc and weather patterns on water dynamics can inform policy and management for sustainable water management disentangling the effects of lulc changes and climate change on water dynamics is challenging especially in heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes in tropical areas marhaento et al 2017 climate projections indicate that changes in temperature and precipitation can be anticipated across the globe ipcc 2018 which will have important implications for water dynamics and associated ecosystem services while the monitoring and analysis of long term hydrological data can provide important insights how lulc changes of the past have influenced streamflow zhang et al 2014 modelling allows for the integration of environmental and climate variables in order to explore water dynamics under scenarios of climate and lulc changes lópez moreno et al 2014 giri et al 2019 the swat model is used worldwide to model the hydrological dynamics in watersheds of varying size and contexts molina navarro et al 2018 tamm et al 2018 rani and sreekesh 2019 and to separate the individual effects of lulc changes and weather variables guo et al 2016 wang et al 2016 combining information about impacts of lulc changes on hydrology and projections of climate change allows the exploration of plausible scenarios for future water dynamics although simulations of deforestation and reforestation show that forest can reduce surface runoff and increase minimum streamflow in southeast brazil pereira et al 2016b de oliveira et al 2018 these have not been linked to policy and management actions for ensuring sustainable water dynamics in the future the aim of this study is to assess the relationship between historical changes in lulc and climate patterns on water dynamics and to explore impacts of future scenarios of lulc and climate changes on water dynamics in a watershed in the southeast of brazil specifically we aimed to i describe the historical trend of temperature precipitation and streamflow between 1990 and 2015 ii unravel the contributions of lulc and climate patterns on streamflow and water dynamics in this region and iii explore the impacts of contrasting scenarios of lulc under climate change on the water dynamics in 2045 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the muriaé river basin covering an area of 5 717 km2 in the southeast of the atlantic forest biome brazil fig 1 the altitude of the studied basin ranges from 113 m to almost 2000 m the climate is subtropical humid with mean temperature of 21 c and annual precipitation of 1300 mm the main soil types in the watershed are ferrasols and acrisols covering more than 80 of the area the main lulc types are pasture forest and coffee the region has been subject to major changes in lulc in the last three decades in contrast to many other tropical areas during the period 1986 2015 the region witnessed a decrease of pasture area from 76 to 58 and an increase in forest cover from 18 to 24 and coffee area from 3 to 11 gomes et al 2020 streamflow and precipitation data were obtained from six gauging stations from agência nacional das águas ana hidroweb and climate data were derived from three meteorological stations in or near the study area located in viçosa 698 m caparaó 843 m and itaperuna 113 m fig 1 appendix 1 2 2 swat model and input data we used swat to analyse how changes in lulc and weather affect water dynamics in the muriaé river basin swat simulates the hydrology based on the water balance concept eq 1 1 sw t s w r day q i e a p i qr i where sw is soil water content mm t is time rday is the amount of precipitation mm qi is the amount of surface runoff mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration mm pi is the amount of percolation mm and qri the amount of return flow mm for a detailed description of the components of the swat model we refer to neitsch et al 2011 the timestep for the model was one month swat delineates sub basins which are further divided in hydrologic response units hrus each hru represents a spatial unit with unique lulc soil type and slope characteristics we used maps of lulc of 1995 and 2015 with 30 30 m resolution to represent the dynamics of lulc change in the muriaé river basin from 1990 to 2015 fig 2 a b the lulc maps were developed using the random forest algorithm classification from images from landsat satellite 5 and 8 and had a performance of 0 90 for kappa and 0 93 for accuracy gomes et al 2020 the detailed lulc changes in quantitative terms in the sub basins are described in appendix 2 we used the map of 1995 to represent the period between 1990 and 2004 baseline period while the lulc map from 2015 represented the period between 2005 and 2015 the lulc maps contained six classes swat land use codes forest frst coffee coff pasture past urban area urhd eucalyptus plantations euca and campos rupestres a scrub grassy vegetation on rocks rngb for swat modelling we used the soil classes derived from the soil maps from the states of minas gerais and rio de janeiro fig 2c feam 2010 embrapa 2016 to account for the local tropical context strauch and volk 2013 dos santos et al 2018 we adjusted the swat vegetation index parameters as suggested by pereira et al 2016a b and used the soil physical hydraulic properties of each local soil class from the national soil survey randambrasil at a 1 1 000 000 scale radambrasil 1983 cooper et al 2005 the slope map was derived from the digital elevation model using arcgis software and was classified into five classes 0 8 8 15 15 25 25 45 and 45 fig 2d we used daily climatic records of precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from three meteorological stations fig 1 however data on solar radiation was only available for the station in viçosa from 2005 to 2015 therefore we used the solar radiation data from 2005 to 2015 to derive a predictive model using the random forests algorithm and the maximum temperature air humidity and daily daylight hours as explanatory variables to predict solar radiation for the three meteorological stations from 1990 to 2015 appendix 3 2 3 swat calibration validation and sensitivity analysis we simulated the streamflow in the muriaé river basin between 1990 and 2015 we calibrated the monthly streamflow for the period of 1990 1999 with the initial three years set as the model spin up period 1990 1992 with the observed streamflow from the upstream gauging station number 4 fig 3 we selected this gauging station since it is located upstream and is the most representative for the watershed abbaspour et al 2015 the spin up period is an essential step to obtain a representative state of the model for the watershed hydrology kim et al 2018 next we validated the model for the period 2000 2015 for model validation we used two performance indicators i the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 with the classification 0 75 nse 1 00 very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory nse 0 50 unsatisfactory and ii the percent bias pbias with values below 25 considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 aiming to identify the most important parameters that influence streamflow we conducted a global sensitivity analysis using p value 0 001 as a threshold for this purpose we used the swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the most sensitive parameters to changes in the historic streamflow were sol k sol awc cn2 alpha bf recharge dp and gw delay appendix 4 these parameters were estimated for the sub basin 4 and regionalized to the entire watershed which contained 612 hydrologic response units for the lulc map of 1995 and 780 for the map of 2015 the observed and simulated monthly average streamflow of gauging station 4 in the calibration period 1993 1999 were 15 42 11 02 and 16 04 9 70 mm respectively the performance indicators of the swat model for this period were 0 72 for nse and 3 3 for pbias in the validation period 2000 2015 the measured and simulated average monthly streamflow were 18 13 94 and 18 20 11 25 mm respectively and the performance indicators were 0 71 for nse and 20 4 for pbias the performance of the swat model for calibration and validation was good according to the performance criteria of moriasi et al 2007 2 4 historical trend analysis of hydro climatic variables we used the non parametric mann kendall test to identify significant trends in the annual time series of mean temperature precipitation and streamflow from 1990 to 2015 this rank based statistical method is extensively applied to series data and performs with robustness for non normally distributed data van belle and hughes 1984 guo et al 2016 here we conducted an uncertainty analysis using a 95 confidence interval i e 1 96 of the standard normal distribution 2 5 disentangling lulc and weather effects we used the separation method to assess the relative contribution of changes in lulc and variation in weather variables on historical water yield surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration dey and mishra 2017 we evaluated four simulations s1 s2 s3 and s4 consisting of pairwise combinations of two contrasting lulc maps 1995 vs 2015 and two climate data periods 1990 2004 vs 2005 2015 table 1 the contrast between s3 and s1 reflects the effect of variation in climate on water dynamics while the contrast between s4 and s3 indicated the effect of lulc change table 2 the difference between s4 and s1 represents the combined effect of changes in lulc and climate on water dynamics the relative impact of changes in climate was calculated as ec s3 s1 s4 s1 100 and changes in lulc as el s4 s3 s4 s1 100 2 6 future lulc and climatic scenarios to explore the effect of lulc changes and climate variability on hydrology for 2045 we developed three scenarios the baseline fossil fuel and green road the baseline scenario was based on the lulc map of 2015 while the green road and fossil fuel were based on projected lulc maps for two contrasting local scenarios consistent with the global socioeconomic shared pathways gomes et al 2020 the percentage forest area in the baseline lulc scenario is 24 while in the green road scenario forest area will expand to 39 and in the fossil fuel scenario the forest area will decrease to 18 and replaced mainly by pastures and coffee plantations fig 4 table 2 the three lulc scenarios were coupled with a climatic projection from 2020 to 2045 which was based on the global representative forcing pathway rcp 8 5 scenario of the hadgem2 es model a limitation of rcp scenarios is that the temperature and precipitation data have a coarse spatial resolution and are unsuitable for the finer resolution of our study therefore we used bias corrected climate projections from 2020 to 2045 generated with the change factor approach for this purpose the current hadgem2 es output values were subtracted from the simulated values for the future resulting in climate anomalies which were then added to the historic database for daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation resulting in future climate database from 2020 to 2045 tabor williams 2010 navarro racines and tarapues 2015 for the period 2035 2045 the mean temperature is expected to increase from 21 6 c to 22 9 c and precipitation will increase with 42 43 mm year 1 compared with the period of 2005 2015 3 results 3 1 historical trend analysis meteorological records from 1990 to 2015 indicate that the mean air temperature showed a significant increasing trend z 2 81 p 0 004 from 1990 to 2015 while there was no significant trend in precipitation and streamflow in this period precipitation z 0 48 p 0 62 streamflow z 0 06 p 0 54 fig 5 the mean air temperature varied from 21 6 c 3 5 between 1990 and 2004 to 22 4 c 2 9 between 2005 and 2015 fig 5 and appendix 5 3 2 disentangling effects of lulc and climate on historical hydrological variables the simulations s1 and s4 showed that the streamflow in the sub basins increased on average by 15 8 m3s 1 between 1990 and 2015 table 3 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 the simulated precipitation increased by 348 mm year 1 in the sub basins 1 2 and 6 while no changes were observed for sub basins 3 4 and 5 appendix 6 at the watershed level surface runoff of water increased by 5 2 mm year 1 as compared to the baseline period with a relative contribution of 155 by climate and 55 by lulc changes fig 6 a the drivers of surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 2 showed contrasting patterns compared to sub basin 3 and 4 the surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 2 were on average 8 mm year 1 higher than in the baseline period as a result of climatic changes 155 1 contribution and lulc changes 55 1 contribution on the other hand in sub basins 3 and 4 surface runoff increased by 3 6 mm year 1 with contributions from changes in lulc of 71 and 14 in sub basins 3 and 4 respectively water yields in the impacted period 2005 2015 increased on average by 252 mm year 1 as compared to the baseline period 1990 2004 as result of climate variability 97 and lulc changes 3 fig 6b at the sub basin level the effect of lulc was positive in sub basins 4 3 8 5 9 2 and 6 7 7 and negative in sub basins 1 0 6 2 0 3 and 3 1 7 at the overall watershed level the soil water content and evapotranspiration showed similar patterns with decreases of 24 6 and 15 7 mm year 1 respectively fig 6c d the change in soil water was due to climate variability 605 5 and lulc changes 505 5 while climate and lulc contributed 59 and 41 respectively to the decrease in evapotranspiration in contrast to the other sub basins sub basin 1 showed an increase of 27 6 mm year 1 in soil water and 63 8 in evapotranspiration fig 6c and d on the other hand in sub basin 3 soil water decreased by 56 2 mm year 1 and evapotranspiration by 98 3 mm year 1 fig 6c and d 3 3 exploring future water dynamic scenarios the green road and fossil fuel scenarios under the rcp 8 5 climate scenario resulted in contrasting hydrology outcomes in 2045 compared with the baseline scenario fig 7 in the fossil fuel scenario increases in water yield 1 5 surface runoff 10 7 soil water 1 2 and a decrease in evapotranspiration 1 9 are expected in contrast in the green road scenario decreases in water yield 3 and soil water 3 6 and increases in surface runoff 3 8 and evapotranspiration 4 2 may be anticipated the water yield tends to increase in all sub basin under the fossil fuel scenario in 2045 with increases up to 2 4 in sub basin 6 fig 7a in contrast in the green road scenario the water yield decreased by 4 4 in sub basin 5 fig 7b surface runoff is expected to increase in all sub basins for the fossil fuel scenario up to 15 in sub basins 2 and 3 fig 7c in the green road scenario surface runoff increased by up to 9 3 in sub basins 2 3 4 and 5 and decreased in sub basins 1 2 5 and 6 1 7 fig 7d soil water increased by up to 2 5 in the fossil fuel scenario fig 7e and decreased by 6 3 in the green road scenario fig 7f evapotranspiration showed a contrasting trend compared to soil water evaporation decreased by as much as 3 3 in the fossil fuel scenario fig 7g and increased by as much as 5 6 in the green road scenario fig 7h 4 discussion in this study we explored the effect of historic lulc changes on the hydrology in a sub tropical watershed between 1990 and 2015 and explored the potential consequences of future scenarios of lulc changes and climate for hydrological dynamics in 2045 our key messages are i the simulated river streamflow increased by 60 from 1990 to 2004 to 2005 2015 which was mostly explained by changes in climate patterns ii the contribution of lulc on the hydrology at the sub basin level depends strongly on climate conditions and iii scenarios for 2045 indicate that lulc changes can have a strong impact on water dynamics the simulated increase in river streamflow 15 8 m3s 1 between 1990 and 2004 and 2005 2015 was mainly attributed to the increase in the annual precipitation 348 mm rather than lulc changes we also found that surface runoff and water yield increased while the soil water and evapotranspiration decreased in the study period however it is difficult to link specific changes in lulc types appendix 2 to changes in streamflow for instance while the increase in forest area tend to decrease surface runoff and increase evapotranspiration expansion of urban areas is associated with increased surface runoff and decreased evapotranspiration in general forests can increase the water infiltration and groundwater recharge lopes et al 2020 ouyang et al 2019 and afforestation has been associated with reduced water yield and river streamflow due to increased evapotranspiration filoso et al 2017 in the last decades water management has mostly focussed on surface water such as streamflow of rivers however it is important to also consider soil water and the water flow by evapotranspiration which are essential to maintain ecosystem functioning falkenmark and rockström 2006 for instance although soil water can decrease with expansion of forests area higher rates of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis from trees can increase the frequency of precipitation and also improve human health by filtering pollution from the air ellison et al 2012 nowak et al 2014 therefore future studies on the effects of lulc changes on hydrology at the watershed level should go beyond the analysis of streamflow or water yield and also focus on soil water and evapotranspiration that are related to natural processes and the maintenance of ecosystem functions and services such information can complement our understanding of the effects of lulc changes on the water cycle and how this influences human wellbeing the analysis of the water balance at the sub basin level shows that the contribution of lulc on key hydrological variables depends on the actual weather conditions in cases of increased precipitation about 436 mm year 1 in sub basins 1 and 2 the climate was the most important driver of the increase in surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration while lulc changes were associated with a decrease of surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration fig 6 in contrast when there were no significant changes in precipitation lulc changes were the most important driver of increases of surface runoff and of decreases of soil water and evapotranspiration sub basins 3 and 4 our findings align with those of li et al 2016 2009 and shang et al 2019 who also identified changes in climate as main drivers of hydrology in various contexts lulc changes can be considered as a moderator of water dynamics which is strongly related to the quantity of precipitation in the environment global studies show that afforestation in drier areas has a stronger negative effect on water yield than in humid regions jackson et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 therefore to improve the future management of water resources we should take in consideration contrasting simulations for a specific lulc type combined with future projections of climate changes the fossil fuel and green road scenarios indicated contrasting outcomes for the hydrological dynamics in 2045 compared with the baseline scenario the fossil fuel scenario with 18 of forest is expected to result in increased water yields surface runoff and soil water contents and decreased evapotranspiration in contrast in the green road scenario which entails an increase of forest cover to 39 of the total area may lead to decreased water yields reduced surface runoff in sub basins 1 and 6 and increased evapotranspiration although the fossil fuel and green road scenarios involve changes in multiple lulc types as compared to the baseline scenario the most pronounced changes involve forest area table 1 this allowed us to explore the effect of forest on hydrological variables in general the green road scenario was associated with higher evapotranspiration and lower surface runoff water yield and soil water content compared to the fossil fuel scenario forest canopies can intercept about 20 of precipitation sari et al 2016 lulc scenarios developed with the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model in the same region as our study supported our finding that increases in forest areas are associated with increased evapotranspiration and decreased surface runoff soil water and water yields alvarenga et al 2016 for instance our analysis indicated that forest areas are associated with reduced surface runoff which can enhance water infiltration and reduce soil erosion and therefore land degradation didoné et al 2015 forests may also mitigate impacts of extreme climatic events that are predicted to happen more often in the future ipcc 2018 such as the precipitation up to 957 mm recorded in january 2020 causing severe flooding and landslides in some parts of our study region inmet 2020 while exploring the consequences of trajectories of socioeconomic development and public policies on water dynamics is complex and fraught with uncertainties our scenarios provide plausible and quantitative indications of what might happen if these scenarios unfold in the future the green road and fossil fuel lead to strongly contrasting water dynamics in the future highlighting the need for well informed policies for land and water management we encountered several challenges and limitations in our attempts to separate the effects of climate and lulc change on historic water dynamics and to explore hydrological dynamics in the future based on combined lulc and climate change scenarios first we lacked historical records of solar radiation and addressed this issue by estimating these data using the random forests algorithm second we used only one climate model hadgem2 es for exploring the future climatic conditions we identified that climate was the main driver of water dynamics between 1990 and 2015 and for future studies we recommend using multiple climatic models to explore the effects of different projections of precipitation patterns on the hydrology third our study did not explore the monthly dynamics of the streamflow in the same region of our study cecílio et al 2019 found that increasing forest cover in the upper areas of a basin can increase the minimum streamflow while the afforestation close to watercourses might reduce the minimum streamflow finally our study focused on streamflow water dynamics and we did not consider groundwater dynamics such as lateral flow and aquifer recharge although groundwater dynamics are important to understand the complete hydrology cycle in mountain regions a meaningful analysis of groundwater movement and aquifer recharge would require a more detailed approach melaku and wang 2019 shao et al 2019 for instance the combination of swat and the modflow model has been used to estimate surface groundwater interactions and recharge rates bailey et al 2016 semiromi and koch 2019 loukika et al 2020 therefore we recommend future studies to explore surface groundwater interactions and the monthly variation of hydrological variables to improve our understanding of the effects of lulc changes on water dynamics in the region 5 conclusions in this study we disentangled the effects of climate and lulc changes on historic and future water dynamics the analysis revealed that changes in climate patterns were the main drivers of historical water dynamics in the region furthermore the green road and fossil fuel scenarios with their specific socioeconomic narratives and associated lulc changes indicated strongly contrasting outcomes on hydrology in the study area the analysis of these scenarios indicated that an increase in forest area is expected to decrease surface runoff and the associated water yield and may mitigate the impacts of extreme precipitation events therefore socioeconomic development and public policies that favour the conservation and expansion of forest may contribute to watersheds to cope with weather extremes that are predicted to be more

4906,modelling groundwater surface water gw sw interactions at scales of large river basins is a difficult challenge in this study a fully integrated surface water groundwater model accounting for hydrologic seasonality is developed for the 766 000 km2 laurentian great lakes basin and applied towards the characterization of groundwater lake gw lake interactions in the five great lakes under monthly normal climatology the simulated annual average rates of direct groundwater discharge to lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario through the combined lakebed and 8 km wide band of shoreline surrounding each lake are 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively thus direct groundwater discharge accounts for a small component of positive basin supply ranging from 0 6 for lake ontario to 1 3 for lake michigan with an overall average of 0 8 for all lakes combined simulation results demonstrate that gw lake interactions are strongest nearshore and vary temporally in response to seasonal fluctuations in both lake levels and terrestrial groundwater levels in nearshore regions in winter direct groundwater discharge dominates the gw lake interactions in both the distal and nearshore lakebed areas in summer the combined effects of rising lake levels and lowering terrestrial groundwater levels lead to notable reductions in direct groundwater discharge through nearshore areas direct groundwater discharge is also shown to vary spatially with highest rates associated with areas containing thick phanerozoic hydrostratigraphy as opposed to precambrian basement rock the results from this study indicate that the great lakes primarily act as groundwater receivers gaining considerable amounts of water directly from the basin s groundwater system keywords laurentian great lakes basin integrated hydrologic model groundwater lake interactions regional scale hydrologic modelling seasonal hydrologic cycles groundwater discharge 1 introduction the laurentian great lakes basin glb includes the five great lakes lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario and their catchment areas fig 1 it covers an area of approximately 766 000 km2 including 244 000 km2 of water epa 2015 and holds approximately 21 of the earth s fresh surface water although abundant with fresh water the great lakes are not excluded from the stresses being imposed upon global water resources as there is currently unprecedented pressure on both water quantity and quality from population growth agricultural and industrial development as well as uncertainties associated with climate change d orgeville et al 2014 howard and gerber 2018 morrice et al 2008 peltier et al 2018 cole et al 1999 groundwater and surface water in the glb are closely interconnected grannemann et al 2000 holtschlag and nicholas 1998 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 hence changes in groundwater quantity or quality may result in degraded surface water resources and vice versa conant jr et al 2019 robinson 2015 winter et al 1998 however processes driving large scale groundwater surface water gw sw interactions are difficult to observe and quantify and require a full understanding of the combined influence that climate topography soils geology land cover and meteorology have on water movement clark et al 2015 shrestha et al 2014 accordingly gw sw interactions have been recognized as an important focal point for the study of water resources globally blöschl et al 2007 and within the glb grannemann et al 2000 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 groundwater flows into the great lakes either directly across the lakebeds and shorelines or indirectly as baseflow via rivers and streams direct gw discharge to the great lakes is thought to play an important role in maintaining water quality and ecological environment of the great lakes grannemann et al 2000 however most studies on direct groundwater discharge to date have focused only on lake michigan and it is generally recognized that there is insufficient evidence to estimate direct groundwater discharge into the other lakes grannemann and weaver 1999 for lake michigan large scale groundwater modelling has been employed to characterize direct groundwater discharge with hoaglund et al 2002 using a modflow model to characterize groundwater inflow and outflow from the michigan peninsula and feinstein et al 2010 using modflow and seawat models to characterize groundwater changes over the 1864 2005 time interval within the entire lake michigan basin knights et al 2017 have investigated direct groundwater discharge along the u s portion of the great lakes shoreline through a water budget analysis however to date there has not yet been a basin wide attempt to characterize the direct groundwater discharge into the laurentian great lakes characterizing gw lake interactions within the entire glb is a challenging task that is well suited to a regional scale model which is able to fully integrate all the relevant hydrological processes and physically resolve gw sw interactions barthel and banzhaf 2016 fatichi et al 2016 furthermore the influence of seasonality should be incorporated into future hydrologic modelling of the glb given that the pronounced influence of intra annual climate variability on the hydrologic characteristics of the basin are well known erler et al 2019a b ghanbari and bravo 2008 pietroniro et al 2007 however the development of a fully integrated model can be expected to be constrained by data availability barthel and banzhaf 2016 and computational ability due to the current lack of basin scale hydrostratigraphic and hydraulic property characterization frey et al 2016 grid discretization constraints and challenges with transient process representation additional investigative work is needed in order to establish the role of fully integrated models in helping to better understand the hydrologic characteristics of the glb while the feasibility of fully integrated models has recently been demonstrated for detailed regional scale approximately 100 000 150 000 km2 hydrologic analysis frey et al 2020 hwang et al 2018 and for more abstracted continental scale analysis under steady state conditions chen et al 2020 maxwell et al 2015 as well as transient conditions maxwell and condon 2016 they have not yet been applied towards detailed analysis of gw lake interaction at the scale of the glb accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a fully integrated gw sw model for the glb 2 apply the model towards a water balance analysis of the glb and provide an estimate of direct gw discharge into the great lakes and 3 investigate basin wide temporal and spatial variability of gw lake interactions this study is the first of its kind to utilize a large scale fully integrated hydrologic model for characterizing groundwater discharge into all five of the laurentian great lakes within a single simulation of the entire basin 2 model development the hydrologic model employed for this study is hydrogeosphere hgs which is a control volume finite element difference model that fully couples a richards equation based 3 dimensional 3 d variably saturated subsurface flow solution with a 2 dimensional 2 d diffusion wave solution for surface flow evapotranspiration processes are simulated in hgs using the formulation presented in kristensen and jensen kristensen and jensen 1975 additional details on the hgs model the processes it employs and numerical methods are provided in the hgs user manual aquanty

encompasses the entire glb area including all five of the great lakes and their subbasins fig 1 the simulated river tributaries for each of the great lakes are illustrated in fig 1b the surface topography across the glb fig 1c was produced by stitching a digital elevation model dem together from 3 different sources namely 1 the ontario enforced dem with a resolution of 30 m which is a hydrologically conditioned surface elevation raster created using the provincial dem and the enhanced watercourse network https geohub lio gov on ca datasets ontario integrated hydrology data 2 a great lakes bathymetry data set with a 3 arc second resolution approximately 90 m from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ngdc noaa gov mgg greatlakes and 3 the hydrosheds data set with a resolution of 83 4 m lehner et al 2008 in the combined dem the resolution was unified to 83 4 m the stream networks were burned into the dem with the minimum amount of vertical correction required to enforce downgradient flow in the surface water network bedrock topography data were obtained from the ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines gao et al 2006 for the southern ontario portion and from the united states geological survey for the u s portion of the model domain soller et al 2012 because of limited bedrock topography data in northern ontario a bedrock surface for the ontario portion of the glb not covered by the gao et al 2006 dataset was created by vertically offseting the dem by 3 m in order to reflect the thin or non existant overburden

freeze and cherry 1979 lappala 1978 olcott 1992 and manually adjusted during model calibration see section 2 3 underlying the quaternary geology layers are two bedrock layers the top bedrock layer was set to a 5 m thickness with a uniform kh of 5 0 10 6 m s with the intention of representing the effect of fractures in shallow bedrock with an equivalent porous media approach underlying the fractured bedrock and extending to the base of the model at 600 m below sea level is a bedrock layer with a kh of 1 0 10 10 m s the influence of deep basin brine density on groundwater flow is not incorporated into the simulation framework as the study herein is focused on the shallow gw system and the bedrock hydrostratigraphy does not carry enough resolution to vertically constrain brine extent to represent anisotropy in quaternary and bedrock units kv values were set one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding kh values in regions of the model domain where quaternary deposits are absent bedrock was extended through the upper layers of the 3 d grid to the base of the soil the river network deployed in the model was derived from hydrosheds 15 arc second resolution vector data lehner et al 2008 simplified such that only river segments with greater than 2500 contributing cells or approximately a 250 km2 catchment area within the hydrosheds 15 arc second dem were represented a total of 53 stream gauging stations were incorporated into the river network so as to provide a spatially distributed set of simulated surface water flow rates for model evaluation fig 2 of which 25 are located in canada ec 2016 and 28 are located in the u s usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis sw with additional details provided in table s4 the gauging stations were selected based on location catchment area and data availability between 1981 and 2010 of particular interest is gauge no 21 wsc station 02ha003 which is located along the niagara river and has a drainage area of 686 000 km2 and gauge no a1 wsc station 02ha019 located along the welland canal near lake erie the welland canal flows parallel to the niagara river but due to mesh resolution constraints it is not represented in the model hence simulated flow rates at gauge no 21 also include flows from gauge no a1 which averaged 206 m3 s for the 1984 2010 gauge record the gauge closest to the model outflow location along the st lawrence river is no a2 wsc station 02mc002 which is located about 40 km downstream from the simulated outlet of the glb and has flow data available to 1993 with a total drainage area of 774 000 km2 gauge no a2 has a catchment area slightly larger than the model domain therefore before comparing to simulation output the gauge data were scaled using the ratio of the respective catchment areas i e model domain area gauge catchment area to assess the model s ability to reproduce groundwater heads a total of 416 monitoring wells were configured into the domain of which 352 are located in canada and 64 are located in the u s fig 2b the canadian monitoring well data was obtained from the ontario provincial groundwater monitoring network https www ontario ca environment and energy map provincial groundwater monitoring network and the u s monitoring well data was obtained from the usgs national ground water monitoring network usgs https cida usgs gov ngwmn a comparison between average observed and simulated groundwater levels was made for both overburden and bedrock wells 2 2 climatology and model forcing the climatology of the glb is complex and requires careful consideration in hydrologic simulations due to their thermal inertia the great lakes exert a profound influence on the seasonal cycle of the region winter temperatures in the vicinity of the lakes are considerably warmer than they would otherwise be bryan et al 2015 notaro et al 2013 and because the lakes do not all completely freeze the warm water surface acts as an ample supply of moisture during the cold season resulting in prominent snow belts downwind of the lakes gula and peltier 2012 notaro et al 2015 conversely in summer the cooler lake surface stabilizes the atmosphere and may act to suppress convection over the lakes and within their immediate vicinity holman et al 2012 this leads to spatial and seasonal precipitation patterns that are highly heterogeneous fig 3 monthly normal gridded 1 12 degree resolution liquid water flux and potential evapotranspiration pet for the 1981 to 2010 time interval was obtained from the natural resources canada nrcan dataset described in mckenney et al 2011 and used as forcing data for the terrestrial portion of the glb model pet is calculated based on the diurnal temperature range hogg 1997 while liquid water flux was computed as the sum of liquid precipitation and snowmelt because snowmelt is not measured directly it was estimated from changes in snow water equivalent swe which in turn was estimated from snow depth using a snow density climatology sturm et al 1995 because snow depth data in the mckenney et al 2011 dataset is only available for canada archived snow depth data from the canadian meteorological center daily analysis was used for the u s part of the basin brown and brasnett 2010 a comparison of the two snow data products over canada suggests that their resulting snowmelt rates are very similar climate forcing over the water surface of the great lakes requires separate consideration because the seasonal cycle of evaporation from the lakes is different from et over land with the peak in fall or winter and the minimum in spring or summer this is due to the thermal inertia of deep lakes and the difference in water vapor pressure between the lake surface and the atmosphere the strength of this effect is a function of lake depth and is most pronounced for lake superior peak in december while it is relatively weak for lake erie peak in october the former being the deepest at 147 m average depth and the latter comparatively shallow at about 19 m for this reason a seasonal cycle of lake evaporation was prescribed using a uniform monthly normal value for each of the great lakes using estimates from the noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory hunter et al 2015 hunter and croley 1993 based on the large lake thermodynamic model lltm croley and assel 1994 furthermore it was found that using the mckenney et al 2011 precipitation data over the lakes resulted in a high flow bias in the glb model therefore the estimates for over lake precipitation from hunter and croley 1993 have been adopted which are somewhat lower and result in more realistic net basin supply nbs we note that although lake ice was not considered explicitly its effect is fully accounted for in the evaporation estimates from the lltm the climatology data was applied to the glb model in two phases first 30 year 1981 2010 annual average precipitation and pet values were used to spin the model up to a steady state condition once achieved the steady state condition was used as an initial condition for monthly normal simulations where the model was forced with monthly average liquid water influx and pet as determined from the 1981 2010 interval this average seasonal cycle was then repeated until a year over year dynamic equilibrium state was achieved all model analysis was conducted on simulation results generated under dynamic equilibrium conditions it should be emphasized that for the purposes of this study 30 year monthly normal climatology provides model forcing data that captures typical seasonal variability and hence provides a basis for resolving the transient behavior of gw lake interactions over an average annual cycle it should also be noted that while the model forcing data were provided with monthly temporal resolution the hgs simulation used time steps ranging from approximately one hour to a maximum of one day that dynamically adapted according to the magnitude of incremental hydrologic change within the domain simulation time was approximately 7 days to reach the steady state initial condition and approximately 3 days to reach dynamic equilibrium monthly normal conditions when utilizing 4 physical cores of an intel i7 6700 t cpu 2 80 ghz with 16 0 gb ram 2 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis a fully integrated model at the scale of the glb has an intractable number of degrees of freedom if all parameters were to be perturbed during calibration however in a relative sense land surface properties such as topography and river location soil type land cover and bathymetry are well constrained by existing data when compared to subsurface properties for this reason model calibration primarily focused on tuning the hydraulic conductivity values associated with the surficial and bedrock hydrostratigraphy although it should be noted that channel elevations along the lake huron lake erie and the lake erie lake ontario river connections were also manually adjusted in order to improve the match between simulated and observed lake levels as one of the objectives of this study is to characterize direct groundwater discharge into the great lakes constraining the influence of the subsurface parameterization on surface water behavior helps ensure that groundwater flow is also constrained this was achieved by focusing the calibration process on optimizing the match between simulated vs observed stream flow rates while the evaluation of groundwater simulation performance provided validation that the model was adequately capturing the spatially varying groundwater levels across the basin the hydraulic conductivity values derived via manual calibration for each of the hydrostratigraphic layers are reported in table s3 and all subsequent analysis utilizes results from the calibrated model to further support the assessment of the model s ability to capture the integrated hydrologic behavior of the glb simulated lake levels for each of the 5 great lakes were visually compared against monthly normal lake levels over the 1981 to 2010 time interval from both a magnitude and cyclicity perspective as previously mentioned the largest data gap during the model construction process is the lack of detailed hydrostratigraphic and hydraulic property characterization for the subsurface to assess the potential impact of the associated uncertainties on model behavior a sensitivity analysis was conducted wherein hydraulic conductivity k values for quaternary fractured bedrock and bedrock layers were perturbed the base k values were both increased high k case and reduced low k case by one order of magnitude and then the changes in streamflow and gw lake interactions were assessed 3 results 3 1 model performance simulated vs observed monthly normal flow rates at two of the main gauge stations namely no 21 and no a2 fig 2a which are located along the niagara and st lawrence rivers respectively are presented in fig 4 while equivalent comparison plots for all other gauge locations are presented in fig s6 it is important to note that the incorporation of surface water diversions such as the chicago ogoki and long lake diversions quinn and edstrom 2000 were not included as surface water sources and sinks however with a net inflow to the glb of approximately 65 m3 s it is not expected that the diversions would have a notable impact on the simulation results good agreement between simulated and observed hydrographs in the context of both magnitude and seasonality is demonstrated in fig 4 the difference between the annual average simulated and observed flowrates is 217 m3 s 3 5 of the observed annual average flowrate in the niagara river fig 4a and 179 m3 s 2 3 of the observed annual average flowrate in the st lawrence river fig 4b overall the majority of simulated hydrographs are in good visual agreement with the observations with respect to both the flow rates and the seasonal cycles high flow during the spring freshet and low flow during the summer when et peaks with acceptable i e 0 5 values of nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficients observed at 26 of the calibration locations however there are 27 locations where the model underperforms with respect to the nse criteria even though visual evaluation confirms that the magnitude and seasonality of surface water flow is generally well captured failure to meet the nse criteria at all locations is not unexpected for a number of reasons including 1 surface water management i e dams is not incorporated into the model 2 there is high uncertainty associated with precipitation and snowmelt 3 model resolution precludes full representation of low order streams and rivers and 4 because of the non linear hydrologic response to climate variability the monthly normal model forcing data will not necessarily result in monthly normal flow rates fig 5 shows the simulated vs observed water levels meters above sea level masl in the monitoring wells used to evaluate groundwater simulation performance the monitoring wells are divided into two groups namely bedrock wells fig 5a and overburden wells fig 5b depending on the hydrostratigraphy at the well screen depth overall the simulated water levels are in reasonable agreement with observations with an r2 of 0 96 for bedrock wells and 0 95 for overburden wells thus validating that the groundwater component of the glb is adequately reproduced by the model 3 2 extended lake surface area elsa based net basin supply in this section the seasonal cycle of net basin supply components lake level fluctuations and gw lake interactions will be discussed again because the model was forced with 30 year monthly normals the results are representative of a long term average dynamic equilibrium for the purpose of this study an extended lake surface area elsa was defined for each of the great lakes in which the exchange between groundwater and the lakes through both lakebed and the adjacent subsurface is investigated for all five lakes the elsa extends 8 km beyond the actual lake boundary fig 6 a fence composed of linear segments encircling the elsa was used in the model to capture all streamflow including surface runoff and indirect groundwater discharge baseflow from the basin land area into each of the great lakes consistent with holtschlag and nicholas 1998 net basin supply nbs for each lake is defined as the sum of streamflow passing through the fence plus precipitation minus evaporation it does not include the main outlet or inlet for water balance calculations in this context over lake precipitation and evaporation are integrated over the elsa instead of the actual lake surface area monthly average rates of precipitation evaporation streamflow and nbs computed over the elsa of each of the lakes are shown in fig 7 it is evident that lakes superior michigan and huron receive considerably more annual precipitation on account of their large sizes however when annual average precipitation volumes are normalized to surface area the results for each of the five lakes are similar although the temporal patterns do vary with lakes superior and michigan showing more seasonal variability in precipitation than lakes erie and ontario unlike precipitation lake evaporation is shown to vary significantly over the year for all lakes with peaks in fall winter and minima in spring summer this is because during the winter months relatively dry air combined with a warm water surface result in high evaporation while during the summer months relatively moist air combined with a cold lake surface result in less evaporation lake erie has the earliest evaporation peak in october because it is relatively shallow and has less thermal inertia compared to the other great lakes furthermore based on the noaa glerl dataset condensation on the lake surface is found to occur over lake superior during june and july and over lake huron during may and june which was included in the liquid water flux forcing dataset as pointed out earlier streamflow fig 7c also manifests a pronounced seasonal cycle that is driven by snowmelt and evapotranspiration over land due to the large area encompassed by the great lakes over lake precipitation and evaporation are of first order importance and of similar magnitude as surface runoff hunter and croley 1993 fig 7d illustrates how the elsa based nbs for each lake rises to a peak in the spring corresponding to the spring freshet and drops to a minimum in fall and winter corresponding to the lake evaporation peak nbs components integrated over the actual lake boundaries not the elsa are shown in fig s7 apart from a small difference in over lake precipitation and evaporation and a small shift in the seasonal cycle due to differences in over land et the values are very similar and hence basing calculations on the elsa is not expected to significantly affect the results 3 3 water level fluctuations in the great lakes the great lakes form a dynamic system where the water levels vary naturally on short seasonal and inter annual time scales short term fluctuations include wind driven set ups storm surges and seiches standing waves and last no more than a few days seasonal fluctuations are mainly driven by seasonal changes in nbs due to evaporation and snowmelt runoff the longer term fluctuations occur as the result of climate variability on inter annual to decadal time scales due to their importance seasonal lake level fluctuations will be discussed and compared against observed water levels for each of the great lakes in this study the observed lake level data at the master gauge of each lake have been obtained from noaa glerl https www glerl noaa gov data dashboard data monthly normal lake levels reflect the 1981 to 2010 time interval fig 8 illustrates the observed and model predicted water levels in each of the great lakes predicted conditions in lakes superior and ontario match the observations very well in terms of water levels and seasonal variations deviating only 0 01 m from the observed annual mean lake superior has the highest water level with a predicted annual mean of 183 35 masl 183 36 masl observed and lake ontario has the lowest with a simulated annual mean of 74 83 masl 74 82 masl observed lakes michigan huron and erie on the other hand exhibit biases in predicted annual average lake levels but the simulated seasonal cycle matches the observed seasonal cycle closely lakes michigan and huron are hydraulically connected and are usually treated as one lake for the purpose of lake level records nevertheless simulated water levels for lake michigan are 0 04 m higher than for lake huron 178 34 m and 178 30 masl which is consistent with the fact that lake michigan drains through lake huron the lakes are also hydraulically connected in the model the observed annual average water level in lake michigan huron is 176 45 masl almost 2 m lower than predicted similarly the observed water levels for lake erie annual mean 174 32 masl are lower than simulated values annual mean 175 54 masl but the seasonal cycle is again well captured in the numerical simulations herein lake levels were found to be primarily governed by two factors net basin supply and outlet bathymetry since the flow rates at the niagara and st lawrence gauges are reasonably well captured it is more likely that the lake level biases are caused by errors in the outlet bathymetry lake huron and lake erie are drained by the st clair detroit and niagara rivers respectively which at their narrowest points are only about 200 300 m wide and protected by embankments this is much smaller than the mesh resolution which means that errors in the bathymetry of the outlet are unavoidable lake superior and ontario are drained by the st mary s and st lawrence rivers which at their narrowest points are over 600 m wide and hence the bathymetry is inherently better captured in the mesh considering the scale of the model and the complexity of the outlet geometry in the natural system a 1 to 2 m bias in water levels is considered acceptable for the purposes of this study especially considering that the seasonal water level variability is well reproduced for all lakes fig 8 when further considering the impact of lake level biases on simulation results it should be noted that because an average annual seasonal cycle is being simulated the surface water and groundwater systems are in a state of year over year dynamic equilibrium and the groundwater table in the vicinity of the lakes is aligned with the lake levels hence a 2 m bias in lake levels will not have a notable influence on simulated gw lake interactions seasonal fluctuations in lake water levels are primarily controlled by changes in nbs comparing figs 7 and 8 it is evident that nbs peaks approximately two to three months before water levels peak a delay of this magnitude is expected since nbs variation represents a rate of change in lake volumes furthermore the temporal cycle of nbs can also explain the differences in the timing of lake level peaks between different lakes due to the depth and thermal inertia of lake superior evaporation peaks relatively late delaying the seasonal cycle compared to shallower lakes while the reverse is the case for relatively shallow lake erie leading to an earlier peak in lake levels 3 4 groundwater lake interactions in the previous section when discussing nbs the exchange fluxes between groundwater and the great lakes were not described however gw lake interactions can be important for understanding a lake system yihdego et al 2017 although groundwater exchange with lake michigan has been modelled and quantified feinstein et al 2010 the gw lake interactions for the other great lakes remain poorly understood as discussed previously the spatial and temporal variability of gw lake interactions requires further investigation in the model employed here surface water and groundwater are fully coupled and therefore the dynamic water exchange between groundwater and the lakes can be quantified in the following sections the simulated groundwater discharge to and recharge from the great lakes will be addressed in terms of both spatial and temporal variability fig 9 shows direct groundwater discharge to and recharge from the lakes in m s through the lakebeds and the 8 kilometer wide extended area around the great lakes during winter in january panel a and summer in july panel b the difference between winter and summer is clearly evident implying that the interactions between the groundwater system and the lakes undergo seasonal changes in winter direct groundwater discharge dominates the gw lake interactions in both the lakebed areas and the extended area fig 9a however in summer groundwater recharge from the lakes tends to dominate in the lakebed areas while direct groundwater discharge from the extended surface area decreases significantly fig 9b as discussed previously water levels in the great lakes fluctuate by several tens of centimeters throughout the year with peaks in summer and troughs in winter however the groundwater table on land generally shows the opposite pattern with a minimum in late summer due to strong et erler et al 2019b fig s8 the phase shift in the seasonal cycle sets up a reversal in hydraulic gradients that occurs in spring and fall with the net result being that direct gw discharge into the lakes dominates the exchange process during winter and gw recharge from the lakes has a stronger influence on the exchange process during summer the seasonal reversals in hydraulic gradients has also been observed in a field study conducted in lake erie by haack et al 2005 who obtained measurements that are consistent with the seasonal changes observed in the modelling work herein compared to the other lakes the discharge and recharge pattern of lake erie fig 9 appears anomalous this can be attributed to the fact that lake erie water levels peak and decline earlier such that lake erie is already in the transition phase during the months of january and july that are depicted in fig 9 in actuality discharge into lake erie peaks in november and hence the discharge pattern for lake erie in november is much like the homogenous patterns observed for the other lakes in january from fig 9 it can also be seen that significant amounts of direct groundwater discharge occur near the shorelines this is consistent with previous modelling studies feinstein et al 2010 and field observations knights et al 2017 as well as inferences from previous studies grannemann et al 2000 grannemann and weaver 1999 in order to characterize the contribution of direct groundwater discharge and recharge relative to the shoreline position three zones of analysis see fig 6 have been defined as the extended lake area including the lakebed and the 8 kilometer wide elsa the lakebed and a reduced lakebed area decreased by 4 km from the lake boundary annual average flow rates across different zones are shown in fig 10 for each of the lakes the total direct groundwater discharge through the extended lake area is much higher than through the lakebed alone indicating that groundwater discharge through the 8 kilometer wide extended ring makes the largest contribution to the total direct groundwater discharge similarly the direct groundwater discharge is considerably higher through the entire lakebed than through the reduced lakebed area implying that the discharge through the 4 kilometer wide nearshore lakebed area makes a much larger contribution than the remaining inner portion of the lakebed area direct groundwater discharge from the nearshore area that encompasses both the 8 kilometer wide elsa and 4 kilometer wide inner lakebed ring contributes nearly 90 of the total gw discharge to lakes superior michigan huron and erie and 76 of the gw discharge to lake ontario whereas the contribution of direct gw discharge from the reduced lakebed area is small 24 for lake ontario and approximately 10 for the other lakes it should also be noted that direct gw discharge to the lakes through the elsa will invariably include inflow from low order streams not resolved in the mesh while it can be expected that these stream segments would receive considerable gw discharge in a traditional sense this would usually be considered indirect gw contribution to the lakes however for the purposes of this study it is quantified as direct gw discharge total annual gw discharge through the combined elsa and inner lakebed ring normalized per km of shoreline is presented in fig s9 in the si compared to gw discharge gw recharge tends to be less dominated by the near shore margin and more uniform across the entire lakebed fig 10 which is most apparent for lakes erie and ontario interestingly direct gw discharge through the reduced inner lakebed area is very close to groundwater recharge indicating that in a dynamic equilibrium state the annual net gw lake exchange flux is minimal hence for an annual water budget analysis that incorporates gw lake interactions it may be reasonable to focus primarily on the nearshore environment 3 5 groundwater discharge influences on basin hydrology the simulation results clearly show that direct groundwater discharge to the great lakes is significantly larger than groundwater recharge from the great lakes this supports the concept that the great lakes commonly act as groundwater receivers which has been put forth in previous research grannemann and weaver 1999 neff and nicholas 2005 narrowing in on the role of groundwater in the overall water balance of the great lakes fig 11 depicts the monthly time series of total direct groundwater discharge rates positive basin water supply pbs and the percentage of direct groundwater discharge to pbs where pbs is defined as the sum of all the positive contributions to nbs runoff over lake elsa precipitation and in this case direct groundwater discharge for all of the great lakes pbs fig 11b follows a pattern similar to that of streamflow fig 7c with spring peaks and summer troughs while over lake elsa precipitation is a significant component of pbs the influence of other hydrologic drivers is also evident in the seasonal signal with the spring to early summer peak in pbs attributable to snowmelt and runoff and the late summer trough associated with high evapotranspiration on the land surface in general lakes superior michigan and huron have a more pronounced seasonal cycle compared to lakes erie and ontario which is consistent with the precipitation patterns shown in figs 3 and 7a the estimated annual average rates of direct groundwater discharge to lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario are 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively fig 10 compared to pbs fig 11b direct groundwater discharge is a small input to the lakes with the annual average ratio of direct groundwater discharge to pbs fig 11c ranging from 0 6 for lake ontario to 1 3 for lake michigan with an overall ratio of 0 8 when all lakes are considered as noted in previous work knights et al 2017 and observed again here direct groundwater discharge to lake michigan is higher than discharge to the other great lakes which can in part be attributed to the relatively high hydraulic conductivities of the quaternary materials in the vicinity of the lake and especially along the michigan peninsula fig s5 overall lakes erie and ontario receive the lowest amount of direct groundwater discharge which is primarily attributable to their comparably small length of shoreline which highlights that among the drivers of total gw discharge shoreline length is an important consideration on an annual average basis direct groundwater discharge relative to nbs is 1 6 2 4 1 1 2 3 and 0 9 for lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively for all great lakes combined gw discharge is 1 6 of nbs which is approximately double the gw component of pbs when interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that anthropogenic gw extraction was not incorporated into the model and hence the groundwater pumping in lake michigan s sub basin feinstein et al 2010 as well as across the rest of the glb are not reflected in the results the gw discharge rates for lake michigan range from 10 7 m3 s in august to 65 7 m3 s in january which is comparable to estimates provided by grannemann and weaver 1999 in their review of previous work showing that direct groundwater discharge to lake michigan ranges from 23 m3 s to 190 m3 s at a larger scale knights et al 2017 estimated the direct groundwater discharge along the u s portions of the shorelines of all great lakes and for lake michigan they report a total direct groundwater discharge rate of 30 8 m3 s which is in line with this study in contrast feinstein et al 2010 estimated a total direct groundwater discharge of 9 6 m3 s to lake michigan under predevelopment conditions with no pumping this value is much smaller than the previous estimates however they suggested that the groundwater discharge rate might be up to 3 8 times greater if their model resolution was refined for lakes superior huron erie and ontario knights et al 2017 report direct groundwater discharge rates of 17 1 14 0 13 3 and 5 1 m3 s respectively across the u s portion of the shoreline when these values are scaled to the full shoreline length the approximate total gw discharge rates are 30 6 36 7 22 2 and 12 1 m3 s for the respective lakes in comparison the work herein estimates the annual average direct gw discharge to lakes superior and ontario at 29 0 and 11 6 m3 s respectively which is in good agreement with the scaled values from knights et al 2017 in contrast for lake huron the annual average groundwater discharge of 24 5 m3 s computed here is somewhat smaller than the scaled value from knights et al 2017 however from fig 9 it is evident that direct discharge rates along the north and northeast coast of lake huron are significantly smaller than those along the west and southwest coast such that scaling estimates based on the u s coast alone would likely lead to inflated estimates for the entire lake similarly the average gw discharge rate of 11 9 m3 s predicted for lake erie is much smaller than the scaled value of 22 2 m3 s obtained from knights et al 2017 in the case of lake erie the differences cannot be fully explained by heterogeneous discharge along the shoreline which highlights that these types of estimates are still highly uncertain in fact it can be argued that in light of the large uncertainties the actual difference in estimated gw discharge between the different studies is relatively small knights et al 2017 also conducted a field scale study at the end of summer to measure direct groundwater discharge rates to lake erie through a small section of shoreline where they found the measured discharge rate of 354 25 m3 year per meter length of shoreline to be lower than their estimate of 588 181 m3 year per meter length made in the large scale analysis for comparison the average gw discharge predicted herein for lake erie is 391 m3 year per meter length of shoreline note however that knights et al 2017 conducted their field study in september when according to the seasonal cycle shown in fig 11 discharge values can be expected to be about 30 lower than the annual average hence accounting for seasonal variation would reconcile the two values obtained by knights et al 2017 and provide independent confirmation for the magnitude of seasonal variations in direct groundwater discharge it should be noted that the gw lake interactions in this study are all simulated under long term monthly normal conditions without consideration of gw pumping according to feinstein et al 2010 the average net pumping rate pumping minus injection within the lake michigan region was 790 mgal d between 1980 and 2005 they estimated that gw pumping diverted groundwater flows and reduced the direct gw discharge to lake michigan by 12 mgal d or about 5 5 of the total gw discharge rate under predevelopment conditions considering that gw pumping in other regions within the glb is much less intensive than in the lake michigan region the effect of pumping on the direct gw discharge at the basin scale is expected to be considerably lower therefore it is not expected that the omission of gw pumping from this work will have any material impact on the results 4 model sensitivity and limitations 4 1 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis fig 12 demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface geology has a noticeable influence on both streamflow characteristics and gw discharge into the lakes this is because increased hydraulic conductivity promotes greater infiltration during wet conditions i e fall winter and spring which results in lower runoff and reduced stream peak flow during the spring freshet whereas during dry conditions i e summer higher hydraulic conductivity results in increased gw discharge to streams which then leads to increased baseflow there is also evidence that the underlying hydrostratigraphic setting has influence on model sensitivity as demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis at station no 9 fig 12a which is located in a region where the extent of the phanerozoic sequence is limited and subsurface geology is primarily composed of precambrian bedrock there is little change in streamflow across the range of hydraulic conductivity values tested the behavior at station no 9 is primarily attributable to the very low hydraulic conductivity of the precambrian bedrock such that even a one order of magnitude change makes very little difference in gw flow as it relates to gw sw interactions and streamflow in contrast gauges no 18 fig 12b and no 38 fig 12c respectively located in southern ontario and the michigan peninsula show a very high sensitivity to subsurface hydraulic conductivity the higher sensitivity is primarily attributed to the thick and relatively permeable phanerozoic deposits in these regions which allow the subsurface to play a more active role in surface water behavior at both gauge no 18 and no 38 increasing the hydraulic conductivity in the subsurface reduces the seasonal variability of streamflow rates because higher infiltration rates and a more active groundwater flow system lead to a larger contribution of baseflow relative to surface runoff conversely when the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface deposits is reduced the role that groundwater plays in surface water flow is diminished summer baseflow declines and the seasonal variability increases the influence of subsurface hydraulic conductivity on direct groundwater discharge into the great lakes follows the surface water flow behavior under the two different high k and low k sensitivity scenarios under the high k scenario gw discharge into the lakes increases by a factor of 2 8 for lake michigan and up to 5 0 for lake erie fig 12d further demonstrating that gw becomes a larger component of the hydrologic cycle as subsurface hydraulic conductivity increases in contrast the low k scenario results in a reduction of direct gw discharge into the great lakes that ranges from a factor of 3 5 for lakes superior and michigan to 6 1 for lake erie in general the smaller great lakes i e lakes erie and ontario appear somewhat more sensitive to changes in k values than the larger lakes 4 2 model limitations interpretation of the results presented here requires an acknowledgment of the model s limitations while care was taken to ensure that the model design and configuration is parsimonious with the objective of determining groundwater discharge into the five laurentian great lakes the model is not suited for addressing questions that involve a high level of local detail furthermore because the model is forced with monthly normal climatology year to year variability in hydrologic conditions within the glb is not addressed however monthly normal climatology aligns well with the scientific questions being addressed by the model in the work herein and is consistent with limitations in spatial resolution and hydrostratigraphic detail erler et al 2019a a primary challenge associated with the model is the spatial scale of the domain which at 766 000 km2 makes this one of the larger applications to date of a fully integrated model apart from the previous continental scale and large regional scale work chen et al 2020 davison et al 2018 keune et al 2016 maxwell et al 2015 in order to ensure computational tractability during parameter tuning a mesh spatial resolution of 2 to 10 km was employed which is relatively coarse compared to watershed scale erler et al 2019a and regional scale frey et al 2020 integrated modeling studies recently conducted within the southern ontario portion of the glb in turn the coarse resolution limits the detail that can be resolved in the topography the surface water network and the lake bathymetry nevertheless surface water behavior in the model shows a good match with observed conditions with little intervention beyond subsurface parameter tuning which is in part due to the compensating influences of the artificially smooth land surface on simulated flow rates within the simulated river channels accordingly while surface flow is demonstrated to have generally acceptable performance based on gauging stations positioned on high order rivers the actual processes driving overland flow in the model are highly simplified and interpretation of simulated surface water behavior needs to be constrained to large rivers and major lakes in the case of small rivers and streams it needs to be recognized that their impact on the overall hydrologic characteristics of the basin is to a large extent being captured by a combination of surface runoff and groundwater flow in the model parallel to the constraints with model spatial resolution is the limited availability of the 3 d hydrostratigraphic data required to fully describe the model subsurface although some large scale hydrostratigraphic characterization has been conducted for regions within the glb carter et al 2019 logan et al 2020 feinstein et al 2010 there is currently no contiguous subsurface dataset that describes the quaternary sediment and phanerozoic bedrock distribution across the entire basin hence while incorporating 2 d heterogeneity within the quaternary sediment layers based on map products gsc 2014 soller et al 2009 and a vertical stratigraphic sequence that reflects diminishing hydraulic conductivity with depth lemieux et al 2008 sykes et al 2009 the model lacks the subsurface detail required to address questions pertaining to small scale groundwater flow patterns when considering the impact of limited subsurface detail on simulation results it is important to note that the subsurface hydraulic parameters were primarily calibrated towards reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of surface water flows this is consistent with the recognized practice of adjusting hydraulic parameters in large scale models as a means of accommodating sub grid scale heterogeneity bierkens 1996 sanchez vila et al 2006 furthermore given the high degree of gw sw interaction in the great lakes basin and the demonstrated sensitivity of surface water flow to subsurface hydraulic conductivity fig 12 it can be argued that calibrations towards spatially distributed surface water flow targets as employed here helps to ensure that the overall balance between groundwater and surface water is being adequately captured additionally the comparison between simulated and observed gw levels provides a calibration independent assessment of model performance and demonstrates that tuning hydraulic conductivity towards optimal surface water performance did not lead to unacceptable gw performance as such the lack of spatial resolution is congruent with the abstracted hydrostratigraphy for which the net result is a large scale model best suited for big picture assessment of glb gw sw behavior at the same time the processes driving surface flow in the model are highly simplified and interpretation of simulated surface water behavior should be restricted to large rivers and major lakes 5 summary in this study a fully integrated surface subsurface hydrogeosphere model for the entire great lakes basin has been developed and applied to characterize groundwater lake interactions the model tightly integrates surface water and groundwater flow processes and incorporates key components of the hydrologic cycle that influence gw sw interactions such as surface evaporation transpiration with evolving vegetation surface flow infiltration and variably saturated groundwater flow the model was forced with a 30 year monthly normal climatology such that the influence of seasonality was captured in the simulations both the spatial and temporal variability in surface water flow rates as well as seasonal variability in water levels within the great lakes were reproduced with an acceptable level of accuracy a sensitivity test revealed that in regions of the basin with relatively thick and permeable phanerozoic deposits the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface provides an important control on surface water flow rates as well as groundwater discharge into the lakes conversely in regions with shallow precambrian bedrock the relative influence of the subsurface is smaller simulation results demonstrate the relative influence of different components of the hydrologic cycle on seasonality with snowmelt and rainfall dominating the annual peak in nbs in spring while strong terrestrial evapotranspiration in summer causes nbs to decline nbs reaches the annual minimum during fall and winter primarily because of high direct lake evaporation furthermore changes in nbs drive seasonal fluctuations in lake levels which lag behind nbs by approximately three months there is strong seasonality associated with gw lake interactions discharge into the lakes tends to be largest during winter and lowest during summer on account of hydraulic gradient fluctuations between terrestrial groundwater and lake levels which oscillate with opposite sign while there is both groundwater discharge and recharge occurring within and around the lakes results show that overall the lakes are net receivers of groundwater the nearshore peripheral region of each lake is the most active with a contribution to total annual groundwater discharge ranging from 76 in lake ontario to nearly 90 in the other four lakes averaged over an annual cycle the simulated average rates of direct groundwater discharge into lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario were found to be 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively this is the first study to employ a 3d fully integrated surface subsurface model to simulate the hydrologic cycle of the entire laurentian great lakes basin and to characterize and quantify the gw lake interactions for all five of the great lakes in particular the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the gw lake interactions have also been investigated the results provide new information to help better understand how spatial and temporal variability in direct gw discharge could influence the thermal regime safaie et al 2017 ecological conditions cantonati et al 2020 and nutrient loading meinikmann et al 2015 nisbeth et al 2019 along shoreline regions within the lakes furthermore while this study did not explicitly study interannual variability the results highlight the magnitude to which direct gw discharge is sensitive to variation in lake levels and terrestrial gw levels hence during years with abnormally low or high lake levels and or terrestrial gw levels the results from this study can provide insight on how direct gw discharge may deviate from an average year with further development that includes increasing the spatial resolution of the mesh and surface water network density adding detail to the phanerozoic hydrostratigraphy and demonstrating the ability to reproduce year to year transient hydrologic behavior fully integrated models such as the one utilized in this study will be able to address increasingly detailed questions pertaining to water resources in the glb 6 data availability the model developed in this study was constructed using

4906,modelling groundwater surface water gw sw interactions at scales of large river basins is a difficult challenge in this study a fully integrated surface water groundwater model accounting for hydrologic seasonality is developed for the 766 000 km2 laurentian great lakes basin and applied towards the characterization of groundwater lake gw lake interactions in the five great lakes under monthly normal climatology the simulated annual average rates of direct groundwater discharge to lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario through the combined lakebed and 8 km wide band of shoreline surrounding each lake are 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively thus direct groundwater discharge accounts for a small component of positive basin supply ranging from 0 6 for lake ontario to 1 3 for lake michigan with an overall average of 0 8 for all lakes combined simulation results demonstrate that gw lake interactions are strongest nearshore and vary temporally in response to seasonal fluctuations in both lake levels and terrestrial groundwater levels in nearshore regions in winter direct groundwater discharge dominates the gw lake interactions in both the distal and nearshore lakebed areas in summer the combined effects of rising lake levels and lowering terrestrial groundwater levels lead to notable reductions in direct groundwater discharge through nearshore areas direct groundwater discharge is also shown to vary spatially with highest rates associated with areas containing thick phanerozoic hydrostratigraphy as opposed to precambrian basement rock the results from this study indicate that the great lakes primarily act as groundwater receivers gaining considerable amounts of water directly from the basin s groundwater system keywords laurentian great lakes basin integrated hydrologic model groundwater lake interactions regional scale hydrologic modelling seasonal hydrologic cycles groundwater discharge 1 introduction the laurentian great lakes basin glb includes the five great lakes lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario and their catchment areas fig 1 it covers an area of approximately 766 000 km2 including 244 000 km2 of water epa 2015 and holds approximately 21 of the earth s fresh surface water although abundant with fresh water the great lakes are not excluded from the stresses being imposed upon global water resources as there is currently unprecedented pressure on both water quantity and quality from population growth agricultural and industrial development as well as uncertainties associated with climate change d orgeville et al 2014 howard and gerber 2018 morrice et al 2008 peltier et al 2018 cole et al 1999 groundwater and surface water in the glb are closely interconnected grannemann et al 2000 holtschlag and nicholas 1998 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 hence changes in groundwater quantity or quality may result in degraded surface water resources and vice versa conant jr et al 2019 robinson 2015 winter et al 1998 however processes driving large scale groundwater surface water gw sw interactions are difficult to observe and quantify and require a full understanding of the combined influence that climate topography soils geology land cover and meteorology have on water movement clark et al 2015 shrestha et al 2014 accordingly gw sw interactions have been recognized as an important focal point for the study of water resources globally blöschl et al 2007 and within the glb grannemann et al 2000 kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 groundwater flows into the great lakes either directly across the lakebeds and shorelines or indirectly as baseflow via rivers and streams direct gw discharge to the great lakes is thought to play an important role in maintaining water quality and ecological environment of the great lakes grannemann et al 2000 however most studies on direct groundwater discharge to date have focused only on lake michigan and it is generally recognized that there is insufficient evidence to estimate direct groundwater discharge into the other lakes grannemann and weaver 1999 for lake michigan large scale groundwater modelling has been employed to characterize direct groundwater discharge with hoaglund et al 2002 using a modflow model to characterize groundwater inflow and outflow from the michigan peninsula and feinstein et al 2010 using modflow and seawat models to characterize groundwater changes over the 1864 2005 time interval within the entire lake michigan basin knights et al 2017 have investigated direct groundwater discharge along the u s portion of the great lakes shoreline through a water budget analysis however to date there has not yet been a basin wide attempt to characterize the direct groundwater discharge into the laurentian great lakes characterizing gw lake interactions within the entire glb is a challenging task that is well suited to a regional scale model which is able to fully integrate all the relevant hydrological processes and physically resolve gw sw interactions barthel and banzhaf 2016 fatichi et al 2016 furthermore the influence of seasonality should be incorporated into future hydrologic modelling of the glb given that the pronounced influence of intra annual climate variability on the hydrologic characteristics of the basin are well known erler et al 2019a b ghanbari and bravo 2008 pietroniro et al 2007 however the development of a fully integrated model can be expected to be constrained by data availability barthel and banzhaf 2016 and computational ability due to the current lack of basin scale hydrostratigraphic and hydraulic property characterization frey et al 2016 grid discretization constraints and challenges with transient process representation additional investigative work is needed in order to establish the role of fully integrated models in helping to better understand the hydrologic characteristics of the glb while the feasibility of fully integrated models has recently been demonstrated for detailed regional scale approximately 100 000 150 000 km2 hydrologic analysis frey et al 2020 hwang et al 2018 and for more abstracted continental scale analysis under steady state conditions chen et al 2020 maxwell et al 2015 as well as transient conditions maxwell and condon 2016 they have not yet been applied towards detailed analysis of gw lake interaction at the scale of the glb accordingly the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a fully integrated gw sw model for the glb 2 apply the model towards a water balance analysis of the glb and provide an estimate of direct gw discharge into the great lakes and 3 investigate basin wide temporal and spatial variability of gw lake interactions this study is the first of its kind to utilize a large scale fully integrated hydrologic model for characterizing groundwater discharge into all five of the laurentian great lakes within a single simulation of the entire basin 2 model development the hydrologic model employed for this study is hydrogeosphere hgs which is a control volume finite element difference model that fully couples a richards equation

encompasses the entire glb area including all five of the great lakes and their subbasins fig 1 the simulated river tributaries for each of the great lakes are illustrated in fig 1b the surface topography across the glb fig 1c was produced by stitching a digital elevation model dem together from 3 different sources namely 1 the ontario enforced dem with a resolution of 30 m which is a hydrologically conditioned surface elevation raster created using the provincial dem and the enhanced watercourse network https geohub lio gov on ca datasets ontario integrated hydrology data 2 a great lakes bathymetry data set with a 3 arc second resolution approximately 90 m from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ngdc noaa gov mgg greatlakes and 3 the hydrosheds data set with a resolution of 83 4 m lehner et al 2008 in the combined dem the resolution was unified to 83 4 m the stream networks were burned into the dem with the minimum amount of vertical correction required to enforce downgradient flow in the surface water network bedrock topography data were obtained from the ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines gao et al 2006 for the southern ontario portion and from the united states geological survey for the u s portion of the model domain soller et al 2012 because of limited bedrock topography data in northern ontario a bedrock surface for the ontario portion of the glb not covered by the gao et al 2006 dataset was created by vertically offseting the dem by 3 m in order to reflect the thin or non existant overburden in this region gsc 2014 the bedrock topographic surface is shown in fig s1 in the si the total thickness of the overburden in the hgs model has been verified with a comparison against the dataset presented by bayless et al 2015 that provides coverage for the u s portion of the basin which yeilded a rmse of 28 m the unstructured 2 d triangular mesh that underpins the full 3 d triangular prism grid in the hgs model was generated using algomesh merrick 2017 the rivers and lake boundaries were used as mesh control features and the spatial resolution of the mesh ranges from about 10 km in the offshore regions within the lakes to approximately 3 km over the land surface and 2 km along the surface water control features in total each 2 d mesh layer contains 54 409 mesh nodes and 107 194

dataset with a pixel size of 500 m the lai data were obtained from july 4 2002 to november 9 2018 and then aggregated into monthly average values for each type of landcover the top three subsurface layers in the 3 d mesh with bottom surfaces at 0 25 0 50 and 1 m depth reflect soil materials across the basin the canadian soils data were obtained from soil landscapes of canada aafc 2010 with a map scale of 1 1 million the soil data for the u s portion were obtained from the state soil geographic statsgo data base with a map scale of 1 250 000 usda nrcs 1995 soil textural types were derived from relative percentages of sand silt and clay using the usda soil textural triangle the data sets were simplified to 10 soil textural types texture average hydraulic conductivity kh kv and porosity were assigned to each individual polygon within the blended canadian u s soils dataset variably saturated flow and soil moisture retention properties were uniquely represented for each soil texture with the van genuchten 1980 formulation the kh value of the lake sediments was assumed to be 1 0 10 7 m s detailed information on soil hydraulic property derivation and spatial distribution is provided in the si underlying the soil layers are 3 quaternary surficial geology layers composed of two weathered layers and 1 bottom unweathered layer that overlies bedrock spatially distributed 2 d surficial geology at a scale of 1 5 million was obtained from the geological survey of canada for the canadian portion of the model domain gsc 2014 and from usgs digital datasets providing 1 1 million scale mapping for the u s portion soller et al 2009 the datasets were merged into a single surficial geology map for the glb basin which is shown in fig s5 in the si and associated lithology and hydraulic properties are presented in table s3 the initial hydraulic conductivity values for each type of quaternary material were determined from existing literature coon and sheets 2006 earle 2015 fetter 2001 freeze and cherry 1979 lappala 1978 olcott 1992 and manually adjusted during model calibration see section 2 3 underlying the quaternary geology layers are two bedrock layers the top bedrock layer was set to a 5 m thickness with a uniform kh of 5 0 10 6 m s with the intention of representing the effect of fractures in shallow bedrock with an equivalent porous media approach underlying the fractured bedrock and extending to the base of the model at 600 m below sea level is a bedrock layer with a kh of 1 0 10 10 m s the influence of deep basin brine density on groundwater flow is not incorporated into the simulation framework as the study herein is focused on the shallow gw system and the bedrock hydrostratigraphy does not carry enough resolution to vertically constrain brine extent to represent anisotropy in quaternary and bedrock units kv values were set one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding kh values in regions of the model domain where quaternary deposits are absent bedrock was extended through the upper layers of the 3 d grid to the base of the soil the river network deployed in the model was derived from hydrosheds 15 arc second resolution vector data lehner et al 2008 simplified such that only river segments with greater than 2500 contributing cells or approximately a 250 km2 catchment area within the hydrosheds 15 arc second dem were represented a total of 53 stream gauging stations were incorporated into the river network so as to provide a spatially distributed set of simulated surface water flow rates for model evaluation fig 2 of which 25 are located in canada ec 2016 and 28 are located in the u s usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis sw with additional details provided in table s4 the gauging stations were selected based on location catchment area and data availability between 1981 and 2010 of particular interest is gauge no 21 wsc station 02ha003 which is located along the niagara river and has a drainage area of 686 000 km2 and gauge no a1 wsc station 02ha019 located along the welland canal near lake erie the welland canal flows parallel to the niagara river but due to mesh resolution constraints it is not represented in the model hence simulated flow rates at gauge no 21 also include flows from gauge no a1 which averaged 206 m3 s for the 1984 2010 gauge record the gauge closest to the model outflow location along the st lawrence river is no a2 wsc station 02mc002 which is located about 40 km downstream from the simulated outlet of the glb and has flow data available to 1993 with a total drainage area of 774 000 km2 gauge no a2 has a catchment area slightly larger than the model domain therefore before comparing to simulation output the gauge data were scaled using the ratio of the respective catchment areas i e model domain area gauge catchment area to assess the model s ability to reproduce groundwater heads a total of 416 monitoring wells were configured into the domain of which 352 are located in canada and 64 are located in the u s fig 2b the canadian monitoring well data was obtained from the ontario provincial groundwater monitoring network https www ontario ca environment and energy map provincial groundwater monitoring network and the u s monitoring well data was obtained from the usgs national ground water monitoring network usgs https cida usgs gov ngwmn a comparison between average observed and simulated groundwater levels was made for both overburden and bedrock wells 2 2 climatology and model forcing the climatology of the glb is complex and requires careful consideration in hydrologic simulations due to their thermal inertia the great lakes exert a profound influence on the seasonal cycle of the region winter temperatures in the vicinity of the lakes are considerably warmer than they would otherwise be bryan et al 2015 notaro et al 2013 and because the lakes do not all completely freeze the warm water surface acts as an ample supply of moisture during the cold season resulting in prominent snow belts downwind of the lakes gula and peltier 2012 notaro et al 2015 conversely in summer the cooler lake surface stabilizes the atmosphere and may act to suppress convection over the lakes and within their immediate vicinity holman et al 2012 this leads to spatial and seasonal precipitation patterns that are highly heterogeneous fig 3 monthly normal gridded 1 12 degree resolution liquid water flux and potential evapotranspiration pet for the 1981 to 2010 time interval was obtained from the natural resources canada nrcan dataset described in mckenney et al 2011 and used as forcing data for the terrestrial portion of the glb model pet is calculated based on the diurnal temperature range hogg 1997 while liquid water flux was computed as the sum of liquid precipitation and snowmelt because snowmelt is not measured directly it was estimated from changes in snow water equivalent swe which in turn was estimated from snow depth using a snow density climatology sturm et al 1995 because snow depth data in the mckenney et al 2011 dataset is only available for canada archived snow depth data from the canadian meteorological center daily analysis was used for the u s part of the basin brown and brasnett 2010 a comparison of the two snow data products over canada suggests that their resulting snowmelt rates are very similar climate forcing over the water surface of the great lakes requires separate consideration because the seasonal cycle of evaporation from the lakes is different from et over land with the peak in fall or winter and the minimum in spring or summer this is due to the thermal inertia of deep lakes and the difference in water vapor pressure between the lake surface and the atmosphere the strength of this effect is a function of lake depth and is most pronounced for lake superior peak in december while it is relatively weak for lake erie peak in october the former being the deepest at 147 m average depth and the latter comparatively shallow at about 19 m for this reason a seasonal cycle of lake evaporation was prescribed using a uniform monthly normal value for each of the great lakes using estimates from the noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory hunter et al 2015 hunter and croley 1993 based on the large lake thermodynamic model lltm croley and assel 1994 furthermore it was found that using the mckenney et al 2011 precipitation data over the lakes resulted in a high flow bias in the glb model therefore the estimates for over lake precipitation from hunter and croley 1993 have been adopted which are somewhat lower and result in more realistic net basin supply nbs we note that although lake ice was not considered explicitly its effect is fully accounted for in the evaporation estimates from the lltm the climatology data was applied to the glb model in two phases first 30 year 1981 2010 annual average precipitation and pet values were used to spin the model up to a steady state condition once achieved the steady state condition was used as an initial condition for monthly normal simulations where the model was forced with monthly average liquid water influx and pet as determined from the 1981 2010 interval this average seasonal cycle was then repeated until a year over year dynamic equilibrium state was achieved all model analysis was conducted on simulation results generated under dynamic equilibrium conditions it should be emphasized that for the purposes of this study 30 year monthly normal climatology provides model forcing data that captures typical seasonal variability and hence provides a basis for resolving the transient behavior of gw lake interactions over an average annual cycle it should also be noted that while the model forcing data were provided with monthly temporal resolution the hgs simulation used time steps ranging from approximately one hour to a maximum of one day that dynamically adapted according to the magnitude of incremental hydrologic change within the domain simulation time was approximately 7 days to reach the steady state initial condition and approximately 3 days to reach dynamic equilibrium monthly normal conditions when utilizing 4 physical cores of an intel i7 6700 t cpu 2 80 ghz with 16 0 gb ram 2 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis a fully integrated model at the scale of the glb has an intractable number of degrees of freedom if all parameters were to be perturbed during calibration however in a relative sense land surface properties such as topography and river location soil type land cover and bathymetry are well constrained by existing data when compared to subsurface properties for this reason model calibration primarily focused on tuning the hydraulic conductivity values associated with the surficial and bedrock hydrostratigraphy although it should be noted that channel elevations along the lake huron lake erie and the lake erie lake ontario river connections were also manually adjusted in order to improve the match between simulated and observed lake levels as one of the objectives of this study is to characterize direct groundwater discharge into the great lakes constraining the influence of the subsurface parameterization on surface water behavior helps ensure that groundwater flow is also constrained this was achieved by focusing the calibration process on optimizing the match between simulated vs observed stream flow rates while the evaluation of groundwater simulation performance provided validation that the model was adequately capturing the spatially varying groundwater levels across the basin the hydraulic conductivity values derived via manual calibration for each of the hydrostratigraphic layers are reported in table s3 and all subsequent analysis utilizes results from the calibrated model to further support the assessment of the model s ability to capture the integrated hydrologic behavior of the glb simulated lake levels for each of the 5 great lakes were visually compared against monthly normal lake levels over the 1981 to 2010 time interval from both a magnitude and cyclicity perspective as previously mentioned the largest data gap during the model construction process is the lack of detailed hydrostratigraphic and hydraulic property characterization for the subsurface to assess the potential impact of the associated uncertainties on model behavior a sensitivity analysis was conducted wherein hydraulic conductivity k values for quaternary fractured bedrock and bedrock layers were perturbed the base k values were both increased high k case and reduced low k case by one order of magnitude and then the changes in streamflow and gw lake interactions were assessed 3 results 3 1 model performance simulated vs observed monthly normal flow rates at two of the main gauge stations namely no 21 and no a2 fig 2a which are located along the niagara and st lawrence rivers respectively are presented in fig 4 while equivalent comparison plots for all other gauge locations are presented in fig s6 it is important to note that the incorporation of surface water diversions such as the chicago ogoki and long lake diversions quinn and edstrom 2000 were not included as surface water sources and sinks however with a net inflow to the glb of approximately 65 m3 s it is not expected that the diversions would have a notable impact on the simulation results good agreement between simulated and observed hydrographs in the context of both magnitude and seasonality is demonstrated in fig 4 the difference between the annual average simulated and observed flowrates is 217 m3 s 3 5 of the observed annual average flowrate in the niagara river fig 4a and 179 m3 s 2 3 of the observed annual average flowrate in the st lawrence river fig 4b overall the majority of simulated hydrographs are in good visual agreement with the observations with respect to both the flow rates and the seasonal cycles high flow during the spring freshet and low flow during the summer when et peaks with acceptable i e 0 5 values of nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficients observed at 26 of the calibration locations however there are 27 locations where the model underperforms with respect to the nse criteria even though visual evaluation confirms that the magnitude and seasonality of surface water flow is generally well captured failure to meet the nse criteria at all locations is not unexpected for a number of reasons including 1 surface water management i e dams is not incorporated into the model 2 there is high uncertainty associated with precipitation and snowmelt 3 model resolution precludes full representation of low order streams and rivers and 4 because of the non linear hydrologic response to climate variability the monthly normal model forcing data will not necessarily result in monthly normal flow rates fig 5 shows the simulated vs observed water levels meters above sea level masl in the monitoring wells used to evaluate groundwater simulation performance the monitoring wells are divided into two groups namely bedrock wells fig 5a and overburden wells fig 5b depending on the hydrostratigraphy at the well screen depth overall the simulated water levels are in reasonable agreement with observations with an r2 of 0 96 for bedrock wells and 0 95 for overburden wells thus validating that the groundwater component of the glb is adequately reproduced by the model 3 2 extended lake surface area elsa based net basin supply in this section the seasonal cycle of net basin supply components lake level fluctuations and gw lake interactions will be discussed again because the model was forced with 30 year monthly normals the results are representative of a long term average dynamic equilibrium for the purpose of this study an extended lake surface area elsa was defined for each of the great lakes in which the exchange between groundwater and the lakes through both lakebed and the adjacent subsurface is investigated for all five lakes the elsa extends 8 km beyond the actual lake boundary fig 6 a fence composed of linear segments encircling the elsa was used in the model to capture all streamflow including surface runoff and indirect groundwater discharge baseflow from the basin land area into each of the great lakes consistent with holtschlag and nicholas 1998 net basin supply nbs for each lake is defined as the sum of streamflow passing through the fence plus precipitation minus evaporation it does not include the main outlet or inlet for water balance calculations in this context over lake precipitation and evaporation are integrated over the elsa instead of the actual lake surface area monthly average rates of precipitation evaporation streamflow and nbs computed over the elsa of each of the lakes are shown in fig 7 it is evident that lakes superior michigan and huron receive considerably more annual precipitation on account of their large sizes however when annual average precipitation volumes are normalized to surface area the results for each of the five lakes are similar although the temporal patterns do vary with lakes superior and michigan showing more seasonal variability in precipitation than lakes erie and ontario unlike precipitation lake evaporation is shown to vary significantly over the year for all lakes with peaks in fall winter and minima in spring summer this is because during the winter months relatively dry air combined with a warm water surface result in high evaporation while during the summer months relatively moist air combined with a cold lake surface result in less evaporation lake erie has the earliest evaporation peak in october because it is relatively shallow and has less thermal inertia compared to the other great lakes furthermore based on the noaa glerl dataset condensation on the lake surface is found to occur over lake superior during june and july and over lake huron during may and june which was included in the liquid water flux forcing dataset as pointed out earlier streamflow fig 7c also manifests a pronounced seasonal cycle that is driven by snowmelt and evapotranspiration over land due to the large area encompassed by the great lakes over lake precipitation and evaporation are of first order importance and of similar magnitude as surface runoff hunter and croley 1993 fig 7d illustrates how the elsa based nbs for each lake rises to a peak in the spring corresponding to the spring freshet and drops to a minimum in fall and winter corresponding to the lake evaporation peak nbs components integrated over the actual lake boundaries not the elsa are shown in fig s7 apart from a small difference in over lake precipitation and evaporation and a small shift in the seasonal cycle due to differences in over land et the values are very similar and hence basing calculations on the elsa is not expected to significantly affect the results 3 3 water level fluctuations in the great lakes the great lakes form a dynamic system where the water levels vary naturally on short seasonal and inter annual time scales short term fluctuations include wind driven set ups storm surges and seiches standing waves and last no more than a few days seasonal fluctuations are mainly driven by seasonal changes in nbs due to evaporation and snowmelt runoff the longer term fluctuations occur as the result of climate variability on inter annual to decadal time scales due to their importance seasonal lake level fluctuations will be discussed and compared against observed water levels for each of the great lakes in this study the observed lake level data at the master gauge of each lake have been obtained from noaa glerl https www glerl noaa gov data dashboard data monthly normal lake levels reflect the 1981 to 2010 time interval fig 8 illustrates the observed and model predicted water levels in each of the great lakes predicted conditions in lakes superior and ontario match the observations very well in terms of water levels and seasonal variations deviating only 0 01 m from the observed annual mean lake superior has the highest water level with a predicted annual mean of 183 35 masl 183 36 masl observed and lake ontario has the lowest with a simulated annual mean of 74 83 masl 74 82 masl observed lakes michigan huron and erie on the other hand exhibit biases in predicted annual average lake levels but the simulated seasonal cycle matches the observed seasonal cycle closely lakes michigan and huron are hydraulically connected and are usually treated as one lake for the purpose of lake level records nevertheless simulated water levels for lake michigan are 0 04 m higher than for lake huron 178 34 m and 178 30 masl which is consistent with the fact that lake michigan drains through lake huron the lakes are also hydraulically connected in the model the observed annual average water level in lake michigan huron is 176 45 masl almost 2 m lower than predicted similarly the observed water levels for lake erie annual mean 174 32 masl are lower than simulated values annual mean 175 54 masl but the seasonal cycle is again well captured in the numerical simulations herein lake levels were found to be primarily governed by two factors net basin supply and outlet bathymetry since the flow rates at the niagara and st lawrence gauges are reasonably well captured it is more likely that the lake level biases are caused by errors in the outlet bathymetry lake huron and lake erie are drained by the st clair detroit and niagara rivers respectively which at their narrowest points are only about 200 300 m wide and protected by embankments this is much smaller than the mesh resolution which means that errors in the bathymetry of the outlet are unavoidable lake superior and ontario are drained by the st mary s and st lawrence rivers which at their narrowest points are over 600 m wide and hence the bathymetry is inherently better captured in the mesh considering the scale of the model and the complexity of the outlet geometry in the natural system a 1 to 2 m bias in water levels is considered acceptable for the purposes of this study especially considering that the seasonal water level variability is well reproduced for all lakes fig 8 when further considering the impact of lake level biases on simulation results it should be noted that because an average annual seasonal cycle is being simulated the surface water and groundwater systems are in a state of year over year dynamic equilibrium and the groundwater table in the vicinity of the lakes is aligned with the lake levels hence a 2 m bias in lake levels will not have a notable influence on simulated gw lake interactions seasonal fluctuations in lake water levels are primarily controlled by changes in nbs comparing figs 7 and 8 it is evident that nbs peaks approximately two to three months before water levels peak a delay of this magnitude is expected since nbs variation represents a rate of change in lake volumes furthermore the temporal cycle of nbs can also explain the differences in the timing of lake level peaks between different lakes due to the depth and thermal inertia of lake superior evaporation peaks relatively late delaying the seasonal cycle compared to shallower lakes while the reverse is the case for relatively shallow lake erie leading to an earlier peak in lake levels 3 4 groundwater lake interactions in the previous section when discussing nbs the exchange fluxes between groundwater and the great lakes were not described however gw lake interactions can be important for understanding a lake system yihdego et al 2017 although groundwater exchange with lake michigan has been modelled and quantified feinstein et al 2010 the gw lake interactions for the other great lakes remain poorly understood as discussed previously the spatial and temporal variability of gw lake interactions requires further investigation in the model employed here surface water and groundwater are fully coupled and therefore the dynamic water exchange between groundwater and the lakes can be quantified in the following sections the simulated groundwater discharge to and recharge from the great lakes will be addressed in terms of both spatial and temporal variability fig 9 shows direct groundwater discharge to and recharge from the lakes in m s through the lakebeds and the 8 kilometer wide extended area around the great lakes during winter in january panel a and summer in july panel b the difference between winter and summer is clearly evident implying that the interactions between the groundwater system and the lakes undergo seasonal changes in winter direct groundwater discharge dominates the gw lake interactions in both the lakebed areas and the extended area fig 9a however in summer groundwater recharge from the lakes tends to dominate in the lakebed areas while direct groundwater discharge from the extended surface area decreases significantly fig 9b as discussed previously water levels in the great lakes fluctuate by several tens of centimeters throughout the year with peaks in summer and troughs in winter however the groundwater table on land generally shows the opposite pattern with a minimum in late summer due to strong et erler et al 2019b fig s8 the phase shift in the seasonal cycle sets up a reversal in hydraulic gradients that occurs in spring and fall with the net result being that direct gw discharge into the lakes dominates the exchange process during winter and gw recharge from the lakes has a stronger influence on the exchange process during summer the seasonal reversals in hydraulic gradients has also been observed in a field study conducted in lake erie by haack et al 2005 who obtained measurements that are consistent with the seasonal changes observed in the modelling work herein compared to the other lakes the discharge and recharge pattern of lake erie fig 9 appears anomalous this can be attributed to the fact that lake erie water levels peak and decline earlier such that lake erie is already in the transition phase during the months of january and july that are depicted in fig 9 in actuality discharge into lake erie peaks in november and hence the discharge pattern for lake erie in november is much like the homogenous patterns observed for the other lakes in january from fig 9 it can also be seen that significant amounts of direct groundwater discharge occur near the shorelines this is consistent with previous modelling studies feinstein et al 2010 and field observations knights et al 2017 as well as inferences from previous studies grannemann et al 2000 grannemann and weaver 1999 in order to characterize the contribution of direct groundwater discharge and recharge relative to the shoreline position three zones of analysis see fig 6 have been defined as the extended lake area including the lakebed and the 8 kilometer wide elsa the lakebed and a reduced lakebed area decreased by 4 km from the lake boundary annual average flow rates across different zones are shown in fig 10 for each of the lakes the total direct groundwater discharge through the extended lake area is much higher than through the lakebed alone indicating that groundwater discharge through the 8 kilometer wide extended ring makes the largest contribution to the total direct groundwater discharge similarly the direct groundwater discharge is considerably higher through the entire lakebed than through the reduced lakebed area implying that the discharge through the 4 kilometer wide nearshore lakebed area makes a much larger contribution than the remaining inner portion of the lakebed area direct groundwater discharge from the nearshore area that encompasses both the 8 kilometer wide elsa and 4 kilometer wide inner lakebed ring contributes nearly 90 of the total gw discharge to lakes superior michigan huron and erie and 76 of the gw discharge to lake ontario whereas the contribution of direct gw discharge from the reduced lakebed area is small 24 for lake ontario and approximately 10 for the other lakes it should also be noted that direct gw discharge to the lakes through the elsa will invariably include inflow from low order streams not resolved in the mesh while it can be expected that these stream segments would receive considerable gw discharge in a traditional sense this would usually be considered indirect gw contribution to the lakes however for the purposes of this study it is quantified as direct gw discharge total annual gw discharge through the combined elsa and inner lakebed ring normalized per km of shoreline is presented in fig s9 in the si compared to gw discharge gw recharge tends to be less dominated by the near shore margin and more uniform across the entire lakebed fig 10 which is most apparent for lakes erie and ontario interestingly direct gw discharge through the reduced inner lakebed area is very close to groundwater recharge indicating that in a dynamic equilibrium state the annual net gw lake exchange flux is minimal hence for an annual water budget analysis that incorporates gw lake interactions it may be reasonable to focus primarily on the nearshore environment 3 5 groundwater discharge influences on basin hydrology the simulation results clearly show that direct groundwater discharge to the great lakes is significantly larger than groundwater recharge from the great lakes this supports the concept that the great lakes commonly act as groundwater receivers which has been put forth in previous research grannemann and weaver 1999 neff and nicholas 2005 narrowing in on the role of groundwater in the overall water balance of the great lakes fig 11 depicts the monthly time series of total direct groundwater discharge rates positive basin water supply pbs and the percentage of direct groundwater discharge to pbs where pbs is defined as the sum of all the positive contributions to nbs runoff over lake elsa precipitation and in this case direct groundwater discharge for all of the great lakes pbs fig 11b follows a pattern similar to that of streamflow fig 7c with spring peaks and summer troughs while over lake elsa precipitation is a significant component of pbs the influence of other hydrologic drivers is also evident in the seasonal signal with the spring to early summer peak in pbs attributable to snowmelt and runoff and the late summer trough associated with high evapotranspiration on the land surface in general lakes superior michigan and huron have a more pronounced seasonal cycle compared to lakes erie and ontario which is consistent with the precipitation patterns shown in figs 3 and 7a the estimated annual average rates of direct groundwater discharge to lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario are 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively fig 10 compared to pbs fig 11b direct groundwater discharge is a small input to the lakes with the annual average ratio of direct groundwater discharge to pbs fig 11c ranging from 0 6 for lake ontario to 1 3 for lake michigan with an overall ratio of 0 8 when all lakes are considered as noted in previous work knights et al 2017 and observed again here direct groundwater discharge to lake michigan is higher than discharge to the other great lakes which can in part be attributed to the relatively high hydraulic conductivities of the quaternary materials in the vicinity of the lake and especially along the michigan peninsula fig s5 overall lakes erie and ontario receive the lowest amount of direct groundwater discharge which is primarily attributable to their comparably small length of shoreline which highlights that among the drivers of total gw discharge shoreline length is an important consideration on an annual average basis direct groundwater discharge relative to nbs is 1 6 2 4 1 1 2 3 and 0 9 for lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively for all great lakes combined gw discharge is 1 6 of nbs which is approximately double the gw component of pbs when interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that anthropogenic gw extraction was not incorporated into the model and hence the groundwater pumping in lake michigan s sub basin feinstein et al 2010 as well as across the rest of the glb are not reflected in the results the gw discharge rates for lake michigan range from 10 7 m3 s in august to 65 7 m3 s in january which is comparable to estimates provided by grannemann and weaver 1999 in their review of previous work showing that direct groundwater discharge to lake michigan ranges from 23 m3 s to 190 m3 s at a larger scale knights et al 2017 estimated the direct groundwater discharge along the u s portions of the shorelines of all great lakes and for lake michigan they report a total direct groundwater discharge rate of 30 8 m3 s which is in line with this study in contrast feinstein et al 2010 estimated a total direct groundwater discharge of 9 6 m3 s to lake michigan under predevelopment conditions with no pumping this value is much smaller than the previous estimates however they suggested that the groundwater discharge rate might be up to 3 8 times greater if their model resolution was refined for lakes superior huron erie and ontario knights et al 2017 report direct groundwater discharge rates of 17 1 14 0 13 3 and 5 1 m3 s respectively across the u s portion of the shoreline when these values are scaled to the full shoreline length the approximate total gw discharge rates are 30 6 36 7 22 2 and 12 1 m3 s for the respective lakes in comparison the work herein estimates the annual average direct gw discharge to lakes superior and ontario at 29 0 and 11 6 m3 s respectively which is in good agreement with the scaled values from knights et al 2017 in contrast for lake huron the annual average groundwater discharge of 24 5 m3 s computed here is somewhat smaller than the scaled value from knights et al 2017 however from fig 9 it is evident that direct discharge rates along the north and northeast coast of lake huron are significantly smaller than those along the west and southwest coast such that scaling estimates based on the u s coast alone would likely lead to inflated estimates for the entire lake similarly the average gw discharge rate of 11 9 m3 s predicted for lake erie is much smaller than the scaled value of 22 2 m3 s obtained from knights et al 2017 in the case of lake erie the differences cannot be fully explained by heterogeneous discharge along the shoreline which highlights that these types of estimates are still highly uncertain in fact it can be argued that in light of the large uncertainties the actual difference in estimated gw discharge between the different studies is relatively small knights et al 2017 also conducted a field scale study at the end of summer to measure direct groundwater discharge rates to lake erie through a small section of shoreline where they found the measured discharge rate of 354 25 m3 year per meter length of shoreline to be lower than their estimate of 588 181 m3 year per meter length made in the large scale analysis for comparison the average gw discharge predicted herein for lake erie is 391 m3 year per meter length of shoreline note however that knights et al 2017 conducted their field study in september when according to the seasonal cycle shown in fig 11 discharge values can be expected to be about 30 lower than the annual average hence accounting for seasonal variation would reconcile the two values obtained by knights et al 2017 and provide independent confirmation for the magnitude of seasonal variations in direct groundwater discharge it should be noted that the gw lake interactions in this study are all simulated under long term monthly normal conditions without consideration of gw pumping according to feinstein et al 2010 the average net pumping rate pumping minus injection within the lake michigan region was 790 mgal d between 1980 and 2005 they estimated that gw pumping diverted groundwater flows and reduced the direct gw discharge to lake michigan by 12 mgal d or about 5 5 of the total gw discharge rate under predevelopment conditions considering that gw pumping in other regions within the glb is much less intensive than in the lake michigan region the effect of pumping on the direct gw discharge at the basin scale is expected to be considerably lower therefore it is not expected that the omission of gw pumping from this work will have any material impact on the results 4 model sensitivity and limitations 4 1 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis fig 12 demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface geology has a noticeable influence on both streamflow characteristics and gw discharge into the lakes this is because increased hydraulic conductivity promotes greater infiltration during wet conditions i e fall winter and spring which results in lower runoff and reduced stream peak flow during the spring freshet whereas during dry conditions i e summer higher hydraulic conductivity results in increased gw discharge to streams which then leads to increased baseflow there is also evidence that the underlying hydrostratigraphic setting has influence on model sensitivity as demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis at station no 9 fig 12a which is located in a region where the extent of the phanerozoic sequence is limited and subsurface geology is primarily composed of precambrian bedrock there is little change in streamflow across the range of hydraulic conductivity values tested the behavior at station no 9 is primarily attributable to the very low hydraulic conductivity of the precambrian bedrock such that even a one order of magnitude change makes very little difference in gw flow as it relates to gw sw interactions and streamflow in contrast gauges no 18 fig 12b and no 38 fig 12c respectively located in southern ontario and the michigan peninsula show a very high sensitivity to subsurface hydraulic conductivity the higher sensitivity is primarily attributed to the thick and relatively permeable phanerozoic deposits in these regions which allow the subsurface to play a more active role in surface water behavior at both gauge no 18 and no 38 increasing the hydraulic conductivity in the subsurface reduces the seasonal variability of streamflow rates because higher infiltration rates and a more active groundwater flow system lead to a larger contribution of baseflow relative to surface runoff conversely when the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface deposits is reduced the role that groundwater plays in surface water flow is diminished summer baseflow declines and the seasonal variability increases the influence of subsurface hydraulic conductivity on direct groundwater discharge into the great lakes follows the surface water flow behavior under the two different high k and low k sensitivity scenarios under the high k scenario gw discharge into the lakes increases by a factor of 2 8 for lake michigan and up to 5 0 for lake erie fig 12d further demonstrating that gw becomes a larger component of the hydrologic cycle as subsurface hydraulic conductivity increases in contrast the low k scenario results in a reduction of direct gw discharge into the great lakes that ranges from a factor of 3 5 for lakes superior and michigan to 6 1 for lake erie in general the smaller great lakes i e lakes erie and ontario appear somewhat more sensitive to changes in k values than the larger lakes 4 2 model limitations interpretation of the results presented here requires an acknowledgment of the model s limitations while care was taken to ensure that the model design and configuration is parsimonious with the objective of determining groundwater discharge into the five laurentian great lakes the model is not suited for addressing questions that involve a high level of local detail furthermore because the model is forced with monthly normal climatology year to year variability in hydrologic conditions within the glb is not addressed however monthly normal climatology aligns well with the scientific questions being addressed by the model in the work herein and is consistent with limitations in spatial resolution and hydrostratigraphic detail erler et al 2019a a primary challenge associated with the model is the spatial scale of the domain which at 766 000 km2 makes this one of the larger applications to date of a fully integrated model apart from the previous continental scale and large regional scale work chen et al 2020 davison et al 2018 keune et al 2016 maxwell et al 2015 in order to ensure computational tractability during parameter tuning a mesh spatial resolution of 2 to 10 km was employed which is relatively coarse compared to watershed scale erler et al 2019a and regional scale frey et al 2020 integrated modeling studies recently conducted within the southern ontario portion of the glb in turn the coarse resolution limits the detail that can be resolved in the topography the surface water network and the lake bathymetry nevertheless surface water behavior in the model shows a good match with observed conditions with little intervention beyond subsurface parameter tuning which is in part due to the compensating influences of the artificially smooth land surface on simulated flow rates within the simulated river channels accordingly while surface flow is demonstrated to have generally acceptable performance based on gauging stations positioned on high order rivers the actual processes driving overland flow in the model are highly simplified and interpretation of simulated surface water behavior needs to be constrained to large rivers and major lakes in the case of small rivers and streams it needs to be recognized that their impact on the overall hydrologic characteristics of the basin is to a large extent being captured by a combination of surface runoff and groundwater flow in the model parallel to the constraints with model spatial resolution is the limited availability of the 3 d hydrostratigraphic data required to fully describe the model subsurface although some large scale hydrostratigraphic characterization has been conducted for regions within the glb carter et al 2019 logan et al 2020 feinstein et al 2010 there is currently no contiguous subsurface dataset that describes the quaternary sediment and phanerozoic bedrock distribution across the entire basin hence while incorporating 2 d heterogeneity within the quaternary sediment layers based on map products gsc 2014 soller et al 2009 and a vertical stratigraphic sequence that reflects diminishing hydraulic conductivity with depth lemieux et al 2008 sykes et al 2009 the model lacks the subsurface detail required to address questions pertaining to small scale groundwater flow patterns when considering the impact of limited subsurface detail on simulation results it is important to note that the subsurface hydraulic parameters were primarily calibrated towards reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of surface water flows this is consistent with the recognized practice of adjusting hydraulic parameters in large scale models as a means of accommodating sub grid scale heterogeneity bierkens 1996 sanchez vila et al 2006 furthermore given the high degree of gw sw interaction in the great lakes basin and the demonstrated sensitivity of surface water flow to subsurface hydraulic conductivity fig 12 it can be argued that calibrations towards spatially distributed surface water flow targets as employed here helps to ensure that the overall balance between groundwater and surface water is being adequately captured additionally the comparison between simulated and observed gw levels provides a calibration independent assessment of model performance and demonstrates that tuning hydraulic conductivity towards optimal surface water performance did not lead to unacceptable gw performance as such the lack of spatial resolution is congruent with the abstracted hydrostratigraphy for which the net result is a large scale model best suited for big picture assessment of glb gw sw behavior at the same time the processes driving surface flow in the model are highly simplified and interpretation of simulated surface water behavior should be restricted to large rivers and major lakes 5 summary in this study a fully integrated surface subsurface hydrogeosphere model for the entire great lakes basin has been developed and applied to characterize groundwater lake interactions the model tightly integrates surface water and groundwater flow processes and incorporates key components of the hydrologic cycle that influence gw sw interactions such as surface evaporation transpiration with evolving vegetation surface flow infiltration and variably saturated groundwater flow the model was forced with a 30 year monthly normal climatology such that the influence of seasonality was captured in the simulations both the spatial and temporal variability in surface water flow rates as well as seasonal variability in water levels within the great lakes were reproduced with an acceptable level of accuracy a sensitivity test revealed that in regions of the basin with relatively thick and permeable phanerozoic deposits the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface provides an important control on surface water flow rates as well as groundwater discharge into the lakes conversely in regions with shallow precambrian bedrock the relative influence of the subsurface is smaller simulation results demonstrate the relative influence of different components of the hydrologic cycle on seasonality with snowmelt and rainfall dominating the annual peak in nbs in spring while strong terrestrial evapotranspiration in summer causes nbs to decline nbs reaches the annual minimum during fall and winter primarily because of high direct lake evaporation furthermore changes in nbs drive seasonal fluctuations in lake levels which lag behind nbs by approximately three months there is strong seasonality associated with gw lake interactions discharge into the lakes tends to be largest during winter and lowest during summer on account of hydraulic gradient fluctuations between terrestrial groundwater and lake levels which oscillate with opposite sign while there is both groundwater discharge and recharge occurring within and around the lakes results show that overall the lakes are net receivers of groundwater the nearshore peripheral region of each lake is the most active with a contribution to total annual groundwater discharge ranging from 76 in lake ontario to nearly 90 in the other four lakes averaged over an annual cycle the simulated average rates of direct groundwater discharge into lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario were found to be 29 0 38 6 24 5 11 9 and 11 6 m3 s respectively this is the first study to employ a 3d fully integrated surface subsurface model to simulate the hydrologic cycle of the entire laurentian great lakes basin and to characterize and quantify the gw lake interactions for all five of the great lakes in particular the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the gw lake interactions have also been investigated the results provide new information to help better understand how spatial and temporal variability in direct gw discharge could influence the thermal regime safaie et al 2017 ecological conditions cantonati et al 2020 and nutrient loading meinikmann et al 2015 nisbeth et al 2019 along shoreline regions within the lakes furthermore while this study did not explicitly study interannual variability the results highlight the magnitude to which direct gw discharge is sensitive to variation in lake levels and terrestrial gw levels hence during years with abnormally low or high lake levels and or terrestrial gw levels the results from this study can provide insight on how direct gw discharge may deviate from an average year with further development that includes increasing the spatial resolution of the mesh and surface water network density adding detail to the phanerozoic hydrostratigraphy and demonstrating the ability to reproduce year to year transient hydrologic behavior fully integrated models such as the one utilized in this study will be able to address increasingly detailed questions pertaining to water resources in the glb 6 data availability the model developed in this study was constructed using

4907,in this paper a novel semi analytical model for pumping tests in discretely fractured aquifers with randomly distributed and finitely conductive fractures is presented to investigate the wellbore drawdown transient behaviour an aquifer model and discrete fracture model are established the flux and drawdown equivalent conditions in the laplace space are applied in the fracture wall to couple the fluid flow in both systems the advantage of the proposed semi analytical model is that only fractures must be separated into segments not the entire domain then a matrix of the fracture segment in laplace space can be built and solved by using gauss s elimination method a final solution for wellbore drawdown can be easily evaluated using the numerical laplace inversion algorithm of stehfest the model is compared with a previous result of an extended well the proposed model allows us to consider the problems of pumping tests in complex fracture networks including parallel uncrossed fracture networks arbitrary distribution non intersected fracture networks and intersected fracture networks with isolated fractures in the past studies some scholars have found that the drawdown or pressure derivative curve will present only one dip valley which looks like a v shaped curve for the naturally fractured confined aquifer or reservoirs and number of dip valleys are only related to porous media type however this study illustrates that the drawdown transient behaviour and the number of dip valleys are closely related to fracture density fracture conductivity fracture length fracture orientation fracture distribution position of a pumping well and the distance between the pumping well and fracture keywords semi analytical model pumping tests discretely fractured aquifers wellbore drawdown 1 introduction fractured aquifers play an important role in regional water supplies many fractures can exist in carbonate sandstone volcanic and other hard rock formations gerke and van genuchten 1993 the widely known double porosity model is often used to study the unsteady behaviour of drawdowns warren and root 1963 a previous study noted that the spatial arbitrary unit is composed of a matrix and fracture the matrix s main role is to store fluid and the fracture acts as the flow channel for the fluid smedt 2011 the exchange function is often used to describe the inter porosity flow between the matrix and fracture kazemi 1969 the assumption of a continuous medium was used to define double porosity models by barenblatt et al 1960 additionally warren and root 1963 established an ideal system formed by matrix blocks separated by orthogonal fractures they then obtained drawdown solutions considering the quasi steady state inter porosity flow between the matrixes and fractures in fractured aquifers the transient inter porosity flow models between the matrixes and fractures were presented by kazemi 1969 we cannot judge which model is better or worse but the quasi steady state model greatly simplifies several mathematical derivations önder 1998 in recent decades owing to its relative simplification and high efficiency the double porosity model has been favoured by an increasing number of researchers moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 mei et al 2020 the head transient behaviour for pumping tests in fractured aquifers has been also discussed in compendiums of aquifer test analysis e g kruseman and de ridder 1991 batu 1998 cheng 2000 and walton 2006 a recent overview of flow models for well testing in fractured media was given by nielsen 2007 at present the continuous medium dual porosity model has been widely used in the field of groundwater seepage and petroleum engineering boulton and streltsova 1977 gerke and van genuchten 1993 ge 1997 slimani and tiab 2008 however owing to the complexity of underground geological conditions and fracture morphology we still face new challenges in the real world fracture systems are not orthogonal the distribution of fractures may be random and the length conductivity and orientation of each fracture are different cai et al 2017 liu et al 2018 to consider the fracture flow behaviour in a stricter sense the flow in the fractures must be considered explicitly the discrete fracture networks dfn model can be used to accurately simulate the flow behaviour in fractures lee et al 2001 karimi et al 2004 in the literature of groundwater and petroleum scholars have attempted to use numerical methods to study the discrete fracture network olorode et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 in most standard numerical methods the whole domain is divided into small cells and the drawdown and flow rate for each cell must be calculated in each timestep to obtain an accurate drawdown distribution in each timestep the area near the discrete fracture must be strictly encrypted a 3d voronoi mesh maker was presented by olorode et al 2013 to simulate flow behaviours for various complex fracture patterns xu et al 2017 synthesized the embedded discrete fracture method into a numerical simulation although the numerical method can address the complex fracture problem with few assumptions owing to the complexity of nonorthogonal grids and associated limitations of numerical computation these approaches may increase the computational time needed for cases with a large number of cells and a small time step to obtain sufficiently accurate results in addition because of errors associated with numerical dispersion early flow behaviours cannot be observed an alternative method is a semi analytical method that is more flexible in calculation speed and does not need to be meshed in an entire aquifer wang et al 2018a 2018b during recent decades scholars have developed some models for fracture problems in the field of groundwater flow and petroleum engineering gringarten et al 1974 jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 cinco ley and meng 1988 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b luo et al 2019 as pioneers in the field gringarten et al 1974 developed analytical solutions concerning groundwater flow towards fully penetrating vertical fractures they presented a set of type curves for observation wells located at different positions around a finite length fracture jenkins and prentice 1982 presented a linear non radial flow model for an infinitesimally small aperture but an extensively long fracture sen 1986 provided a type curve for the linear to a pumping well and the fracture storage capacity was also considered in his model in the above three models the authors assumed that the flow of a fluid in a fracture is infinitely conductive in this study a semi analytical model is developed to investigate the drawdown transient behaviour in discretely fractured aquifers with multiple finitely conductive fractures first the aquifer model and fracture model are established and the analytical solutions in the aquifer system and fracture system are obtained using laplace transform methodology then a fracture network is discretized into fracture segments and the flux and drawdown equivalent conditions in the laplace space are applied in the fracture wall to couple the fluid flow in both systems the final solutions for wellbore drawdown are presented and compared with the existing analytical solutions of a single fracture model cinco ley and meng 1988 in addition the semi analytical model is more general which allows us to consider any mode of intersection or non intersection among the fractures finally an analysis of important flow characteristics and parameters influencing the factors of discrete fractures is also proposed the main advantage of the solution in the laplace domain is that it requires neither volumetric discretization nor the discretization of time and it can be performed on demand 2 methodology 2 1 basic assumption in this study we assumed that discrete fractures exist in confined aquifers in two ways the first is that discrete fractures do not intersect each other fig 1 a whereas the second is that vertical intersections of some fractures occur fig 1 b the detailed assumptions are as follows 1 the confined aquifer is infinite horizontal with a uniform thickness b a hydraulic conductivity km and an aquifer specific storage capacity ssm and the upper and lower boundaries of the confined aquifer are closed 2 in the process of pumping the temperature change in the aquifers is ignored 3 each well has a constant rate q and can either intersect with the fracture or not 4 a two dimensional darcy seepage occurs in the aquifers and the radius of pumping well is rw 5 because the width of the fracture is much smaller than its length we assumed that a one dimensional flow occurs in the fracture 6 as shown in fig 2 the discrete fracture system contains nf fractures with a full length lfn hydraulic conductivity kfn fracture width wfn angle θn with the x axis and the located position

of simple fractures one comprises a node at one end with the other end being closed which is called a single node model fig 3 a another case is that both ends are nodes which is called a double node model fig 3 b the single node model is a special case of double node model so to generalize our proposed model we describe here the derivation of the double node model as shown in fig 3 c the drawdown and flow rate for double nodes are considered to be unknowns because the fracture volume is exceedingly small compared with the volume of the entire aquifer the response is assumed to instantaneously respond to external changes reaching a pseudo steady state in the fracture although the response of unsteady state models is different from that of the pss model the difference becomes exceedingly small and almost disappears within a short time period alternatively the overall aquifer storage coefficient of the fracture is so small that the effect of storage coefficient can be neglected zeng 2008 as a result the drawdown equation can be given as 8 x fn k fn s fn x fn y fn k fn s fn y fn 0 0 x fn l n w n 2 y fn w n 2 according to darcy s law the terms of k fn s fn x fn and k fn s fn y fn represent the flow velocity parallel to the fracture length and fracture width directions respectively note that the local spatial coordinates in the n th fracture are denoted as x fn y fn and the global spatial coordinates in the aquifer are denoted as x y after translation and rotation transformation fig 4 the relationship between local coordinates and global coordinates is as follows 9 x fn x x ofn cos θ fn y y ofn sin θ fn 10 y fn y y ofn cos θ fn x x ofn sin θ fn the relationship equations imply functional relationship between local coordinates and global coordinates if the local coordinate position is given the corresponding global coordinate can be calculated from the perspective of the entire confined aquifer the fracture width is exceedingly small compared with the fracture length on the two interface surfaces of fracture the flow rate will be equal to the aquifer 11 k fn s fn y fn y fn w fn 2 k m s m l l f 1 n x y 0 x fn l fn y fn w fn 2 k fn s fn y fn y fn w

source a negative indicates the injection source and a positive indicates the extraction sink the type of sink or source is automatically determined by the mass balance principle on the

ith node q fdn 1 is the flow rate of the first surface in the laplace space q fdn 2 is the flow rate of the second surface in the laplace space and c fdn is the dimensionless fracture conductivity for the n th fracture as shown in fig 3c we then discretize the above equation and if the fracture surface is divided into 2nfn segments for j th segment of the n th fracture see fig 3c eq 23 would have the following transformation 24 s fdnj x fdnj s fdwi p 4 π c fdn x fdnj q fdwi 4 π c fdn ε 1 j 1 q f d n ε 1 p δ x fdn 2 2 δ x fdn x fdnj ε δ x fdn δ x fdn 2 8 q fdnj 1 s 4 π c fdn ε 1 j 1 q f d n ε 2

the j th segment of the n th fracture s fdwi is the dimensionless drawdown for i th node in the laplace space for the j th segment of the n th fracture x fdn is the dimensionless segment length of the n th fracture the rest of the symbols are already defined above 2 4 semi analytical solution of the coupled model to obtain the final semi analytical solution we must couple the aquifer model with the discrete fracture model here let us consider the unknowns nf is the number of fractures and each fracture has nfn segments thus the total number of fracture surface fluxes is 25 n tsur n 1 n f 2 n fn in addition n node is the number of nodes in the fracture suppose that the i th node has ni branches as shown in fig 2 each node has ni unknown flow rate q fdwi β fox example if the i th node is linked to the four fractures then ni is equal to 4 and β 1 2 3 4 as shown in fig 2 thus the number of the total unknown flow rate is 26 n trat i 1 n node n i each node has one unknown drawdown sfdwi thus the total number of the unknown drawdown is nnode therefore the total number of unknowns is ntsur ntrat nnode the unknowns in laplace space can be provided in a vector form 27 x q f d 11 1 q f d 12 1 q f d 1 n f 1 1 q f d n 1 1 q f d n 2 1 q fdn n fn 1 q f d 11 2 q f d 12 2 q f d 1 n f 1 2 q f d n 1 2 q f d n 2 2 q fdn n fn 2 n tsur q f d w 1 1 q f d w 1 2 q f d w 1 n 1 q fdw n node 1 q fdw n

eq 24 on the surface of the fracture the following equation can be given 28 s md n j p s fdnj x dj n 1 2 n f j 1 2 n fn n fn 1 2 n fn there are ntsur equations in eq 28 if there is no well outflow at the node the total flow of the node is equal to zero alternately if there is a well at a certain node the sum of the total flow rate should be equal to the well flow rate thus the following equation can be given 29 β 1 n i q fdwi β 0 f o r n o w e l l r a t e q fdwi well f o r w e l l r a t e i 1 2 n node there are nnode equations in eq 29 chen et al 2016 proposed a method to address the problem of intersection flow by manually judging the flow direction however their method was extraordinarily complex and difficult to implement in large scale fracture crossing to obtain an accurate simulation of fracture intersections we used the principle of mass balance to enable the flow redirection automatically rather than artificially as in chen et al 2016 this was ensured by restricting the magnitude of the source on interconnections from different fracture panels this can solve the problem of intersection flow calculations of multiple fractures the model in eq 29 makes it unnecessary for us to judge the flow direction of an intersection as shown in fig 2 the i th node is linked into ni fractures and it will produce ni total flow rate for this node for example there are four fractures linked to the i th node therefore there would be four flow rate in this node in other words each fracture connected to this node has a total flow the relationship between each flow rate and the flux of the fracture segment can be given as follows 30 q fdwi β ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 l fdn n fn ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 2 l fdn n fn i 1 2 n node β 1 2 n i there are ntrat equations in eq 30 notice that there are ntsur ntrat nnode unknowns and there are ntsur ntrat nnode equations equation 30 is suitable for single node model see fig 2 however for double node model see fig 3 c the sum of the flux on the two fracture surface should be equal to the sum of the total flow rate of the two nodes the relationship in eq 30 will be replaced by 31 q fdwi β q f d w i 1 β ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 q f d n ε 2 l fdn n fn i 1 2 n node β 1 2 n i the above equation shows that whether the i th node is or the i 1 th node is used as a reference point only one equation can be created however before that each node will list a different equation such as eq 30 in other words for each double node fracture the number of equations is reduced by one so we must add an auxiliary drawdown equation for each additional double node fracture which is given by 32 s fdwi s f d w i 1 4 π c fdn l fdn q fdwi 4 π c fdn ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 p q f d n ε 2 p δ x n 2 δ x n l fdn ε δ x n eqs 25 32 constitute a linear equation system of the laplace space which can be solved by the gaussian elimination method then the derived solution is brought into equation 7 1 and we can obtain any wellbore drawdown of the laplace space substituting fracture surface flow rate and nodal flow rate into eq 7 2 the drawdown in any location xd yd can be calculated the final wellbore drawdown in the real time domain can be obtained by the stehfest 1970 numerical inversion see s3 of supplementary document kuhlman and neuman 2009 kuhlman and kristopher 2013 has evaluated the laplace space numerical approaches in detail the well radius for the final wellbore drawdown solution is given by 33 r wd x d x wd 2 y d y wd 2 where r wd is the dimensionless wellbore radius which is set to 0 001 in this study 3 results and discussion in this section we will discuss cases for a pumping well in discretely fractured aquifers with multiple finitely conductive fractures in the fractured aquifers any fracture can be described by parameters such as length aperture and orientation sen 1986 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b which is different from the double porosity model fractures can be divided into isolated and interconnected network fracture types of course a pumping well can be arbitrarily arranged in a fracture or matrix we will thus discuss how the drawdown behaviour of a pumping well can change in this analysis we used the drawdown derivative curve analysis method bourdet et al 1983 3 1 comparison with the literature for a well intersected by a conductive fracture prior to this article cinco ley and meng 1988 proposed that a well can be crossed by a finitely conductive fracture which was named as an extended well sen 1986 fig 5 a shows presented drawdown solutions compared with cinco ley and meng 1988 under different conductivity for a pumping well intersected by a finite conductive fracture thus for convenience we simulated this simple case in our model the fracture length lfd was set to 2 and the fracture conductivity cfd was set to 5 15 60 and 300 respectively the pumping well was located at xd 0 yd 0 the fracture centre was located at xd 0 yd 0 and the angle with the axis was 0 the solution cinco ley and meng 1988 is the dimensionless pressure solution and it can be found that the proposed solution is in good agreement with their solution in the field of well test analyses for hydrology and petroleum the dimensionless drawdown equation is similar to the dimensionless pressure equation in the literature so their results are comparable however the previous solution cinco ley and meng 1988 is only a special case of the proposed model the subgraph in fig 5 a shows the drawdown distribution of the dimensionless time the shape of equipotential lines near the extended wells is elliptical which implies that an elliptical flow will occur for an extended well in a confined aquifer fig 5 b shows drawdown solutions compared with gringarten et al 1974 for an infinite conductive fracture red line represents the drawdown solution for a pumping well intersected by one fracture and blue line represents drawdown solutions for a pumping well near a fracture we compared our solution with their solution gringarten et al 1974 in this specific case the fracture length lfd was set to 2 and the distance between the fracture and the pumping well was set to 0 02 fig 5 b shows that the drawdown curves can completely coincide however their results are exceedingly limited first their method can only calculate a finite length fracture and fractures are infinitely conductive second they only assumed that the well and the fracture intersected if a well and fracture were to separate their method could not calculate the drawdown in this study from comparing a simple case we found that the drawdown was exceedingly different depending on whether the well and fracture intersected or not the proposed model in this study allows us to consider the problems of pumping tests in many complex fracture networks including parallel uncrossed fracture networks arbitrary distribution non intersected fracture networks intersected fracture networks with some isolated fractures 3 2 drawdown behaviour for a pumping well near a conductive natural fracture fig 6 shows the drawdown behaviour for a pumping well near a conductive natural fracture under the effect of different fracture parameters the analysis of such an example is helpful for us to understand the drawdown behaviour in a more complex fracture system the derivative of the drawdown can better reflect the flow characteristics of confined aquifers warren and root 1963 moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 as shown in fig 6 the derivative of the drawdown for all sub figures shows three flow periods an early time radial flow period transient flow period and late time quasi radial flow period whether in the early or late stage of flow the derivative of the drawdown shows one constant straight and one dip valley appears in the transient flow period fig 6 a shows the effect of dimensionless distance d between the fracture and pumping well for the drawdown and its derivative the dimensionless distance d was set to 0 03 0 05 and 0 1 respectively in this case the dimensionless fracture length lfd was set to 2 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time in the early time radial flow period yielded a straight line whose slope was related to the hydraulic conductivity of the confined aquifer the end time of early time radial flow was related to the distance d and the shorter the distance was the earlier the end time was next the drawdown curves with a shorter distance caused a smaller drawdown loss as this was useful for pumping implying that pumping wells should be drilled near natural fractures the log log plot wellbore drawdown derivative vs time in the transient flow period yielded one whose depth was related to the distance a shorter distance would cause a deeper dip valley and an earlier starting time fig 6 b shows the effect of dimensionless natural fracture length lfd on drawdown and its derivative the dimensionless distance lfd was set to 0 5 2 and 4 respectively the distance between a pumping well and a natural fracture d was set to 0 05 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time result showed that all drawdown curves coincided with each other in the early time radial flow period a shorter fracture length yielded a larger drawdown loss in the later period the plot of the drawdown derivative shows a unit constant straight line in both the early time and later time flow periods and that a longer fracture length would cause a deeper dip valley in the transient flow period fig 6 c shows the effect of natural fracture conductivity c fd during the drawdown and its derivative the fracture conductivity cfd was set to 2 20 and 300 respectively the distance between a pumping well and a natural fracture d was set to 0 05 and the fracture length lfd was set to 2 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time showed that a larger fracture conductivity would cause a smaller drawdown loss however this phenomenon was not infinite when the conductivity is greater than 20 the drawdown loss changes negligibly the plot of the drawdown derivative shows that a greater conductivity leads to a deeper dip valley fig 6 d shows the effect of the relative location between a pumping well and a natural fracture the fracture length lfd was set to 2 the sub figure in fig 5 d shows two cases the coordinate of a pumping well was located at 0 0 for case 1 the centre coordinate of the fracture was located at 0 0 05 and for case 2 the coordinate of fracture s left tip was located at 0 05 0 the drawdown loss was the largest when the fracture left tip was close to the pumping well i e case 2 the drawdown derivative curve thus implied that case 2 had a shallower dip valley 3 3 effect of increasing number of fractures on drawdown behaviour fig 7 shows the effect of a pumping well with additional fractures upon drawdown and its derivative there are four cases to consider fracture 1 fractures 1 through 2 fractures 1 through 3 and fractures 1 through 4 fracture 1 is the nearest to the pumping well the drawdown derivative plot shows that one dip valley is observed in the transient flow period for case 1 when only fracture 1 is considered as additional fractures fractures 2 3 4 appear away from the pumping well a second dip valley can be found and the time of occurrence is when the dimensionless time equals 0 3 the first dip valleys for cases 2 4 are in accordance with each other which also indicates that the first case is mainly affected by fracture 1 there will obviously be additional dip valleys at a certain fracture number fracture distribution fracture orientation fracture length and fracture width the drawdown plot shows that when the dimensionless time is less than 0 4 all the curves are coincident with each other and this implies that 0 4 is the critical point at which other fracture begins to act when the dimensionless time is more than 0 4 the head loss increases gradually with the increasing natural fractures 3 4 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with parallel and non intersected fracture networks we have discussed the groundwater drawdown transient behaviour of a pumping well in the vicinity of one fracture and four fractures next we evaluate how the drawdown behaviour of a pumping well s position changes in the fracture networks fig 8 shows a pumping well arranged in a parallel fracture network with 27 fractures that do not intersect fig 8 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is located at xd 4 and yd 1 7 and the pumping well is relatively far away from the fracture in case 2 a pumping well is located at xd 1 8 and yd 0 6 and this well is near a fracture tip in case 3 a pumping well is located at xd 0 2 and yd 0 8 and the pumping well is near a shorter fracture in case 4 a pumping well is located at xd 0 4 and yd 0 84 and the pumping well is near a longer fracture fig 8 b shows the effect of well location on the dimensionless drawdown and its derivative in a parallel and non intersected fracture network from the drawdown curve in case 1 the well is far away from the natural fracture and the maximum drawdown indicates that the corresponding loss of head is also the largest in case 4 the pumping well is closest to the longer natural fracture so its drawdown and loss of head are the smallest according to these results we can presume that the loss of head is related to the distances between the well and fracture fracture conductivity and fracture density and so on the derivative curve shows the length of the transient flow period and the number of dip valleys which are greatly influenced by well location in case 1 only one dip valley can be observed and it is shallow and has the shortest duration in case 2 the pumping well is close to the fracture end point the duration of transient flow period is relatively long and the dip valley is deep in case 3 the pumping well is close to the short fracture and is located in the centre of the fracture network three dip valleys can be observed which is the result of the interaction of natural fractures with different lengths nearby in case 4 two dip valleys can be observed because the well is long close to the fracture and located in the centre of the fracture network the natural fracture has the longest influence time so the opening of dip valley is exceedingly large 3 5 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with a random azimuth angle and non intersected fracture networks fig 9 shows a pumping well arranged in a fracture network with 30 fractures with random azimuth angles that do not intersect fig 9 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is located at xd 2 6 and yd 4 95 a pumping well is positioned at xd 1 6 and yd 0 9 in case 2 in case 3 a pumping well is placed at xd 1 6 and yd 1 5 in case 4 a pumping well is placed at xd 2 05 and yd 1 the drawdown and drawdown derivative curves are shown in fig 9 b in cases 2 and 3 the well location is the closest to the natural fracture their associated curves show that the two cases drawdowns are relatively close case 1 shows the maximum drawdown whereas case 4 contains the minimum drawdown this indicates that the head loss of the pumping well near the long fracture is the smallest the drawdown derivative curves also show that only one or two dip valleys are present in each case moreover the opening sizes these dip valleys are relatively inconsistent indicating that the flow behaviour is different under the condition of different well location because the fracture is randomly distributed in the confined aquifers with any angle and any length the drawdown derivatives of different well positions are strongly unique one dip valley can be observed in case 1 and two dip valleys can be observed in cases 2 and 3 owing to the different well locations there are many possible situations for the shapes of drawdown derivatives however this finding is different from the warren root model which has nothing to do with well locations 3 6 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with a random azimuth angle and intersected fracture networks unlike previous examples in the real world the underground geological conditions are very complex under the influence of structure stress groundwater environment dissolution and other actions a long term geological process results in an uneven distribution of natural fractures in the aquifers some fractures are connected to form a connected natural fracture network and some fractures remain isolated and randomly distributed for a more general example fig 10 a shows a pumping well arranged in a complex natural fracture network with 16 intersected fractures blue lines and 4 isolated fractures green lines fig 10 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is placed at xd 0 9 and yd 1 where the pumping well is not intersected by fracture networks and is near the intersected fractures the position of a pumping well in case 2 is xd 0 2 and yd 2 74 where the well is near an isolated fracture in case 3 a pumping well is located at xd 0 076 and yd 2 73 where the pumping well intersects an isolated fracture in case 4 a pumping well is placed at xd 1 06 and yd 3 15 and the pumping well is intersected by the connected natural fracture network four cases are shown in fig 10 b in cases 1 and 2 when the well does not intersect any fractures the dimensionless drawdown is higher than the drawdowns in cases 3 and 4 in the early stage the two drawdown curves coincide with each other when the dimensionless time is greater than 0 0004 the drawdown curve bifurcates the dimensionless drawdown of the well arranged in the fracture network is higher than its counterpart suggesting that the former s head loss is the largest in cases 3 and 4 the drawdown of the well intersecting the fracture is much lower than its counterpart which implies that the head loss is small when the well is intersected by natural fractures finally the drawdown of the well intersecting the connected fracture network is lower than that of the well intersecting the isolated fracture the drawdown derivative curve shows that the four cases are considerably different when a pumping well is arranged in the fracture networks and does not intersect the fracture network the drawdown derivative curve shows a deep dip valley in the period of unstable flow which is caused by the influence of the fracture network when the drawdown disturbance propagates to the fracture network as the isolated fracture is far from the well it is not felt in the second case the isolated fracture closest to the pumping well is felt and the drawdown derivative shows the first dip valley then as the drawdown disturbance continues to propagate the connected fracture network is sensed and the second dip valley appears because of the large area of the fracture network connected by large fractures the second dip valley is deeper in the third case when a well is crossed by an isolated fracture only a single dip valley can be observed because the fracture network is felt at this time the pumping well and the isolated fracture are connected as a whole in the fourth case the pumping well is crossed by the connected fracture network and no dip valley is felt because the whole fracture network and the well are considered as a whole figs 11 and 12 show the drawdown field distribution at the dimensionless time td 0 1 the drawdown in case 1 is the largest because the pumping well is in the matrix and is far away from the fracture and the wellbore drawdown has no place to release the lowest head loss is in case 4 when the well is connected with the connected fracture network because the propagation speed of the fracture network is rapid the drawdown quickly affects the entire fracture network the drawdown in case 2 is similar to that in case 3 the well is near or intersects with the isolated fracture and the head loss is also large this is because the isolated fracture is not connected with the fracture network and its propagation speed is affected by the low hydraulic conductivity in matrix figs 11 and 12 intuitively demonstrate the evolution of head contours over time in different cases of fracture configurations the drawdown increases with time and the flow characteristic on wellbore is determined by the pattern of the head contour in the conventional warren root model and traditional concept warren and root 1963 moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 the shape of the dip valley is mainly affected by two factors the storage coefficient and the inter porosity coefficient however this study illustrates that the number of dip valleys on the curve of drawdown derivative is closely related to the fracture density fracture length fracture conductivity fracture distribution and position of the well 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel semi analytical model to study the drawdown transient behaviour in a fractured aquifer with multiple intersecting or isolated natural fractures aquifer and natural fracture models were both established the coupling model and linear equations were obtained through the coupling conditions of fracture wall in laplace space the final drawdown solution was proposed using the stehfest numerical inversion the following conclusions were derived 1 the presented drawdown solution was compared with a previous solution for a pumping well intersected by a natural fracture with double wings and the comparative results were in accordance 2 the case for a pumping well with an isolated fracture showed the important effects of fracture conductivity fracture length distance between the well and fracture and location of the fracture during dimensionless drawdown 3 the case for a pumping well with four isolated fractures showed that the drawdown derivative was obviously affected by the fracture number additional dip valleys will occur with an increasing fracture number and the head loss increased gradually with the increasing natural fractures 4 the effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with parallel and non intersected fracture networks was analysed the result indicated that because the studied well was long close to the fracture and placed at the centre of the isolated fracture network the natural fracture had the longest influence time so the dip valley opening was large three dip valleys were observed which was the result of the interaction of natural fractures with different lengths 5 the effect of well location on the drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with random azimuth angles and non intersected fracture networks was evaluated the head loss of the pumping well near the long fracture was the smallest moreover the calculation results showed that when the pumping well was intersected by the connected fracture network the head loss was the smallest during the pumping test process the well should be drilled into the connected fracture network as much as possible credit authorship contribution statement lei wang conceptualization writing original draft hong zhou data curation validation junlei

4907,in this paper a novel semi analytical model for pumping tests in discretely fractured aquifers with randomly distributed and finitely conductive fractures is presented to investigate the wellbore drawdown transient behaviour an aquifer model and discrete fracture model are established the flux and drawdown equivalent conditions in the laplace space are applied in the fracture wall to couple the fluid flow in both systems the advantage of the proposed semi analytical model is that only fractures must be separated into segments not the entire domain then a matrix of the fracture segment in laplace space can be built and solved by using gauss s elimination method a final solution for wellbore drawdown can be easily evaluated using the numerical laplace inversion algorithm of stehfest the model is compared with a previous result of an extended well the proposed model allows us to consider the problems of pumping tests in complex fracture networks including parallel uncrossed fracture networks arbitrary distribution non intersected fracture networks and intersected fracture networks with isolated fractures in the past studies some scholars have found that the drawdown or pressure derivative curve will present only one dip valley which looks like a v shaped curve for the naturally fractured confined aquifer or reservoirs and number of dip valleys are only related to porous media type however this study illustrates that the drawdown transient behaviour and the number of dip valleys are closely related to fracture density fracture conductivity fracture length fracture orientation fracture distribution position of a pumping well and the distance between the pumping well and fracture keywords semi analytical model pumping tests discretely fractured aquifers wellbore drawdown 1 introduction fractured aquifers play an important role in regional water supplies many fractures can exist in carbonate sandstone volcanic and other hard rock formations gerke and van genuchten 1993 the widely known double porosity model is often used to study the unsteady behaviour of drawdowns warren and root 1963 a previous study noted that the spatial arbitrary unit is composed of a matrix and fracture the matrix s main role is to store fluid and the fracture acts as the flow channel for the fluid smedt 2011 the exchange function is often used to describe the inter porosity flow between the matrix and fracture kazemi 1969 the assumption of a continuous medium was used to define double porosity models by barenblatt et al 1960 additionally warren and root 1963 established an ideal system formed by matrix blocks separated by orthogonal fractures they then obtained drawdown solutions considering the quasi steady state inter porosity flow between the matrixes and fractures in fractured aquifers the transient inter porosity flow models between the matrixes and fractures were presented by kazemi 1969 we cannot judge which model is better or worse but the quasi steady state model greatly simplifies several mathematical derivations önder 1998 in recent decades owing to its relative simplification and high efficiency the double porosity model has been favoured by an increasing number of researchers moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 mei et al 2020 the head transient behaviour for pumping tests in fractured aquifers has been also discussed in compendiums of aquifer test analysis e g kruseman and de ridder 1991 batu 1998 cheng 2000 and walton 2006 a recent overview of flow models for well testing in fractured media was given by nielsen 2007 at present the continuous medium dual porosity model has been widely used in the field of groundwater seepage and petroleum engineering boulton and streltsova 1977 gerke and van genuchten 1993 ge 1997 slimani and tiab 2008 however owing to the complexity of underground geological conditions and fracture morphology we still face new challenges in the real world fracture systems are not orthogonal the distribution of fractures may be random and the length conductivity and orientation of each fracture are different cai et al 2017 liu et al 2018 to consider the fracture flow behaviour in a stricter sense the flow in the fractures must be considered explicitly the discrete fracture networks dfn model can be used to accurately simulate the flow behaviour in fractures lee et al 2001 karimi et al 2004 in the literature of groundwater and petroleum scholars have attempted to use numerical methods to study the discrete fracture network olorode et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 in most standard numerical methods the whole domain is divided into small cells and the drawdown and flow rate for each cell must be calculated in each timestep to obtain an accurate drawdown distribution in each timestep the area near the discrete fracture must be strictly encrypted a 3d voronoi mesh maker was presented by olorode et al 2013 to simulate flow behaviours for various complex fracture patterns xu et al 2017 synthesized the embedded discrete fracture method into a numerical simulation although the numerical method can address the complex fracture problem with few assumptions owing to the complexity of nonorthogonal grids and associated limitations of numerical computation these approaches may increase the computational time needed for cases with a large number of cells and a small time step to obtain sufficiently accurate results in addition because of errors associated with numerical dispersion early flow behaviours cannot be observed an alternative method is a semi analytical method that is more flexible in calculation speed and does not need to be meshed in an entire aquifer wang et al 2018a 2018b during recent decades scholars have developed some models for fracture problems in the field of groundwater flow and petroleum engineering gringarten et al 1974 jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 cinco ley and meng 1988 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b luo et al 2019 as pioneers in the field gringarten et al 1974 developed analytical solutions concerning groundwater flow towards fully penetrating vertical fractures they presented a set of type curves for observation wells located at different positions around a finite length fracture jenkins and prentice 1982 presented a linear non radial flow model for an infinitesimally small aperture but an extensively long fracture sen 1986 provided a type curve for the linear to a pumping well and the fracture storage capacity was also considered in his model in the above three models the authors assumed that the flow of a fluid in a fracture is infinitely conductive in this study a semi analytical model is developed to investigate the drawdown transient behaviour in discretely fractured aquifers with multiple finitely conductive fractures first the aquifer model and fracture model are established and the analytical solutions in the aquifer system and fracture system are obtained using laplace transform methodology then a fracture network is discretized into fracture segments and the flux and drawdown equivalent conditions in the laplace space are applied in the fracture wall to couple the fluid flow in both systems the final solutions for wellbore drawdown are presented and compared with the existing analytical solutions of a single fracture model cinco ley and meng 1988 in addition the semi analytical model is more general which allows us to consider any mode of intersection or non intersection among the fractures finally an analysis of important flow characteristics and parameters influencing the factors of discrete fractures is also proposed the main advantage of the solution in the laplace domain is that it requires neither volumetric discretization nor the discretization of time and it can be performed on demand 2 methodology 2 1 basic assumption in this study we assumed that discrete fractures exist in confined aquifers in two ways the first is that discrete fractures do not intersect each other fig 1 a whereas the second is that vertical intersections of some fractures occur fig 1 b the detailed assumptions are as follows 1 the confined aquifer is infinite horizontal with a uniform thickness b a hydraulic conductivity km and an aquifer specific storage capacity ssm and the upper and lower boundaries of the confined aquifer are closed 2 in the process of pumping the temperature change in the aquifers is ignored 3 each well has a constant rate q and can either intersect with the fracture or not 4 a two dimensional darcy seepage occurs in the aquifers and the radius of pumping well is rw 5 because the width of the fracture is much smaller than its length we assumed that a one dimensional flow occurs in the fracture 6 as shown in fig 2 the discrete fracture system contains nf fractures with a full length lfn hydraulic conductivity kfn fracture width wfn angle θn with the x axis and the located position

of simple fractures one comprises a node at one end with the other end being closed which is called a single node model fig 3 a another case is that both ends are nodes which is called a double node model fig 3 b the single node model is a special case of double node model so to generalize our proposed model we describe here the derivation of the double node model as shown in fig 3 c the drawdown and flow rate for double nodes are considered to be unknowns because the fracture volume is exceedingly small compared with the volume of the entire aquifer the response is assumed to instantaneously respond to external changes reaching a pseudo steady state in the fracture although the response of unsteady state models is different from that of the pss model the difference becomes exceedingly small and almost disappears within a short time period alternatively the overall aquifer storage coefficient of the fracture is so small that the effect of storage coefficient can be neglected zeng 2008 as a result the drawdown equation can be given as 8 x fn k fn s fn x fn y fn k fn s fn y fn 0 0 x fn l n w n 2 y fn w n 2 according to darcy s law the terms of k fn s fn x fn and k fn s fn y fn represent the flow velocity parallel to the fracture length and fracture width directions respectively note that the local spatial coordinates in the n th fracture are denoted as x fn y fn and the global spatial coordinates in the aquifer are denoted as x y after translation and rotation transformation fig 4 the relationship between local coordinates and global coordinates is as follows 9 x fn x x ofn cos θ fn y y ofn sin θ fn 10 y fn y y ofn cos θ fn x x ofn sin θ fn the relationship equations imply functional relationship between local coordinates and global coordinates if the local coordinate position is given the corresponding global coordinate can be calculated from the perspective of the entire confined aquifer the fracture width is exceedingly small compared with the fracture length on the two interface surfaces of fracture the flow rate will be equal to the aquifer 11 k fn s fn y fn y fn w fn 2 k m s m l l f 1 n x y 0 x fn l fn y fn w fn 2 k fn s fn y fn y fn w

source a negative indicates the injection source and a positive indicates the extraction sink the type of sink or source is automatically determined by the mass balance principle on the interconnection among different fracture units eqs 13 17 form the discrete fracture drawdown equations we can use the following dimensionless definitions to make the above equation dimensionless as

ith node q fdn 1 is the flow rate of the first surface in the laplace space q fdn 2 is the flow rate of the second surface in the laplace space and c fdn is the dimensionless fracture conductivity for the n th fracture as shown in fig 3c we then discretize the above equation and if the fracture surface is divided into 2nfn segments for j th segment of the n th fracture see fig 3c eq 23 would have

the j th segment of the n th fracture s fdwi is the dimensionless drawdown for i th node in the laplace space for the j th segment of the n th fracture x fdn is the dimensionless segment length of the n th fracture the rest of the symbols are already defined above 2 4 semi analytical solution of the coupled model to obtain the final semi analytical solution we must couple the aquifer model with the discrete fracture model here let us consider the unknowns nf is the number of fractures and each fracture has nfn segments thus the total number of fracture surface fluxes is 25 n tsur n 1 n f 2 n fn in addition n node is the number of nodes in the fracture suppose that the i th node has ni branches as shown in fig 2 each node has ni unknown flow rate q fdwi β fox example if the i th node is linked to the four fractures then ni is equal to 4 and β 1 2 3 4 as shown in fig 2 thus the number of the total unknown flow rate is 26 n trat i 1 n node n i each node has one unknown drawdown sfdwi thus the total number of the unknown drawdown is nnode therefore the total number of unknowns is ntsur ntrat nnode the unknowns in laplace space can be provided in a vector form 27 x q f d 11 1 q f d

eq 24 on the surface of the fracture the following equation can be given 28 s md n j p s fdnj x dj n 1 2 n f j 1 2 n fn n fn 1 2 n fn there are ntsur equations in eq 28 if there is no well outflow at the node the total flow of the node is equal to zero alternately if there is a well at a certain node the sum of the total flow rate should be equal to the well flow rate thus the following equation can be given 29 β 1 n i q fdwi β 0 f o r n o w e l l r a t e q fdwi well f o r w e l l r a t e i 1 2 n node there are nnode equations in eq 29 chen et al 2016 proposed a method to address the problem of intersection flow by manually judging the flow direction however their method was extraordinarily complex and difficult to implement in large scale fracture crossing to obtain an accurate simulation of fracture intersections we used the principle of mass balance to enable the flow redirection automatically rather than artificially as in chen et al 2016 this was ensured by restricting the magnitude of the source on interconnections from different fracture panels this can solve the problem of intersection flow calculations of multiple fractures the model in eq 29 makes it unnecessary for us to judge the flow direction of an intersection as shown in fig 2 the i th node is linked into ni fractures and it will produce ni total flow rate for this node for example there are four fractures linked to the i th node therefore there would be four flow rate in this node in other words each fracture connected to this node has a total flow the relationship between each flow rate and the flux of the fracture segment can be given as follows 30 q fdwi β ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 l fdn n fn ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 2 l fdn n fn i 1 2 n node β 1 2 n i there are ntrat equations in eq 30 notice that there are ntsur ntrat nnode unknowns and there are ntsur ntrat nnode equations equation 30 is suitable for single node model see fig 2 however for double node model see fig 3 c the sum of the flux on the two fracture surface should be equal to the sum of the total flow rate of the two nodes the relationship in eq 30 will be replaced by 31 q fdwi β q f d w i 1 β ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 q f d n ε 2 l fdn n fn i 1 2 n node β 1 2 n i the above equation shows that whether the i th node is or the i 1 th node is used as a reference point only one equation can be created however before that each node will list a different equation such as eq 30 in other words for each double node fracture the number of equations is reduced by one so we must add an auxiliary drawdown equation for each additional double node fracture which is given by 32 s fdwi s f d w i 1 4 π c fdn l fdn q fdwi 4 π c fdn ε 1 n fn q f d n ε 1 p q f d n ε 2 p δ x n 2 δ x n l fdn ε δ x n eqs 25 32 constitute a linear equation system of the laplace space which can be solved by the gaussian elimination method then the derived solution is brought into equation 7 1 and we can obtain any wellbore drawdown of the laplace space substituting fracture surface flow rate and nodal flow rate into eq 7 2 the drawdown in any location xd yd can be calculated the final wellbore drawdown in the real time domain can be obtained by the stehfest 1970 numerical inversion see s3 of supplementary document kuhlman and neuman 2009 kuhlman and kristopher 2013 has evaluated the laplace space numerical approaches in detail the well radius for the final wellbore drawdown solution is given by 33 r wd x d x wd 2 y d y wd 2 where r wd is the dimensionless wellbore radius which is set to 0 001 in this study 3 results and discussion in this section we will discuss cases for a pumping well in discretely fractured aquifers with multiple finitely conductive fractures in the fractured aquifers any fracture can be described by parameters such as length aperture and orientation sen 1986 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a 2018b which is different from the double porosity model fractures can be divided into isolated and interconnected network fracture types of course a pumping well can be arbitrarily arranged in a fracture or matrix we will thus discuss how the drawdown behaviour of a pumping well can change in this analysis we used the drawdown derivative curve analysis method bourdet et al 1983 3 1 comparison with the literature for a well intersected by a conductive fracture prior to this article cinco ley and meng 1988 proposed that a well can be crossed by a finitely conductive fracture which was named as an extended well sen 1986 fig 5 a shows presented drawdown solutions compared with cinco ley and meng 1988 under different conductivity for a pumping well intersected by a finite conductive fracture thus for convenience we simulated this simple case in our model the fracture length lfd was set to 2 and the fracture conductivity cfd was set to 5 15 60 and 300 respectively the pumping well was located at xd 0 yd 0 the fracture centre was located at xd 0 yd 0 and the angle with the axis was 0 the solution cinco ley and meng 1988 is the dimensionless pressure solution and it can be found that the proposed solution is in good agreement with their solution in the field of well test analyses for hydrology and petroleum the dimensionless drawdown equation is similar to the dimensionless pressure equation in the literature so their results are comparable however the previous solution cinco ley and meng 1988 is only a special case of the proposed model the subgraph in fig 5 a shows the drawdown distribution of the dimensionless time the shape of equipotential lines near the extended wells is elliptical which implies that an elliptical flow will occur for an extended well in a confined aquifer fig 5 b shows drawdown solutions compared with gringarten et al 1974 for an infinite conductive fracture red line represents the drawdown solution for a pumping well intersected by one fracture and blue line represents drawdown solutions for a pumping well near a fracture we compared our solution with their solution gringarten et al 1974 in this specific case the fracture length lfd was set to 2 and the distance between the fracture and the pumping well was set to 0 02 fig 5 b shows that the drawdown curves can completely coincide however their results are exceedingly limited first their method can only calculate a finite length fracture and fractures are infinitely conductive second they only assumed that the well and the fracture intersected if a well and fracture were to separate their method could not calculate the drawdown in this study from comparing a simple case we found that the drawdown was exceedingly different depending on whether the well and fracture intersected or not the proposed model in this study allows us to consider the problems of pumping tests in many complex fracture networks including parallel uncrossed fracture networks arbitrary distribution non intersected fracture networks intersected fracture networks with some isolated fractures 3 2 drawdown behaviour for a pumping well near a conductive natural fracture fig 6 shows the drawdown behaviour for a pumping well near a conductive natural fracture under the effect of different fracture parameters the analysis of such an example is helpful for us to understand the drawdown behaviour in a more complex fracture system the derivative of the drawdown can better reflect the flow characteristics of confined aquifers warren and root 1963 moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 as shown in fig 6 the derivative of the drawdown for all sub figures shows three flow periods an early time radial flow period transient flow period and late time quasi radial flow period whether in the early or late stage of flow the derivative of the drawdown shows one constant straight and one dip valley appears in the transient flow period fig 6 a shows the effect of dimensionless distance d between the fracture and pumping well for the drawdown and its derivative the dimensionless distance d was set to 0 03 0 05 and 0 1 respectively in this case the dimensionless fracture length lfd was set to 2 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time in the early time radial flow period yielded a straight line whose slope was related to the hydraulic conductivity of the confined aquifer the end time of early time radial flow was related to the distance d and the shorter the distance was the earlier the end time was next the drawdown curves with a shorter distance caused a smaller drawdown loss as this was useful for pumping implying that pumping wells should be drilled near natural fractures the log log plot wellbore drawdown derivative vs time in the transient flow period yielded one whose depth was related to the distance a shorter distance would cause a deeper dip valley and an earlier starting time fig 6 b shows the effect of dimensionless natural fracture length lfd on drawdown and its derivative the dimensionless distance lfd was set to 0 5 2 and 4 respectively the distance between a pumping well and a natural fracture d was set to 0 05 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time result showed that all drawdown curves coincided with each other in the early time radial flow period a shorter fracture length yielded a larger drawdown loss in the later period the plot of the drawdown derivative shows a unit constant straight line in both the early time and later time flow periods and that a longer fracture length would cause a deeper dip valley in the transient flow period fig 6 c shows the effect of natural fracture conductivity c fd during the drawdown and its derivative the fracture conductivity cfd was set to 2 20 and 300 respectively the distance between a pumping well and a natural fracture d was set to 0 05 and the fracture length lfd was set to 2 the semi log plot wellbore drawdown vs time showed that a larger fracture conductivity would cause a smaller drawdown loss however this phenomenon was not infinite when the conductivity is greater than 20 the drawdown loss changes negligibly the plot of the drawdown derivative shows that a greater conductivity leads to a deeper dip valley fig 6 d shows the effect of the relative location between a pumping well and a natural fracture the fracture length lfd was set to 2 the sub figure in fig 5 d shows two cases the coordinate of a pumping well was located at 0 0 for case 1 the centre coordinate of the fracture was located at 0 0 05 and for case 2 the coordinate of fracture s left tip was located at 0 05 0 the drawdown loss was the largest when the fracture left tip was close to the pumping well i e case 2 the drawdown derivative curve thus implied that case 2 had a shallower dip valley 3 3 effect of increasing number of fractures on drawdown behaviour fig 7 shows the effect of a pumping well with additional fractures upon drawdown and its derivative there are four cases to consider fracture 1 fractures 1 through 2 fractures 1 through 3 and fractures 1 through 4 fracture 1 is the nearest to the pumping well the drawdown derivative plot shows that one dip valley is observed in the transient flow period for case 1 when only fracture 1 is considered as additional fractures fractures 2 3 4 appear away from the pumping well a second dip valley can be found and the time of occurrence is when the dimensionless time equals 0 3 the first dip valleys for cases 2 4 are in accordance with each other which also indicates that the first case is mainly affected by fracture 1 there will obviously be additional dip valleys at a certain fracture number fracture distribution fracture orientation fracture length and fracture width the drawdown plot shows that when the dimensionless time is less than 0 4 all the curves are coincident with each other and this implies that 0 4 is the critical point at which other fracture begins to act when the dimensionless time is more than 0 4 the head loss increases gradually with the increasing natural fractures 3 4 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with parallel and non intersected fracture networks we have discussed the groundwater drawdown transient behaviour of a pumping well in the vicinity of one fracture and four fractures next we evaluate how the drawdown behaviour of a pumping well s position changes in the fracture networks fig 8 shows a pumping well arranged in a parallel fracture network with 27 fractures that do not intersect fig 8 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is located at xd 4 and yd 1 7 and the pumping well is relatively far away from the fracture in case 2 a pumping well is located at xd 1 8 and yd 0 6 and this well is near a fracture tip in case 3 a pumping well is located at xd 0 2 and yd 0 8 and the pumping well is near a shorter fracture in case 4 a pumping well is located at xd 0 4 and yd 0 84 and the pumping well is near a longer fracture fig 8 b shows the effect of well location on the dimensionless drawdown and its derivative in a parallel and non intersected fracture network from the drawdown curve in case 1 the well is far away from the natural fracture and the maximum drawdown indicates that the corresponding loss of head is also the largest in case 4 the pumping well is closest to the longer natural fracture so its drawdown and loss of head are the smallest according to these results we can presume that the loss of head is related to the distances between the well and fracture fracture conductivity and fracture density and so on the derivative curve shows the length of the transient flow period and the number of dip valleys which are greatly influenced by well location in case 1 only one dip valley can be observed and it is shallow and has the shortest duration in case 2 the pumping well is close to the fracture end point the duration of transient flow period is relatively long and the dip valley is deep in case 3 the pumping well is close to the short fracture and is located in the centre of the fracture network three dip valleys can be observed which is the result of the interaction of natural fractures with different lengths nearby in case 4 two dip valleys can be observed because the well is long close to the fracture and located in the centre of the fracture network the natural fracture has the longest influence time so the opening of dip valley is exceedingly large 3 5 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with a random azimuth angle and non intersected fracture networks fig 9 shows a pumping well arranged in a fracture network with 30 fractures with random azimuth angles that do not intersect fig 9 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is located at xd 2 6 and yd 4 95 a pumping well is positioned at xd 1 6 and yd 0 9 in case 2 in case 3 a pumping well is placed at xd 1 6 and yd 1 5 in case 4 a pumping well is placed at xd 2 05 and yd 1 the drawdown and drawdown derivative curves are shown in fig 9 b in cases 2 and 3 the well location is the closest to the natural fracture their associated curves show that the two cases drawdowns are relatively close case 1 shows the maximum drawdown whereas case 4 contains the minimum drawdown this indicates that the head loss of the pumping well near the long fracture is the smallest the drawdown derivative curves also show that only one or two dip valleys are present in each case moreover the opening sizes these dip valleys are relatively inconsistent indicating that the flow behaviour is different under the condition of different well location because the fracture is randomly distributed in the confined aquifers with any angle and any length the drawdown derivatives of different well positions are strongly unique one dip valley can be observed in case 1 and two dip valleys can be observed in cases 2 and 3 owing to the different well locations there are many possible situations for the shapes of drawdown derivatives however this finding is different from the warren root model which has nothing to do with well locations 3 6 effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with a random azimuth angle and intersected fracture networks unlike previous examples in the real world the underground geological conditions are very complex under the influence of structure stress groundwater environment dissolution and other actions a long term geological process results in an uneven distribution of natural fractures in the aquifers some fractures are connected to form a connected natural fracture network and some fractures remain isolated and randomly distributed for a more general example fig 10 a shows a pumping well arranged in a complex natural fracture network with 16 intersected fractures blue lines and 4 isolated fractures green lines fig 10 a shows four well location arrangements to be discussed in case 1 a pumping well is placed at xd 0 9 and yd 1 where the pumping well is not intersected by fracture networks and is near the intersected fractures the position of a pumping well in case 2 is xd 0 2 and yd 2 74 where the well is near an isolated fracture in case 3 a pumping well is located at xd 0 076 and yd 2 73 where the pumping well intersects an isolated fracture in case 4 a pumping well is placed at xd 1 06 and yd 3 15 and the pumping well is intersected by the connected natural fracture network four cases are shown in fig 10 b in cases 1 and 2 when the well does not intersect any fractures the dimensionless drawdown is higher than the drawdowns in cases 3 and 4 in the early stage the two drawdown curves coincide with each other when the dimensionless time is greater than 0 0004 the drawdown curve bifurcates the dimensionless drawdown of the well arranged in the fracture network is higher than its counterpart suggesting that the former s head loss is the largest in cases 3 and 4 the drawdown of the well intersecting the fracture is much lower than its counterpart which implies that the head loss is small when the well is intersected by natural fractures finally the drawdown of the well intersecting the connected fracture network is lower than that of the well intersecting the isolated fracture the drawdown derivative curve shows that the four cases are considerably different when a pumping well is arranged in the fracture networks and does not intersect the fracture network the drawdown derivative curve shows a deep dip valley in the period of unstable flow which is caused by the influence of the fracture network when the drawdown disturbance propagates to the fracture network as the isolated fracture is far from the well it is not felt in the second case the isolated fracture closest to the pumping well is felt and the drawdown derivative shows the first dip valley then as the drawdown disturbance continues to propagate the connected fracture network is sensed and the second dip valley appears because of the large area of the fracture network connected by large fractures the second dip valley is deeper in the third case when a well is crossed by an isolated fracture only a single dip valley can be observed because the fracture network is felt at this time the pumping well and the isolated fracture are connected as a whole in the fourth case the pumping well is crossed by the connected fracture network and no dip valley is felt because the whole fracture network and the well are considered as a whole figs 11 and 12 show the drawdown field distribution at the dimensionless time td 0 1 the drawdown in case 1 is the largest because the pumping well is in the matrix and is far away from the fracture and the wellbore drawdown has no place to release the lowest head loss is in case 4 when the well is connected with the connected fracture network because the propagation speed of the fracture network is rapid the drawdown quickly affects the entire fracture network the drawdown in case 2 is similar to that in case 3 the well is near or intersects with the isolated fracture and the head loss is also large this is because the isolated fracture is not connected with the fracture network and its propagation speed is affected by the low hydraulic conductivity in matrix figs 11 and 12 intuitively demonstrate the evolution of head contours over time in different cases of fracture configurations the drawdown increases with time and the flow characteristic on wellbore is determined by the pattern of the head contour in the conventional warren root model and traditional concept warren and root 1963 moench 1984 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 the shape of the dip valley is mainly affected by two factors the storage coefficient and the inter porosity coefficient however this study illustrates that the number of dip valleys on the curve of drawdown derivative is closely related to the fracture density fracture length fracture conductivity fracture distribution and position of the well 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel semi analytical model to study the drawdown transient behaviour in a fractured aquifer with multiple intersecting or isolated natural fractures aquifer and natural fracture models were both established the coupling model and linear equations were obtained through the coupling conditions of fracture wall in laplace space the final drawdown solution was proposed using the stehfest numerical inversion the following conclusions were derived 1 the presented drawdown solution was compared with a previous solution for a pumping well intersected by a natural fracture with double wings and the comparative results were in accordance 2 the case for a pumping well with an isolated fracture showed the important effects of fracture conductivity fracture length distance between the well and fracture and location of the fracture during dimensionless drawdown 3 the case for a pumping well with four isolated fractures showed that the drawdown derivative was obviously affected by the fracture number additional dip valleys will occur with an increasing fracture number and the head loss increased gradually with the increasing natural fractures 4 the effect of well location on drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with parallel and non intersected fracture networks was analysed the result indicated that because the studied well was long close to the fracture and placed at the centre of the isolated fracture network the natural fracture had the longest influence time so the dip valley opening was large three dip valleys were observed which was the result of the interaction of natural fractures with different lengths 5 the effect of well location on the drawdown behaviour in fractured aquifers with random azimuth angles and non intersected fracture networks was evaluated the head loss of the pumping well near the long fracture was the smallest moreover the calculation results showed that when the pumping well was intersected by the connected fracture network the head loss was the smallest during the pumping test process the well should be drilled into the connected fracture network as much as possible credit authorship contribution statement lei wang conceptualization writing original draft hong zhou data curation validation junlei

4908,in the last three decades the low income and highly populated kosi river s alluvial plain have improved its agricultural production by adapting a million groundwater pumping systems as the farmers have less land holding for agriculture activities site specific water and nutrient management are adopted for agriculture production the study represents the impact of intensified agricultural activities aided by additional groundwater pumping system over the groundwater recharge pumping rate we analysed groundwater utilization variation due to farmers empowerment through the green revolution and adaption of a million groundwater pumping system via satellite based actual evapotranspiration aet throughout the year groundwater accessibility has reduced the study area s agricultural dependency on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities all season in this study hydrological modelling with spatial input data from different sources estimated monthly groundwater recharge pumping and its variation during wet dry years the observed groundwater recharge extraction was compared with the corresponding rainfall patterns and validated using measured seasonal groundwater depths we present the relative change in groundwater recharge or extraction statistics using a set of standardized seasonal indices improved socio economic condition and the risk of recurring floods droughts has increased the dependency on groundwater aided irrigation in the region since the farmers have to pay for pumping fuel they opt for more efficient groundwater aided agricultural activities especially in dry years this additional dependency on groundwater has significantly increased the annual groundwater extraction rate and reduced the area s net recharge keywords groundwater recharge indian basins water budgeting anthropogenic effect actual evapotranspiration hydrological modelling 1 introduction the unrestrained groundwater utilization for socio economic improvement often results in severe groundwater crises in quantity and quality the problem is much more severe in india due to the dense population and agriculture based economy the worldwide crisis for freshwater calls for an effective and sustainable water resource management plan al bassam and al rumikhani 2003 net depletion in the water table due to groundwater extraction depends primarily on the groundwater recharge therefore quantitative assessment of monthly groundwater recharge and extraction is a prerequisite for developing an efficient and sustainable groundwater resource management system kumar and seethapathi 2002 yagbasan 2016 multiple factors control the groundwater recharge such as rainfall quantity and its duration soil property agriculture field geometry soil moisture temperature and depth of water table apart from the meteorological factors human intervention especially in terms of pumping for irrigation purposes peña arancibia et al 2020 yue et al 2020 alteration in landuse landcover pattern han et al 2017 and climate change yue et al 2020 also significantly alter the groundwater recharge in a river basin such interventions may result in complex spatial and temporal variations in the groundwater recharge pattern therefore recharge estimated based only on climatic factors and neglecting the anthropogenic influences can lead to inaccurate outcomes especially in the present times moeck et al 2020 the alluvial plain parts of the kosi river basin in the state of bihar india is the study area due to its significant dependence on agricultural activity 90 of the area covered with agricultural lands the area witnesses extensive groundwater extraction as almost 80 of the irrigation depends on the groundwater sinha et al 2018 the state of bihar has undergone a significant transformation in terms of agricultural production and socio economic conditions over the past few decades the measures taken as a part of the green revolution has increased the percentage of irrigated area in bihar from 28 8 1970 71 to 43 5 1988 90 within two decades wilson 2002 the number of pumps used to extract groundwater in the state has increased drastically from 0 37 million to 1 56 million between 1976 and 1977 and 1997 1998 kumar et al 2017a 2017b these measures have resulted in a significant increase in the production 57 6 and productivity of rice kg ha 55 between 1986 and 2001 singh et al 2004 however this agricultural revolution has its due effect in terms of the depletion of groundwater resources uncontrolled groundwater utilization to meet the irrigation demands has resulted in significant depletion of the region s water table pophare et al 2014 the depletion of the groundwater level has inevitably affected the water quality of the region different districts of the region have reordered an alarming rise in the arsenic concentration mainly due to groundwater overexploitation ghosh et al 2007 the groundwater resources dire state calls for an urgent in depth analysis of the groundwater statistics in the region to develop a sustainable groundwater utilization and development plan since india is an agriculture dependent economy and there is an increasing reliance on groundwater to meet the irrigation demand countrywide similar sustainable water management plans will soon be an urgent necessity accessibility of groundwater for irrigation has instigated a significant increase in agricultural productivity in the area this enhanced agricultural production has significantly improved the socio economic condition of the farmers however the cost of this uncontrolled groundwater exploitation for irrigational activities in the area s net groundwater storage is yet to be studied the present study makes an effort to understand the change in farming practices corresponding to the region s dry and wet years due to more accessible groundwater for irrigation we investigated the effect of such altered and improved farming patterns over groundwater storage in terms of monthly and seasonal groundwater recharge or extraction 2 study area kosi river one of the ganga s major tributaries originates from the foothills of himalayas and joins the ganga at kursela in katihar district bihar india kumar pradhan et al 2018 fig 1 it is situated between 85 19 to 88 56 east and 25 18 to 29 8

indicates no significant change in the lulc pattern in the study area from 1985 to 2005 therefore the present study omits the effect of lulc changes on the groundwater recharge estimation 2 2 annual

under the jurisdiction of the state of bihar india due to the non availability of basin scale socio economic data the state level data is used for the analysis assuming that the trends are similar during the period under consideration the study area has witnessed a significant increase in agricultural production as well as socio economic conditions a comparative analysis of the state s

agricultural production million shallow tubewell program mstp was implemented in 2004 kishore et al 2019 this program allowed the farmers easy access to the groundwater for irrigation as a result the net irrigated area in the state had a significant rise the availability of groundwater for agriculture has resulted in substantial growth in its agricultural products and economic conditions the increasing trend of groundwater utilization observed fig 3 has a significant effect on the et value of the land and the subsequent sections discuss them 3 methodology a soil water budgeting swb model was employed in the study to estimate the monthly scale groundwater recharge pumping for the basin the groundwater recharge pumping observed from the model was compared with the seasonal groundwater depths obtained from the central groundwater board cgwb govt of india the soil water budgeting swb is a lumped model approach where the entire watershed or sub basin is a single unit and the status of soil water with time is tracked dhungel and fiedler 2016 in basins where anthropogenic influences over the groundwater recharge are immensely significant and highly unpredictable basic methods such as swb can be very useful the swb method has been widely recognized and used for estimation of groundwater recharge at daily monthly seasonal and annual scale chung et al 2016 dripps and bradbury 2007 eilers et al 2007 finch 1998 kendy et al 2003 the monthly recharge or groundwater extraction at the sub basin scale can be estimated using the following equation 1 r e p et q δ s where re et p q and δs are the recharge or extraction cm precipitation cm actual evapotranspiration cm runoff cm and change in soil moisture storage at a monthly scale cm the accuracy of the estimated recharge using this method depends on its components accuracy and spatio temporal resolutions the estimation of et data is of particular interest in the case of basins with intense anthropogenic activities the region s agricultural pattern is extremely heterogeneous since most farmers have minimal land holdings kishore et al 2014 therefore the agricultural and irrigational activities are site specific and challenging to account for in a hydrological budgeting exercise as a result the quantification of groundwater utilization in irrigational activities at the field level is a difficult task in such a situation satellite based aet data can be useful to account for the impact of groundwater extraction for agricultural activities rushton and ward 1979 van tonder and kirchner 1990 the brief methodology followed in the paper can be presented as follows fig a1 a the study utilized necessary meteorological geospatial and hydrological data from different agencies meteorological data include rainfall temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity the geospatial data include soil types topography and landuse landcover pattern the datasets utilized in the present study alongside the agencies concerned are presented table 3 b the obtained rainfall data were analyzed to identify the dry and wet years the aet data were analyzed to understand the spatio temporal variation in groundwater utilization during the study period the observed variation in et was validated using the rainfall characteristics and the socio economic data obtained from the study area c the study employed basin scale runoff simulated in swat due to the unavailability of measured discharge data at the sub basin scales the swat model was calibrated and validated using the central water commission s cwc s observed daily discharge data at several discrete locations the r2 nse and rmse cumecs values were obtained as 0 85 0 83 and 960 respectively for the data obtained between 1980 and 1990 and 0 84 0 81 and 925 for the data between 1991 and 2000 fig a2 satish 2020 d groundwater recharge extraction obtained from the swb model was compared with the seasonal groundwater table data obtained from central ground water board cgwb e finally the impact of intensified agricultural activities using enhanced groundwater utilization on the net groundwater recharge pumping pattern was studied the net groundwater recharge pumping data was further utilized to analyze the farmers irrigational response s alteration in the dry and wet years 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of groundwater utilization using satellite based aet data the net utilized groundwater in a river basin can indicate the actual rate of evapotranspiration aet since a part of the extracted groundwater converts to runoff or may even infiltrate back to the groundwater accurate assessment of aet can improve groundwater recharge estimations anderson et al 2015 2012 glenn et al 2013 gokmen et al 2013 senay et al 2011 in large basins like the present study area the farming practices are vastly heterogeneous and site specific a field based measurement of spatio temporal variation in groundwater utilization is therefore challenging in such cases spatio temporal variations in the groundwater utilization can be estimated using remotely sensed evapotranspiration data in this study the noaa 1982 1999 and modis 2000 2011 satellite products provided the aet data for groundwater utilization using the energy balance approach aet was derived from land surface products like leaf area index lai vegetation index vi albedo land surface temperature lst and emissivity these derived aet products of noaa and modis were calibrated and validated with in situ measurements for the indian sub continent goroshi et al 2017 mallick et al 2009 due to the unavailability of reliable in situ measurements the modis and noaa data were utilized in the study area for several purposes including seasonal and annual flood modeling amarnath et al 2012 sharma et al 2019 rainfall runoff modeling futter et al 2015 simultaneously these dataset s reliability and applicability have also been addressed guleria et al 2011 nishat and shams 2013 the present section discusses the spatio temporal variations of monthly aet in the study area using the data obtained for 1982 83 1998 99 and 2010 2011 from the observed spatio temporal variation of aet data between 1982 march and 1983 february fig 4 a high aet value in march indicates the peak growth stage of rabi winter crops in the region the following two months april and may are traditionally harvesting months for rabi crops which explains aet values decline based on the availability of a water irrigation system zaid summer crops cultivation practices can also be observed in some parts the sowing period of these crops is generally during march april and the peak growth is achieved during june july kumar et al 2002 the high aet values observed in parts of the region from april to july can be attributed to the zaid crops irrigation demands the most crucial phase of the crop cycle in the region is generally initiated with the sowing of kharif monsoon crop during june and harvesting during october november biradar and xiao 2011 sehgal et al 2013 however the sowing time can vary depending on the arrival of monsoonal rainfall and the farmer s socio economic condition the rise in observed aet values over the entire region from june explains the increase in water demands in the region for the cultivation of kharif crops the water demands in terms of aet over the entire region reach its maximum value during october the kharif crop s peak growth stage after the kharif crop harvest in october november the basin grows several winter crops like wheat maize vegetables and pulses with low water demands however the entirety of this water demand is generally met by using groundwater irrigation systems the low aet values from november to january indicates the lower water demands for these winter crops the increase in aet values from january can be attributed to the extensive cultivation of crops like wheat and maize the variation in observed aet between 1998 march and 1999 february is presented fig 5 the higher values of aet observed in april and may are due to the rabi crop s winter crop s peak growth the higher mean values of aet for the 1982 1983 season points toward the intensification in the cultivation of rabi crops november december to march april prasad et al 2007 sehgal et al 2013 furthermore high aet values were observed in the same parts of the region same as 1982 1983 season during june and july months which can be due to the zaid crop s peak growth stage aet s average values reduce during the kharif period august october months compared to that of the 1982 1983 season the lesser value of aet during the kharif crop period points towards the farmers reluctance towards investing in kharif paddy due to the possibility of floods as a substitute the farmers are inclining towards much secure agricultural investments in winter rabi crops or summer zaid crops using the easily accessible groundwater irrigation systems a similar observation has been reported in kishore et al 2014 the rabi crop cycle of the region during the 1998 1999 season was initiated during november december and the crops were harvested during april may the monthly et variation observed for 2010 2011 fig 6 is also presented in this section to understand the regions agricultural behavior after implementing the million tubewell scheme in 2004 this scheme allowed the farmers to access groundwater throughout the year which significantly impacted the crop cycle and agricultural pattern the availability of groundwater for irrigation has reduced the agricultural dependency on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities throughout the year the high standard deviation observed in the monthly aet data suggests an increasingly site specific mixed agricultural practice in the region especially from march to october different regions in the study area simultaneously cultivated of all three types of crops therefore identifying a fixed crop cycle is extremely difficult since the farmers have adopted a much more flexible and site specific agricultural activity based on their convenience a comparative analysis of the aet patterns observed for the three water years 1982 1983 1998 1999 and 2010 2011 points towards crucial alteration in the study area s agricultural practice the traditional fixed crop calendar based seasonal agricultural practice of 1982 1983 has gradually evolved into a much more flexible mixed agricultural activity the agricultural activities observed for the 2010 2011 season is much more diverse and extremely heterogeneous this heterogeneity is due to the availability of accessible groundwater throughout the year for irrigational activities it has allowed the farmers to choose the cropping time as per their convenience instead of natural factors 4 2 estimation of groundwater recharge pumping estimated monthly scale net groundwater recharge pumping values corresponding to the specific wet and dry years are presented fig 7 along with the other hydrological components fig 7 a and b shows the variation of hydrological components in sub basin 11 during wet and dry years the cumulative et values represent a linearly increasing and relatively smooth trend compared to the rainfall values et s obtained value for both wet and dry years was near similar despite a noticeable difference in rainfall availability a significant difference between the cumulative rainfall and cumulative et resulted in a high rate of groundwater extraction observed in the data up to june or july in the case of both dry and wet years the groundwater recharge in the cases of s 11 wet year fig 7a and s 11 dry year fig 7b begins after june and july respectively and the cumulative groundwater recharge depends on the cumulative rainfall value total rainfall and et at s 11 were 150 cm and 70 cm respectively for the extremely wet year whereas 80 cm and 80 cm for the dry year while the total recharges for the wet and dry years were 60 cm and 10 cm respectively similar analyses are done for the wet year 1998 and dry year 2005 in the sub basin s 14 and wet year 2000 and dry year 2005 for s 16 and the corresponding results plotted fig 7c f in both the sub basins the total annual et shows no significant variation the relative difference in the rainfall availability during the dry year resulted in increased groundwater extraction to meet the irrigation demands fig 7 c f shows the recharge changes due to the non availability of sufficient rainfall during different seasons throughout the year the plots fig 7c f also reveal the reduction of cumulative rainfall during dry years in the middle s 14 and lower basins s 16 as compared to the upper basin s 11 that has resulted in a significant decrease in the groundwater recharge 4 3 comparison of recharge estimated using the swb method with the field measurement the swb estimated values of monsoon groundwater recharge 1996 2010 in the study were compared with the region s rainfall pattern and the recharge data calculated using field observations from cgwb fig 8 the recharge pattern obtained from the swb approach correctly imitated the rainfall trend of the region the fluctuations in groundwater recharge measured using the swb approach corresponding to dry and wet years are apparent fig 8 however no such trends are visible from the groundwater recharge data calculated using the observed field data from cgwb the number of total observation wells in the area 19129 sq km is 165 among which only 27 well stations have recorded data for the study period 1996 2010 furthermore the distributions of these observation wells are uneven over the basin the smaller number of observation wells and their uneven distribution add to the uncertainties in groundwater recharge s estimated values percentage deviations between the estimated recharge in the present study and the recharge calculated using the groundwater data from cgwb fig 8 are presented fig 9 the comparison suggests that 32 of the data are within the 20 deviation range whereas 56 in the range of 40 deviation and 80 in the 60 deviation range given the substantial uncertainties associated with groundwater recharge estimations both in the present study and by cgwb higher deviations are possible furthermore the observed deviations are much higher in the case of extremely dry and wet years fig 8 revealed that the groundwater recharge data estimated using water table measurements from cgwb does not represent the natural fluctuations corresponding to dry and wet years for example according to the spi indices 2007 and 2009 represent the extremely wet year and extremely dry year for sub basin 11 fig 8 a the monsoon recharge patterns further suggested the total annual rainfall difference between the two years however the monsoon recharge estimated using the groundwater data from cgwb represent only a 23 higher value corresponding to an extremely wet year than that of the extremely dry year similar observations can be made for extremely dry and wet years presented in s 14 and s 16 fig 8 b and c 4 4 impact of anthropogenic influence over net groundwater recharge pumping the farmer s response to dry wet years in terms of groundwater recharge or extraction 1996 to 2010 for different sub basins can be observed fig 10 the figure describes the fluctuations in relative groundwater extractions to their seasonal average values corresponding to pre monsoon march may monsoon june september monsoon surplus october and winter november february standardized pre monsoon pumping index spmpi standardized monsoon recharge index smri standardized monsoon surplus pumping index smspi and standardized winter pumping index swpi indicates the relative groundwater extraction during pre monsoon march may monsoon june september monsoon surplus october and winter november february seasons table 4 presents the mean values and the standard deviations of these indices the groundwater recharge in the region occurred during the monsoon june september season table 4 therefore the standardized monsoon recharge indices smri represent the relative groundwater recharge values during the period the authors would like to clarify that the indices have only been used as a tool to better represent groundwater recharge extraction over fifteen years in relative terms for the study area and do not have any further statistical significance the formula used for calculating these indices is similar to the spi index formula proposed by mckee et al 1995 these indices positive or negative values indicate an increase or decrease in recharge or extraction compared to mean annual recharge extraction the socio economic statistics presented in fig 3 indicates a sharp rise in the agricultural productivity and groundwater utilization pattern of the area for irrigational activities from the year 2004 in 2004 the bihar government implemented the million shallow tube well program to improve groundwater accessibility for agricultural activities the farmers response to dry and wet years before and after implementing the mstp 2004 revealed an improved socio economic situation 4 4 1 period before the implementation of million shallow tube well program the spi index trend analysis at the annual scale from 1996 to 2004 suggests that the entire basin including all the sub basins under discussion has received adequate rainfall during this period the period witnessed only very few significant dry years however enhanced groundwater dependency for irrigational activities especially after 1998 is evident from the extraction indices positive values the negative values of swpi and spmpi for all three sub basins and the entire study area till 1998 suggests that the groundwater extraction during winter and pre monsoon period is well below their average values the observation suggests a lack of intent from the farmers towards utilizing groundwater for irrigation during the pre monsoon or winter season especially during dry periods however the positive peaks of smri in sub basins 14 and 16 during these years suggests higher groundwater recharge during this period the pumping indices of s 11 during dry years indicate higher pumping during the october month of 1997 mildly dry year however the pumping for the pre monsoon and winter period is less than the average value the observation suggests that the farmers are more inclined towards providing supplementary irrigation to the kharif crops than investing in the rabi or zaid cultivation the observed pumping trend of s 11 for 2000 a dry year indicates positive values for pre monsoon winter and october pumping indices the higher values of pre monsoon and winter trends indicate a shift in the farmers intent to cultivate rabi and zaid crops compared to previous dry years similarly 2002 was a dry year for s 16 as the groundwater recharge index in this period yielded a negative value this negative index is perfectly explainable since the annual rainfall depth is less than the normal one a similar conclusion can be made from the obtained pumping indices for 2002 s 16 which indicate higher groundwater extraction during winter than pre monsoon or october overall during this period it can be concluded that the farmers had mostly utilized the groundwater irrigation as a supplementary system when there is deficit rainfall and change in monthly rainfall distribution the farmers delicate socio economic status and input cost in terms of fuel price to avail the pumping systems can be the reason for such behavior 4 4 2 period after the implementation of million shallow tube well programme the million shallow tube well programme was implemented after 2004 to enhance the irrigational activities in the area in the same period the study area has witnessed a significant reduction in the annual rainfall quantity the only wet year for the study area was observed in 2007 positive values of monsoonal recharge indices can be observed for the wet year indicating higher groundwater recharge on the other hand the extremely dry year corresponding to s 11 is 2009 and for s 14 s 16 and the rest of the basin was 2005 however a complete alteration can be observed in the farmer s irrigational response to the dry years the groundwater extraction recorded in 2009 during the winter and pre monsoon period of s 11 had increased significantly however the response of study areas under discussion s 14 s 16 and the entire study area on groundwater extraction during the extremely dry year 2005 was not adequate statistics presented in fig 3 may provide a suitable explanation for this observation the net area irrigated in the state using groundwater is minimum during 2004 2005 the delicate economic condition and restricted access to groundwater for irrigation during 2005 have also severely impacted the agricultural production and productivity of the state fig 3 the economic condition of the state and the net area irrigated using groundwater has gradually improved from 2006 to 2007 the improved access to groundwater provided by mstp and enhanced economy can be the reason behind the alteration in farmers responses to the dry years after 2007 since the farmers have the economic strength to pay the fuel for pumping due to improved socio economic conditions they opted for more efficient groundwater aided agricultural activities especially in dry years the lack of rainfall and the additional dependency on groundwater for irrigation has significantly increased the annual rate of groundwater extraction and reduced the net recharge of the area therefore a balance between socio economic upliftment and water resources has to be maintained to protect the groundwater resources from being overly exploited which can have catastrophic consequences in terms of economy and human health 5 conclusion anthropogenic effects over the groundwater recharge in a basin with high agricultural activities were investigated in the presented study the alluvial part of the kosi river basin was the study area due to its substantial agricultural activities and intensified groundwater utilization trend the area has seen a significant enhancement in the groundwater utilization for agricultural activities after implementing the green revolution programme in 1970 and million shallow tube well programme in 2004 considering the difficulties associated with the measurement of groundwater utilization for irrigational activities especially in indian sub continent satellite based aet datasets have been used a soil water budgeting swb method aided with satellite based aet data was used to estimate monthly groundwater recharge at the sub basin scale the evaluation of monthly variation in observed aet for 1982 1983 1998 1999 and 2009 2010 suggests an alteration in the region s agricultural behavior relatively easy access to groundwater for irrigation has reduced the dependency of the agricultural activities on monsoonal rainfall to some extent as a precautionary measure to the frequent floods the farmers opt to invest in much more secure agricultural practice during the pre monsoon or post monsoon seasons the significant increase in the productivity of winter crops in the region also supports the observation the observation also suggests that the season specific farming practices are being gradually diluted with the arrival of hybrid seeds fertilizers and most notably the accessibility of groundwater throughout the year accessibility of groundwater has reduced the agricultural dependency of the study area on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities throughout the year finally the study highlights large scale agricultural activities over the groundwater recharge pattern in the basin there is a noticeable difference in terms of irrigation response to drought years after 2005 the groundwater extraction to meet crop irrigation demand during dry years has significantly enhanced which resulted in substantial economic growth however enhanced dependency on groundwater for agriculture in dry years and wet years can have an alarming effect on the quantity and quality therefore the concerned authorities and stakeholders should immediately make an effort to manage the water resource of this basin for long term sustainable development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4908,in the last three decades the low income and highly populated kosi river s alluvial plain have improved its agricultural production by adapting a million groundwater pumping systems as the farmers have less land holding for agriculture activities site specific water and nutrient management are adopted for agriculture production the study represents the impact of intensified agricultural activities aided by additional groundwater pumping system over the groundwater recharge pumping rate we analysed groundwater utilization variation due to farmers empowerment through the green revolution and adaption of a million groundwater pumping system via satellite based actual evapotranspiration aet throughout the year groundwater accessibility has reduced the study area s agricultural dependency on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities all season in this study hydrological modelling with spatial input data from different sources estimated monthly groundwater recharge pumping and its variation during wet dry years the observed groundwater recharge extraction was compared with the corresponding rainfall patterns and validated using measured seasonal groundwater depths we present the relative change in groundwater recharge or extraction statistics using a set of standardized seasonal indices improved socio economic condition and the risk of recurring floods droughts has increased the dependency on groundwater aided irrigation in the region since the farmers have to pay for pumping fuel they opt for more efficient groundwater aided agricultural activities especially in dry years this additional dependency on groundwater has significantly increased the annual groundwater extraction rate and reduced the area s net recharge keywords groundwater recharge indian basins water budgeting anthropogenic effect actual evapotranspiration hydrological modelling 1 introduction the unrestrained groundwater utilization for socio economic improvement often results in severe groundwater crises in quantity and quality the problem is much more severe in india due to the dense population and agriculture based economy the worldwide crisis for freshwater calls for an effective and sustainable water resource management plan al bassam and al rumikhani 2003 net depletion in the water table due to groundwater extraction depends primarily on the groundwater recharge therefore quantitative assessment of monthly groundwater recharge and extraction is a prerequisite for developing an efficient and sustainable groundwater resource management system kumar and seethapathi 2002 yagbasan 2016 multiple factors control the groundwater recharge such as rainfall quantity and its duration soil property agriculture field geometry soil moisture temperature and depth of water table apart from the meteorological factors human intervention especially in terms of pumping for irrigation purposes peña arancibia et al 2020 yue et al 2020 alteration in landuse landcover pattern han et al 2017 and climate change yue et al 2020 also significantly alter the groundwater recharge in a river basin such interventions may result in complex spatial and temporal variations in the groundwater recharge pattern therefore recharge estimated based only on climatic factors and neglecting the anthropogenic influences can lead to inaccurate outcomes especially in the present times moeck et al 2020 the alluvial plain parts of the kosi river basin in the state of bihar india is the study area due to its significant dependence on agricultural activity 90 of the area covered with agricultural lands the area witnesses extensive groundwater extraction as almost 80 of the irrigation depends on the groundwater sinha et al 2018 the state of bihar has undergone a significant transformation in terms of agricultural production and socio economic conditions over the past few decades the measures taken as a part of the green revolution has increased the percentage of irrigated area in bihar from 28 8 1970 71 to 43 5 1988 90 within two decades wilson 2002 the number of pumps used to extract groundwater in the state has increased drastically from 0 37 million to 1 56 million between 1976 and 1977 and 1997 1998 kumar et al 2017a 2017b these measures have resulted in a significant increase in the production 57 6 and productivity of rice kg ha 55 between 1986 and 2001 singh et al 2004 however this agricultural revolution has its due effect in terms of the depletion of groundwater resources uncontrolled groundwater utilization to meet the irrigation demands has resulted in significant depletion of the region s water table pophare et al 2014 the depletion of the groundwater level has inevitably affected the water quality of the region different districts of the region have reordered an alarming rise in the arsenic concentration mainly due to groundwater overexploitation ghosh et al 2007 the groundwater resources dire state calls for an urgent in depth analysis of the groundwater statistics in the region to develop a sustainable groundwater utilization and development plan since india is an agriculture dependent economy and there is an increasing reliance on groundwater to meet the irrigation demand countrywide similar sustainable water management plans will soon be an urgent necessity accessibility of groundwater for irrigation has instigated a significant increase in agricultural productivity in the area this enhanced agricultural production has significantly improved the socio economic condition of the farmers however the cost of this uncontrolled groundwater exploitation for irrigational activities in the area s net groundwater storage is yet to be studied the present study makes an effort to understand the change in farming practices corresponding to the region s dry and wet years due to more accessible groundwater for irrigation we investigated the effect of such altered and improved farming patterns over groundwater storage in terms of monthly and seasonal groundwater recharge or extraction 2 study area kosi river one of the ganga s major tributaries originates from the foothills of himalayas and joins the ganga at kursela in katihar district bihar india kumar pradhan et al 2018 fig 1 it is situated between 85 19 to 88 56 east and 25 18 to 29 8 north and has a total catchment area of 86 000 km2 which includes parts of nepal 45 tibet 32 and india 23 rajbhandari et al 2017 in india the channel length is 730 km and the catchment area covers various districts of bihar state supaul saharsa araria khagaria bhagalpur madhepura and purnia rai et al 2018 sinha and friend 1994 the basin falls under the sub tropical belt and therefore experiences a humid climate towards the southern part of the basin and cold and arid climate on the mountainous region in the north shrestha et al 2017 the average annual rainfall over the basin is 1000 mm more than 80 of which occurs during the monsoon season rajbhandari et al 2017 shrestha 2000 the basin experiences a wide range of spatial temperature variations generally decreasing towards the northern part of the basin himalayan region in general the june month recorded the highest temperature approx 27 c and 32 c for the mountain regions and hilly regions respectively and december january the lowest 0 c and 5 c for the mountains and hilly regions agarwal et al 2016 the plain part of the kosi basin considered for the study is covered with agricultural lands 90 predominantly used for paddy cultivation during june siddiq 2006 despite reasonably high annual rainfall 1000 mm per year more than 80 of the plain regions irrigation demand is met by groundwater resources sinha et al 2018 the basin was divided into several sub basins by topographic data analysis for analyzing the results at sub basin scales the seven sub basins obtained are marked with arabic numerical 11 to 17 in fig 1 b hydrological characteristics of three representative sub basins s 11 s 14 and s 16 have been discussed thoroughly in this manuscript 2 1 decadal change of land use landcover lulc change was analyzed using decadal landuse landcover maps for 1985 1995 and 2005 relative change in the landuse landcover data in the study area from 1985 to 2005 is presented table 1 the lulc data analysis indicates no significant change in the lulc pattern in the study area from 1985 to 2005 therefore the present study omits the effect of lulc changes on the groundwater recharge estimation 2 2 annual rainfall trend the precipitation dataset is one of the most influential datasets in estimating the basin s groundwater recharge and extraction the study utilizes the aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation precipitation data which is an interpolated product of thousands of surface rainfall stations from asia pacific countries and additional wmo world meteorological organization global telecommunication systems xie et al 2007 yatagai et al 2012 it provides gridded rainfall data at a 0 25 spatial resolution which is better than cfsr s climate forecast system reanalysis 0 38 resolution the aphrodite dataset on precipitation is widely used as baseline rainfall series in the asia pacific region for hydrological modelling jain

based on spi values mckee et al 1995 categorized rainfall into eight different classes ranging from extremely wet to dry as shown in table 2 aladaileh et al 2019 to identify the wet and dry year variability across the sub basin 12 monthly spi was calculated for sub basins in the upper region s 11 middle region s 14 and lower region s 16 fig 2 the present study estimated the groundwater recharge at the sub basin scale for the period 1996 2010 during this estimation period the wettest and driest years for the sub basin s 11 were 2007 and 2009 spi value 2 17 and 1 74 fig 2 a similarly the wettest and driest years for s 14 were 1998 and 2005 spi value 1 05 and 2 17 fig 2 b and for s 16 were 2000 and 2005 spi value 1 17 and 2 17 fig 2 c for the whole basin the wettest and driest years were 1999 and 2005 spi value 1 74 and 1 74 fig 2 d 2 3 agricultural production and socio economic status the study area under consideration i e the alluvial plains of the kosi basin mostly falls under the jurisdiction of the state of bihar india due to the non availability of basin scale socio economic data the state level data is used for the analysis assuming that the trends are similar during the period under consideration the study area has witnessed a significant increase in agricultural production as well as socio economic conditions a comparative analysis of the state s agricultural and socio economic conditions over the years can help understand the variation in aet and link them with irrigation practices fig 3 represents agricultural irrigational and economic statistics of the state of bihar kumar et al 2018 the figure also links the agricultural statistics with variation in the net irrigated area using groundwater mowr 2014 2005 2000 1993 and percentage

agricultural production since implementing the green revolution 1969 1970 however from 1984 both agricultural and economic performance in bihar experienced a steady decline till 2000 2001 to improve agricultural production million shallow tubewell program mstp was implemented in 2004 kishore et al 2019 this program allowed the farmers easy access to the groundwater for irrigation as a result the net irrigated area in the state had a significant rise the availability of groundwater for agriculture has resulted in substantial growth in its agricultural products and economic conditions the increasing trend of groundwater utilization observed fig 3 has a significant effect on the et value of the land and the subsequent sections discuss them 3 methodology a soil water budgeting swb model was employed in the study to estimate the monthly scale groundwater recharge pumping for the basin the groundwater recharge pumping observed from the model was compared with the seasonal groundwater depths obtained from the central groundwater board cgwb govt of india the soil water budgeting swb is a lumped model approach where the entire watershed or sub basin is a single unit and the status of soil water with time is tracked dhungel and fiedler 2016 in basins where anthropogenic influences over the groundwater recharge are immensely significant and highly unpredictable basic methods such as swb can be very useful the swb method has been widely recognized and used for estimation of groundwater recharge at daily monthly seasonal and annual scale chung et al 2016 dripps and bradbury 2007 eilers et al 2007 finch 1998 kendy et al 2003 the monthly recharge or groundwater extraction at the sub basin scale can be estimated using the following equation 1 r e p et q δ s where re et p q and δs are the recharge or extraction cm precipitation cm actual evapotranspiration cm runoff cm and change in soil moisture storage at a monthly scale cm the accuracy of the estimated recharge using this method depends on its components accuracy and spatio temporal resolutions the estimation of et data is of particular interest in the case of basins with intense anthropogenic activities the region s agricultural pattern is extremely heterogeneous since most farmers have minimal land holdings kishore et al 2014 therefore the agricultural and irrigational activities are site specific and challenging to account for in a hydrological budgeting exercise as a result the quantification of groundwater utilization in irrigational activities at the field level is a difficult task in such a situation satellite based aet data can be useful to account for the impact of groundwater extraction for agricultural activities rushton and ward 1979 van tonder and kirchner 1990 the brief methodology followed in the paper can be presented as follows fig a1 a the study utilized necessary meteorological geospatial and hydrological data from different agencies meteorological data include rainfall temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity the geospatial data include soil types topography and landuse landcover pattern the datasets utilized in the present study alongside the agencies concerned are presented table 3 b the obtained rainfall data were analyzed to identify the dry and wet years the aet data were analyzed to understand the spatio temporal variation in groundwater utilization during the study period the observed variation in et was validated using the rainfall characteristics and the socio economic data obtained from the study area c the study employed basin scale runoff simulated in swat due to the unavailability of measured discharge data at the sub basin scales the swat model was calibrated and validated using the central water commission s cwc s observed daily discharge data at several discrete locations the r2 nse and rmse cumecs values were obtained as 0 85 0 83 and 960 respectively for the data obtained between 1980 and 1990 and 0 84 0 81 and 925 for the data between 1991 and 2000 fig a2 satish 2020 d groundwater recharge extraction obtained from the swb model was compared with the seasonal groundwater table data obtained from central ground water board cgwb e finally the impact of intensified agricultural activities using enhanced groundwater utilization on the net groundwater recharge pumping pattern was studied the net groundwater recharge pumping data was further utilized to analyze the farmers irrigational response s alteration in the dry and wet years 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of groundwater utilization using satellite based aet data the net utilized groundwater in a river basin can indicate the actual rate of evapotranspiration aet since a part of the extracted groundwater converts to runoff or may even infiltrate back to the groundwater accurate assessment of aet can improve groundwater recharge estimations anderson et al 2015 2012 glenn et al 2013 gokmen et al 2013 senay et al 2011 in large basins like the present study area the farming practices are vastly heterogeneous and site specific a field based measurement of spatio temporal variation in groundwater utilization is therefore challenging in such cases spatio temporal variations in the groundwater utilization can be estimated using remotely sensed evapotranspiration data in this study the noaa 1982 1999 and modis 2000 2011 satellite products provided the aet data for groundwater utilization using the energy balance approach aet was derived from land surface products like leaf area index lai vegetation index vi albedo land surface temperature lst and emissivity these derived aet products of noaa and modis were calibrated and validated with in situ measurements for the indian sub continent goroshi et al 2017 mallick et al 2009 due to the unavailability of reliable in situ measurements the modis and noaa data were utilized in the study area for several purposes including seasonal and annual flood modeling amarnath et al 2012 sharma et al 2019 rainfall runoff modeling futter et al 2015 simultaneously these dataset s reliability and applicability have also been addressed guleria et al 2011 nishat and shams 2013 the present section discusses the spatio temporal variations of monthly aet in the study area using the data obtained for 1982 83 1998 99 and 2010 2011 from the observed spatio temporal variation of aet data between 1982 march and 1983 february fig 4 a high aet value in march indicates the peak growth stage of rabi winter crops in the region the following two months april and may are traditionally harvesting months for rabi crops which explains aet values decline based on the availability of a water irrigation system zaid summer crops cultivation practices can also be observed in some parts the sowing period of these crops is generally during march april and the peak growth is achieved during june july kumar et al 2002 the high aet values observed in parts of the region from april to july can be attributed to the zaid crops irrigation demands the most crucial phase of the crop cycle in the region is generally initiated with the sowing of kharif monsoon crop during june and harvesting during october november biradar and xiao 2011 sehgal et al 2013 however the sowing time can vary depending on the arrival of monsoonal rainfall and the farmer s socio economic condition the rise in observed aet values over the entire region from june explains the increase in water demands in the region for the cultivation of kharif crops the water demands in terms of aet over the entire region reach its maximum value during october the kharif crop s peak growth stage after the kharif crop harvest in october november the basin grows several winter crops like wheat maize vegetables and pulses with low water demands however the entirety of this water demand is generally met by using groundwater irrigation systems the low aet values from november to january indicates the lower water demands for these winter crops the increase in aet values from january can be attributed to the extensive cultivation of crops like wheat and maize the variation in observed aet between 1998 march and 1999 february is presented fig 5 the higher values of aet observed in april and may are due to the rabi crop s winter crop s peak growth the higher mean values of aet for the 1982 1983 season points toward the intensification in the cultivation of rabi crops november december to march april prasad et al 2007 sehgal et al 2013 furthermore high aet values were observed in the same parts of the region same as 1982 1983 season during june and july months which can be due to the zaid crop s peak growth stage aet s average values reduce during the kharif period august october months compared to that of the 1982 1983 season the lesser value of aet during the kharif crop period points towards the farmers reluctance towards investing in kharif paddy due to the possibility of floods as a substitute the farmers are inclining towards much secure agricultural investments in winter rabi crops or summer zaid crops using the easily accessible groundwater irrigation systems a similar observation has been reported in kishore et al 2014 the rabi crop cycle of the region during the 1998 1999 season was initiated during november december and the crops were harvested during april may the monthly et variation observed for 2010 2011 fig 6 is also presented in this section to understand the regions agricultural behavior after implementing the million tubewell scheme in 2004 this scheme allowed the farmers to access groundwater throughout the year which significantly impacted the crop cycle and agricultural pattern the availability of groundwater for irrigation has reduced the agricultural dependency on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities throughout the year the high standard deviation observed in the monthly aet data suggests an increasingly site specific mixed agricultural practice in the region especially from march to october different regions in the study area simultaneously cultivated of all three types of crops therefore identifying a fixed crop cycle is extremely difficult since the farmers have adopted a much more flexible and site specific agricultural activity based on their convenience a comparative analysis of the aet patterns observed for the three water years 1982 1983 1998 1999 and 2010 2011 points towards crucial alteration in the study area s agricultural practice the traditional fixed crop calendar based seasonal agricultural practice of 1982 1983 has gradually evolved into a much more flexible mixed agricultural activity the agricultural activities observed for the 2010 2011 season is much more diverse and extremely heterogeneous this heterogeneity is due to the availability of accessible groundwater throughout the year for irrigational activities it has allowed the farmers to choose the cropping time as per their convenience instead of natural factors 4 2 estimation of groundwater recharge pumping estimated monthly scale net groundwater recharge pumping values corresponding to the specific wet and dry years are presented fig 7 along with the other hydrological components fig 7 a and b shows the variation of hydrological components in sub basin 11 during wet and dry years the cumulative et values represent a linearly increasing and relatively smooth trend compared to the rainfall values et s obtained value for both wet and dry years was near similar despite a noticeable difference in rainfall availability a significant difference between the cumulative rainfall and cumulative et resulted in a high rate of groundwater extraction observed in the data up to june or july in the case of both dry and wet years the groundwater recharge in the cases of s 11 wet year fig 7a and s 11 dry year fig 7b begins after june and july respectively and the cumulative groundwater recharge depends on the cumulative rainfall value total rainfall and et at s 11 were 150 cm and 70 cm respectively for the extremely wet year whereas 80 cm and 80 cm for the dry year while the total recharges for the wet and dry years were 60 cm and 10 cm respectively similar analyses are done for the wet year 1998 and dry year 2005 in the sub basin s 14 and wet year 2000 and dry year 2005 for s 16 and the corresponding results plotted fig 7c f in both the sub basins the total annual et shows no significant variation the relative difference in the rainfall availability during the dry year resulted in increased groundwater extraction to meet the irrigation demands fig 7 c f shows the recharge changes due to the non availability of sufficient rainfall during different seasons throughout the year the plots fig 7c f also reveal the reduction of cumulative rainfall during dry years in the middle s 14 and lower basins s 16 as compared to the upper basin s 11 that has resulted in a significant decrease in the groundwater recharge 4 3 comparison of recharge estimated using the swb method with the field measurement the swb estimated values of monsoon groundwater recharge 1996 2010 in the study were compared with the region s rainfall pattern and the recharge data calculated using field observations from cgwb fig 8 the recharge pattern obtained from the swb approach correctly imitated the rainfall trend of the region the fluctuations in groundwater recharge measured using the swb approach corresponding to dry and wet years are apparent fig 8 however no such trends are visible from the groundwater recharge data calculated using the observed field data from cgwb the number of total observation wells in the area 19129 sq km is 165 among which only 27 well stations have recorded data for the study period 1996 2010 furthermore the distributions of these observation wells are uneven over the basin the smaller number of observation wells and their uneven distribution add to the uncertainties in groundwater recharge s estimated values percentage deviations between the estimated recharge in the present study and the recharge calculated using the groundwater data from cgwb fig 8 are presented fig 9 the comparison suggests that 32 of the data are within the 20 deviation range whereas 56 in the range of 40 deviation and 80 in the 60 deviation range given the substantial uncertainties associated with groundwater recharge estimations both in the present study and by cgwb higher deviations are possible furthermore the observed deviations are much higher in the case of extremely dry and wet years fig 8 revealed that the groundwater recharge data estimated using water table measurements from cgwb does not represent the natural fluctuations corresponding to dry and wet years for example according to the spi indices 2007 and 2009 represent the extremely wet year and extremely dry year for sub basin 11 fig 8 a the monsoon recharge patterns further suggested the total annual rainfall difference between the two years however the monsoon recharge estimated using the groundwater data from cgwb represent only a 23 higher value corresponding to an extremely wet year than that of the extremely dry year similar observations can be made for extremely dry and wet years presented in s 14 and s 16 fig 8 b and c 4 4 impact of anthropogenic influence over net groundwater recharge pumping the farmer s response to dry wet years in terms of groundwater recharge or extraction 1996 to 2010 for different sub basins can be observed fig 10 the figure describes the fluctuations in relative groundwater extractions to their seasonal average values corresponding to pre monsoon march may monsoon june september monsoon surplus october and winter november february standardized pre monsoon pumping index spmpi standardized monsoon recharge index smri standardized monsoon surplus pumping index smspi and standardized winter pumping index swpi indicates the relative groundwater extraction during pre monsoon march may monsoon june september monsoon surplus october and winter november february seasons table 4 presents the mean values and the standard deviations of these indices the groundwater recharge in the region occurred during the monsoon june september season table 4 therefore the standardized monsoon recharge indices smri represent the relative groundwater recharge values during the period the authors would like to clarify that the indices have only been used as a tool to better represent groundwater recharge extraction over fifteen years in relative terms for the study area and do not have any further statistical significance the formula used for calculating these indices is similar to the spi index formula proposed by mckee et al 1995 these indices positive or negative values indicate an increase or decrease in recharge or extraction compared to mean annual recharge extraction the socio economic statistics presented in fig 3 indicates a sharp rise in the agricultural productivity and groundwater utilization pattern of the area for irrigational activities from the year 2004 in 2004 the bihar government implemented the million shallow tube well program to improve groundwater accessibility for agricultural activities the farmers response to dry and wet years before and after implementing the mstp 2004 revealed an improved socio economic situation 4 4 1 period before the implementation of million shallow tube well program the spi index trend analysis at the annual scale from 1996 to 2004 suggests that the entire basin including all the sub basins under discussion has received adequate rainfall during this period the period witnessed only very few significant dry years however enhanced groundwater dependency for irrigational activities especially after 1998 is evident from the extraction indices positive values the negative values of swpi and spmpi for all three sub basins and the entire study area till 1998 suggests that the groundwater extraction during winter and pre monsoon period is well below their average values the observation suggests a lack of intent from the farmers towards utilizing groundwater for irrigation during the pre monsoon or winter season especially during dry periods however the positive peaks of smri in sub basins 14 and 16 during these years suggests higher groundwater recharge during this period the pumping indices of s 11 during dry years indicate higher pumping during the october month of 1997 mildly dry year however the pumping for the pre monsoon and winter period is less than the average value the observation suggests that the farmers are more inclined towards providing supplementary irrigation to the kharif crops than investing in the rabi or zaid cultivation the observed pumping trend of s 11 for 2000 a dry year indicates positive values for pre monsoon winter and october pumping indices the higher values of pre monsoon and winter trends indicate a shift in the farmers intent to cultivate rabi and zaid crops compared to previous dry years similarly 2002 was a dry year for s 16 as the groundwater recharge index in this period yielded a negative value this negative index is perfectly explainable since the annual rainfall depth is less than the normal one a similar conclusion can be made from the obtained pumping indices for 2002 s 16 which indicate higher groundwater extraction during winter than pre monsoon or october overall during this period it can be concluded that the farmers had mostly utilized the groundwater irrigation as a supplementary system when there is deficit rainfall and change in monthly rainfall distribution the farmers delicate socio economic status and input cost in terms of fuel price to avail the pumping systems can be the reason for such behavior 4 4 2 period after the implementation of million shallow tube well programme the million shallow tube well programme was implemented after 2004 to enhance the irrigational activities in the area in the same period the study area has witnessed a significant reduction in the annual rainfall quantity the only wet year for the study area was observed in 2007 positive values of monsoonal recharge indices can be observed for the wet year indicating higher groundwater recharge on the other hand the extremely dry year corresponding to s 11 is 2009 and for s 14 s 16 and the rest of the basin was 2005 however a complete alteration can be observed in the farmer s irrigational response to the dry years the groundwater extraction recorded in 2009 during the winter and pre monsoon period of s 11 had increased significantly however the response of study areas under discussion s 14 s 16 and the entire study area on groundwater extraction during the extremely dry year 2005 was not adequate statistics presented in fig 3 may provide a suitable explanation for this observation the net area irrigated in the state using groundwater is minimum during 2004 2005 the delicate economic condition and restricted access to groundwater for irrigation during 2005 have also severely impacted the agricultural production and productivity of the state fig 3 the economic condition of the state and the net area irrigated using groundwater has gradually improved from 2006 to 2007 the improved access to groundwater provided by mstp and enhanced economy can be the reason behind the alteration in farmers responses to the dry years after 2007 since the farmers have the economic strength to pay the fuel for pumping due to improved socio economic conditions they opted for more efficient groundwater aided agricultural activities especially in dry years the lack of rainfall and the additional dependency on groundwater for irrigation has significantly increased the annual rate of groundwater extraction and reduced the net recharge of the area therefore a balance between socio economic upliftment and water resources has to be maintained to protect the groundwater resources from being overly exploited which can have catastrophic consequences in terms of economy and human health 5 conclusion anthropogenic effects over the groundwater recharge in a basin with high agricultural activities were investigated in the presented study the alluvial part of the kosi river basin was the study area due to its substantial agricultural activities and intensified groundwater utilization trend the area has seen a significant enhancement in the groundwater utilization for agricultural activities after implementing the green revolution programme in 1970 and million shallow tube well programme in 2004 considering the difficulties associated with the measurement of groundwater utilization for irrigational activities especially in indian sub continent satellite based aet datasets have been used a soil water budgeting swb method aided with satellite based aet data was used to estimate monthly groundwater recharge at the sub basin scale the evaluation of monthly variation in observed aet for 1982 1983 1998 1999 and 2009 2010 suggests an alteration in the region s agricultural behavior relatively easy access to groundwater for irrigation has reduced the dependency of the agricultural activities on monsoonal rainfall to some extent as a precautionary measure to the frequent floods the farmers opt to invest in much more secure agricultural practice during the pre monsoon or post monsoon seasons the significant increase in the productivity of winter crops in the region also supports the observation the observation also suggests that the season specific farming practices are being gradually diluted with the arrival of hybrid seeds fertilizers and most notably the accessibility of groundwater throughout the year accessibility of groundwater has reduced the agricultural dependency of the study area on monsoonal rainfall and allowed agricultural activities throughout the year finally the study highlights large scale agricultural activities over the groundwater recharge pattern in the basin there is a noticeable difference in terms of irrigation response to drought years after 2005 the groundwater extraction to meet crop irrigation demand during dry years has significantly enhanced which resulted in substantial economic growth however enhanced dependency on groundwater for agriculture in dry years and wet years can have an alarming effect on the quantity and quality therefore the concerned authorities and stakeholders should immediately make an effort to manage the water resource of this basin for long term sustainable development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4909,root water uptake plays an important role in water cycle in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o are effective tools to quantify the use of different water sources by plant roots however the widespread δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources due to δ2h fractionation during root water uptake result in conflicting interpretations of water utilization using stable isotopes in this study a potential water source line pwl i e a linear regression line between δ18o and δ2h data of both soil water at different depths and groundwater was proposed to correct δ2h offsets of stem water the pwl corrected δ2h was determined by subtracting the deviation between δ2h in stem water and pwl from the original value the mixsiar model coupled with seven types of input data i e various combinations of single or dual isotopes with uncorrected or corrected δ2h data by pwl or soil water line swl were used to determine seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of riparian tree of salix babylonica l along the jian and chaobai river in beijing china these methods were evaluated via three criteria including akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse results showed that different types of input data led to considerable differences in the contributions of soil water at upper 30 cm 9 9 57 6 and below 80 cm depths 29 0 76 4 seasonal water uptake patterns were significantly different especially when δ2h offset was pronounced p 0 05 the dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h underestimated the contributions of soil water in the 0 30 cm layer by 30 4 and groundwater by 56 3 compared to that with pwl corrected δ2h the pwl correction method obtained a higher groundwater contribution mean of 29 5 than that estimated by the swl correction method mean of 24 5 the mixsiar model using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h produced the smallest aic 94 1 bic 91 9 and rmse values 4 8 than other methods 94 9 101 7 92 6 99 5 and 5 3 12 4 respectively which underlined the best performance of pwl correction method the present study provides crucial insights into quantifying accurate root water uptake sources even if δ2h offset exists keywords root water uptake δ2h offset mixsiar model potential water source line riparian tree 1 introduction terrestrial vegetation plays an irreplaceable role in the global water cycle because 65 of precipitation was transported from land surfaces to the atmosphere by means of plant transpiration wang et al 2014 good et al 2015 wei et al 2017 in recent years a growing number of studies have focused on the water cycle in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac which is mainly controlled by plant transpiration gou and miller 2014 jiao et al 2019 in particular root water uptake is one of the most important components in gspac by indicating the plants abilities to take up different water sources and respond to variable hydrological conditions ma and song 2016 barbeta et al 2019 however the explicit quantification of root water uptake remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of plant water use stable isotope tracing technique as an efficient tool with minimum damage to plants during sampling has been widely used in exploring root water uptake by comparing isotopic compositions of stem water and its potential water sources dawson and ehleringer 1991 asbjornsen et al 2007 yang et al 2015a 2018 ma and song 2016 rothfuss and javaux 2017 the quantification of the main plant water sources is usually carried out via the statistically based multisource mixing models such as the isosource model and bayesian mixing models e g siar mixsir and mixsiar rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2019a specifically mixsiar not only accounts for the uncertainties in the root water uptake estimations of isotope ratios of stem water and its corresponding water sources but also provides an optimal solution rather than a range of feasible solutions rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2019a the isotopic tracing method relies on a basic assumption that no isotopic fractionation occurs during root water uptake dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopes of twig xylem water represents a weighted mean signature of all water sources used by plants respectively to their contributions dawson and ehleringer 1993 ehleringer and dawson 1992 both δ2h and δ18o isotopes of stem water should match those of source water if the assumption of no isotopic fractionation is true lin and sternberg 1993 barbeta et al 2019 however some studies reported that δ2h fractionation occurred in root water uptake for some halophytes and xerophytes species lin and sternberg 1993 ellsworth and williams 2007 as a result the δ2h of stem water was far less than that of soil water groundwater and river water which were possible sources of the root water uptake lin and sternberg 1993 found that the depletion of δ2h in stem water ranged from 2 to 13 compared to that of source water both in the field and greenhouse experiments for coastal wetland plants it was reported that 3 9 depletion in δ2h of stem water in comparison to that of soil water was observed in twelve of sixteen shrubs and tree species from arid and semi arid regions in greenhouse experiments by ellsworth and williams 2007 these δ2h offsets of stem water from their potential sources due to isotopic fractionation challenged the reliability of isotopic tracing method in identifications of plant water sources barbeta et al 2019 a growing number of studies showed that δ2h offsets of stem water also existed in non halophytes and non xerophytes such as the riparian trees brooks et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 geris et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 and the laboratory controlled tree species vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 these δ2h offsets of stem water mainly resulted from δ2h fractionation occurring in roots or between stem and root water which was related to soil water loss soil type as well as leaf transpiration lin and sternberg 1993 vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 therefore the δ2h offsets caused by hydrogen fractionation should be kept in mind in applications such as quantifying sources of root water uptake previous studies usually did not take the δ2h offsets of stem water into account and still used single or dual isotopes with uncorrected δ2h method to quantify plant water sources they usually speculated that a missing water source in the sampling process led to the δ2h offsets bowling et al 2017 evaristo et al 2017 indicated that plant water source estimations were less sensitive to δ2h fractionation when both δ2h and δ18o were combined within a bayesian inference approach on the contrary some studies confirmed that there were remarkably divergent source water contributions either using single uncorrected δ2h single δ18o or both isotopes due to δ2h offsets barbeta et al 2019 2020 in order to avoid inaccurate results caused by pronounced δ2h offsets some studies directly used single δ18o to quantify plant water sources asbjornsen et al 2007 goebel et al 2015 nevertheless single isotopic tracer is insufficient to identify plant water sources when the isotopic composition of stem water matches with several water sources barbeta et al 2019 parnell et al 2010 therefore neither single nor dual isotopes method using uncorrected isotopes is effective for the identification of plant water sources when δ2h offsets exist how to correct δ2h offsets and make accurate estimations of plant water sources is an urgent need a concept of line condition excess lc excess which was originally used to describe the δ2h offset of the river water from the local meteoric water line lmwl was presented by landwehr and coplen 2006 recently barbeta et al 2019 modified the lc excess and corrected δ2h of stem water for riparian trees by subtracting the sw excess which represents for the δ2h offsets of stem water from their corresponding soil water line swl the swl correction method only considered soil water as potential water sources for plants however the potential water sources also include other sources such as groundwater rock moisture fog water and dew water evaristo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2019b in particular groundwater serves as an important and independent water source for phreatophytes especially during drought periods or in arid and semiarid regions contreras et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 fan 2015 mediterranean region dawson and pate 1996 and even humid region vincke and thiry 2008 several tree species could tap into capillary fringe or even water tables to take up groundwater directly to meet transpiration needs song et al 2016 christina et al 2018 groundwater is extracted by trees more efficiently than soil water in the unsaturated zone because a few deep roots can withdraw a large quantities of groundwater 20 for transpiration ferro et al 2003 although groundwater is identified as an important water source it was not considered in the swl correction method due to its similar isotopic values with deep soil water in barbeta et al 2019 however the isotopic composition of groundwater may vary greatly from that in the deep soil water therefore the δ2h offset correction should consider the isotopic values of potential water sources such as soil water at different depths and groundwater if the plants have deep roots to acquire groundwater in this study the mixsiar model accompanied with a developed δ2h offset correction method was used to quantify root water uptake patterns of riparian trees along the jian and chaobai river in beijing china the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a water source line that can correct the δ2h offset of stem water from its potential water sources 2 compare the outputs of mixsiar model using single or dual isotopes method with uncorrected or corrected δ2h input data 3 evaluate the effects of δ2h offsets and single or dual isotopes method on determination of water sources for riparian trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical consideration 2 1 1 pwl definition the potential water source line pwl was presented to correct the δ2h offset of stem water from the potential water sources including both soil water at different depths and groundwater δ2h values of stem water corrected by pwl can match those of source water the pwl was proposed on the basis of the concept of lc excess which was defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 as following 1 lc excess δ2h aδ18o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of lmwl δ2h and δ18o in eq 1 are isotopic compositions of river water samples generally trees cannot take up rainwater or river water directly but rely on soil water in order to access the δ2h deviation of stem water from the swl i e sw excess barbeta et al 2019 changed the above lc excess formula into 2 sw excess δ2h as δ18o bs where as and bs represent the slope and intercept of swl respectively δ2h and δ18o in eq 2 are isotopic compositions of stem water the sw excess indicates the δ2h offsets of stem water with respect to their corresponding swl which limits the plant water sources to only soil water pools positive sw excess value means that the δ2h in stem water is more enriched than the swl while negative value means that δ2h in stem water is more depleted than swl the concept of the swl correction method is shown in fig 1 besides soil water groundwater is a crucial water source especially for phreatophytes growing in areas with shallow water table depth wtd groundwater and deep soil water cannot be merged into one source for the estimations of water uptake patterns when their isotopic compositions are significantly different groundwater will greatly affect the fitting of the correction water line therefore the pwl was proposed by performing a linear regression on all soil water and groundwater isotope data as shown in fig 1 the δ2h deviation of stem water from the pwl i e pw excess was as follows 3 pw excess δ2h ap δ18o bp where ap and bp are the slope and intercept of the pwl respectively positive value of pw excess means that the δ2h in stem water is more enriched than the pwl the larger the positive value is the greater the degree of isotopic enrichment is on the contrary negative value of pw excess represents that δ2h in stem water is more depleted than that the pwl the larger the negative value is the greater the degree of isotopic depletion is when pw excess is zero there is no δ2h offset between stem water and the pwl the δ2h value of stem water is corrected by subtracting the corresponding pw excess from the original value 2 1 2 mixsiar model and different types of input data the mixsiar model v3 1 incorporating with stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o was used to calculate contributions of potential water sources to plant stem water the isotopic values of stem water were referred as the mixture data whereas those of soil water at different depths and groundwater were set as the source data the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter run length in the mixsiar model was selected as very long for convergence the model errors were evaluated via the process and residual errors the calculated 50 percentile of the posterior contribution was referred as the main proportional contribution of each water source to stem water in this study stock and semmens 2013 more details about mixsiar model v3 1 could be found in stock and semmens 2013 in order to evaluate the effects of δ2h offset in stem water and single or dual isotopes method on quantifying root water uptake we compared the performance of mixsiar model input with seven types of isotopic data for stem water including 1 uncorrected δ2h and δ18o 2 single uncorrected δ2h 3 single δ18o 4 dual isotopes with δ2h corrected by the swl subtracting the sw excess from the δ2h values and δ18o 5 single δ2h corrected by the swl 6 dual isotopes with δ2h corrected by the pwl subtracting the pw excess from the δ2h values and δ18o and 7 single δ2h corrected by the pwl to assess the effectiveness of the developed δ2h offset correction method in identifying root water uptake sources two types of evaluation methods were used to evaluate the results of seven types of input data the first method was based on the correlations between plant water source estimations and environment variables previous studies showed that δ2h offsets and root water uptake patterns were affected by different environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd precipitation soil sand content ssc wtd and soil water content swc qian et al 2017 vargas et al 2017 wang et al 2017b barbeta et al 2019 for example precipitation the fluctuation of wtd and swc could affect water availabilities of potential water sources for trees qian et al 2017 geris et al 2017 concluded that soil type might have a strong effect on water uptake patterns this could be explained by the fact that soil types affected both precipitation infiltration and groundwater capillary rise through changing soil moisture and root distribution vereecken et al 2015 zipper et al 2015 the vpd could impact the transpiration rate of plants which was the driving force of root water uptake a significant relationship was found between the vpd and water source contributions barbeta et al 2019 therefore the correlations between plant water source estimations and these multiple environment variables could be considered to evaluate the performances of mixsiar model with seven types of input data the stronger the correlation was the water source contributions calculated by mixsiar model were closer to actual values the correlation analysis was conducted using general linear mixed models glmm in the spss software 22 0 version to avoid the influence of random errors e g different sites and sampling campaigns the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic values rascher et al 2004 were used to compare the correlations of plant water source estimations with different environmental variables among the seven types of input data the input data with the lower values of aic and bic were the preferred type secondly the deviation of water source contributions estimated with each type of input data from the average values of all seven types of input data was assessed it could reflect the uncertainties of mixsiar estimations with different input data by the root mean square error rmse 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i p 2 where n indicates the number of all water sources including soil water at different depths and groundwater at all sites and dates pi is the proportional contribution of the ith water source estimated by mixsiar model with one certain type of input data and p is the average contribution of the ith water source calculated through seven types of input data the smaller the rmse value is the smaller the uncertainties of plant water source estimations are the best type of input data for quantification of plant water source contributions using the mixsiar model was then selected through the smallest aic bic and rmse values 2 2 field observations 2 2 1 study area and field measurements in order to test the correction method of stem water δ2h offset by pwl for determining plant water sources experiments for riparian trees of s babylonica were conducted during april to november in 2019 along the reaches of the jian and chaobai river in shunyi district beijing china 40 07 30 n 116 40 37 e fig 2 the study area has a temperate continental sub humid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 11 5 c and annual average evaporation is 1175 mm the annual average precipitation is 610 mm with 80 of which occurring in the wet season from june to august the water depth in river is mean of 1 4 m in the reach of jian river with a width of 50 90 m and remains approximately 0 7 m in the reach of the chaobai river with a width of about 200 m s babylonica is one of the most widely distributed riparian trees with growing season starting from late april to early november with a rooting system suitable for waterlogging approximately 4 m deep s babylonica can survive being below the water tables markus michalczyk et al 2019 martorello et al 2020 three representative sites in the riparian zone alongside the jian river site a and chaobai river sites b and c with different soil textures and wtds were selected in this study area fig 2 the soil textures within 0 3 m depth were mainly clay loam sandy loam and sand for sites a b and c respectively table 1 there was extremely significant difference in the ssc p 0 001 among sites a 33 4 b 80 6 and c 90 8 the annual mean wtd was significantly different among sites a 21 1 m b 2 3 m and c 1 6 m both soil water and groundwater can be taken up by s babylonica easily at sites b and c due to shallow wtd they were used to compare the performances of mixsiar model with δ2h corrected by the pwl and swl the site a was selected as a comparison where the potential water sources for s babylonica were only confined to the soil water sources at different depths under the deep wtd and the pwl was the same as swl these three sites with various environmental conditions were adequate to qualitatively evaluate the significance of the pwl correction method for quantifying root water uptake sources of riparian trees and evaluate the performance of mixsiar model with seven types of input data daily meteorological data including temperature radiation and relative humidity was collected from the meteorological observation station et007 insentec instrument hangzhou china in this study area fig 2 daily vpd was estimated through relative humidity and temperature the daily precipitation data was recorded via a tilting rain gauge sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument shanghai china installed on the opposite side of site c the wtd was measured once a month from the groundwater monitoring wells constructed at each site 2 2 2 water sampling and isotope analysis water samples of precipitation river groundwater stem and soil were collected for δ2h and δ18o analysis precipitation greater than 1 5 mm was collected during the observation period in 2019 the polyethylene bottle coupled with a funnel and plastic ball was used to avoid evaporation yang et al 2015b water samples of river groundwater stem and soil were collected on the same day with six campaigns on may 5 june 14 july 26 august 15 september 26 and november 5 in 2019 river water was sampled at a depth of 0 3 m below the water surface using the organic glass hydrophore groundwater was sampled from the monitoring well at each site by a water pump s babylonica trees in three plots with distances of 5 10 and 20 m away from the river bank at each site were selected for stem water isotope analysis fig 2 the mean diameter at breast height and average height of the studied trees were 66 5 cm and 8 0 m respectively three non green and suberized stems approximately 10 mm in diameter were taken from twigs of each tree and combined to represent a single stem sample they were removed the bark and phloem tissue immediately placed into air tight glass vials and sealed with parafilm soil samples were collected within 1 m of each tree using a power auger with the petrol engine driven post driver chpd78 christie engineering company sydney australia soil was sampled at depths of 5 10 15 20 30 40 60 80 100 150 200 250 and 300 cm the roots were removed and then soil samples were placed into air tight glass vials and sealed with parafilm the soil samples were also used for gravimetric swc measurements by oven dry method and soil texture measurements by a laser particle size analyzer mastersize 2000 malven instruments ltd uk all soil and stem samples were kept frozen in a refrigerator until water extraction the water contained in the stem and soil samples were collected using an automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the extraction progress was described in detail by wu et al 2019a all the water extractions were completed which had been checked by oven drying samples at 105 c for 12 h and reweighing them to ensure complete extraction yang et al 2015b the isotopic compositions of rainwater soil water groundwater and river water were measured by an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa the measurement precision of the iris system was 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o wang et al 2009 because organic contaminants in the water cryogenically extracted from the tree stems would affect the isotopic measurements by the iris method zhao et al 2011 we used an isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany to measure the δ2h and δ18o in stem water the precision of the irms system was 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o respectively the measured isotopic compositions for different waters were calibrated and normalized against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow no significant difference in δ2h p 0 98 and δ18o p 0 89 measurements for groundwater rainwater and soil water was observed between the iris and irms methods there was no significant difference in water isotopes among the trees in the three plots at each site and they were considered as three replicates to analyze the water sources of riparian trees four soil layers 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm were divided based on seasonal variations in swc and soil water isotopic composition at different depths the isotopic ratios of stem water and soil water in each layer were input into mixsiar model to quantify the water source contributions for riparian trees in each plot and then the estimated results of three plots were averaged to determine the root water uptake patterns at each site 2 3 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with kolmogorov smirnov levene s and post hoc tukey s tests p 0 05 were used to examine differences in the isotopic compositions of different water sources as well as differences in the δ2h offsets among three sites two way anova was performed to detect the significant effects of both sampling sites and dates on the δ2h offsets and the differences of proportional contributions of water sources among seven types of input data the above statistical analysis was performed in the spss software 22 0 inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the total precipitation was 399 mm during the observation period in 2019 fig 3 there were pronounced differences in seasonal variations of precipitation p 0 01 the accumulated monthly precipitation during april to november was 18 4 25 8 19 5 133 7 89 1 79 1 32 9 and 0 6 mm respectively monthly mean vpd was 0 9 1 4 1 4 1 2 1 0 0 8 0 5 and 0 3 kpa from april to november respectively with mean of 1 0 kpa and standard deviation sd of 0 5 kpa fig 3 the wtd was significantly different among sites a 20 5 0 5 m b 1 9 0 3 m and c 1 5 0 1 m p 0 05 fig 3 the increase of wtd was observed at sites a from 20 0 to 21 2 m and b from 1 7 to 2 5 m during the wet season whereas wtd was relatively stable at site c the depth distribution and seasonal variation in swc exhibited significant differences among the three sites p 0 05 the average swc in the 0 30 cm layer was larger at site a mean of 0 16 g g 1 and sd of 0 03 g g 1 than that at site b mean of 0 09 g g 1 and sd of 0 02 g g 1 and site c mean of 0 09 g g 1 and sd of 0 03 g g 1 fig 4 however the swc in the 80 300 cm layer was largest mean of 0 25 g g 1 at site c following by that at site b mean of 0 21 g g 1 and smallest at site a mean of 0 20 g g 1 fig 4 there was an evident decline of swc in the 0 150 cm layer during may to august at sites a and b but not at site c 3 2 isotopic compositions of different water bodies the isotopic values of precipitation ranged from 68 3 to 26 0 for δ2h and 13 9 to 6 3 for δ18o fig 5 the lmwl fitted by the isotopic compositions of precipitation was established as δ2h 5 5δ18o 7 9 r 2 0 81 during the observation period in 2019 groundwater gradually enriched from site a mean of 71 1 for δ2h and 10 2 for δ18o to site b mean of 55 7 for δ2h and 6 9 for δ18o and site c mean of 51 1 for δ2h and 6 4 for δ18o fig 5 the isotopic compositions of groundwater were more depleted than those of river water at site a p 0 001 fig 5 nevertheless no significant difference was found in seasonal variations of isotopic values between groundwater and river water at sites b and c during the observation period p 0 05 soil water isotopes at different depths ranged from 86 6 to 45 6 for δ2h and from 14 1 to 3 2 for δ18o at the three sites fig 5 they were enriched in the 0 30 cm soil layer but depleted with depth within the 0 300 cm profile at site a it was evident that soil water isotopes in the 150 300 cm layer at sites b and c were evidently affected by groundwater being more enriched than those in the 80 150 cm layer fig 5 the δ2h in stem water was more depleted than that of potential water sources and fell to the lower right of the pwl at sites b and c in the dual isotopes plots fig 5 nevertheless the δ18o in stem water was always within the range of that in groundwater and soil water suggesting that groundwater was an important water source for riparian trees at sites b and c as river water and groundwater interacted closely and had similar isotopic characteristics they could be pooled together as one potential water source for riparian trees at these two sites on the contrary the δ18o in stem water mean of 7 4 was remarkably enriched than that of groundwater mean of 10 2 and more depleted than that of river water mean of 6 9 at site a trees could not take up groundwater under the deep wtd mean of 20 5 m therefore neither groundwater nor river water was considered as water sources for riparian trees at site a 3 3 δ2h offsets of stem water the pwl and swl for sites a pwl was the same as swl b and c during the observation period were fitted with r2 0 66 p 0 001 in fig 5 the slope of swl and pwl indicated the evaporation degree of soil water sources and potential water sources respectively on average the swl had a slope of 6 4 4 2 and 4 8 at site a b and c respectively in comparison the slopes of pwl at site b mean of 4 5 and site c mean of 5 3 were larger than those of swl which indicated that the evaporation degree of potential water sources was smaller than that of soil water sources additionally evaporation of both soil water and potential sources were strongest at site b among the three sites the δ2h offset of stem water from its potential water sources was calculated by the pw excess and sw excess fig 6 the mean sw excess value during the observation period was 4 7 5 1 and 8 0 for site a b and c respectively the pw excess values mean of 8 5 were significantly lower than sw excess values mean of 6 5 over the observation period at sites b and c p 0 05 there were pronounced seasonal differences in the δ2h offset characteristics among the three sites p 0 001 fig 6 the average value of pw excess same as sw excess for site a remained stable with sd of 0 8 during the observation period the average value of pw excess varied greatly ranging from 13 7 to 1 7 among the six sampling campaigns during the observation period at sites b and c fig 6 extremely significant δ2h offset of stem water occurred on may 5 june 14 and july 26 p 0 01 3 4 comparison of water use patterns determined by different input data the proportional contributions of different potential water sources to riparian trees estimated by mixsiar model with seven types of input data were shown in fig 7 and table 2 when using dual isotopes method with δ2h in stem water corrected by pwl the average contributions of soil water in the 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm layers and groundwater were 22 4 18 3 14 1 16 7 and 28 5 respectively table 2 there were significant differences in proportional contributions of soil water sources below 80 cm 29 0 76 4 among seven types of input data p 0 05 especially when δ2h offset was pronounced for example those average contributions estimated using single uncorrected δ2h mean of 41 4 and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h mean of 36 9 were lower than those estimated by single δ18o mean of 62 2 dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h mean of 62 7 and dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h mean of 63 6 the differences were also observed in the contribution of groundwater among seven types of input data during the whole growing season p 0 05 for instance groundwater contributed a little to trees estimated using single uncorrected δ2h mean of 12 9 and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h and δ18o mean of 12 9 whereas it contributed more using single δ18o mean of 27 4 single δ2h corrected by pwl mean of 30 6 and dual isotopes with δ18o and pwl corrected δ2h mean of 29 5 table 2 additionally the pwl correction method estimated a higher contribution of groundwater mean of 29 5 than that mean of 24 5 estimated by the swl correction method table 2 there were significant differences in seasonal water uptake patterns for riparian trees among different types of input data p 0 05 fig 7 and table 2 the results calculated by dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h showed that riparian trees mainly used water from soils below 150 cm on may 5 june 14 july 26 and august 15 with contributions greater than 54 6 then the main water uptake depth changed to the 0 150 cm layer on september 26 and november 5 with the contributions more than 60 5 however the main water uptake depth estimated by single and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h was in the 0 150 cm layer during the entire observation period with average contribution of 72 3 fig 7 and table 2 the proportional contribution of soil water in the 0 30 cm layer to stem water of trees during wet season june to august differed greatly among seven types of input data it contributed more estimated using dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h with mean of 25 8 whereas the average contributions were 18 4 20 2 and 19 6 calculated by single uncorrected δ2h single δ2h corrected by swl and pwl respectively the absolute from 8 6 to 10 6 and relative from 29 9 to 64 7 differences in the contributions of tree water sources were evident on several sampling campaigns especially at sites b and c between the single δ18o and dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h methods fig 7 and table s1 for example the single δ18o method overestimated the contributions of soil water in the 30 80 cm layer by 64 2 on aug 15 while it underestimated groundwater contributions by 26 1 on september 26 at site b relative to the dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method 3 5 best input isotope data for identifying riparian tree water sources the aic and bic values that reflected the relationship between source contributions to stem water and environmental variables for selecting the preferred input data were shown in table 3 without consideration of the δ2h offset both single δ2h and dual isotopes methods displayed the largest aic 101 7 and bic 101 7 table 3 it was worth noting that the single δ18o method showed lower aic 94 9 and bic values 92 6 on the contrary when δ2h in stem water was corrected by pwl dual isotopes method produced smaller aic 94 1 and bic 91 9 than single pwl corrected δ2h aic of 98 0 and bic of 95 8 and single δ18o aic of 94 9 and bic of 92 6 the estimations of plant water sources with corrected isotopes displayed significantly smaller aic and bic values than those with uncorrected isotopes p 0 05 for instance the average single corrected δ2h produced a lower aic 97 1 and bic 94 9 than single uncorrected δ2h aic of 101 7 and bic of 99 5 moreover the dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h figured out larger aic 97 6 and bic 95 4 values than that with pwl corrected δ2h this suggested that dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h had better performance than that with swl corrected δ2h the rmse values for explaining the deviation of the source contributions estimated by one type of input data from the average source contributions of different input data were shown in table 3 rmse value was remarkably smaller when using dual isotopes than that using single isotope p 0 05 table 3 whether δ2h offset was corrected or not for example rmse value was 12 4 when using single uncorrected δ2h whereas it was 9 5 when using dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h the water source contribution estimations with corrected isotopes displayed significantly smaller rmse values mean of 5 1 than those with uncorrected isotopes mean of 9 6 p 0 05 furthermore the dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h had significant higher rmse values than the dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h p 0 05 overall our results suggested that the dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h performed best in identifying water uptake patterns 4 discussion 4 1 possible reasons for isotopic offsets of stem water spatial and seasonal disparities of pw excess values suggested that δ2h offsets of stem water differed greatly during the observation period among the three sites fig 6 a δ2h offset could be attributed to methodological issues reported by orlowski et al 2018 however water extraction of soil and stem samples via automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system was well conducted and yielded a collection rate more than 98 in this study contamination of extracted water by organic compounds was also routinely dealt with custom and post measurement corrections these techniques extremely avoided the fractionation processes occurring during water extraction another possibility for explaining the δ2h offset is the isotopic heterogeneity in plant water pools aroused by discrimination during water transport and redistribution within the plant zhao et al 2016 barbeta et al 2020 the δ2h offset would be decreased or even reversed under drier conditions as a result of evaporative enrichment barbeta et al 2020 these studies indicated that there were no δ2h fractionation and offset occurring during root water uptake however δ2h offsets were more noticeable under drier conditions in our study e g much lower pw excess values occurring on may 5 at sites b and c it was impossible to be completely ascribed to the evaporative enrichment in plant water pools the δ2h offset of stem water probably occurred in the soil root interfaces by root water uptake allison et al 1983 vargas et al 2017 it was found that large δ2h offset was synchronized to low swc in the 0 150 cm layer and the decline of water table from may to june fig 4 more interestingly δ2h offset progressively decreased as swc in the 0 150 cm layer increased with increasing precipitation amount and rising water table this might be due to that pore spaces between soil grains and roots increased with the soil water loss under the increase of wtd which resulted in stronger δ2h fractionation during root water uptake barnes and allison 1983 vargas et al 2017 moreover the δ2h offsets at high ssc sites mean ssc of 80 7 for site b and 90 8 for site c were significantly larger than those at low ssc site mean ssc of 33 4 for site a table 1 and fig 6 it has been reported that δ2h fractionation was controlled by variable diffusive resistance of soil vapors which was indicated by air filled porosity and the tortuosity of the soil barnes and allison 1988 therefore the high ssc could increase the pore spaces barnes and allison 1983 vargas et al 2017 and possibilities of roots contacting with air during root water uptake which could lead to δ2h offset evaristo et al 2017 geris et al 2017 previous studies found that soil clay content and or carbonate content could result in δ18o fractionation of water added to soil particularly under low soil water content leading to conflicting results in quantification of root water uptake meiβner et al 2014 yang et al 2015 the bias of δ18o might be caused by oxygen isotope exchanges between soil water and carbonates during the water extraction process the adsorbed cation isotope effects in mineral water interface were also examined in greenhouse experiments by oerter et al 2014 however if soil water with depleted δ18o values was taken up by roots stem water should be depleted in both isotopes but not only in δ2h barbeta et al 2019 the stem δ18o matched those of source water during the growing season of riparian trees and no δ18o offset was observed in our study fig 5 lin and sternberg 1993 and ellsworth and williams 2007 reported that passage of water through simplistic pathway led to δ2h fractionation in soil root interface but no δ18o fractionation was observed during root water uptake transfer and transport within the plant zhao et al 2016 and a few laboratory experiments confirmed this finding vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 quite a few studies presented notable isotopic offsets for δ2h rather than for δ18o zhao et al 2016 evaristo et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 it is mainly due to that the reversible diffusion of water through the ultrafiltration membrance from the external medium to the root xylem discriminates against 2h about 10 times more than 18o during water uptake lin and sternberg 1993 vargas et al 2017 nevertheless the bias of δ18o and corresponding reasons need further investigations 4 2 correction of δ2h offset for identifications of plant water sources by means of comparing aic bic and rmse during the observation period at the three sites the mixsiar model outputs with uncorrected δ2h displayed higher aic bic and rmse values than those with corrected δ2h figs 6 and 7 this indicated that δ2h offsets in stem water greatly affected plant water source contributions estimated using either single or dual isotopes method generally δ2h offsets lead to underestimation of proportional contributions of deep water sources using uncorrected δ2h evaristo et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 barbeta et al 2019 found that dual isotopes approach with swl corrected δ2h estimated 1 5 times of the groundwater contribution to stem water than dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h our study showed that dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h underestimated groundwater contribution by 56 3 at shallow wtd sites compared to dual isotopes method with corrected δ2h fig 7 moreover soil water contribution in the 0 30 cm layer was underestimated by 30 4 at deep wtd site where groundwater could not be used by plants fig 7 it was evident that the effects of δ2h offsets on quantifying plant water sources were remarkably different among the three sites with various wtds identifying plant water sources should primarily check δ2h offsets especially under the conditions of high ssc and variable wtd fluctuations the mixsiar model outputs using single δ18o displayed lower aic bic and rmse values than those using dual isotopes with uncorrected δ2h table 3 this suggested that single δ18o performed better than dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h in the attribution of plant water sources when there were notable δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources goebel et al 2015 evaristo et al 2017 vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 however the mixsiar model outputs estimated using single δ18o were greatly different with those estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method on several sampling campaigns especially at sites b and c fig 7 and table s1 the differences would be enlarged with the increase of δ2h offsets as indicated by barbeta et al 2019 it was evident that the single δ18o method showed larger uncertainties rmse of 7 0 for plant source water identifications over the observation period than the dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method rmse of 4 8 moreover the single δ18o method could lead to erroneous interpretations when root water uptake took place simultaneously from several zones while dual isotopes method might provide information that was not apparent in the single isotope method evaristo et al 2017 furthermore the source contributions estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method had closer correlations with the environmental variables indicating by lower aic and bic values table 3 that is when the isotopic offsets were corrected and the isotopes in stem water did not deviated from their corresponding water sources the mixsiar model with dual isotopes was more accurate to identify water sources than that with single δ18o isotope parnell et al 2010 also reported that increasing the number of isotopes without δ2h offsets could improve the predictive accuracy of the bayesian model when the number of sources e g five water sources for trees in this study were more than that of tracer isotopes therefore it is essential to propose a correction method to correct the δ2h offsets rather than just use δ18o for plant water source identifications the mixsiar model outputs estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method displayed lower aic bic and rmse values than those using dual isotopes with swl corrected δ2h method table 3 it suggested that dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h performed better in plant water source estimations than that with swl corrected δ2h the reason was probably due to that groundwater was a crucial and independent water source for s babylonica growing in areas with shallow wtd low precipitation and shallow groundwater with abundant dissolved oxygen and nutrients during the growing season of s babylonica could stimulate deep roots to tap into capillary fringe or even water tables to take up groundwater directly to meet the water requirement yu et al 2017 therefore both groundwater and soil water should be in consideration of correcting stem water δ2h offsets especially for phreatophytes in shallow wtd areas the pwl correction method was more accurate and avoided an underestimation of groundwater contribution mean of 5 0 in comparison to the swl correction method in summary of previous and our results we propose four distinct types of δ2h offsets and the corresponding correction methods based on different wtds and groundwater recharge sources for riparian trees fig 8 there is one thing in common among these four types the contributions of plant water sources estimated using δ2h are not in agreement with those estimated using δ18o due to stem water δ2h offsets barbeta et al 2020 on the one hand when groundwater recharge mainly comes from precipitation the isotopic composition of groundwater is generally more depleted than that of soil water at different layers fig 8a and b δ2h offset characteristics depends on whether δ18o in stem water is within the range of that in groundwater or not for instance when groundwater cannot be taken up by plants under deep wtd conditions δ18o in stem water is not within the range of that in groundwater as observed in previous studies brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2017 and at site a in this study fig 8a consequently groundwater will not be considered to correct δ2h offset in case that groundwater serves as an important water source for riparian trees in shallow wtd areas oerter and bowen 2019 both groundwater and soil water should be taken into consideration to correct δ2h offset i e pwl correction method fig 8b on the other hand groundwater is principally recharged by seepage of surface water which may lead to more enriched isotopic composition of groundwater compared to the depleted soil water in deep layers fig 8c and d if δ18o in stem water is within the range of that in groundwater such as at sites b and c in our study and in other field studies bowling et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 groundwater should be considered to correct δ2h offset fig 8d otherwise when δ18o in stem water is not within the range of that in groundwater fig 8c groundwater is not included in one of the water sources to correct δ2h offset therefore the proposed pwl correction method in this study considers all potential water sources and can be applied to quantify root water uptake under different types of δ2h offsets of stem water 4 3 implications riparian trees perennially or seasonally depended on groundwater in the arid and semi arid climate regions fan 2015 contreras et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 or mediterranean climate region dawson and pate 1996 there could be an underestimation of groundwater contributions when using uncorrected δ2h due to δ2h offset which could be resolved by the developed pwl correction method in this study when groundwater served as a crucial water source the pwl correction method performed better than both the swl correction method and non correction method in identifications of plant water sources it was evident that mixsiar model using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h estimated more accurate proportional contributions of groundwater in this study only possible reasons for δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources was deducted by indirect evidences the mechanisms of δ2h offsets requires further investigation by collecting different plant water pools from roots xylem sap as well as stem tissues under various soil texture and water table conditions the potential water sources might not be confined to soil water and groundwater in some regions they also included other sources such as rock moisture fog water and dew water wang et al 2017a 2019b only when all potential water sources were considered to fit the correction line the mixsiar model with pwl corrected input data could obtain more accurate estimations of plant water sources contributions the pwl correction method was evaluated for determining riparian tree water sources only considering soil water and groundwater sources in this study it requires further validation using more cases in consideration of other water sources including rock moisture fog water and dew water the pwl correction method provides insights into determining accurate root water uptake patterns even if δ2h offset exists it further contributes to understanding the relationship between plants and water such as partitioning evapotranspiration fluxes into transpiration and

contributions of soil water in the 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm layers and groundwater were 22 4 18 3 14 1 16 7 and 28 5 respectively riparian trees mainly used soil water below 150 cm depth on may 5 june 14 july 26 and august 15 with contributions greater than 54 6 then the main root water uptake depth returned to the 0 150 cm layer on september 26 and november 5 with contributions more than 60 5

4909,root water uptake plays an important role in water cycle in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o are effective tools to quantify the use of different water sources by plant roots however the widespread δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources due to δ2h fractionation during root water uptake result in conflicting interpretations of water utilization using stable isotopes in this study a potential water source line pwl i e a linear regression line between δ18o and δ2h data of both soil water at different depths and groundwater was proposed to correct δ2h offsets of stem water the pwl corrected δ2h was determined by subtracting the deviation between δ2h in stem water and pwl from the original value the mixsiar model coupled with seven types of input data i e various combinations of single or dual isotopes with uncorrected or corrected δ2h data by pwl or soil water line swl were used to determine seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of riparian tree of salix babylonica l along the jian and chaobai river in beijing china these methods were evaluated via three criteria including akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse results showed that different types of input data led to considerable differences in the contributions of soil water at upper 30 cm 9 9 57 6 and below 80 cm depths 29 0 76 4 seasonal water uptake patterns were significantly different especially when δ2h offset was pronounced p 0 05 the dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h underestimated the contributions of soil water in the 0 30 cm layer by 30 4 and groundwater by 56 3 compared to that with pwl corrected δ2h the pwl correction method obtained a higher groundwater contribution mean of 29 5 than that estimated by the swl correction method mean of 24 5 the mixsiar model using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h produced the smallest aic 94 1 bic 91 9 and rmse values 4 8 than other methods 94 9 101 7 92 6 99 5 and 5 3 12 4 respectively which underlined the best performance of pwl correction method the present study provides crucial insights into quantifying accurate root water uptake sources even if δ2h offset exists keywords root water uptake δ2h offset mixsiar model potential water source line riparian tree 1 introduction terrestrial vegetation plays an irreplaceable role in the global water cycle because 65 of precipitation was transported from land surfaces to the atmosphere by means of plant transpiration wang et al 2014 good et al 2015 wei et al 2017 in recent years a growing number of studies have focused on the water cycle in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac which is mainly controlled by plant transpiration gou and miller 2014 jiao et al 2019 in particular root water uptake is one of the most important components in gspac by indicating the plants abilities to take up different water sources and respond to variable hydrological conditions ma and song 2016 barbeta et al 2019 however the explicit quantification of root water uptake remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of plant water use stable isotope tracing technique as an efficient tool with minimum damage to plants during sampling has been widely used in exploring root water uptake by comparing isotopic compositions of stem water and its potential water sources dawson and ehleringer 1991 asbjornsen et al 2007 yang et al 2015a 2018 ma and song 2016 rothfuss and javaux 2017 the quantification of the main plant water sources is usually carried out via the statistically based multisource mixing models such as the isosource model and bayesian mixing models e g siar mixsir and mixsiar rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2019a specifically mixsiar not only accounts for the uncertainties in the root water uptake estimations of isotope ratios of stem water and its corresponding water sources but also provides an optimal solution rather than a range of feasible solutions rothfuss and javaux 2017 wang et al 2019a the isotopic tracing method relies on a basic assumption that no isotopic fractionation occurs during root water uptake dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopes of twig xylem water represents a weighted mean signature of all water sources used by plants respectively to their contributions dawson and ehleringer 1993 ehleringer and dawson 1992 both δ2h and δ18o isotopes of stem water should match those of source water if the assumption of no isotopic fractionation is true lin and sternberg 1993 barbeta et al 2019 however some studies reported that δ2h fractionation occurred in root water uptake for some halophytes and xerophytes species lin and sternberg 1993 ellsworth and williams 2007 as a result the δ2h of stem water was far less than that of soil water groundwater and river water which were possible sources of the root water uptake lin and sternberg 1993 found that the depletion of δ2h in stem water ranged from 2 to 13 compared to that of source water both in the field and greenhouse experiments for coastal wetland plants it was reported that 3 9 depletion in δ2h of stem water in comparison to that of soil water was observed in twelve of sixteen shrubs and tree species from arid and semi arid regions in greenhouse experiments by ellsworth and williams 2007 these δ2h offsets of stem water from their potential sources due to isotopic fractionation challenged the reliability of isotopic tracing method in identifications of plant water sources barbeta et al 2019 a growing number of studies showed that δ2h offsets of stem water also existed in non halophytes and non xerophytes such as the riparian trees brooks et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 geris et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 and the laboratory controlled tree species vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 these δ2h offsets of stem water mainly resulted from δ2h fractionation occurring in roots or between stem and root water which was related to soil water loss soil type as well as leaf transpiration lin and sternberg 1993 vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 therefore the δ2h offsets caused by hydrogen fractionation should be kept in mind in applications such as quantifying sources of root water uptake previous studies usually did not take the δ2h offsets of stem water into account and still used single or dual isotopes with uncorrected δ2h method to quantify plant water sources they usually speculated that a missing water source in the sampling process led to the δ2h offsets bowling et al 2017 evaristo et al 2017 indicated that plant water source estimations were less sensitive to δ2h fractionation when both δ2h and δ18o were combined within a bayesian inference approach on the contrary some studies confirmed that there were remarkably divergent source water contributions either using single uncorrected δ2h single δ18o or both isotopes due to δ2h offsets barbeta et al 2019 2020 in order to avoid inaccurate results caused by pronounced δ2h offsets some studies directly used single δ18o to quantify plant water sources asbjornsen et al 2007 goebel et al 2015 nevertheless single isotopic tracer is insufficient to identify plant water sources when the isotopic composition of stem water matches with several water sources barbeta et al 2019 parnell et al 2010 therefore neither single nor dual isotopes method using uncorrected isotopes is effective for the identification of plant water sources when δ2h offsets exist how to correct δ2h offsets and make accurate estimations of plant water sources is an urgent need a concept of line condition excess lc excess which was originally used to describe the δ2h offset of the river water from the local meteoric water line lmwl was presented by landwehr and coplen 2006 recently barbeta et al 2019 modified the lc excess and corrected δ2h of stem water for riparian trees by subtracting the sw excess which represents for the δ2h offsets of stem water from their corresponding soil water line swl the swl correction method only considered soil water as potential water sources for plants however the potential water sources also include other sources such as groundwater rock moisture fog water and dew water evaristo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2019b in particular groundwater serves as an important and independent water source for phreatophytes especially during drought periods or in arid and semiarid regions contreras et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 fan 2015 mediterranean region dawson and pate 1996 and even humid region vincke and thiry 2008 several tree species could tap into capillary fringe or even water tables to take up groundwater directly to meet transpiration needs song et al 2016 christina et al 2018 groundwater is extracted by trees more efficiently than soil water in the unsaturated zone because a few deep roots can withdraw a large quantities of groundwater 20 for transpiration ferro et al 2003 although groundwater is identified as an important water source it was not considered in the swl correction method due to its similar isotopic values with deep soil water in barbeta et al 2019 however the isotopic composition of groundwater may vary greatly from that in the deep soil water therefore the δ2h offset correction should consider the isotopic values of potential water sources such as soil water at different depths and groundwater if the plants have deep roots to acquire groundwater in this study the mixsiar model accompanied with a developed δ2h offset correction method was used to quantify root water uptake patterns of riparian trees along the jian and chaobai river in beijing china the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a water source line that can correct the δ2h offset of stem water from its potential water sources 2 compare the outputs of mixsiar model using single or dual isotopes method with uncorrected or corrected δ2h input data 3 evaluate the effects of δ2h offsets and single or dual isotopes method on determination of water sources for riparian trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 theoretical consideration 2 1 1 pwl definition the potential water source line pwl was presented to correct the δ2h offset of stem water from the potential water sources including both soil water at different depths and groundwater δ2h values of stem water corrected by pwl can match those of source water the pwl was proposed on the basis of the concept of lc excess which was defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 as following 1 lc excess δ2h aδ18o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of lmwl δ2h and δ18o in eq 1 are isotopic compositions of river water samples generally trees cannot take up rainwater or river water directly but rely on soil water in order to access the δ2h deviation of stem water from the swl i e sw excess barbeta et al 2019 changed the above lc excess formula into 2 sw excess δ2h as δ18o bs where as and bs represent the slope and intercept of swl respectively δ2h and δ18o in eq 2 are isotopic compositions of stem water the sw excess indicates the δ2h offsets of stem water with respect to their corresponding swl which limits the plant water sources to only soil water pools positive sw excess value means that the δ2h in stem water is more enriched than the swl while negative value means that δ2h in stem water is more depleted than swl the concept of the swl correction method is shown in fig 1 besides soil water groundwater is a crucial water source especially for phreatophytes growing in areas with shallow water table depth wtd groundwater and deep soil water cannot be merged into one source for the estimations of water uptake patterns when their isotopic compositions are significantly different groundwater will greatly affect the fitting of the correction water line therefore the pwl was proposed by performing a linear regression on all soil water and groundwater isotope data as shown in fig 1 the δ2h deviation of stem water from the pwl i e pw excess was as follows 3 pw excess δ2h ap δ18o bp where ap and bp are the slope and intercept of the pwl respectively positive value of pw excess means that the δ2h in stem water is more enriched than the pwl the larger the positive value is the greater the degree of isotopic enrichment is on the contrary negative value of pw excess represents that δ2h in stem water is more depleted than that the pwl the larger the negative value is the greater the degree of isotopic depletion is when pw excess is zero there is no δ2h offset between stem water and the pwl the δ2h value of stem water is corrected by subtracting the corresponding pw excess from the original value 2 1 2 mixsiar model and different types of input data the mixsiar model v3 1 incorporating with stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o was used to calculate contributions of potential water sources to plant stem water the isotopic values of stem water were referred as the mixture data whereas those of soil water at different depths and groundwater were set as the source data the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter run length in the mixsiar model was selected as very long for convergence the model errors were evaluated via the process and residual errors the calculated 50 percentile of the posterior contribution was referred as the main proportional contribution of each water source to stem water in this study stock and semmens 2013 more details about mixsiar model v3 1 could be found in stock and semmens 2013 in order to evaluate the effects of δ2h offset in stem water and single or dual isotopes method on quantifying root water uptake we compared the performance of mixsiar model input with seven types of isotopic data for stem water including 1 uncorrected δ2h and δ18o 2 single uncorrected δ2h 3 single δ18o 4 dual isotopes with δ2h corrected by the swl subtracting the sw excess from the δ2h values and δ18o 5 single δ2h corrected by the swl 6 dual isotopes with δ2h corrected by the pwl subtracting the pw excess from the δ2h values and δ18o and 7 single δ2h corrected by the pwl to assess the effectiveness of the developed δ2h offset correction method in identifying root water uptake sources two types of evaluation methods were used to evaluate the results of seven types of input data the first method was based on the correlations between plant water source estimations and environment variables previous studies showed that δ2h offsets and root water uptake patterns were affected by different environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd precipitation soil sand content ssc wtd and soil water content swc qian et al 2017 vargas et al 2017 wang et al 2017b barbeta et al 2019 for example precipitation the fluctuation of wtd and swc could affect water availabilities of potential water sources for trees qian et al 2017 geris et al 2017 concluded that soil type might have a strong effect on water uptake patterns this could be explained by the fact that soil types affected both precipitation infiltration and groundwater capillary rise through changing soil moisture and root distribution vereecken et al 2015 zipper et al 2015 the vpd could impact the transpiration rate of plants which was the driving force of root water uptake a significant relationship was found between the vpd and water source contributions barbeta et al 2019 therefore the correlations between plant water source estimations and these multiple environment variables could be considered to evaluate the performances of mixsiar model with seven types of input data the stronger the correlation was the water source contributions calculated by mixsiar model were closer to actual values the correlation analysis was conducted using general linear mixed models glmm in the spss software 22 0 version to avoid the influence of random errors e g different sites and sampling campaigns the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic values rascher et al 2004 were used to compare the correlations of plant water source estimations with different environmental variables among the seven types of input data the input data with the lower values of aic and bic were the preferred type secondly the deviation of water source contributions estimated with each type of input data from the average values of all seven types of input data was assessed it could reflect the uncertainties of mixsiar estimations with different input data by the root mean square error rmse 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i p 2 where n indicates the number of all water sources including soil water at different depths and groundwater at all sites and dates pi is the proportional contribution of the ith water source estimated by mixsiar model with one certain type of input data and p is the average contribution of the ith water source calculated through seven types of input data the smaller the rmse value is the smaller the uncertainties of plant water source estimations are the best type of input data for quantification of plant water source contributions using the mixsiar model was then selected through the smallest aic bic and rmse values 2 2 field observations 2 2 1 study area and field measurements in order to test the correction method of stem water δ2h offset by pwl for determining plant water sources experiments for riparian trees of s babylonica were conducted during april to november in 2019 along the reaches of the jian and chaobai river in shunyi district beijing china 40 07 30 n 116 40 37 e fig 2 the study area has a temperate continental sub humid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 11 5 c and annual average evaporation is 1175 mm the annual average precipitation is 610 mm with 80 of which occurring in the wet season from june to august the water depth in river is mean of 1 4 m in the reach of jian river with a width of 50 90 m and remains approximately 0 7 m in the reach of the chaobai river with a width of about 200 m s babylonica is one of the most widely distributed riparian trees with growing season starting from late april to early november with a rooting system suitable for waterlogging approximately 4 m deep s babylonica can survive being below the water tables markus michalczyk et al 2019 martorello et al 2020 three representative sites in the riparian zone alongside the jian river site a and chaobai river sites b and c with different soil textures and wtds were selected in this study area fig 2 the soil textures within 0 3 m depth were mainly clay loam sandy loam and sand for sites a b and c respectively table 1 there was extremely significant difference in the ssc p 0 001 among sites a 33 4 b 80 6 and c 90 8 the annual mean wtd was significantly different among sites a 21 1 m b 2 3 m and c 1 6 m both soil water and groundwater can be taken up by s babylonica easily at sites b and c due to shallow wtd they were used to compare the performances of mixsiar model with δ2h corrected by the pwl and swl the site a was selected as a comparison where the potential water sources for s babylonica were only confined to the soil water sources at different depths under the deep wtd and the pwl was the same as swl these three sites with various environmental conditions were adequate to qualitatively evaluate the significance of the pwl correction method for quantifying root water uptake sources of riparian trees and evaluate the performance of mixsiar model with seven types of input data daily meteorological data including temperature radiation and relative humidity was collected from the meteorological observation station et007 insentec instrument hangzhou china in this study area fig 2 daily vpd was estimated through relative humidity and temperature the daily precipitation data was recorded via a tilting rain gauge sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument shanghai china installed on the opposite side of site c the wtd was measured once a month from the groundwater monitoring wells constructed at each site 2 2 2 water sampling and isotope analysis water samples of precipitation river groundwater stem and soil were collected for δ2h and δ18o analysis precipitation greater than 1 5 mm was collected during the observation period in 2019 the polyethylene bottle coupled with a funnel and plastic ball was used to avoid evaporation yang et al 2015b water samples of river groundwater stem and soil were collected on the same day with six campaigns on may 5 june 14 july 26 august 15 september 26 and november 5 in 2019 river water was sampled at a depth of 0 3 m below the water surface using the organic glass hydrophore groundwater was sampled from the monitoring well at each site by a water pump s babylonica trees in three plots with distances of 5 10 and 20 m away from the river bank at each site were selected for stem water isotope analysis fig 2 the mean diameter at breast height and average height of the studied trees were 66 5 cm and 8 0 m respectively three non green and suberized stems approximately 10 mm in diameter were taken from twigs of each tree and combined to represent a single stem sample they were removed the bark and phloem tissue immediately placed into air tight glass vials and sealed with parafilm soil samples were collected within 1 m of each tree using a power auger with the petrol engine driven post driver chpd78 christie engineering company sydney australia soil was sampled at depths of 5 10 15 20 30 40 60 80 100 150 200 250 and 300 cm the roots were removed and then soil samples were placed into air tight glass vials and sealed with parafilm the soil samples were also used for gravimetric swc measurements by oven dry method and soil texture measurements by a laser particle size analyzer mastersize 2000 malven instruments ltd uk all soil and stem samples were kept frozen in a refrigerator until water extraction the water contained in the stem and soil samples were collected using an automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the extraction progress was described in detail by wu et al 2019a all the water extractions were completed which had been checked by oven drying samples at 105 c for 12 h and reweighing them to ensure complete extraction yang et al 2015b the isotopic compositions of rainwater soil water groundwater and river water were measured by an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa the measurement precision of the iris system was 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o wang et al 2009 because organic contaminants in the water cryogenically extracted from the tree stems would affect the isotopic measurements by the iris method zhao et al 2011 we used an isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany to measure the δ2h and δ18o in stem water the precision of the irms system was 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o respectively the measured isotopic compositions for different waters were calibrated and normalized against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow no significant difference in δ2h p 0 98 and δ18o p 0 89 measurements for groundwater rainwater and soil water was observed between the iris and irms methods there was no significant difference in water isotopes among the trees in the three plots at each site and they were considered as three replicates to analyze the water sources of riparian trees four soil layers 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm were divided based on seasonal variations in swc and soil water isotopic composition at different depths the isotopic ratios of stem water and soil water in each layer were input into mixsiar model to quantify the water source contributions for riparian trees in each plot and then the estimated results of three plots were averaged to determine the root water uptake patterns at each site 2 3 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with kolmogorov smirnov levene s and post hoc tukey s tests p 0 05 were used to examine differences in the isotopic compositions of different water sources as well as differences in the δ2h offsets among three sites two way anova was performed to detect the significant effects of both sampling sites and dates on the δ2h offsets and the differences of proportional contributions of water sources among seven types of input data the above statistical analysis was performed in the spss software 22 0 inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the total precipitation was 399 mm during the observation period in 2019 fig 3 there were pronounced differences in seasonal variations of precipitation p 0 01 the accumulated monthly precipitation during april to november was 18 4 25 8 19 5 133 7 89 1 79 1 32 9 and 0 6 mm respectively monthly mean vpd was 0 9 1 4 1 4 1 2 1 0 0 8 0 5 and 0 3 kpa from april to november respectively with mean of 1 0 kpa and standard deviation sd of 0 5 kpa fig 3 the wtd was significantly different among sites a 20 5 0 5 m b 1 9 0 3 m and c 1 5 0 1 m p 0 05 fig 3 the increase of wtd was observed at sites a from 20 0 to 21 2 m and b from 1 7 to 2 5 m during the wet season whereas wtd was relatively stable at site c the depth distribution and seasonal variation in swc exhibited significant differences among the three sites p 0 05 the average swc in the 0 30 cm layer was larger at site a mean of 0 16 g g 1 and sd of 0 03 g g 1 than that at site b mean of 0 09 g g 1 and sd of 0 02 g g 1 and site c mean of 0 09 g g 1 and sd of 0 03 g g 1 fig 4 however the swc in the 80 300 cm layer was largest mean of 0 25 g g 1 at site c following by that at site b mean of 0 21 g g 1 and smallest at site a mean of 0 20 g g 1 fig 4 there was an evident decline of swc in the 0 150 cm layer during may to august at sites a and b but not at site c 3 2 isotopic compositions of different water bodies the isotopic values of precipitation ranged from 68 3 to 26 0 for δ2h and 13 9 to 6 3 for δ18o fig 5 the lmwl fitted by the isotopic compositions of precipitation was established as δ2h 5 5δ18o 7 9 r 2 0 81 during the observation period in 2019 groundwater gradually enriched from site a mean of 71 1 for δ2h and 10 2 for δ18o to site b mean of 55 7 for δ2h and 6 9 for δ18o and site c mean of 51 1 for δ2h and 6 4 for δ18o fig 5 the isotopic compositions of groundwater were more depleted than those of river water at site a p 0 001 fig 5 nevertheless no significant difference was found in seasonal variations of isotopic values between groundwater and river water at sites b and c during the observation period p 0 05 soil water isotopes at different depths ranged from 86 6 to 45 6 for δ2h and from 14 1 to 3 2 for δ18o at the three sites fig 5 they were enriched in the 0 30 cm soil layer but depleted with depth within the 0 300 cm profile at site a it was evident that soil water isotopes in the 150 300 cm layer at sites b and c were evidently affected by groundwater being more enriched than those in the 80 150 cm layer fig 5 the δ2h in stem water was more depleted than that of potential water sources and fell to the lower right of the pwl at sites b and c in the dual isotopes plots fig 5 nevertheless the δ18o in stem water was always within the range of that in groundwater and soil water suggesting that groundwater was an important water source for riparian trees at sites b and c as river water and groundwater interacted closely and had similar isotopic characteristics they could be pooled together as one potential water source for riparian trees at these two sites on the contrary the δ18o in stem water mean of 7 4 was remarkably enriched than that of groundwater mean of 10 2 and more depleted than that of river water mean of 6 9 at site a trees could not take up groundwater under the deep wtd mean of 20 5 m therefore neither groundwater nor river water was considered as water sources for riparian trees at site a 3 3 δ2h offsets of stem water the pwl and swl for sites a pwl was the same as swl b and c during the observation period were fitted with r2 0 66 p 0 001 in fig 5 the slope of swl and pwl indicated the evaporation degree of soil water sources and potential water sources respectively on average the swl had a slope of 6 4 4 2 and 4 8 at site a b and c respectively in comparison the slopes of pwl at site b mean of 4 5 and site c mean of 5 3 were larger than those of swl which indicated that the evaporation degree of potential water sources was smaller than that of soil water sources additionally evaporation of both soil water and potential sources were strongest at site b among the three sites the δ2h offset of stem water from its potential water sources was calculated by the pw excess and sw excess fig 6 the mean sw excess value during the observation period was 4 7 5 1 and 8 0 for site a b and c respectively the pw excess values mean of 8 5 were significantly lower than sw excess values mean of 6 5 over the observation period at sites b and c p 0 05 there were pronounced seasonal differences in the δ2h offset characteristics among the three sites p 0 001 fig 6 the average value of pw excess same as sw excess for site a remained stable with sd of 0 8 during the observation period the average value of pw excess varied greatly ranging from 13 7 to 1 7 among the six sampling campaigns during the observation period at sites b and c fig 6 extremely significant δ2h offset of stem water occurred on may 5 june 14 and july 26 p 0 01 3 4 comparison of water use patterns determined by different input data the proportional contributions of different potential water sources to riparian trees estimated by mixsiar model with seven types of input data were shown in fig 7 and table 2 when using dual isotopes method with δ2h in stem water corrected by pwl the average contributions of soil water in the 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm layers and groundwater were 22 4 18 3 14 1 16 7 and 28 5 respectively table 2 there were significant differences in proportional contributions of soil water sources below 80 cm 29 0 76 4 among seven types of input data p 0 05 especially when δ2h offset was pronounced for example those average contributions estimated using single uncorrected δ2h mean of 41 4 and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h mean of 36 9 were lower than those estimated by single δ18o mean of 62 2 dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h mean of 62 7 and dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h mean of 63 6 the differences were also observed in the contribution of groundwater among seven types of input data during the whole growing season p 0 05 for instance groundwater contributed a little to trees estimated using single uncorrected δ2h mean of 12 9 and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h and δ18o mean of 12 9 whereas it contributed more using single δ18o mean of 27 4 single δ2h corrected by pwl mean of 30 6 and dual isotopes with δ18o and pwl corrected δ2h mean of 29 5 table 2 additionally the pwl correction method estimated a higher contribution of groundwater mean of 29 5 than that mean of 24 5 estimated by the swl correction method table 2 there were significant differences in seasonal water uptake patterns for riparian trees among different types of input data p 0 05 fig 7 and table 2 the results calculated by dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h showed that riparian trees mainly used water from soils below 150 cm on may 5 june 14 july 26 and august 15 with contributions greater than 54 6 then the main water uptake depth changed to the 0 150 cm layer on september 26 and november 5 with the contributions more than 60 5 however the main water uptake depth estimated by single and dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h was in the 0 150 cm layer during the entire observation period with average contribution of 72 3 fig 7 and table 2 the proportional contribution of soil water in the 0 30 cm layer to stem water of trees during wet season june to august differed greatly among seven types of input data it contributed more estimated using dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h with mean of 25 8 whereas the average contributions were 18 4 20 2 and 19 6 calculated by single uncorrected δ2h single δ2h corrected by swl and pwl respectively the absolute from 8 6 to 10 6 and relative from 29 9 to 64 7 differences in the contributions of tree water sources were evident on several sampling campaigns especially at sites b and c between the single δ18o and dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h methods fig 7 and table s1 for example the single δ18o method overestimated the contributions of soil water in the 30 80 cm layer by 64 2 on aug 15 while it underestimated groundwater contributions by 26 1 on september 26 at site b relative to the dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method 3 5 best input isotope data for identifying riparian tree water sources the aic and bic values that reflected the relationship between source contributions to stem water and environmental variables for selecting the preferred input data were shown in table 3 without consideration of the δ2h offset both single δ2h and dual isotopes methods displayed the largest aic 101 7 and bic 101 7 table 3 it was worth noting that the single δ18o method showed lower aic 94 9 and bic values 92 6 on the contrary when δ2h in stem water was corrected by pwl dual isotopes method produced smaller aic 94 1 and bic 91 9 than single pwl corrected δ2h aic of 98 0 and bic of 95 8 and single δ18o aic of 94 9 and bic of 92 6 the estimations of plant water sources with corrected isotopes displayed significantly smaller aic and bic values than those with uncorrected isotopes p 0 05 for instance the average single corrected δ2h produced a lower aic 97 1 and bic 94 9 than single uncorrected δ2h aic of 101 7 and bic of 99 5 moreover the dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h figured out larger aic 97 6 and bic 95 4 values than that with pwl corrected δ2h this suggested that dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h had better performance than that with swl corrected δ2h the rmse values for explaining the deviation of the source contributions estimated by one type of input data from the average source contributions of different input data were shown in table 3 rmse value was remarkably smaller when using dual isotopes than that using single isotope p 0 05 table 3 whether δ2h offset was corrected or not for example rmse value was 12 4 when using single uncorrected δ2h whereas it was 9 5 when using dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h the water source contribution estimations with corrected isotopes displayed significantly smaller rmse values mean of 5 1 than those with uncorrected isotopes mean of 9 6 p 0 05 furthermore the dual isotopes method with swl corrected δ2h had significant higher rmse values than the dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h p 0 05 overall our results suggested that the dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h performed best in identifying water uptake patterns 4 discussion 4 1 possible reasons for isotopic offsets of stem water spatial and seasonal disparities of pw excess values suggested that δ2h offsets of stem water differed greatly during the observation period among the three sites fig 6 a δ2h offset could be attributed to methodological issues reported by orlowski et al 2018 however water extraction of soil and stem samples via automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system was well conducted and yielded a collection rate more than 98 in this study contamination of extracted water by organic compounds was also routinely dealt with custom and post measurement corrections these techniques extremely avoided the fractionation processes occurring during water extraction another possibility for explaining the δ2h offset is the isotopic heterogeneity in plant water pools aroused by discrimination during water transport and redistribution within the plant zhao et al 2016 barbeta et al 2020 the δ2h offset would be decreased or even reversed under drier conditions as a result of evaporative enrichment barbeta et al 2020 these studies indicated that there were no δ2h fractionation and offset occurring during root water uptake however δ2h offsets were more noticeable under drier conditions in our study e g much lower pw excess values occurring on may 5 at sites b and c it was impossible to be completely ascribed to the evaporative enrichment in plant water pools the δ2h offset of stem water probably occurred in the soil root interfaces by root water uptake allison et al 1983 vargas et al 2017 it was found that large δ2h offset was synchronized to low swc in the 0 150 cm layer and the decline of water table from may to june fig 4 more interestingly δ2h offset progressively decreased as swc in the 0 150 cm layer increased with increasing precipitation amount and rising water table this might be due to that pore spaces between soil grains and roots increased with the soil water loss under the increase of wtd which resulted in stronger δ2h fractionation during root water uptake barnes and allison 1983 vargas et al 2017 moreover the δ2h offsets at high ssc sites mean ssc of 80 7 for site b and 90 8 for site c were significantly larger than those at low ssc site mean ssc of 33 4 for site a table 1 and fig 6 it has been reported that δ2h fractionation was controlled by variable diffusive resistance of soil vapors which was indicated by air filled porosity and the tortuosity of the soil barnes and allison 1988 therefore the high ssc could increase the pore spaces barnes and allison 1983 vargas et al 2017 and possibilities of roots contacting with air during root water uptake which could lead to δ2h offset evaristo et al 2017 geris et al 2017 previous studies found that soil clay content and or carbonate content could result in δ18o fractionation of water added to soil particularly under low soil water content leading to conflicting results in quantification of root water uptake meiβner et al 2014 yang et al 2015 the bias of δ18o might be caused by oxygen isotope exchanges between soil water and carbonates during the water extraction process the adsorbed cation isotope effects in mineral water interface were also examined in greenhouse experiments by oerter et al 2014 however if soil water with depleted δ18o values was taken up by roots stem water should be depleted in both isotopes but not only in δ2h barbeta et al 2019 the stem δ18o matched those of source water during the growing season of riparian trees and no δ18o offset was observed in our study fig 5 lin and sternberg 1993 and ellsworth and williams 2007 reported that passage of water through simplistic pathway led to δ2h fractionation in soil root interface but no δ18o fractionation was observed during root water uptake transfer and transport within the plant zhao et al 2016 and a few laboratory experiments confirmed this finding vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 quite a few studies presented notable isotopic offsets for δ2h rather than for δ18o zhao et al 2016 evaristo et al 2017 barbeta et al 2020 it is mainly due to that the reversible diffusion of water through the ultrafiltration membrance from the external medium to the root xylem discriminates against 2h about 10 times more than 18o during water uptake lin and sternberg 1993 vargas et al 2017 nevertheless the bias of δ18o and corresponding reasons need further investigations 4 2 correction of δ2h offset for identifications of plant water sources by means of comparing aic bic and rmse during the observation period at the three sites the mixsiar model outputs with uncorrected δ2h displayed higher aic bic and rmse values than those with corrected δ2h figs 6 and 7 this indicated that δ2h offsets in stem water greatly affected plant water source contributions estimated using either single or dual isotopes method generally δ2h offsets lead to underestimation of proportional contributions of deep water sources using uncorrected δ2h evaristo et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 barbeta et al 2019 found that dual isotopes approach with swl corrected δ2h estimated 1 5 times of the groundwater contribution to stem water than dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h our study showed that dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h underestimated groundwater contribution by 56 3 at shallow wtd sites compared to dual isotopes method with corrected δ2h fig 7 moreover soil water contribution in the 0 30 cm layer was underestimated by 30 4 at deep wtd site where groundwater could not be used by plants fig 7 it was evident that the effects of δ2h offsets on quantifying plant water sources were remarkably different among the three sites with various wtds identifying plant water sources should primarily check δ2h offsets especially under the conditions of high ssc and variable wtd fluctuations the mixsiar model outputs using single δ18o displayed lower aic bic and rmse values than those using dual isotopes with uncorrected δ2h table 3 this suggested that single δ18o performed better than dual isotopes method with uncorrected δ2h in the attribution of plant water sources when there were notable δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources goebel et al 2015 evaristo et al 2017 vargas et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 however the mixsiar model outputs estimated using single δ18o were greatly different with those estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method on several sampling campaigns especially at sites b and c fig 7 and table s1 the differences would be enlarged with the increase of δ2h offsets as indicated by barbeta et al 2019 it was evident that the single δ18o method showed larger uncertainties rmse of 7 0 for plant source water identifications over the observation period than the dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method rmse of 4 8 moreover the single δ18o method could lead to erroneous interpretations when root water uptake took place simultaneously from several zones while dual isotopes method might provide information that was not apparent in the single isotope method evaristo et al 2017 furthermore the source contributions estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method had closer correlations with the environmental variables indicating by lower aic and bic values table 3 that is when the isotopic offsets were corrected and the isotopes in stem water did not deviated from their corresponding water sources the mixsiar model with dual isotopes was more accurate to identify water sources than that with single δ18o isotope parnell et al 2010 also reported that increasing the number of isotopes without δ2h offsets could improve the predictive accuracy of the bayesian model when the number of sources e g five water sources for trees in this study were more than that of tracer isotopes therefore it is essential to propose a correction method to correct the δ2h offsets rather than just use δ18o for plant water source identifications the mixsiar model outputs estimated using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h method displayed lower aic bic and rmse values than those using dual isotopes with swl corrected δ2h method table 3 it suggested that dual isotopes method with pwl corrected δ2h performed better in plant water source estimations than that with swl corrected δ2h the reason was probably due to that groundwater was a crucial and independent water source for s babylonica growing in areas with shallow wtd low precipitation and shallow groundwater with abundant dissolved oxygen and nutrients during the growing season of s babylonica could stimulate deep roots to tap into capillary fringe or even water tables to take up groundwater directly to meet the water requirement yu et al 2017 therefore both groundwater and soil water should be in consideration of correcting stem water δ2h offsets especially for phreatophytes in shallow wtd areas the pwl correction method was more accurate and avoided an underestimation of groundwater contribution mean of 5 0 in comparison to the swl correction method in summary of previous and our results we propose four distinct types of δ2h offsets and the corresponding correction methods based on different wtds and groundwater recharge sources for riparian trees fig 8 there is one thing in common among these four types the contributions of plant water sources estimated using δ2h are not in agreement with those estimated using δ18o due to stem water δ2h offsets barbeta et al 2020 on the one hand when groundwater recharge mainly comes from precipitation the isotopic composition of groundwater is generally more depleted than that of soil water at different layers fig 8a and b δ2h offset characteristics depends on whether δ18o in stem water is within the range of that in groundwater or not for instance when groundwater cannot be taken up by plants under deep wtd conditions δ18o in stem water is not within the range of that in groundwater as observed in previous studies brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2017 and at site a in this study fig 8a consequently groundwater will not be considered to correct δ2h offset in case that groundwater serves as an important water source for riparian trees in shallow wtd areas oerter and bowen 2019 both groundwater and soil water should be taken into consideration to correct δ2h offset i e pwl correction method fig 8b on the other hand groundwater is principally recharged by seepage of surface water which may lead to more enriched isotopic composition of groundwater compared to the depleted soil water in deep layers fig 8c and d if δ18o in stem water is within the range of that in groundwater such as at sites b and c in our study and in other field studies bowling et al 2017 barbeta et al 2019 groundwater should be considered to correct δ2h offset fig 8d otherwise when δ18o in stem water is not within the range of that in groundwater fig 8c groundwater is not included in one of the water sources to correct δ2h offset therefore the proposed pwl correction method in this study considers all potential water sources and can be applied to quantify root water uptake under different types of δ2h offsets of stem water 4 3 implications riparian trees perennially or seasonally depended on groundwater in the arid and semi arid climate regions fan 2015 contreras et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 or mediterranean climate region dawson and pate 1996 there could be an underestimation of groundwater contributions when using uncorrected δ2h due to δ2h offset which could be resolved by the developed pwl correction method in this study when groundwater served as a crucial water source the pwl correction method performed better than both the swl correction method and non correction method in identifications of plant water sources it was evident that mixsiar model using dual isotopes with pwl corrected δ2h estimated more accurate proportional contributions of groundwater in this study only possible reasons for δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential sources was deducted by indirect evidences the mechanisms of δ2h offsets requires further investigation by collecting different plant water pools from roots xylem sap as well as stem tissues under various soil texture and water table conditions the potential water sources might not be confined to soil water and groundwater in some regions they also included other sources such as rock moisture fog water and dew water wang et al 2017a 2019b only when all potential water sources were considered to fit the correction line the mixsiar model with pwl corrected input data could obtain more accurate estimations of plant water sources contributions the pwl correction method was evaluated for determining riparian tree water sources only considering soil water and groundwater sources in this study it requires further validation using more cases in consideration of other water sources including rock moisture fog water and dew water the pwl correction method provides insights into determining accurate root water uptake patterns even if δ2h offset exists it further contributes to understanding the relationship between plants and water such as partitioning evapotranspiration fluxes into transpiration and evaporation wang et al 2010 water competition among different plant species wang et al 2017b species abilities to respond to variable hydrological conditions wu et al 2019b or even the parameterization of ecohydrological models at both plot and catchment scales miller et al 2012 beyer et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the pwl correction method was proposed to correct the δ2h offsets of stem water from its potential water sources the mixsiar model coupled with dual stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o were used to determine seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of riparian trees s babylonica at three sites in 2019 along the jian and chaobai river in beijing china when using dual isotopes method with δ2h in stem water corrected by the pwl the average contributions of soil water in the 0 30 30 80 80 150 150 300 cm layers and groundwater were 22 4 18 3 14 1 16 7 and 28 5 respectively riparian trees mainly used soil water below 150 cm depth on may 5 june 14 july 26 and august 15 with contributions greater than 54 6 then the main root water uptake depth returned to the 0 150 cm layer on september 26 and november 5 with contributions more than 60 5 different types of input data led to considerable differences in the contributions of soil water in the 0 30 cm layer 9 9 57 6 and water sources below the depth of 80 cm 29 0 76 4 especially when δ2h offset was pronounced the mixsiar model with dual isotopes method was more accurate to identify plant water sources than that with single isotope method the best performance of pwl correction method was underlined compared to swl correction and non correction methods when groundwater was accessible for plants furthermore four distinct types of δ2h offsets in riparian zone and their correspondingly suitable correction methods have been summarized this study provides crucial insights into exploring accurate root water uptake patterns to account for δ2h offset of stem water credit
