rhamnolipid rhl biosurfactant in a stirred cell for removal of cd 2 and crystal violet cv simultaneously from aqueous solution the influence of various operating conditions on the transient profiles of permeate flux and observed rejections were investigated experimental results revealed that for the treatment of aqueous feed under optimal conditions rhl 1730 10 3 kg m 3 cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 cv 15

with more than 98 0 1 rejections of both the pollutants cd 2 and cv and minimum surfactant loss 3 to the permeate the rapid decline in permeate flux at the earlier stage of filtration was attributed to adsorption pore blocking followed by gradual decline at the later stage due to the growth of a cake layer of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface the transition of fouling mechanism occurred in the range of 200 390 s depending on the operating conditions a combined model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s constant pressure cake filtration model was developed to analyze the profiles of flux decline and observed rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl the predicted results showed a good agreement with the experimental data the developed model was

effluents 1 which are characterized with high values of chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds color and salinity etc 2 crystal violet a basic dye is often used in the manufacture of paints and printing inks and also in the textile industries for dyeing of cotton and silk in countries such as india and china 3 4 the major environmental problem associated with the use of dyes is their significant lose about 10 15 during processing operations the use of various cadmium salts cds cdseo3 and cdcl2 etc in dyeing and printing textiles are considered to be potential source of cadmium in textile effluents 5 during the application of basic dyes on wool the concentration of cd 2 in dyeing wastewater is found to 7 5 mg l 6 as a consequence they can be found simultaneously in the effluents discharged by these industries due to high cost of effluent treatment small scale industries discharge the hazardous effluent directly to the surface water also the rapid industrialization poor waste management and improper waste disposal techniques particularly in developing countries also cause the mixing of effluents of different industries resulting in presence of toxic heavy metal ions and dyes in wastewaters both cd 2 and cv are non biodegradable highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature even at low concentration and responsible for skin diseases and digestive problems 3 7 they may also lead to failure of kidney and respiratory system at the extreme cases also presence of small amount of dye produces a lot of color that affects the water transparency according to bureau of indian standards bis 3306 1955 the discharge limit into the public sewage is considered to be colorless in compliance with the stringent environmental regulations it is warranted to find an effective method to simultaneously remove these co pollutants from the aqueous waste before being discharged into the environment therefore the study on the removal of both these pollutants from wastewaters is of great importance so far various techniques such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange electrochemical and reverse osmosis etc have been attempted for the treatment of wastewaters polluted by both dyes and heavy metal ions 8 12 however at a large scale these techniques are not effective particularly at low pollutant concentration in this connection micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf a surfactant based separation process has been considered as a promising separation technique for simultaneous removal of toxic heavy metal ions and organic compounds at low concentration level from aqueous streams in single multi component systems 1 13 20 this method combines the high process throughput permeate flux of ultrafiltration and the high selectivity of reverse osmosis 15 in meuf process surfactant is added into the contaminated water to a concentration higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc resulting in formation of large amphiphilic surfactant aggregates namely micelles organic pollutants tend to be solubilized in the hydrophobic core of the micelles via hydrophobic interactions while the heavy metal ions are adsorbed on the oppositely charged surface of the micelles via electrostatic interaction then these micelles along with trapped pollutants are separated from the aqueous stream via an ultrafiltration membrane with appropriate pore size most of the pollutant micelle complexes remain in the retentate stream and thus the concentration of contaminants in permeate stream is much lower than that in feed stream to date most of the previous meuf studies reported are based on various ionic and or non ionic synthetic surfactants however due to high cmc value the applications of synthetic surfactant in meuf causes a long term risk of secondary contamination due to leakage of surfactant with the permeate stream recently biosurfactants have attracted attention of many researchers and have become more effective over synthetic surfactants because of their biodegradability low cmc value non toxic nature ecological acceptability and renewable production sources etc 21 the idea of using biosurfactant has been demonstrated and applied in the meuf processes for removal of single multi component heavy metal ions alone or simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants from aqueous environment 22 23 recently meuf process using chemical surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate has been applied for removing ionic dyes and cd 2 from wastewaters 1 24 26 however to our knowledge there is no prior report on meuf using biosurfactant for simultaneous removal of dyes and cd 2 from aqueous stream in this paper we report the simultaneous removal of crystal violet cv and heavy metal ion cd 2 from aqueous solution by meuf process using rhamnolipid rhl biosurfactant the major problem associated in any meuf process was the flux decline caused by membrane fouling modeling the flux decline during meuf provides better understanding on membrane fouling and can serve as a predictive tool for performance analysis selection of best operating conditions and scale up several models are available today in the literature to analyze the flux decline with time during meuf process such as i the gel polarization model 27 ii the resistance in series model 28 iii hermia s model 29 etc jadhav et al 30 have developed a mathematical model to explain the removal of phenol and aniline by meuf and predict permeate concentrations chhatre and marathe 31 have evaluated the performance of sds based meuf for removing ni ii ions from aqueous stream using the combination of equilibrium model mass transfer model and resistance in series model the model has been extended to the prediction of permeate flux during meuf of binary mixture of cu 2 and ca 2 by das et al 32 apart from these models combined model has been successfully used for explaining flux decline behavior in many ultrafiltration microfiltration studies 33 34 although the earlier developed combined models have proven beneficial in some applications to our best knowledge the use of combined model in meuf studies has not been reported so far it is worthy to mention that the developed combined model assumes that the cake foulant is incompressible in nature however in the present study experimental results show an increasing trend of permeate flux with increasing operating pressure indicating the compressible nature of deposited layer thus existing combined models are restrictive and cannot be employed for meuf treatment of dye heavy metal ion containing wastewater in view of this an attempt has been made to develop a combined model based on the models available in the literature for simultaneous prediction of permeate flux and permeate concentrations during meuf of wastewater containing both dye and heavy metal ions the aims of this work were i to assess the performance of meuf using rhl in stirred dead end filtration for simultaneous removal of dye and cd 2 from aqueous stream at different nacl concentrations transmembrane pressures stirrer speeds temperatures and feed surfactant concentrations ii to develop a resistance in series model coupled with hermia s cake filtration model taking into account the transition of fouling mechanisms from pore blockage adsorption to cake filtration and to compare the predicted results with the experimental profiles of flux decline and retention of cv and cd 2 as a function of time for different operating conditions iii to observe the effects of operating conditions on the evolution of various fouling resistances and the transition time of fouling mechanism 2 theory dead end meuf experiments were carried out in a stirred stainless steel batch cell m s pmi india ltd india at a constant transmembrane pressure the aqueous solution containing rhl cv cd 2 and electrolyte nacl was charged into the cell and pressure was delivered from a cylinder of nitrogen gas rhl vesicles containing solubilized cd 2 and cv with sizes larger than the membrane pore size were rejected effectively by the ultrafiltration membrane resulting in simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv it was assumed that the solute either rhl monomer or unsolubilized cv cd 2 freely passed through the membrane with the permeate the observed rejection r o s for any solute rhl cd 2 cv was calculated as 1 r o s 1 c p s c r s where c p s and c r s are the concentrations of the solute in permeate and retentate respectively at higher operating pressure it appeared that some pollutant rhl vesicle complexes were forced to pass through the membrane the rejection of rhl vesicles was defined as 2 r v 1 c p v c r v where cp v and cr v are the concentrations of the rhl vesicles in permeate and retentate respectively thus the concentration of solute rhl cd 2 cv in the permeate could be written in terms of rv as 3 c p s c p f s 1 r v c r s c p f s where c p f s was the concentration of either rhl monomers or unsolubilized cv cd 2 in aqueous phase the solute rhl cv cd 2 mass balance in the retentate resulted the variation of solute concentration in the retentate with time as 4 v r d c r s dt v w a c r s c p s where v w 1 a v p δ t s vp was the volume of permeate collected δts was the sampling time a was the effective membrane area and v r was the retentate volume assuming equal densities of permeate and retentate the overall material balance in the cell gave 5 d v r dt v w a using eqs 3 and 4 could be written in terms of rejection of rhl vesicles as 6 v r d c r s dt v w a r v c r s c p f s it was further assumed that there was no variation in the rejection of rhl vesicles with time the concentration of rhl in aqueous phase was assumed to be constant at its cmc value c p f rhl cmc on the other hand the concentration of pollutants cv cd 2 in aqueous phase could be expressed in terms of rhl vesicle binding constant k rhl cv c d 2 as 7 c p f cv c d 2 c r cv c d 2 1 k rhl cv c d 2 c r rhl cmc the rhl vesicle binding constant was defined as 14 8 k rhl cv c d 2 c v cv c d 2 c v rhl c p f cv c d 2 where c v cv c d 2 c v rhl were the concentration of pollutant cv cd 2 and rhl in the vesicle phase respectively the binding constant indicated the relative affinity of pollutants for rhl vesicles which was found to be depended upon the concentration of surfactant and pollutants in the feed 35 using eqs 7 and 6 could be written as 9 v r d c r rhl dt v w a r v c r rhl cmc for rhl 10 v r d c r c d 2 dt v w a r v c r c d 2 c r c d 2 1 k

membrane fouling was assumed to be started with adsorption of solutes and pore blocking followed by cake layer formation by the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates over the membrane surface in the present study resistance in series model coupled with hermia s cake filtration model was used to explain the flux decline behavior for the entire duration of experiment the resistance in series model considered both fouling mechanisms as well as it accounted the resistance due to adsorption pore blockage up to transition time t1 and the resistance caused by the cake layer formation beyond t1 2 1 flux decline for stage 1 t t 1 the initial flux decline t t 1 was due to membrane fouling which was assumed to be started with the adsorption of cd 2 cv rhl aggregates onto the surface and the membrane pore blocking the time variation of permeate flux was expressed using the phenomenological equation as 36 12 v w δp μ r m r f where rm was the membrane hydraulic resistance rf was the fouling resistance caused by the adsorption of cv and cd 2 ions on membrane surface and inside its pores and pore blocking of cd 2 cv rhl aggregates experimental results revealed that the rejection of nacl by the membrane used in this study was almost insignificant less than 6 due to smaller size of the ions compared to the membrane pore size confirming the presence of high content of nacl in the permeate stream measured by conductivity thus using the van t hoff equation the osmotic pressure was estimated as 15 20 kpa which was about 2 5 of the operating pressures studied therefore the effect of osmotic pressure was not considered in the development of model in presence of stirring the fouling resistance increased with time but at a decreasing rate reaching a maximum value at the transition time onset of cake formation thus the rate of growth of adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance rf could be expressed as 37 13 r f r fm 1 exp k 1 t where k1 was the kinetic parameter indicating the growth rate of adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance rfm was its maximum fouling resistance and t was operation time therefore eq 12 could be rewritten as 14 v w v w o 1 r fm 1 exp k 1 t where v w o δp μ r m and r fm r fm r m 2 2 flux decline for stage 2 t t1 it was assumed that formation of cake layer started after completion of solute adsorption and pore blocking hermia s cake filtration model for dead end filtration was coupled with resistance in series model it should be noted in this regard that although hermia s model is based on classical constant pressure unstirred dead end filtration this model has been successfully used to explain flux decline behavior during stirred dead end filtration 29 38 as well as cross flow experiments 39 40 using hermia s cake filtration model 41 the rate of flux decline could be written as follows 15 d v w dt k c v w 3 hence at t t 1 the permeate flux could be written in terms of resistance as 16 v w δp μ r m r f t 1 r c t t 1 where rc was the resistance due to cake layer formation on the membrane surface by the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates eq 16 could also be written as 17 v w v w t 1 1 r c where v w t 1 v w o 1 r f r c r c 1 r f r c r c r m and r f r f r m equating eq 15 with the derivative of eq 17 with respect to t resulted the following as 18 d r c dt k c v w t 1 2 1 r c the integration of eq 18 with the initial condition at t t1 rc 0 led to the expression of cake layer resistance as 19 r c t 1 r f 1 2 k c v w t 1 2 t t 1 1 2 1 2 3 expression of time for onset of cake layer formation it was assumed that the permeate flux values and its time derivatives were continuous at time t1 since the fouling mechanism changed from adsorption pore blocking to cake layer formation at time t1 thus the continuity of slope of permeate flux versus time curve at t t1 was obtained as follows 20 d v w dt t t δ d v w dt t t δ at t t1 and δ 0 in the regime t t1 the following equation was obtained from eq 14 21 d v w dt t t 1 v w o r fm k 1 exp k 1 t 1 1 r fm 1 exp k 1 t 1 2 at t t1 and δ 0 in the regime t t1 the following equation was obtained from eq 15 22 d v w dt t t 1 k c v w 3 t t 1 after equating eqs 21 and 22 followed by rearrangement the expression of time for onset of cake formation t1 was obtained as 23 t 1 cal 1 k 1 ln 2 1 p 1 p 2 4 p 2 q 1 2 where p r m r fm and q k 1 k c v w o 2 2 4 estimation of model parameters the six model parameters namely rfm k1 kc k rhl cv k rhl c d 2 and rv were estimated through an optimization method and by minimizing the sum of square errors between the calculated and experimental data of permeate flux and permeate concentration using the values of optimized model parameters the performance of the meuf experiments was predicted 1 from the knowledge of pure water permeate flux hydraulic membrane resistance was calculated for a particular experiment the values of operating pressure stirrer speed initial feed volume and initial concentration of rhl cv and cd 2 in feed were known the values of rfm k1 and kc were initially guessed for that particular set of operating conditions then the value of transition time t1 was calculated from eq 23 2 next the values of rv k rhl cv and k rhl c d 2 were guessed experimental determination of vesicle binding constant did not show any significant deviation with the variation of transmembrane pressure stirrer speed and feed temperature thus the model assumed that k rhl cv c d 2 was independent of operating conditions and operation time for the prediction of permeate flux and the solute concentration in permeate and retentate for first guess the value of k rhl cv c d 2 was chosen which was obtained by using experimental data of permeate concentration and retentate concentration for stage 1 t t1 the permeate flux values v w retentate volume retentate concentration and permeate concentration at various operation time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations eqs 5

flux retentate volume retentate concentration and permeate concentration at various operation time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations eqs 5 9 10 11 14 17 and 19 using matlab with the initial condition at t t1 r c 0 6 the time t was increased to t δt next 7 step 5 was repeated till t tt 8 the sum of square errors between calculated and experimental values of permeate flux and permeate concentration were calculated for the entire duration of experiment sum of square errors was defined as e i 1 n v w i exp v w i cal v w i exp 2 i 1 n c p i rhl exp c p i

10 3 the program was terminated the corresponding values of rfm k1 kc k rhl cv k rhl c d 2 and rv were recorded if not another set of values of parameters were guessed in step 1 and 2 and process was continued till the given convergence was achieved thus the transient profiles of permeate flux retentate volume solute concentration in retentate and permeate were obtained the model was validated by comparing the calculated values of permeate flux and permeate concentrations with those observed during experiments the results obtained were discussed in the results and discussion sections 3

previously for simultaneous maximization of rejections of both cd 2 and cv using response surface methodology 42 in our previous study a full factorial central composite design was employed with rhl

of rhl and nacl on the permeate flux and solute rejections the summary of selected operating conditions of experiments were presented in table 1 the synthetic solution was prepared by adding pre determined amount of cd no3 2 4h2o cv and nacl into the distilled water followed by addition of pre determined amount rhl surfactant into the wastewater the ph of the feed solution was adjusted to desired ph value of 7 8 by adding 0 1 n naoh or 0 1 n hcl then the solution was gently stirred with magnetic stirrer for 1 h to ensure uniform solute dispersion and then allowed to keep at room

india permeate was continuously collected from bottom of the cell the schematic diagram of the experimental set up was described in detail elsewhere 23 cumulative volume of permeate as a function of time was measured the permeate flux was obtained from the slop of the cumulative volume time plot using the membrane area the experiments were stopped at the desired volume concentration ratio vcr which implied removal of desired percentage feed as permeate vcr was a measure of the ratio of initial feed volume to the retentate volume at any point of time all the meuf experiments were carried out in triplicate the experimental data with error bars were reported in the corresponding figures prior to meuf experiment the fresh membrane was compacted at 690 kpa for 90 min using double distilled water and permeate flux values were measured at different transmembrane pressures 276 345 414 and 690 kpa the pure water permeability of the membrane was obtained from the slope of permeate flux versus transmembrane pressure as 6 2 0 2 x10 11 m pa 1 s 1 3 3 membrane cleaning protocol after each meuf experiment the cell was dismantled and the membrane was first cleaned with distilled

aqueous naoh solution for 20 min ph 10 0 and iv finally membrane was washed with distilled water then the cell was reassembled and the membrane permeability was checked using distilled water after this the membrane was ready for the next experiment with freshly prepared feed thus thorough membrane cleaning resulted the recovery of the pure water permeability within 96 of the new membrane permeability thereby maintaining the integrity of the membrane 3 4 experimental analysis the mean sizes hydrodynamic diameter dp av of rhl aggregates in aqueous solution in presence of cd 2 cv and nacl were measured by the dynamic light scattering dls technique using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk at 90 scattering angle and 26 1 c the critical micelle concentrations cmc of rhl in presence of cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 and cv 15 10 3 kg m 3 with varying nacl concentration 0 30 kg m 3 were determined by surface tension measurement in aqueous solution the surface tensions of aqueous surfactant solution was measured based on pendant drop method using drop shape analyzer model dsa 25 e kruss gmbh germany a stock solution of rhl was first prepared in water filtered with 0 45 μm pore size nylon filter at a concentration of 1000 10 3 kg m 3 in presence of desired concentration of cd 2 cv and nacl for surface tension measurement samples were prepared by serial dilution of stock solution at a concentration range 5 500 x10 3 kg m 3 of rhl keeping the concentration of cd 2 cv and nacl unaltered the temperature and solution ph were kept at 26 1 ºc and 7 8 respectively all the measurements were performed in triplicate and their average values were used the cmc value was determined from the intersection point of two tangents of the surface tension isotherm which was a plot of equilibrium surface tension versus logarithm of rhl concentration graph not shown here the morphological characterization of the membrane before and after the experiments was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss evo 18 uk the membranes were dried in room temperature and cut into pieces of desired sizes as the polymeric membranes were non conductive membrane samples were coated with a very thin layer of gold in a vacuum the top surface and cross sectional view of the membranes were observed by sem under very high vacuum at 20 kv in 1 2 2 5 kx magnifications the concentrations of cd 2 cv and rhl in feed permeate and retentate samples were analyzed for estimation of observed retentions the concentration of cadmium ion was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer electronics corporation of india ltd india at 228 8 nm the concentration of cv was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer u2900 hitachi japan at 589 nm rhamnolipid concentration was determined by the colorimetric determination of sugars with anthrone sulfate method 43 the solution ph was measured using a ph meter mettler toledo conductivity was measured by autoranging conductivity meter toshniwal instrument india 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of nacl on cmc and mean aggregate size the cmc of rhl in presence of cd 2 and cv was found to be 60 1 x10 3 kg m 3 the concentration of nacl in solution showed significant effect on the cmc value of rhl an increase in nacl concentration increased the concentration of free counter ion na around rhl aggregates thereby decreasing the repulsive forces between charged head group of the surfactant aggregates resulting in easier formation of the surfactant aggregates with increase in aggregation number 44 this led to decrease in cmc value for instance in presence of cv and cd 2 the cmc values of rhl were observed as 40 35 30 and 30 10 3 kg m 3 for the nacl concentration of 5 10 20 and 30 kg m 3 respectively keeping other conditions unaltered the obtained values of cmc were consistent with those reported previously 22 44 45 the mean size of rhl aggregates in aqueous solution rhl 1730 10 3 kg m 3 cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 cv 15 10 3 kg m 3 ph 7 8 decreased with the increasing nacl concentration for instance with increase in salt concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 the mean size of rhl aggregates decreased from 23 04 6 6 nm which corresponded to change in morphology from medium vesicles 99 06 to micelles 94 2 the decrease in size of micellar structures in presence of nacl might be caused by the induction of na soft acid into the anionic rhl aggregates soft base resulting in an increase in water solubility of rhl biosurfactant which in turn disfavored the growth of rhl aggregates this observation was in accordance with the results obtained by pornsunthorntawee et al 44 4 2 micellar enhance ultrafiltration 4 2 1 assessment of fouling mechanisms and modeling of permeate flux to evaluate membrane performance it was important to check the existence of single or multiple fouling mechanisms during the filtration process and also to identify the type of fouling mechanism in this way the experimental flux data were initially analyzed using the integral method of field et al 46 according to integral method the various functions of permeate flux vw and blocking index n were plotted against the volume of permeate vp corresponding to individual fouling mechanisms such as complete pore blocking cpb intermediate pore blocking ipb standard pore blocking spb and cake layer formation cf as shown in fig 1 a b as seen in figure that the filtration curve bent at vp of about 5 l m 2 indicating the existence of more than one fouling mechanisms during filtration the inset of fig 1a showed the break point at about 240 s which corresponded to a switch in fouling mechanism thus the integral method suggested that flux decline during meuf did not follow a single fouling mechanism instead fouling likely occurred through a combination of two mechanisms after determining the break point the appropriate fouling mechanisms were identified before and after the break point during meuf the resistance in series model proposed by choi et al 37 and hermia s models for dead end filtration complete blocking intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake layer formation were used to fit the experimental data before the break point t t1 as shown in fig 2 a c resistance in series model of choi et al 37 considered the membrane resistance and adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance the criteria for selection of best model representing the experimental flux data were the magnitudes of the r2 sd and mrpd 23 higher values of r2 and lower values of sd and mrpd indicated better goodness of fit the results showed that the values of r2 sd and mrpd obtained for the hermia s pore blocking models were in the range of 0 921 0 936 1 0 1 09 and 0 641 0 7 3 respectively fig 2 a b the permeate flux data exhibited an excellent compliance with the resistance in series model r2 0 997 sd 0 2 and mrpd 0 12 as shown in fig 2c the obtained results clearly demonstrated that resistance in series model fitted better than all the hermia s blocking models thus resistance in series model was selected as the best model to fit the experimental data before the break point after the break point the experimental flux data yielded excellent fit with the hermia s cake layer formation model r2 0 99 sd 0 47 mrpd 0 364 as shown in fig 2d thus to explain the transient flux decline data over the entire meuf process a combined model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s cake filtration model was developed that used a two stage fouling mechanisms accounting for both adsorption pore blockage and cake layer formation the variation of permeate flux with operation time was shown in fig 3 the symbols represented experimental data while the lines curves 1 2 3 were the model predicted results curve 1 showed the prediction of permeate flux using the combined model developed in this study as clearly observed in fig 3 that there is a transition time t1 in the experimental data indicating a change in fouling mechanism thus the flux decline curve could be divided into two stages with two different fouling mechanisms there was a rapid initial loss of flux at the early stage stage 1 upto t t1 of filtration followed by a gradual continuous loss of flux at the later stage stage 2 t t1 till end of the experiment the rapid loss in permeate flux at stage 1 could be attributed to the adsorption and pore blocking by the rhl pollutant aggrgates on the membrane surface and subsequently increased the fouling resistance the sluggish flux decline at stage 2 could be attributed to the continuous formation and growth of cake type layer 47 due to accumulation of aggregates on the membrane surface with the progress of filtration the sem images of membrane before and after the experiments were shown in fig 4 it is clear from fig 4 that there was a cake type layer deposition on the membrane surface during ultrafiltration as discussed in section 2 the calculation of transition time of fouling mechanism using eq 23 involved the estimation of three parameters rfm k1 and kc by the optimization technique the value of t1 was calculated as 298 s at a fixed transmembrane pressure stirrer speed and feed temperature of 414 kpa 600 rpm and 26 c respectively the model calculated transition time t 1 cal was found to be very close to that of experimentally observed value t 1 exp of 300 s as shown in fig 3 the values of permeate flux post transition time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations as discussed in section 2 it could be noted that the transition time obtained from integral method field et al 46 slightly differed from that obtained from the developed combined model this slight discrepancies in transition time might be due to the fact that integral method was based on hermia s four fouling mechanisms whereas the present combined model considered the initial fouling resistance caused by the adsorption pore blockage thus for the determination of transition time in fouling mechanisms the developed combined model would be very much applicable for the system containing solutes having a tendency of pore blocking as well as adsorption on membrane surface and inside its pores an attempt was also made to analyze the flux decline using single adsorption pore blocking model and hermia s cake filtration model as shown by curves 2 and 3 respectively fig 3 the values of r2 sd and mrpd for the proposed combined model showed a good concordance between calculated values and experimental flux data 23 over the single models table 2 the predictions of permeate flux using combined model were within 0 47 of the experimental flux values compared to 4 using the model of choi et al 37 alone and 6 2 using the hermia s cake filtration model this clearly indicated that neither the adsorption pore blocking mechanism nor the cake layer formation by surfactant aggregates was the stand alone cause for the membrane fouling occurred during ultrafiltration analysis of membrane fouling was carried out by evaluating of the results obtained from the combined model under various operating conditions presented in table 3 the simulated profiles of flux and observed retention were compared with the experimental results figs 4 7 the proposed model provided good fits of experimental results for a wide range of data and yielded accurate predictions of permeate flux and observed solute retention using estimated parameters the predominant fouling mechanisms in the flux decline was determined from the value of normalized fouling coefficient q k 1 k c v w o 2 as shown in table 3 the value of q larger than unity indicated that initial adsorption pore blocking contributed more to the combined model than caking the value q ranged from 97 8 184 4 under the operating conditions tested implying that initial fouling due to adsorption pore blocking contributed more to the combined model than fouling due to cake layer formation it was important to notice that the contribution of the adsorption pore blocking resistance to the total resistance 11 5 35 9 was higher than the contribution of the cake layer resistance 10 8 21 6 however the contribution of the clean membrane intrinsic resistance to the total resistance was always higher than either of the fouling resistance representing about 50 77 of the total resistance under the experimental conditions studied herein the estimated fouling coefficients k1 kc were correlated to four independent variables transmembrane pressure reynolds number temperature and rhl feed concentration using a multiple regression analysis the developed equations at 95 confidence interval p values 0 05 were represented by eqs 24 25 with the value of coefficient of determination r2 24 k 1 1 40x1 0 5 1 t 1 2 δ p 0 96 1 re 0 18 c 0 rhl 0 21 r 2 0 91 25 k c 1 68x1 0 11 1 t 1 244 1 δ p 0 482 1 re 0 375 c 0 rhl 0 195 r 2 0 98 4 2 2 effect of various operating conditions on permeate flux and solute rejections 4 2 2 1 effect of transmembrane pressure fig 5a illustrated the effects of transmembrane pressure on the profiles of flux decline and vcr at constant stirrer speed the symbols represented experimental data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results as seen in fig 5a that at the early stage of filtration there is sharp decline in permeate flux which could be attributed to the adsorption and pore blocking by the rhl pollutant aggrgates on the membrane surface and inside its pores and subsequently increased the fouling resistance the gradual flux decline at the later stages could be due to formation and growth of cake layer due to accumulation of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface a related behavior was observed in the treatment of wastewater using meuf with sds 1 the initial flux decline in the first 200 400 s was 70 80 of the total flux decline for the operating pressures tested comparing the values of k1 for different operating pressures it was observed that k1 increased as pressure increased indicating a greater initial permeate flux decline and thus more severe membrane fouling due to adsorption pore blocking in the case of higher operating pressure filtration at higher pressure was also characterized by earlier occurrence of cake formation with faster and greater flux decline during the initial stage of filtration this could be explained by the fact that at higher pressure more cd 2 cv rhl vesicles were arriving faster to the membrane surface because of enhanced driving force across the membrane increase in pressure from 276 to 690 kpa resulted to decrease in the onset of cake formation from 393 to 203 s with increase in value of k1 from 1 08 10 2 to 2 4 10 2 and decrease in value of kc from 2 105 to 1 34 105 table 3 this observation was in accordance with previous studies 48 also initial flux decline increased from 22 4 43 with the same increment of pressure however the flux remained greater at the higher pressure throughout the ultrafiltration process at the end of experiment vcr 2 increasing pressure from 276 to 690 kpa led to increase in permeate flux from 41 5 74 l m 2 h 1 as also seen in fig 2a vcr continued to increase with operation time which might be due to continuous decrease of retentate volume with the progress of filtration furthermore transmembrane pressure had significant effect on the time required to achieve vcr 2 for instance the time required to reach vcr 2 was reduced about a half when pressure increased from 276 to 690 kpa fig 5b showed the effects caused by transmembrane pressure δp on the rejection profiles of cd 2 cv and rhl the rejection profiles followed a similar time dependence in the pressure ranges considered as observed in fig 5b that a lower solute rejection was observed at higher ultrafiltration pressure this might be explained by the fact at higher filtration pressure more than 414 kpa some of the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates tended to pass through the membrane and thereby reducing the values of solute rejection for example at the end of experiment vcr 2 the rejection of cd 2 cv and rhl at 276 kpa were 98 5 98 9 and 98 5 respectively while at 690 kpa they were 95 6 96 0 and 95 6 respectively it could also be observed from the figure that the rejections of cd 2 cv rhl were almost independent of operation time at all operating pressures a tradeoff between the permeate flux and solute rejection should be made for selecting a suitable operating pressure thus among the operating pressure studied herein 414 kpa was the suitable ultrafiltration pressure and the obtained permeate flux at vct 2 was about 61 l m2 h with rejections of cd 2 98 4 cv 98 7 and rhl 98 6 the variations of solute cd 2 cv and rhl concentrations in retentate with operation time for different operating pressures were shown in fig 5c it was observed from the figure that solute concentration in retentate continued to increase with time at any point of operation time solute concentration was higher for higher filtration pressure this could be due to enhanced permeate flux at higher pressure the profiles of fouling resistances with time at various operating pressure were depicted in fig 5d it was evident from the figures that both the fouling resistances increased with increase in pressure at a particular time of operation for example after 45 min of operation total fouling resistance increased about 1 36 fold on increasing pressure from 276 to 690 kpa this was because the surfactant aggregates had more opportunity to migrate into the membrane surface at larger filtration pressure increasing fouling resistance would tend to decrease the permeate flux however in the present study higher permeate flux was obtained for higher operating pressure which might be due to dominance of enhanced pressure driving force over the total transport resistance during filtration 4 2 2 2 effect of feed temperature the influence of feed temperature on profiles of flux and vcr can be observed by comparing the curves under the same operating pressure and stirrer speed as shown in fig 6a the symbols represented experimental data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results as observed in figure that the permeate flux attenuated very quickly at the beginning of filtration due to pore blocking and solute adsorption permeate flux decay slowed down when the fouling mechanism changed to the cake formation as explained earlier comparing the permeate flux at different temperatures revealed that a higher permeate flux and lower flux decay could be obtained at higher feed temperature this result could be due to reduction of solution viscosity and enhancement of diffusivity of rhl aggregates at elevated feed temperature and both the factors affected positively to the permeation fluxes for example at 414 kpa with increasing temperature from 26 40 c permeate flux increased from 61 to 72 l m 2 h 1 almost 18 increase in flux with decrease in k1 from 1 3 10 2 to 0 9 10 2 s 1 and kc from 1 6 105 to 1 0 105 s m 2 furthermore when the times required in achieving vcr 2 were compared then it appeared that ultrafiltration at 40 c 48 5 min had definite advantages over that operated at 26 c 56 min also the onset of cake formation was delayed on increasing temperature the effect of feed temperature was not observed on the retention profiles of cd 2 cv and rhl as shown in fig 5b the profiles of solute cd 2 cv and rhl concentrations in retentate with operation time for different operating temperature were depicted in fig 6c it was observed from the figure that solute concentration in retentate continued to increase with time at a particular time operation solute concentration was more for higher operating temperature because of enhanced permeation rate at higher temperature the initial membrane fouling resistance as well as the cake layer resistance both decreased with an increase in temperature as expected fig 6d increasing temperature from 26 40 c reduced the cake layer resistance from 4 17 1012 to 2 55 1012 m 1 however beyond 40 c increasing temperature did not result in a noticeable reduction of the cake layer resistance therefore any further increase in temperature above 40 c did not lead to increase in permeate flux for the experimental temperatures tested 4 2 2 3 effect of stirrer speed at higher stirrer speed the fouling associated with adsorption and pore blockage decreased due to increase in turbulence near to the membrane surface leading to decrease in membrane fouling this resulted to increase in permeate flux with decrease in both k1 and kc for example at the end of the experiment vcr 2 at 414 kpa and 26 c with increase in stirrer speed from 200 to 600 rpm the permeate flux increased from 51 9 61 l m 2 h 1 fig 7 a with decrease in cake layer resistance from 7 08 1012 to 4 17 1012 m 1 fig 7d the corresponding value of k1 decreased from 1 75 10 2 to 1 3 10 2 s 1and that for kc decreased from 2 6 105 to 1 6 105 s m 2 table 3 the onset of cake formation was delayed from 230 to 300 s it was also noticed that beyond 600 rpm the increased stirrer speed did not cause a significant change in the permeate flux as alsodepicted in fig 7b solute rejection was virtually independent of stirrer speeds indicating that the retention of cd 2 and cv by the membrane in meuf is mainly governed by the solubilization mechanism of the cd 2 and cv on into the rhl aggregates and the retention of the aggregates by the membrane the rejection of cd 2 and cv were found to be 98 4 and 98 7 respectively for the stirrer speeds studied thus far 4 2 2 4 effect of nacl concentration in feed electrolytes are extensively used in textile industry with the dyes and heavy metal ions therefore this industry generated large volumes of coloured wastewater with significant amount of electrolyte thus it was enable to meet with electrolytes content in colored wastewaters including heavy metal ions the performance of meuf process was also evaluated by varying the electrolyte nacl concentration in feed and the results were depicted in fig 8 a d it was observed that increasing feed nacl concentration caused significant decrease in rejections of both cd 2 and cv with slightly decline in permeate flux as was also evident from fig 8b that the rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl were almost invariant throughout the filtration the lower solute rejection at higher nacl concentration was attributed to the lower solubilization of cd 2 cv molecules because of the charge neutralization and size reduction of rhl aggregates the reduction of rhl aggregates sizes with increase in nacl concentration caused a decrease in the solubilization of cv into the rhl vesicles for a given surfactant concentration moreover due to counteraction of the charge of aggregates and thus to reduction in the electrostatic attraction between cd 2 and the rhl aggregates led to decrease in solubilization of cd 2 in the outer portion of the palisade layer besides na ions also competed with cd 2 for adsorption on negatively charged aggregates surface as observed in table 3 an increase in nacl feed concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 resulted to decrease in krhl values from 19 to 11 m3 kg 1 and 25 to 23 m3 kg 1 for cd 2 and cv respectively moreover the size reduction would enable the passage of some cd 2 cv rhl micelles 6 6 7 25 nm through the membrane pores 7 2 0 2 nm along with solubilized cd 2 and cv molecules with the permeate this resulted to decrease in rejections of cv cd 2 and rhl with increase in salt concentration experimental results revealed that the nacl concentration of 5 0 kg m 3 was the turning point that led to changing process performance during simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv by meuf at 5 0 kg m 3 of nacl the rejections of cd 2 and cv and the permeate flux were determined as 98 4 98 7 and 61 l m 2 h 1 respectively however beyond this there was a sharp decline in rejections of both cd 2 from 98 4 87 3 and cv from 98 7 89 0 with significant loss 11 5 of surfactant in permeate by increasing nacl concentration in feed from 5 to 30 kg m 3 thus for high nacl concentration it could be suggested to use the membrane with lower pore size for the purpose of obtaining higher rejection of cd 2 and cv and minimal loss of surfactant the presence of salt in feed showed negative effect on permeate flux increasing nacl concentration to the aqueous solution would reduce the repulsion between the charged head groups of the rhl surfactants resulting in easier formation of surfactant micelles in solution compared to the absence of the nacl therefore at high nacl concentration more number of micelles with smaller size were formed and thus forming more compact cake type layer over the membrane surface with increase in value of kc as well as specific cake layer resistance leading to decrease in permeate flux with early onset of cake formation over the membrane surface for instance at the end of experiment vcr 2 the permeate flux decreased from 61 to 56 l m 2 h 1 with increase in kc value from 1 58 105 to 2 1 105 s m 2 by increasing nacl concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 4 2 2 5 effects of rhl concentration in feed and vcr the effects of rhl feed concentration on the profiles of permeate flux solute rejections and cake layer resistance were presented in fig 9 a c the symbols represented experimental flux data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results an excellent match between the experimental and model predicted values were depicted the results indicated that a sharp initial flux decline was observed in case of higher surfactant feed concentration an increase in rhl concentration in feed increased the number of rhl vesicles therefore accumulation of the retained rhl vesicles near the membrane surface caused to increase in concentration polarization that led to cake type layer deposition on the membrane surface which offered extra resistance to solvent flow this resulted to increase in cake layer resistance and decrease in permeate flux both the values of k1 and kc were found to increase with increase in rhl feed concentration as observed in fig 9 a c at vcr 2 with increase in rhl feed concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 permeate flux decreased from 64 25 46 2 l m 2 h 1 28 decrease with increase in cake layer resistance from 3 67 1012 to 5 39 1012 m 1 the corresponding values of k1 and kc increased from 0 012 to 0 018 s 1 and 1 4 105 to 1 98 105 s m 2 respectively table 3 with the decrease of time required for onset of cake formation from 306 to 280 s initial feed surfactant concentration also showed significant effects on solute rejections as well as on the vesicle binding constants as presented in table 3 due to presence of more surfactant molecules in the vesicle form at higher rhl feed concentration the number of binding sites of surfactants increased that led to solubilize or bind more cd 2 and cv molecules and thus increasing the rejections of cd 2 and cv the rejections of cd 2 and cv increased from 64 to 96 9 and 89 4 96 9 respectively furthermore the developed model was used to analyze the flux decline behavior up to vcr 4 as shown in fig 9d the model calculations showed excellent agreement with the experimental data the effect of vcr was mainly observed on the cake fouling resistance and permeate flux comparing the permeate flux under the same operating conditions fig 9a d revealed that a lower permeate flux was observed at higher vcr this was due to more accumulation of more rhl vesicles on the membrane surface thus accounted for the increase of cake fouling resistance for instance with increase in vcr from 2 to 4 cake fouling resistance increased from 4 17 1012 to 6 55 1012 resulting in decrease in permeate flux from 61 to 55 8 l m 2 h 1 4 2 3 applicability of the developed model to other meuf study the developed model was also applied to analyze the flux decline behavior and solute rejections during meuf for simultaneous removal of methylene blue mb and cadmium ion cd 2 from aqueous solution using the binary mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether tritonx 100 1 fig 10 showed the comparison between the experimental and predicted flux decline data along with the estimated values of the model parameters symbols and solid line were the experimental and predicted flux data respectively meuf experiments were performed with fixed sds concentration of 4 mm and tritonx 100 to sds molar ratio of 0 5 under batch concentration mode vcr 7 5 at constant pressure of 0 03 mpa the concentration of mb and cd 2 were 6 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the sd and mrpd between experimental and predicted flux values were acceptable being 8 2 and 5 1 respectively corroborating the strong correlation between predicted and experimental flux data the transition time of fouling mechanism was calculated as 283 s which was consistent with the observed trend of flux decline the calculated rejection values mb 99 01 0 41 cd 2 98 06 0 14 agreed well with the experimental rejection values mb 99 2 cd 2 98 4 also the estimated values of micelle binding constant of mb log ks mb and cd 2 log ks cd 2 were found to be 3 9 and 3 62 respectively which were very close to the reported values of 3 95 and 3 65 respectively 1 this clearly indicated that the proposed combined model would be useful for explaining flux decline data that resembled systems containing dilute heavy metal ions and organic compounds with the observed fouling mechanisms 5 conclusions simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv from aqueous solution was investigated in a stirred cell by meuf using rhamnolipid biosurfactant the detailed parametric study revealed that permeate flux increased with increase in transmembrane pressure difference stirrer speed and feed temperature but decreased with increase in feed concentrations of rhamnolipid and nacl the increase of transmembrane pressure and nacl feed concentration caused substantial decrease in rejection of both cd 2 and cv however stirrer speed and feed temperature had no influence on observed rejection a model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s constant pressure cake filtration model was developed to quantify the flux decline and solute rejection during meuf the model assumed sequential occurrence of initial fouling due to adsorption pore blocking and subsequent fouling due to the growth of cake layer of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface during meuf using the estimated model parameters the model successfully predicted the profiles of permeate flux vcr fouling resistance retentate concentration and observed rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl with filtration time the predominant fouling mechanism for flux decline was found to be adsorption pore blocking operating conditions showed significant influence on transition time of fouling mechanism analysis of the fouling resistance revealed that the adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance was higher compared to the cake resistance although membrane hydraulic resistance was the dominant one the developed model provided a useful tool to understand the effects of operating conditions on the flux decline behavior and to select the optimal process parameters to obtain a desirable system performance in terms of permeate flux and solute rejection efficiency the developed model was also successfully used to other meuf studies to explain flux decline behavior and solute rejections and thus the model would be useful for explaining flux decline data that resembled systems with the observed fouling mechanisms declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the guru gobind singh indraprastha university delhi

of trypsin 20 kda in phosphate buffer ph 7 2 experiment was carried out in stirred cell under continuous mode the details of schematic diagram of the experimental set up were illustrated elsewhere 23 the permeate was collected from the bottom of the cell at steady state the concentration of solute was determined in the feed as well as in the permeate samples using uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 280 nm the observed rejection r o of trypsin was calculated using eq 1 knowing the observed rejection of trypsin the average pore radius r m av of the membrane was determined using the following expression as 49 a1 r m av r s av r o where r m av and r s av were the average radius nm of the membrane pore and trypsin respectively the average radius of trypsin was taken as 2 15 nm 50 thus the average membrane pore radius of hfuf 20 membrane was experimentally estimated as 3 6 0 1 nm

rhamnolipid rhl biosurfactant in a stirred cell for removal of cd 2 and crystal violet cv simultaneously from aqueous solution the influence of various operating conditions on the transient profiles

with more than 98 0 1 rejections of both the pollutants cd 2 and cv and minimum surfactant loss 3 to the permeate the rapid decline in permeate flux at the earlier stage of filtration was attributed to adsorption pore blocking followed by gradual decline at the later stage due to the growth of a cake layer of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface the transition of fouling mechanism occurred in the range of 200 390 s depending on the operating conditions a combined model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s constant pressure cake filtration model was developed to analyze the profiles of flux decline and observed rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl the predicted results showed a good agreement with the experimental data the developed model was

effluents 1 which are characterized with high values of chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds color and salinity etc 2 crystal violet a basic dye is often used in the manufacture of paints and printing inks and also in the textile industries for dyeing of cotton and silk in countries such as india and china 3 4 the major environmental problem associated with the use of dyes is their significant lose about 10 15 during processing operations the use of various cadmium salts cds cdseo3 and cdcl2 etc in dyeing and printing textiles are considered to be potential source of cadmium in textile effluents 5 during the application of basic dyes on wool the concentration of cd 2 in dyeing wastewater is found to 7 5 mg l 6 as a consequence they can be found simultaneously in the effluents discharged by these industries due to high cost of effluent treatment small scale industries discharge the hazardous effluent directly to the surface water also the rapid industrialization poor waste management and improper waste disposal techniques particularly in developing countries also cause the mixing of effluents of different industries resulting in presence of toxic heavy metal ions and dyes in wastewaters both cd 2 and cv are non biodegradable highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature even at low concentration and responsible for skin diseases and digestive problems 3 7 they may also lead to failure of kidney and respiratory system at the extreme cases also presence of small amount of dye produces a lot of color that affects the water transparency according to bureau of indian standards bis 3306 1955 the discharge limit into the public sewage is considered to be colorless in compliance with the stringent environmental regulations it is warranted to find an effective method to simultaneously remove these co pollutants from the aqueous waste before being discharged into the environment therefore the study on the removal of both these pollutants from wastewaters is of great importance so far various techniques such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange electrochemical and reverse osmosis etc have been attempted for the treatment of wastewaters polluted by both dyes and heavy metal ions 8 12 however at a large scale these techniques are not effective particularly at low pollutant concentration in this connection micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf a surfactant based separation process has been considered as a promising separation technique for simultaneous removal of toxic heavy metal ions and organic compounds at low concentration level from aqueous streams in single multi component systems 1 13 20 this method combines the high process throughput permeate flux of ultrafiltration and the high selectivity of reverse osmosis 15 in meuf process surfactant is added into the contaminated water to a concentration higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc resulting in formation of large amphiphilic surfactant aggregates namely micelles organic pollutants tend to be solubilized in the hydrophobic core of the micelles via hydrophobic interactions while the heavy metal ions are adsorbed on the oppositely charged surface of the micelles via electrostatic interaction then these micelles along with trapped pollutants are separated from the aqueous stream via an ultrafiltration membrane with appropriate pore size most of the pollutant micelle complexes remain in the retentate stream and thus the concentration of contaminants in permeate stream is much lower than that in feed stream to date most of the previous meuf studies reported are based on various ionic and or non ionic synthetic surfactants however due to high cmc value the applications of synthetic surfactant in meuf causes a long term risk of secondary contamination due to leakage of surfactant with the permeate stream recently biosurfactants have attracted attention of many researchers and have become more effective over synthetic surfactants because of their biodegradability low cmc value non toxic nature ecological acceptability and renewable production sources etc 21 the idea of using biosurfactant has been demonstrated and applied in the meuf processes for removal of single multi component heavy metal ions alone or simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants from aqueous environment 22 23 recently meuf process using chemical surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate has been applied for removing ionic dyes and cd 2 from wastewaters 1 24 26 however to our knowledge there is no prior report on meuf using biosurfactant for simultaneous removal of dyes and cd 2 from aqueous stream in this paper we report the simultaneous removal of crystal violet cv and heavy metal ion cd 2 from aqueous solution by meuf process using rhamnolipid rhl biosurfactant the major problem associated in any meuf process was the flux decline caused by membrane fouling modeling the flux decline during meuf provides better understanding on membrane fouling and can serve as a predictive tool for performance analysis selection of best operating conditions and scale up several models are available today in the literature to analyze the flux decline with time during meuf process such as i the gel polarization model 27 ii the resistance in series model 28 iii hermia s model 29 etc jadhav et al 30 have developed a mathematical model to explain the removal of phenol and aniline by meuf and predict permeate concentrations chhatre and marathe 31 have evaluated the performance of sds based meuf for removing ni ii ions from aqueous stream using the combination of equilibrium model mass transfer model and resistance in series model the model has been extended to the prediction of permeate flux during meuf of binary mixture of cu 2 and ca 2 by das et al 32 apart from these models combined model has been successfully used for explaining flux decline behavior in many ultrafiltration microfiltration studies 33 34 although the earlier developed combined models have proven beneficial in some applications to our best knowledge the use of combined model in meuf studies has not been reported so far it is worthy to mention that the developed combined model assumes that the cake foulant is incompressible in nature however in the present study experimental results show an increasing trend of permeate flux with increasing operating pressure indicating the compressible nature of deposited layer thus existing combined models are restrictive and cannot be employed for meuf treatment of dye heavy metal ion containing wastewater in view of this an attempt has been made to develop a combined model based on the models available in the literature for simultaneous prediction of permeate flux and permeate concentrations during meuf of wastewater containing both dye and heavy metal ions the aims of this work were i to assess the performance of meuf using rhl in stirred dead end filtration for simultaneous removal of dye and cd 2 from aqueous stream at different nacl concentrations transmembrane pressures stirrer speeds temperatures and feed surfactant concentrations ii to develop a resistance in series model coupled with hermia s cake filtration model taking into account the transition of fouling mechanisms from pore blockage adsorption to cake filtration and to compare the predicted results with the experimental profiles of flux decline and retention of cv and cd 2 as a function of time for different operating conditions iii to observe the effects of operating conditions on the evolution of various fouling resistances and the transition time of fouling mechanism 2 theory dead end meuf experiments were carried out in a stirred stainless steel batch cell m s pmi india ltd india at a constant transmembrane pressure the aqueous solution containing rhl cv cd 2 and electrolyte nacl was charged into the cell and pressure was delivered from a cylinder of nitrogen gas rhl vesicles containing solubilized cd 2 and cv with sizes larger than the membrane pore size were rejected effectively by the ultrafiltration membrane resulting in simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv it was assumed that the solute either rhl monomer or unsolubilized cv cd 2 freely passed through the membrane with the permeate the observed rejection r o s for any solute rhl cd 2 cv was calculated as 1 r o s 1 c p s c r s where c p s and c r s are the concentrations of the solute in permeate and retentate respectively at higher operating pressure it appeared that some pollutant rhl vesicle complexes were forced to pass through the membrane the rejection of rhl vesicles was defined as 2 r v 1 c p v c r v where cp v and cr v are the concentrations of the rhl vesicles in permeate and retentate respectively thus the concentration of solute rhl cd 2 cv in the permeate could be written in terms of rv as 3 c p s c p f s 1 r v c r s c p f s where c p f s was the concentration of either rhl monomers or unsolubilized cv cd 2 in aqueous phase the solute rhl cv cd 2 mass balance in the retentate resulted the variation of solute concentration in the retentate with time as 4 v r d c r s dt v w a c r s c p s where v w 1 a v p δ t s vp was the volume of permeate collected δts was the sampling time a was the effective membrane area and v r was the retentate volume assuming equal densities of permeate and retentate the overall material balance in the cell gave 5 d v r dt v w a using eqs 3 and 4 could be written in terms of rejection of rhl vesicles as 6 v r d c r s dt v w a r v c r s c p f s it was further assumed that there was no variation in the rejection of rhl vesicles with time the concentration of rhl in aqueous phase was assumed to be constant at its cmc value c p f rhl cmc on the other hand the concentration of pollutants cv cd 2 in aqueous phase could be expressed in terms of rhl vesicle binding constant k rhl cv c d 2 as 7

concentration of pollutant cv cd 2 and rhl in the vesicle phase respectively the binding constant indicated the relative affinity of pollutants for rhl vesicles which was found to be depended upon the concentration of surfactant and pollutants in the feed 35 using eqs 7 and 6 could be written as 9 v r d c r rhl dt v w a r v c r rhl cmc for rhl 10 v r d c r c d 2 dt v w a r v c r c d 2 c r c d 2 1 k

membrane fouling was assumed to be started with adsorption of solutes and pore blocking followed by cake layer formation by the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates over the membrane surface in the present study resistance in series model coupled with hermia s cake filtration model was used to explain the flux decline behavior for the entire duration of experiment the resistance in series model considered both fouling mechanisms as well as it accounted the resistance due to adsorption pore blockage up to transition time t1 and the resistance caused by the cake layer formation beyond t1 2 1 flux decline for stage 1 t t 1 the initial flux decline t t 1 was due to membrane fouling which was assumed to be started with the adsorption of cd 2 cv rhl aggregates onto the surface and the membrane pore blocking the time variation of permeate flux was expressed using the phenomenological equation as 36 12 v w δp μ r m r f where rm was the membrane hydraulic resistance rf was the fouling resistance caused by the adsorption of cv and cd 2 ions on membrane surface and inside its pores and pore blocking of cd 2 cv rhl aggregates experimental results revealed that the rejection of nacl by the membrane used in this study was almost insignificant less than 6 due to smaller size of the ions compared to the membrane pore size confirming the presence of high content of nacl in the permeate stream measured by conductivity thus using the van t hoff equation the osmotic pressure was estimated as 15 20 kpa which was about 2 5 of the operating pressures studied therefore the effect of osmotic pressure was not considered in the development of model in presence of stirring the fouling resistance increased with time but at a decreasing rate reaching a maximum value at the transition time onset of cake formation thus the rate of growth of adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance rf could be expressed as 37 13 r f r fm 1 exp k 1 t where k1 was the kinetic parameter indicating the growth rate of adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance rfm was its maximum fouling resistance and t was operation time therefore eq 12 could be rewritten as 14 v w v w o 1 r fm 1 exp k 1 t where v w o δp μ r m and r fm r fm r m 2 2 flux decline for stage 2 t t1 it was assumed that formation of cake layer started after completion of solute adsorption and pore blocking hermia s cake filtration model for dead end filtration was coupled with resistance in series model it should be noted in this regard that although hermia s model is based on classical constant pressure unstirred dead end filtration this model has been successfully used to explain flux decline behavior during stirred dead end filtration 29 38 as well as cross flow experiments 39 40 using hermia s cake filtration model 41 the rate of flux decline could be written as follows 15 d v w dt k c v w 3 hence at t t 1 the permeate flux could be written in terms of resistance as 16 v w δp μ r m r f t 1 r c t t 1 where rc was the resistance due to cake layer formation on the membrane surface by the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates eq 16 could also be written as 17 v w v w t 1 1 r c where v w t 1 v w o 1 r f r c r c 1 r f r c r c r m and r f r f r m equating eq 15 with the derivative of eq 17 with respect to t resulted the following as 18 d r c dt k c v w t 1 2 1 r c the integration of eq 18 with the initial condition at t t1 rc 0 led to the expression of cake layer resistance as 19 r c t 1 r f 1 2 k c v w t 1 2 t t 1 1 2 1 2 3 expression of time for onset of cake layer formation it was assumed that the permeate flux values and its time derivatives were continuous at time t1 since the fouling mechanism changed from adsorption pore blocking to cake layer formation at time t1 thus the continuity of slope of permeate flux versus time curve at t t1 was obtained as follows 20 d v w dt t t δ d v w dt t t δ at t t1 and δ 0 in the regime t t1 the following equation was obtained from eq 14 21 d v w dt t t 1 v w o r fm k 1 exp k 1 t 1 1 r fm 1 exp k 1 t 1 2 at t t1 and δ 0 in the regime t t1 the following equation was obtained from eq 15 22 d v w dt t t 1 k c v w 3 t t 1 after equating eqs 21 and 22 followed by rearrangement the expression of time for onset of cake formation t1 was obtained as 23 t 1 cal 1 k 1 ln 2 1 p 1 p 2 4 p 2 q 1 2 where p r m r fm and q k 1 k c v w o 2 2 4 estimation of model parameters the six model parameters namely rfm k1 kc k rhl cv k rhl c d 2 and rv were estimated through an optimization method and by minimizing the sum of square errors between the calculated and experimental data of permeate flux and permeate concentration using the values of optimized model parameters the performance of the meuf experiments was predicted 1 from the knowledge of pure water permeate flux hydraulic membrane resistance was calculated for a particular experiment the values of operating pressure stirrer speed initial feed volume and initial concentration of rhl cv and cd 2 in feed were known the values of rfm k1 and kc were initially guessed for that particular set of operating conditions then the value of transition time t1 was calculated from eq 23 2 next the values of rv k rhl cv and k rhl c d 2 were guessed experimental determination of vesicle binding constant did not show any significant deviation with the variation of transmembrane pressure stirrer speed and feed temperature thus the model assumed that k rhl cv c d 2 was independent of operating conditions and operation time for the prediction of permeate flux and the solute concentration in permeate and retentate for first guess the value of k rhl cv c d 2 was chosen which was obtained by using experimental data of permeate concentration and retentate concentration for stage 1 t t1 the permeate flux values v w retentate volume retentate concentration and permeate concentration at various operation time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations eqs 5 9 10 12 and 13 using matlab with the following initial condition at t 0 c r s c 0 s and vr v0 3 then the time t was increased to t δt 4 step 2 was repeated till t t1 5 for stage 2 t t1 the permeate flux retentate volume retentate concentration and permeate concentration at various operation time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations eqs 5 9 10 11 14 17 and 19 using matlab with the initial condition at t t1 r c 0 6 the time t was increased to t δt next 7 step 5 was repeated till t tt 8 the sum of square errors between calculated and experimental values of permeate flux and permeate concentration were calculated for the entire duration of experiment sum of square errors was defined as e i 1 n v w i exp v w i cal v w i exp 2 i 1 n c p i rhl exp c p i rhl cal c p i rhl exp 2 i 1 n c p i cv exp c p i cv cal c p i cv exp 2 i 1 n c p i c d 2 exp c p i c d 2 cal c p i c d 2 exp 2 where n represented number of experimentally measured data points 9 if e 10 3 the program was terminated the corresponding values of rfm k1 kc k rhl cv k rhl c d 2 and rv were recorded if not another set of values of parameters were guessed in step 1 and 2 and process was continued till the given convergence was achieved thus the transient profiles of permeate flux retentate volume solute concentration in retentate and permeate were obtained the model was validated by comparing the calculated values of permeate flux and permeate concentrations with those observed during experiments the results obtained were discussed in the results and discussion sections 3

permionics membranes pvt ltd india was used in this study 3 2 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration to observe the effects of various operating conditions meuf experiments were carried out with initial feed of 4 10 4 m3 of synthetic solution prepared under the optimal feed conditions rhl 1730 10 3 kg m 3 cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 cv 15 10 3 kg m 3 nacl 5 kg m 3 and ph of 7 8 at different transmembrane pressures 276 690 kpa stirrer speeds 200 1000 rpm and feed temperatures 26 45 c the corresponding values of reynolds number re were in the range of 5410 27040 the optimal feed conditions were obtained previously for simultaneous maximization of rejections of both cd 2 and cv using response surface methodology 42 in our previous study a full factorial central composite design was employed with rhl concentration 584 2920 10 3 kg m 3 or 1 5 mm solution ph 6 5 8 5 cv concentration 10 30 10 3 kg m 3 and cd 2 concentration 20 60 10 3 kg m 3 as independent variables and permeate flux rejections of cd 2 and cv as response variables the concentration of nacl in feed was fixed at 5 kg m 3 besides the effects of operating conditions the present study also investigated the effects of feed concentration of rhl and nacl on the permeate flux and solute rejections the summary of selected operating conditions of experiments were presented in table 1 the synthetic solution was prepared by adding pre determined amount of cd no3 2 4h2o cv and nacl into the distilled water followed by addition of pre determined amount rhl surfactant into the wastewater the ph of the feed solution was adjusted to desired ph value of 7 8 by adding 0 1 n naoh or 0 1 n hcl then the solution was gently stirred with magnetic stirrer for 1 h to ensure uniform solute dispersion and then allowed to keep at room temperature of 26 1 c for 12 h the freshly prepared feed was subjected to ultrafiltration in stirred membrane cell capacity 5 10 4 m3 under batch concentration mode the stirred cell was pressurized

india permeate was continuously collected from bottom of the cell the schematic diagram of the experimental set up was described in detail elsewhere 23 cumulative volume of permeate as a function of time was measured the permeate flux was obtained from the slop of the cumulative volume time plot using the membrane area the experiments were stopped at the desired volume concentration ratio vcr which implied removal of desired percentage feed as permeate vcr was a measure of the ratio of initial feed volume to the retentate volume at any point of time all the meuf experiments were carried out in triplicate the experimental data with error bars were reported in the corresponding figures prior to meuf experiment the fresh membrane was compacted at 690 kpa for 90 min using double distilled water and permeate flux values were measured at different transmembrane pressures 276 345 414 and 690 kpa the pure water permeability of the membrane was obtained from the slope of permeate flux versus transmembrane pressure as 6 2 0 2 x10 11 m pa 1 s 1 3 3 membrane cleaning protocol after each meuf experiment the cell was dismantled and the membrane was first cleaned with distilled water then the membrane was submitted to static chemical cleaning procedures i cleaning with an aqueous hcl solution for 20 min ph 3 0 ii rinsing with distilled water for 10 min iii cleaning with an aqueous naoh solution for 20 min ph 10 0 and iv finally membrane was washed with distilled water then the cell was reassembled and the membrane permeability was checked using distilled water after this the membrane was ready for the next experiment with freshly prepared feed thus thorough membrane cleaning resulted the recovery of the pure water permeability within 96 of the new membrane permeability thereby maintaining the integrity of the membrane 3 4 experimental analysis the mean sizes hydrodynamic diameter dp av of rhl aggregates in aqueous solution in presence of cd 2 cv and nacl were measured by the dynamic light scattering dls technique using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk at 90 scattering angle and 26 1 c the critical micelle concentrations cmc of rhl in presence of cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 and cv 15 10 3 kg m 3 with varying nacl concentration 0 30 kg m 3 were determined by surface tension measurement in aqueous solution the surface tensions of aqueous surfactant solution was measured based on pendant drop method using drop shape analyzer model dsa 25 e kruss gmbh germany a stock solution of rhl was first prepared in water filtered with 0 45 μm pore size nylon filter at a concentration of 1000 10 3 kg m 3 in presence of desired concentration of cd 2 cv and nacl for surface tension measurement samples were prepared by serial dilution of stock solution at a concentration range 5 500 x10 3 kg m 3 of rhl keeping the concentration of cd 2 cv and nacl unaltered the temperature and solution ph were kept at 26 1 ºc and 7 8 respectively all the measurements were performed in triplicate and their average values were used the cmc value was determined from the intersection point of two tangents of the surface tension isotherm which was a plot of equilibrium surface tension versus logarithm of rhl concentration graph not shown here the morphological characterization of the membrane before and after the experiments was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss evo 18 uk the membranes were dried in room temperature and cut into pieces of desired sizes as the polymeric membranes were non conductive membrane samples were coated with a very thin layer of gold in a vacuum the top surface and cross sectional view of the membranes were observed by sem under very high vacuum at 20 kv in 1 2 2 5 kx magnifications the concentrations of cd 2 cv and rhl in feed permeate and retentate samples were analyzed for estimation of observed retentions the concentration of cadmium ion was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer electronics corporation of india ltd india at 228 8 nm the concentration of cv was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer u2900 hitachi japan at 589 nm rhamnolipid concentration was determined by the

instrument india 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of nacl on cmc and mean aggregate size the cmc of rhl in presence of cd 2 and cv was found to be 60 1 x10 3 kg m 3 the concentration of nacl in solution showed significant effect on the cmc value of rhl an increase in nacl concentration increased the concentration of free counter ion na around rhl aggregates thereby decreasing the repulsive forces between charged head group of the surfactant aggregates resulting in easier formation of the surfactant aggregates with increase in aggregation number 44 this led to decrease in cmc value for instance in presence of cv and cd 2 the cmc values of rhl were observed as 40 35 30 and 30 10 3 kg m 3 for the nacl concentration of 5 10 20 and 30 kg m 3 respectively keeping other conditions unaltered the obtained values of cmc were consistent with those reported previously 22 44 45 the mean size of rhl aggregates in aqueous solution rhl 1730 10 3 kg m 3 cd 2 30 10 3 kg m 3 cv 15 10 3 kg m 3 ph 7 8 decreased with the increasing nacl concentration for instance with increase in salt concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 the mean size of rhl aggregates decreased from 23 04 6 6 nm which corresponded to change in morphology from medium vesicles 99 06 to micelles 94 2 the decrease in size of micellar structures in presence of nacl might be caused by the induction of na soft acid into the anionic rhl aggregates soft base resulting in an increase in water solubility of rhl biosurfactant which in turn disfavored the growth of rhl aggregates this observation was in accordance with the results obtained by pornsunthorntawee et al 44 4 2 micellar enhance ultrafiltration 4 2 1 assessment of fouling mechanisms and modeling of permeate flux to evaluate membrane performance it was important to check the existence of single or multiple fouling mechanisms during the filtration process and also to identify the type of fouling mechanism in this way the experimental flux data were initially analyzed using the integral method of field et al 46 according to integral method the various functions of permeate flux vw and blocking index n were plotted against the volume of permeate vp corresponding to individual fouling mechanisms such as complete pore blocking cpb intermediate pore blocking ipb standard pore blocking spb and cake layer formation cf as shown in fig 1 a b as seen in figure that the filtration curve bent at vp of about 5 l m 2 indicating the existence of more than one fouling mechanisms during filtration the inset of fig 1a showed the break point at about 240 s which corresponded to a switch in fouling mechanism thus the integral method suggested that flux decline during meuf did not follow a single fouling mechanism instead fouling likely occurred through a combination of two mechanisms after determining the break point the appropriate fouling mechanisms were identified before and after the break point during meuf the resistance in series model proposed by choi et al 37 and hermia s models for dead end filtration complete blocking intermediate blocking standard blocking and cake layer formation were used to fit the experimental data before the break point t t1 as shown in fig 2 a c resistance in series model of choi et al 37 considered the membrane resistance and adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance the criteria for selection of best model representing the experimental flux data were the magnitudes of the r2 sd and mrpd 23 higher values of r2 and lower values of sd and mrpd indicated better goodness of fit the results showed that the values of r2 sd and mrpd obtained for the hermia s pore blocking models were in the range of 0 921 0 936 1 0 1 09 and 0 641 0 7 3 respectively fig 2 a b the permeate flux data exhibited an excellent compliance with the resistance in series model r2 0 997 sd 0 2 and mrpd 0 12 as shown in fig 2c the obtained results clearly demonstrated that resistance in series model fitted better than all the hermia s blocking models thus resistance in series model was selected as the best model to fit the experimental data before the break point after the break point the experimental flux data yielded excellent fit with the hermia s cake layer formation model r2 0 99 sd 0 47 mrpd 0 364 as shown in fig 2d thus to explain the transient flux decline data over the entire meuf process a combined model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s cake filtration model was developed that used a two stage fouling mechanisms accounting for both adsorption pore blockage and cake layer formation the variation of permeate flux with operation time was shown in fig 3 the symbols represented experimental data while the lines curves 1 2 3 were the model predicted results curve 1 showed the prediction of permeate flux using the combined model developed in this study as clearly observed in fig 3 that there is a transition time t1 in the experimental data indicating a change in fouling mechanism thus the flux decline curve could be divided into two stages with two different fouling mechanisms there was a rapid initial loss of flux at the early stage stage 1 upto t t1 of filtration followed by a gradual continuous loss of flux at the later stage stage 2 t t1 till end of the experiment the rapid loss in permeate flux at stage 1 could be attributed to the adsorption and pore blocking by the rhl pollutant aggrgates on the membrane surface and subsequently increased the fouling resistance the sluggish flux decline at stage 2 could be attributed to the continuous formation and growth of cake type layer 47 due to accumulation of aggregates on the membrane surface with the progress of filtration the sem images of membrane before and after the experiments were shown in fig 4 it is clear from fig 4 that there was a cake type layer deposition on the membrane surface during ultrafiltration as discussed in section 2 the calculation of transition time of fouling mechanism using eq 23 involved the estimation of three parameters rfm k1 and kc by the optimization technique the value of t1 was calculated as 298 s at a fixed transmembrane pressure stirrer speed and feed temperature of 414 kpa 600 rpm and 26 c respectively the model calculated transition time t 1 cal was found to be very close to that of experimentally observed value t 1 exp of 300 s as shown in fig 3 the values of permeate flux post transition time were calculated by solving the coupled differential and algebraic equations as discussed in section 2 it could be noted that the transition time obtained from integral method field et al 46 slightly differed from that obtained from the developed combined model this slight discrepancies in transition time might be due to the fact that integral method was based on hermia s four fouling mechanisms whereas the present combined model considered the initial fouling resistance caused by the adsorption pore blockage thus for the determination of transition time in fouling mechanisms the developed combined model would be very much applicable for the system containing solutes having a tendency of pore blocking as well as adsorption on membrane surface and inside its pores an attempt was also made to analyze the flux decline using single adsorption pore blocking model and hermia s cake filtration model as shown by curves 2 and 3 respectively fig 3 the values of r2 sd and mrpd for the proposed combined model showed a good concordance between calculated values and experimental flux data 23 over the single models table 2 the predictions of permeate flux using combined model were within 0 47 of the experimental flux values compared to 4 using the model of choi et al 37 alone and 6 2 using the hermia s cake filtration model this clearly indicated that neither the adsorption pore blocking mechanism nor the cake layer formation by surfactant aggregates was the stand alone cause for the membrane fouling occurred during ultrafiltration analysis of membrane fouling was carried out by evaluating of the results obtained from the combined model under various operating conditions presented in table 3 the simulated profiles of flux and observed retention were compared with the experimental results figs 4 7 the proposed model provided good fits of experimental results for a wide range of data and yielded accurate predictions of permeate flux and observed solute retention using estimated parameters the predominant fouling mechanisms in the flux decline was determined from the value of normalized fouling coefficient q k 1 k c v w o 2 as shown in table 3 the value of q larger than unity indicated that initial adsorption pore blocking contributed more to the combined model than caking the value q ranged from 97 8 184 4 under the operating conditions tested implying that initial fouling due to adsorption pore blocking contributed more to the combined model than fouling due to cake layer formation it was important to notice that the contribution of the adsorption pore blocking resistance to the total resistance 11 5 35 9 was higher than the contribution of the cake layer resistance 10 8 21 6 however the contribution of the clean membrane intrinsic resistance to the total resistance was always higher than either of the fouling resistance representing about 50 77 of the total resistance under the experimental conditions studied herein the estimated fouling coefficients k1 kc were correlated to four independent variables transmembrane pressure reynolds number temperature and rhl feed concentration using a multiple regression analysis the developed equations at 95 confidence interval p values 0 05 were represented by eqs 24 25 with the value of coefficient of determination r2 24 k 1 1 40x1 0 5 1 t 1 2 δ

2 2 1 effect of transmembrane pressure fig 5a illustrated the effects of transmembrane pressure on the profiles of flux decline and vcr at constant stirrer speed the symbols represented experimental data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results as seen in fig 5a that at the early stage of filtration there is sharp decline in permeate flux which could be attributed to the adsorption and pore blocking by the rhl pollutant aggrgates on the membrane surface and inside its pores and subsequently increased the fouling resistance the gradual flux decline at the later stages could be due to formation and growth of cake layer due to accumulation of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface a related behavior was observed in the treatment of wastewater using meuf with sds 1 the initial flux decline in the first 200 400 s was 70 80 of the total flux decline for the operating pressures tested comparing the values of k1 for different operating pressures it was observed that k1 increased as pressure increased indicating a greater initial permeate flux decline and thus more severe membrane fouling due to adsorption pore blocking in the case of higher operating pressure filtration at higher pressure was also characterized by earlier occurrence of cake formation with faster and greater flux decline during the initial stage of filtration this could be explained by the fact that at higher pressure more cd 2 cv rhl vesicles were arriving faster to the membrane surface because of enhanced driving force across the membrane increase in pressure from 276 to 690 kpa resulted to decrease in the onset of cake formation from 393 to 203 s with increase in value of k1 from 1 08 10 2 to 2 4 10 2 and decrease in value of kc from 2 105 to 1 34 105 table 3 this observation was in accordance with previous studies 48 also initial flux decline increased from 22 4 43 with the same increment of pressure however the flux remained greater at the higher pressure throughout the ultrafiltration process at the end of experiment vcr 2 increasing pressure from 276 to 690 kpa led to increase in permeate flux from 41 5 74 l m 2 h 1 as also seen in fig 2a vcr continued to increase with operation time which might be due to continuous decrease of retentate volume with the progress of filtration furthermore transmembrane pressure had significant effect on the time required to achieve vcr 2 for instance the time required to reach vcr 2 was reduced about a half when pressure increased from 276 to 690 kpa fig 5b showed the effects caused by transmembrane pressure δp on the rejection profiles of cd 2 cv and rhl the rejection profiles followed a similar time dependence in the pressure ranges considered as observed in fig 5b that a lower solute rejection was observed at higher ultrafiltration pressure this might be explained by the fact at higher filtration pressure more than 414 kpa some of the cd 2 cv rhl aggregates tended to pass through the membrane and thereby reducing the values of solute rejection for example at the end of experiment vcr 2 the rejection of cd 2 cv and rhl at 276 kpa were 98 5 98 9 and 98 5 respectively while at 690 kpa they were 95 6 96 0 and 95 6 respectively it could also be observed from the figure that the rejections of cd 2 cv rhl were almost independent of operation time at all operating pressures a tradeoff between the permeate flux and solute rejection should be made for selecting a suitable operating pressure thus among the operating pressure studied herein 414 kpa was the suitable ultrafiltration pressure and the obtained permeate flux at vct 2 was about 61 l m2 h with rejections of cd 2 98 4 cv 98 7 and rhl 98 6 the variations of solute cd 2 cv and rhl concentrations in retentate with operation time for different operating pressures were shown in fig 5c it was observed from the figure that solute concentration in retentate continued to increase with time at any point of operation time solute concentration was higher for higher filtration pressure this could be due to enhanced permeate flux at higher pressure the profiles of fouling resistances with time at various operating pressure were depicted in fig 5d it was evident from the figures that both the fouling resistances increased with increase in pressure at a particular time of operation for example after 45 min of operation total fouling resistance increased about 1 36 fold on increasing pressure from 276 to 690 kpa this was because the surfactant aggregates had more opportunity to migrate into the membrane surface at larger filtration pressure increasing fouling resistance would tend to decrease the permeate flux however in the present study higher permeate flux was obtained for higher operating pressure which might be due to dominance of enhanced pressure driving force over the total transport resistance during filtration 4 2 2 2 effect of feed temperature the influence of feed temperature on profiles of flux and vcr can be observed by comparing the curves under the same operating pressure and stirrer speed as shown in fig 6a the symbols represented experimental data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results as observed in figure that the permeate flux attenuated very quickly at the beginning of filtration due to pore blocking and solute adsorption permeate flux decay slowed down when the fouling mechanism changed to the cake formation as explained earlier comparing the permeate flux at different temperatures revealed that a higher permeate flux and lower flux decay could be obtained at higher feed temperature this result could be due to reduction of solution viscosity and enhancement of diffusivity of rhl aggregates at elevated feed temperature and both the factors affected positively to the permeation fluxes for example at 414 kpa with increasing temperature from 26 40 c permeate flux increased from 61 to 72 l m 2 h 1 almost 18 increase in flux with decrease in k1 from 1 3 10 2 to 0 9 10 2 s 1 and kc from 1 6 105 to 1 0 105 s m 2 furthermore when the times required in achieving vcr 2 were compared then it appeared that ultrafiltration at 40 c 48 5 min had definite advantages over that operated at 26 c 56 min also the onset of cake formation was delayed on increasing temperature the effect of feed temperature was not observed on the retention profiles of cd 2 cv and rhl as shown in fig 5b the profiles of solute cd 2 cv and rhl concentrations in retentate with operation time for different operating temperature were depicted in fig 6c it was observed from the figure that solute concentration in retentate continued to increase with time at a particular time operation solute concentration was more for higher operating temperature because of enhanced permeation rate at higher temperature the initial membrane fouling resistance as well as the cake layer resistance both decreased with an increase in temperature as expected fig 6d increasing temperature from 26 40 c reduced the cake layer resistance from 4 17 1012 to 2 55 1012 m 1 however beyond 40 c increasing temperature did not result in a noticeable reduction of the cake layer resistance therefore any further increase in temperature above 40 c did not lead to increase in permeate flux for the experimental temperatures tested 4 2 2 3 effect of stirrer speed at higher stirrer speed the fouling associated with adsorption and pore blockage decreased due to increase in turbulence near to the membrane surface leading to decrease in membrane fouling this resulted to increase in permeate flux with decrease in both k1 and kc for example at the end of the experiment vcr 2 at 414 kpa and 26 c with increase in stirrer speed from 200 to 600 rpm the permeate flux increased from 51 9 61 l m 2 h 1 fig 7 a with decrease in cake layer resistance from 7 08 1012 to 4 17 1012 m 1 fig 7d the corresponding value of k1 decreased from 1 75 10 2 to 1 3 10 2 s 1and that for kc decreased from 2 6 105 to 1 6 105 s m 2 table 3 the onset of cake formation was delayed from 230 to 300 s it was also noticed that beyond 600 rpm the increased stirrer speed did not cause a significant change in the permeate flux as alsodepicted in fig 7b solute rejection was virtually independent of stirrer speeds indicating that the retention of cd 2 and cv by the membrane in meuf is mainly governed by the solubilization mechanism of the cd 2 and cv on into the rhl aggregates and the retention of the aggregates by the membrane the rejection of cd 2 and cv were found to be 98 4 and 98 7 respectively for the stirrer speeds studied thus far 4 2 2 4 effect of nacl concentration in feed electrolytes are extensively used in textile industry with the dyes and heavy metal ions therefore this industry generated large volumes of coloured wastewater with significant amount of electrolyte thus it was enable to meet with electrolytes content in colored wastewaters including heavy metal ions the performance of meuf process was also evaluated by varying the electrolyte nacl concentration in feed and the results were depicted in fig 8 a d it was observed that increasing feed nacl concentration caused significant decrease in rejections of both cd 2 and cv with slightly decline in permeate flux as was also evident from fig 8b that the rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl were almost invariant throughout the filtration the lower solute rejection at higher nacl concentration was attributed to the lower solubilization of cd 2 cv molecules because of the charge neutralization and size reduction of rhl aggregates the reduction of rhl aggregates sizes with increase in nacl concentration caused a decrease in the solubilization of cv into the rhl vesicles for a given surfactant concentration moreover due to counteraction of the charge of aggregates and thus to reduction in the electrostatic attraction between cd 2 and the rhl aggregates led to decrease in solubilization of cd 2 in the outer portion of the palisade layer besides na ions also competed with cd 2 for adsorption on negatively charged aggregates surface as observed in table 3 an increase in nacl feed concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 resulted to decrease in krhl values from 19 to 11 m3 kg 1 and 25 to 23 m3 kg 1 for cd 2 and cv respectively moreover the size reduction would enable the passage of some cd 2 cv rhl micelles 6 6 7 25 nm through the membrane pores 7 2 0 2 nm along with solubilized cd 2 and cv molecules with the permeate this resulted to decrease in rejections of cv cd 2 and rhl with increase in salt concentration experimental results revealed that the nacl concentration of 5 0 kg m 3 was the turning point that led to changing process performance during simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv by meuf at 5 0 kg m 3 of nacl the rejections of cd 2 and cv and the permeate flux were determined as 98 4 98 7 and 61 l m 2 h 1 respectively however beyond this there was a sharp decline in rejections of both cd 2 from 98 4 87 3 and cv from 98 7 89 0 with significant loss 11 5 of surfactant in permeate by increasing nacl concentration in feed from 5 to 30 kg m 3 thus for high nacl concentration it could be suggested to use the membrane with lower pore size for the purpose of obtaining higher rejection of cd 2 and cv and minimal loss of surfactant the presence of salt in feed showed negative effect on permeate flux increasing nacl concentration to the aqueous solution would reduce the repulsion between the charged head groups of the rhl surfactants resulting in easier formation of surfactant micelles in solution compared to the absence of the nacl therefore at high nacl concentration more number of micelles with smaller size were formed and thus forming more compact cake type layer over the membrane surface with increase in value of kc as well as specific cake layer resistance leading to decrease in permeate flux with early onset of cake formation over the membrane surface for instance at the end of experiment vcr 2 the permeate flux decreased from 61 to 56 l m 2 h 1 with increase in kc value from 1 58 105 to 2 1 105 s m 2 by increasing nacl concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 4 2 2 5 effects of rhl concentration in feed and vcr the effects of rhl feed concentration on the profiles of permeate flux solute rejections and cake layer resistance were presented in fig 9 a c the symbols represented experimental flux data with error bar while the solid lines were the predicted results an excellent match between the experimental and model predicted values were depicted the results indicated that a sharp initial flux decline was observed in case of higher surfactant feed concentration an increase in rhl concentration in feed increased the number of rhl vesicles therefore accumulation of the retained rhl vesicles near the membrane surface caused to increase in concentration polarization that led to cake type layer deposition on the membrane surface which offered extra resistance to solvent flow this resulted to increase in cake layer resistance and decrease in permeate flux both the values of k1 and kc were found to increase with increase in rhl feed concentration as observed in fig 9 a c at vcr 2 with increase in rhl feed concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 permeate flux decreased from 64 25 46 2 l m 2 h 1 28 decrease with increase in cake layer resistance from 3 67 1012 to 5 39 1012 m 1 the corresponding values of k1 and kc increased from 0 012 to 0 018 s 1 and 1 4 105 to 1 98 105 s m 2 respectively table 3 with the decrease of time required for onset of cake formation from 306 to 280 s initial feed surfactant concentration also showed significant effects on solute rejections as well as on the vesicle binding constants as presented in table 3 due to presence of more surfactant molecules in the vesicle form at higher rhl feed concentration the number of binding sites of surfactants increased that led to solubilize or bind more cd 2 and cv molecules and thus increasing the rejections of cd 2 and cv the rejections of cd 2 and cv increased from 64 to 96 9 and 89 4 96 9 respectively furthermore the developed model was used to analyze the flux decline behavior up to vcr 4 as shown in fig 9d the model calculations showed excellent agreement with the experimental data the effect of vcr was mainly observed on the cake fouling resistance and permeate flux comparing the permeate flux under the same operating conditions fig 9a d revealed that a lower permeate flux was observed at higher vcr this was due to more accumulation of more rhl vesicles on the membrane surface thus accounted for the increase of cake fouling resistance for instance with increase in vcr from 2 to 4 cake fouling resistance increased from 4 17 1012 to 6 55 1012 resulting in decrease in permeate flux from 61 to 55 8 l m 2 h 1 4 2 3 applicability of the developed model to other meuf study the developed model was also applied to analyze the flux decline behavior and solute rejections during meuf for simultaneous removal of methylene blue mb and cadmium ion cd 2 from aqueous solution using the binary mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether tritonx 100 1 fig 10 showed the comparison between the experimental and predicted flux decline data along with the estimated values of the model parameters symbols and solid line were the experimental and predicted flux data respectively meuf experiments were performed with fixed sds concentration of 4 mm and tritonx 100 to sds molar ratio of 0 5 under batch concentration mode vcr 7 5 at constant pressure of 0 03 mpa the concentration of mb and cd 2 were 6 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the sd and mrpd between experimental and predicted flux values were acceptable being 8 2 and 5 1 respectively corroborating the strong correlation between predicted and experimental flux data the transition time of fouling mechanism was calculated as 283 s which was consistent with the observed trend of flux decline the calculated rejection values mb 99 01 0 41 cd 2 98 06 0 14 agreed well with the experimental rejection values mb 99 2 cd 2 98 4 also the estimated values of micelle binding constant of mb log ks mb and cd 2 log ks cd 2 were found to be 3 9 and 3 62 respectively which were very close to the reported values of 3 95 and 3 65 respectively 1 this clearly indicated that the proposed combined model would be useful for explaining flux decline data that resembled systems containing dilute heavy metal ions and organic compounds with the observed fouling mechanisms 5 conclusions simultaneous removal of cd 2 and cv from aqueous solution was investigated in a stirred cell by meuf using rhamnolipid biosurfactant the detailed parametric study revealed that permeate flux increased with increase in transmembrane pressure difference stirrer speed and feed temperature but decreased with increase in feed concentrations of rhamnolipid and nacl the increase of transmembrane pressure and nacl feed concentration caused substantial decrease in rejection of both cd 2 and cv however stirrer speed and feed temperature had no influence on observed rejection a model based on resistance in series theory coupled with hermia s constant pressure cake filtration model was developed to quantify the flux decline and solute rejection during meuf the model assumed sequential occurrence of initial fouling due to adsorption pore blocking and subsequent fouling due to the growth of cake layer of rhl pollutant aggregates on the membrane surface during meuf using the estimated model parameters the model successfully predicted the profiles of permeate flux vcr fouling resistance retentate concentration and observed rejections of cd 2 cv and rhl with filtration time the predominant fouling mechanism for flux decline was found to be adsorption pore blocking operating conditions showed significant influence on transition time of fouling mechanism analysis of the fouling resistance revealed that the adsorption pore blocking fouling resistance was higher compared to the cake resistance although membrane hydraulic resistance was the dominant one the developed model provided a useful tool to understand the effects of operating conditions on the flux decline behavior and to select the optimal process parameters to obtain a desirable system performance in terms of permeate flux and solute rejection efficiency the developed model was also successfully used to other meuf studies to explain flux decline behavior and solute rejections and thus the model would be useful for explaining flux decline data that resembled systems with the observed fouling mechanisms declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the guru gobind singh indraprastha university delhi

14186,in this study a novel photocatalytic membrane had been successfully fabricated through the incorporation of n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite on polysulfone psf membrane for the photodegradation of pharmaceutical compound namely diclofenac dcf in water the n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites were synthesized with different loadings of n s cqds 1 0 g 1 5 g and 2 0 g on tio2 nanoparticles subsequently the synthesized n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites were deposited on the psf membrane via in situ phase inversion method the membranes were evaluated for the photodegradation of 10 ppm of dcf under uv light and visible light irradiation different characterization techniques including ftir xrd sem edx and sessile drop analysis methods were employed to characterize the membranes the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane exhibited the highest photodegradation performance among the membranes with 62 3 of dcf removal under visible light while the pure tio2 membrane only showed 3 33 removal the study showed that 1 5 g loading of n s cqds on tio2 had successfully shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range and enhanced the photodegradation performance in addition the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane showed improved hydrophilicity with the highest permeability of 277 l m2 hr bar this study demonstrated that n s cqds tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for the photocatalytic membrane fabrication keywords photocatalytic membrane carbon dots visible light pharmaceutical photocatalyst 1 introduction according to the sustainable development goal 6 established by united nation at 2015 approximately 884 million people have no access to safe and affordable drinking water 1 with the rapid development of biomedical science and pharmaceutical industry worldwide production and consumption of pharmaceuticals increased tremendously in recent years as the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis were extremely non biodegradable and pseudo persistent in the environment the conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtp fails to remove these apis completely 2 the incomplete removal of these pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment will result in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args which can be harmful to human praveena et al 3 reported that pharmaceutical wastes such as ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole nitrofurazone and diclofenac dcf were found in lui river selangor river and gombak river in malaysia therefore it is essential to eliminate the pharmaceutical content in the water recently there is an increase of emerging technologies like advanced oxidation processes aops to overcome the inefficiency of conventional wwtp for eliminating pharmaceuticals from water aops involve the use of hydroxyl radicals that generated from oxidation reduction techniques to degrade pharmaceuticals 4 photocatalysis is one of the aops which relies on the formation of hydroxyl radicals to oxidize the pharmaceuticals into less harmful substances however the main drawback of this technology is the difficulty in recovering the photocatalyst in suspension form and reusing in continuous water treatment 5 the unrecovered photocatalyst released into the environment may affect aquatic life and human health 6 by coupling the photocatalyst into membrane fabrication photocatalysts will be evenly dispersed and embedded in the membrane hence the photocatalyst recovery process can be simplified in short the integration of photocatalyst into membrane vis à vis photocatalytic membrane is able to degrade the pollutant produce high quality of permeate and eliminate the hassle in separating the photocatalyst previous studies showed that photocatalytic membrane was able to remove the persistent organic compounds at the same time improved the membrane properties such as hydrophilicity fouling propensity or mechanical strength 7 8 ren et al 9 found that tio2 incorporated in membrane could also control biofouling as the membrane demonstrated excellent removal of arb and args contained in wastewater after uv light illumination besides geng et al 10 showed that tio2 modified membrane exhibited self cleaning capability due to the hydroxyl radicals produced by the tio2 under uv irradiation sun et al 11 also reported that the catalytic removal of bisphenol using iron oxychloride polyvinylidene fluoride feocl pvdf composite membrane was further improved with the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the mostly used semiconductor photocatalyst is titanium dioxide tio2 which is inexpensive possesses stable light absorption and charge transport properties 12 sunlight irradiation usually comprises of 45 of visible light and 5 of uv light 13 however tio2 has a wide band gap energy eg of 3 2 ev and can only be excited by uv light with wavelength of less than 387 nm 14 in order to utilize more visible light which is more energy saving modification need to be done on tio2 to reduce the eg and produce such visible light responsive photocatalyst this could widen the application of tio2 in both uv and visible light range fang et al 15 found that the modification of tio2 by non metal or metal doping and carbon based composite can narrow the eg of tio2 subsequently this can increase the light absorption spectrum and modified the electron density to prevent charge carrier re combination in this study we improved the electrical properties of tio2 semiconductor by coupling with nitrogen and sulphur co doped carbon quantum dots n s cqds from concentrated acid and raw egg yolk sources the elimination of organic chemical and utilization of egg yolk for this cqd synthesis purpose conforms to the concept of green chemistry eggs are chosen as they are rich in proteins carbohydrate and fat that contain a lot of heteroatoms nitrogen sulfur and carbon carbon quantum dots cqds are carbon atoms that form quasi spherical shape with high quantum yield low toxicity and good stability 16 17 cqds particle size is extremely small and exhibits up converted photoluminescence upcl 18 ucpl means wavelength emitted by cqds upon light absorption is less than absorbed light wavelength thus the range of light wavelength that the cqds absorbed can be developed into visible region and near infrared red region the fabrication of cqds normally involves oxidation where oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl cooh carbonyl co and hydroxyl oh are introduced into the molecular structure cqd with conjugated π structure makes it exhibits excellent electron donating and accepting ability 19 ke et al 20 found that nitrogen doped cqds could induce charge delocalization efficiently lower work function of carbon and enhance the photoluminescence properties this was because the size of n atom was similar to carbon atom and it was available to form covalent bonds with carbon atom thus large conjugated carbon structure of cqds was broken and induced the surface defects of cqds this would lead to better electronic conductivity properties to accelerate electron transport as well as increased specific surface area for adsorption of pollutants 21 besides heteroatom sulphur s doping also has the similar function as the n atom which can significantly improve electron concentration of cqds and photo excitation performance 22 ultrafiltration uf with polymeric polysulfone psf membrane has been widely applied because it has good thermal stability superior film forming ability low cost and strong acid and alkaline resistance zhang et al 23 found that in situ phase inversion deposition approach had minimized the entrapment of nanoparticles within the membrane matrix compared to the blending method referring to the study by yang et al 24 blending the psf membrane with tio2 nanoparticles had produced membrane with super hydrophilicity uv resistance and ability to degrade bacteria however the main problem is that tio2 has wide eg which causes radiative re combination to occur thus in this study the tio2 photocatalytic membrane with improved performance was prepared by incorporating nitrogen sulfur cqds n s cqds nanocomposite in psf polymeric membrane through in situ phase inversion process this is the first report on the photodegradation of pseudo persistent pharmaceutical water i e dcf by photocatalytic membranes with visible light active n s cqds tio2 the objectives of this study were to examine the photodegradation performance of immobilized n s co doped cqds tio2 psf membrane by dcf decomposition and to determine the hydrophilicity photocatalytic performance and permeability of the n s cqds tio2 loaded psf membrane 2 experimental 2 1 materials eggs bought from market tio2 nanoparticles with particle size of 21 nm sigma aldrich nitric acid hno3 r m and sulphuric acid h2so4 sigma aldrich were used to synthesize n s co doped cqds tio2 photocatalyst psf polymer solvay polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp sigma aldrich and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp sigma aldrich were used to prepare membrane the nmp was the solvent used to dissolve the psf while pvp was used as membrane pore forming agent dcf alfa aesar was used as the model pharmaceutical in this study 2 2 preparation of n s co doped cqds tio2 photocatalyst solution egg yolk was used in this study due to its high amino acid content which contains n atoms firstly the egg was boiled and the egg yolk was separated from the egg white then the boiled egg yolk was placed in a vacuum oven and dried at 80 c after that the dried and mashed egg yolk was placed in a tube furnace and heated up to 300 c under n2 atmosphere for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 c min to produce black and sticky n doped cqds powder next the sample was cooled to room temperature for one day and a mixture of h2so4 and hno3 was added to the ncqds powder at 120 c for 6 h to produce n s cqds tio2 the ratio of concentrated acid added was 3 1 of h2so4 and hno3 based on volume volume percent v v the yellowish brown solution formed indicated the formation of n s cqds photocatalyst 25 later 0 2 g of tio2 nanoparticles was added to the resulting n s cqds solution after stirring it was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 c for 12 h to form nanocomposite the tem image of the produced n s cqds was presented in figure s1 besides the fluorescent n s cqds displayed green emission under 365 nm wavelength of uv light as shown in figure s2 the n s cqds produced was similar to the sample produced by 26 the amount of egg yolk used in this study was 1 0 g 1 5 g and 2 0 g and hence the nanocomposite samples synthesized in this study were named as 1 0 n s cqds tio2 1 5 n s cqds tio2 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 respectively 2 3 photocatalyst characterization the strong absorption peak wavelength λ for tio2 and n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites was obtained by using uv vis spectrophotometer the eg of the photocatalysts can be estimated using eq 1 by knowing the specific λ for each of the photocatalysts the photodegradation performance for each type of the photocatalyst could be estimated from the shift of light absorption range after the n s cqds doping 1 e g h c λ 1 2408 10 6 λ where eg is the band gap energy ev h is planck s constant 4 1359 10 15 js c is light velocity 3 108 m s and λ is absorption threshold wavelength m 2 4 fabrication of n s co doped cqds tio2 membrane to prepare the membrane casting solution 17 psf and 1 0 of pvp with respect to the weight of psf were dissolved in 83 nmp solvent at 60 c the solution was stirred using magnetic stirrer until it became transparent and homogeneous then the solution was left overnight for degassing distilled water was added into the n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst solution and used as the coagulant bath the amount of tio2 nanoparticles used to fabricate tio2 membrane was 0 2 g which was similar to the amount used to produce n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst in situ phase inversion allowed the formation of membrane and simultaneously immobilized the n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst onto the membrane surface the prepared membrane casting solution was spread onto a dry and clean glass plate using a casting blade adjusted to 200 μm thickness after that the casted solution was smoothly immersed into the coagulant bath which filled with the as prepared n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst the n s cqds tio2 photocatalysts entrapped on psf membrane was formed after complete coagulation the membrane was left inside the coagulant bath with aluminium foil covered for a night this was to ensure complete entrapment of photocatalysts and to avoid exposure of the photocatalytic membrane to light irradiation 2 5 photocatalytic membrane characterization ftir is10 nicolet was used to identify functional groups of the membranes in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 the crystallization phase structure analysis of the membranes was performed by xrd xrd 6000 shidmazu the membrane morphology and surface elemental composition were investigated by sem edx s 3400 n hitachi the cross sectional view of the membrane was prepared by cryogenically fracturing the membrane in liquid nitrogen the membrane surface hydrophilicity can be determined by measuring the static water contact angle swca over the membrane surface using contact angle meter fm40mk2 krüss gmbh the porosity ε and mean pore radius rm of the fabricated membranes could be calculated according to gravimetric method and guerout elford ferry equation as shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 27 28 2 ε w w w d ρ h w w w d ρ h w d ρ c where ww is

test was conducted under three different transmembrane pressures tmps using a dead end cell with a membrane effective surface area of 14 6 cm2 at 1 bar 2 bar and 3 bar then the permeation flux of the

filtration time hours 2 6 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performance of n s cqds tio2 deposited on psf membrane was determined by measuring the rate of photodegradation of dcf solution under a strip of square shape with certain dimension the membranes with area of 25 cm2 were suspended into 200 ml of dcf solution with concentration of 10 ppm under stirring condition prior to photocatalytic reactions the photocatalytic membrane was immersed in the dcf solution for 30 min in the dark condition to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium then the photodegradation process was conducted under uv light 40 w and visible light 12 w irradiation the concentration of the dcf solution was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 agilent in a 30 min interval for 150 min including the initial dcf concentration before and after dark condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis absorption spectra of tio2 and n s cqds tio2 fig 1 shows different optical properties between the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites with different loading compare with pristine tio2 n s cqds tio2 shows a broad uv vis absorption below 400 nm besides it can be observed that the absorption intensity of n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite increased with increasing loading of the ncqds in addition 1 5 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite have better absorption intensity near visible light range 400 nm this confirmed that the n s cqds dopant has the ability to shift the light absorption range of tio2 from uv region to visible light region on the other hand the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 possesses lower absorption intensity near visible light range compare to 1 5 n s cqds tio2 weak visible light absorption by the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 was due to higher dose of the ncqds on n s cqds tio2 which tended to aggregate and reduced the active surface area 30 table 1 shows the bandgap energies of the photocatalysts the reasons of the improvement are explained as follow firstly the introduction of photosensitizer n s cqds to tio2 could effectively favors the spectral response ranging from uv to visible light through newly formed n ti o ti o c and ti o s chemical bonds between ncqds and tio2 photocatalysts 18 the shift of the light absorption range was due to the introduction of n s heteroatoms and carbon energy levels the introduction of the n atom created a mid gap energy state ti3 defect below the cb meanwhile s atom gave s 3p atomic orbital at higher energy than the o 2p atomic which shifted the vb of tio2 upward according to pauling electronegativity concept 31 thus the combination of both n and s heteroatom can lower the band gap energy of tio2 as shown in table 1 32 secondly the smaller particle size of n s cqds exhibited ucpl property due to quantum confinement which absorbed and converted visible light longer wavelength into shorter wavelength and excite tio2 to generate more hydroxyl radical for the dcf degradation 18 thirdly the n s cqds exhibited excellent electron transfer and reservoir due to the conjugated π structure form by n heteroatom binded the neighbour carbon atoms in the form of double bonds 33 for the electron reservoir property the excess excited or received mobile photogenerated electron could move from cb of tio2 to n s cqds which delayed the charge carriers re combination in tio2 lastly referring to the study by ke et al 20 the doping of n and s atom could lower the work function of n s cqds compared to solely cqds by lowering the work function a large barrier between n s cqds and tio2 was formed in another words more photogenerated electrons were efficiently transferred from cb of n s cqds to cb of tio2 through schottky junction until the fermi energy level reached equilibrium 21 therefore the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 had shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range 3 2 characteristics of membranes the chemical structure of the tio2 membrane and n s cqds tio2 membranes with different ncqds dosage were analyzed by ftir as shown in fig 2 all the signature peaks of the pure psf polymer were visible and similar among the membranes 34 the peak at 1583 cm 1 indicates the characteristic stretch of aromatic ring quadrant the peak of 1241 cm 1 is associated with phase stretching of sulfone so2 the peak of 1014 cm 1 represents c oc aryl out of phase stretch the peak at 834 cm 1 shows aromatic para substituted adjacent h wagging the peaks of 690 cm 1 and 558 cm 1 are associated with csc out of phase stretch and so2 scissors deformation respectively besides ftir spectra reveals two important peaks 3438 cm 1 and weak peak at 1660 cm 1 which correspond to oh and co stretching vibrations respectively originated from the n s cqds 18 it can be observed that the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 have a broad peak centre at 3438 cm 1 compared to the others membranes due to the presence of the huge number of hydroxyl groups from the surface of the nanocomposite the co also shows the presence of carboxyl groups in the nanocomposites 26 thus it was anticipated that the incorporation of the n s cqds on tio2 membrane could improve the membrane hydrophilicity the phase structure of the as synthesized tio2 and n s cqds tio2 composites membrane were determined by xrd as shown in figure s3 both diffraction pattern of the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 membranes exhibited similar diffraction peaks indicating the incorporation of the n s cqds tio2 did not alter the crystal structure of tio2 35 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of membrane the photocatalytic ability of the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 membranes towards dcf were evaluated under two light sources which were uv light irradiation λ 380 nm and visible light irradiation λ 400 nm as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively co is the initial concentration of dcf while c is the corresponding concentration in real time as noticed from the figures dcf had been greatly degraded in the first 30 min during dark condition of adsorption desorption equilibrium this was mainly due to the adsorption of the dcf by the n s cqds which was positively correlated with the amounts of n s cqds in the nanocomposites referring to the study by hu et al 36 the improved absorbability of dcf was due to the presence of oxygenated functional groups and this was the main reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic performance among all the n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites the tio2 membrane showed the highest photodegradation rate under the uv light irradiation compared with the visible light irradiation tio2 photocatalyst which had strong absorption peak at 370 nm able to gain much excitation energy under the uv light wavelength and released more photogenerated electron to degrade the pollutant in another words the uv light irradiation gave the highest photodegradation rate due to shorter wavelength 380 nm which provided tio2 with sufficient photoexcitation energy hence the tio2 photocatalyst had sufficient energy to overcome the wide eg of tio2 and excited the electrons from vb to cb 14 referring to fig 3b almost no dcf removal was observed using the tio2 and 1 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes after 2 h visible light irradiation on the other hand the photodegradation efficiency increased 12 59 for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane and 10 65 for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane this revealed that the addition of an appropriate amount of the ncqds on the tio2 could improve the photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposite the photodegradation efficiency of 1 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane did not show much improvement from tio2 membrane this was because the tio2 nanoparticles had negligible emission at visible light range and the lower loading of ncqds in the membrane was not able to shift the light absorption range completely from uv to visible light range and delayed the re combination of photogenerated electrons and holes the 1 0 n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst had higher eg and hence required more excitation energy to excite the localized electron from vb to cb besides the re combination of charge carriers happned faster than interfacial charge transfer when the mobilized electrons in cb fell to vb and re combined with holes due to lower energy available in cb 37 as can be observed from fig 3 the optimum loading of n s cqds was found to be 1 5 g as the photocatalytic activity of the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane was higher than the others membranes the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites displayed a strong and wide emission peak centered at around 380 nm 410 nm as discussed in section 3 1 the optimum loading of ncqds incorporated on n s cqds tio2 had shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range thus the light absorption range for the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 become wider and resulted in higher photocatalysis performance although more ncqds loaded on n s cqds tio2 composite could help to promote the adsorption of dcf superfluous dcf accumulation on photocatalyst surface could suppress the substance migration in addition the active sites of tio2 surface would also be buried by the overloaded ncqds 36 the resulted hindrance of photodegradation process explained the lower photocatalytic efficiency for the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 compared to the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane as presented in fig 3 besides the eg of the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 was high and required more excitation energy to overcome the barrier as a result 2 0 n s cqds tio2 photocatalytic membrane produced lesser amount of photogenerated electrons and holes which were responsible for the dcf photodegradation in this study the insignificant photocatalytic degradation of the membranes fig 3b could be related to several reasons such as high adsorption which prevent the subsequent degradation through oxidation and desorption processes low lamp power 12 w and low amount of n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst incorporated in the membrane the effect of membrane area on the photodegradation process was studied using 1 5 n s cqds tio2 under initial dcf concentration of 10 ppm visible light irradiation and contact time of 2 h the exposed surface area of photocatalytic membrane is a key factor in photodegradation process based on fig 4 the photodegradation efficiency increased 13 54 from membrane area of 9 cm2 to 25 cm2 this was because more active sites of n s cqds tio2 photocatalysts on psf membrane were available for the photodegradation process and guaranteed a good contact between photocatalysts and the dcf pollutants although increasing photocatalytic membrane area can gives higher photodegradation efficiency oversize of membrane area will result in bigger foot print higher fabrication and membrane cleaning cost 3 4 membrane permeability and hydrophilicity the contact angle of the membranes are shown in table 2 the swca decreased as the loading of ncqds increased in the membranes from 66 67 to 49 71 this revealed that the deposition of n s cqds onto tio2 and subsequently attached on the membrane surface had improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane 24 hence the surface density of the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups increased on the membrane surface and resulted in improved hydrophilicity 38 on the other hand the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane showed high contact angle value due to excessive loading of the ncqds that aggregated and positioned irregularly on the membrane surface hydrophilicity plays an important role in affecting membrane porosity and pore size referring to table 2 the membrane porosity and mean pore size increased with the increment of n s cqds loading up to 1 5 g and decreased afterwards the porosity of the membrane increased from 79 88 for tio2 membrane to 81 29 for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane however the excessive ncqds loading showed negative effect on membrane porosity 78 88 similar trend was observed for the mean pore size of the membrane the average pore size increased from 73 70 μm for tio2 membrane to 77 20 μm for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane but dropped to 73 10 μm for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane the improvement in hydrophilicity of the membrane was due to doping of hydroxyl group of n s cqds which could speed up solvent and non solvent de mixing process and facilitated the formation of porous structure 39 the overall mechanism of the in situ phase inversion process was that the hydrophilic n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites migrated spontaneously to the interface between the uf membrane and water due to large difference of interfacial energy hence causing an increment of hydrophilic nanoparticles deposition on the surface of the membrane 40 on the other hand when the loading of n s cqds tio2 increased the increment of the viscosity of prepared suspension could hinder the exchange rate between nmp and n s cqds tio2 during the polymer precipitation process thus resulted in the aggregation of irregular positioning of n s cqds tio2 nanoparticles on the membrane pore and reduced the effective surface area of the nanocomposite 41 as a consequence membrane with less porosity was produced and resulted in lower permeation flux the effect of the incorporation of n s cqds with tio2 on the permeability of the photocatalytic membrane was studied under three different transmembrane pressures tmps as shown in fig 5 it can be observed that all of the studied membranes showed the similar trend where the pure water permeation flux increased with increasing tmp maximizing at 3 bar which was the principle driving force responsible for membrane filtration 42 the permeability of the photocatalytic membranes increased with the increment of ncqds loading and then decreased rapidly when the loading of ncqds reached 2 0 g for instance for tmp of 1 bar the permeation flux of the tio2 membrane was 203 72 l m2hr and increased steadily until it reached 277 80 l m2hr for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane but dropped to 188 63 l m2hr for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane the 1 5 g loading of ncqds showed great improvement in hydrophilicity properties and provided more open asymmetric membrane structure to attract water molecules to flow into the membrane matrix and promoted them to pass through the membrane under tmp driving force 43 the porous structure of the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane could be observed via sem which will be discussed in section 3 5 referring to the porosity and mean pore size results in table 2 we can further confirmed that the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane had the highest flux compare to others membranes due to high connection between membrane pore structure and bigger pore size which allowed water to pass through 3 5 membrane morphology and elemental composition in order to understand the influence of photocatalyst embedding on the psf membrane structure and their overall composition the plane and cross sectional of the photocatalytic membranes were observed using sem edx the sem images in fig 6 show the highly porous membrane surface topped with a layer of photocatalysts the pores of tio2 membrane could be seen clearly as the layer of tio2 nanoparticles deposited on the membrane surface was thin compared with the n s cqds tio2 membranes the pore structure of 1 5 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes were not obvious due to irregular positioning of nanoparticles and higher concentration of sol in the coagulation bath formed a dense selective top layer on the membrane surface 23 referring to the cross sectional view in fig 7 all the photocatalytic membranes exhibits a typical asymmetric structure which consists of a thin dense top layer and a porous sublayer the tio2 membrane in fig 7a shows finger like structure with narrow pores the introduction of the hydrophilic n s cqds had widen the pore channels of the sublayer of the membranes compare to the tio2 membrane fig 7b to fig 7d as the loading of the hydrophilic ncqds increased the inflow of the non solvent water accelerated and the mass transfer was enhanced during the phase inversion process as a results the finger like pores in these membranes become bigger gradually the intermediate layer shows a sponge like structure and the thickness of the skin layer declined as shown in fig 7b and 7c 44 however when the loading of the ncqds increased to 2 0 g pore wall was formed in the sublayer and macro void size reduced as shown in fig 7d 40 hence the porosity of the membrane decreased this might due to the delay in liquid liquid de mixing process arising from the higher viscosity of the polymeric solution and slower phase inversion rate 39 these results are well consistent with the membrane porosity as reported in section 3 4 the elemental composition of the membranes were confirmed through edx analysis as shown in table 3 from the edx spectra table 3 and figure s4 peaks associated with the composition of carbon c oxygen o and sulphur s confirmed that the membrane was indeed pure psf 41 the tio2 membrane showed the peak of titanium ti due to the presence of tio2 and no peak for n was noticed from the analysis this indicated that the membrane only incorporated with tio2 photocatalyst for the n s cqds tio2 membranes there was an additional peak of nitrogen n ti and increment of s content compare to the tio2 membrane this confirmed the incorporation of n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst in the membranes which promoted better photocatalytic performance 45 besides the ratios of n to c are 0 0254 0 0169 0 0208 for the 1 0 n s cqds tio2 1 5 n s cqds tio2 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes respectively the ratio of n to c was the lowest when the ncqds loading increased to 1 5 g suggesting that some of the functional groups containing n were converted into carboxylic functional group as reported by zhang et al 46 therefore the amount of o increased and resulted in higher hydrophilicity 3 6 possible mechanism of photodegradation process based on the results discussed in section 3 3 a plausible mechanism for photocatalytic degradation by the n s cqds tio2 membrane was proposed schematically as shown in fig 8 firstly the dcf was adsorbed on the psf membrane surface deposited with n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst secondly when the membrane was exposed to light the localized electrons in the vb of tio2 and n s cqds were excited to their cb and holes were generated in the vb the cb of the n s cqds was located above the cb of tio2 due to the more negative fermi energy of the n s cqds compared to the tio2 which provided a driving force for photogenerated electron injection 47 therefore the photogenerated electrons flowed from the cb of n s cqds to the cb of tio2 which formed the schottky junction in the n s cqds tio2 membrane and generated an electromagnetic field that improved the efficiency of charge carrier separation 48 this confirmed that the n s cqds could act as an electron donor the transfer of delocalized photogenerated electron from the cb of n s cqds to the cb of tio2 also resulted the generation of ti3 defects in the tio2 matrix and favored the o2 adsorption on the membrane surface 36 thus more superoxide radicals could be generated to degrade dcf effectively these superoxide radicals not only directly oxidize organic pollutants 49 but also responsible for the generation of hydroxyl radicals according to the following reactions 50 5 o2 e o2 6 2o2 2h 2 oh o2 both oh and o2 contributed to the degradation of dcf 51 thirdly the deposition of the n s cqds on the tio2 could widen the light absorption range and helped harnessing the full spectrum of environment light this could be related to the ucpl properties of n s cqds that emitted shorter light wavelength 380 nm from longer absorbed light wavelength 400 nm 18 in another word it meant that the emission energy of photon from light source was larger than the excitation energy lastly the n s cqds photocatalyst also could act as an electron acceptor where photogenerated electrons on cb of the tio2 tended to transfer to the n s cqds this resulted in an efficient electrons and holes separation and enhanced photocatalytic activity 13 as a result the photoinduced electrons on the surface of membrane could further oxidize h2o to produce hydroxyl radical meanwhile the superoxide radicals would be formed by the combination of photogenerated electron with the adsorbed dissolved oxygen molecules from the membrane both of these radicals were extremely strong oxidants for the decomposition of the dcf 4 conclusions and recommendations in this work a novel type of tio2 membrane had been successfully produced through the incorporation of the n s cqds for the employment in the photodegradation of dcf pharmaceutical in water the resulting n s cqds tio2 membranes exhibited excellent photodegradation ability for removing dcf from water under the visible light irradiation the n s cqds tio2 membrane with 1 5 g of ncqds loading showed the highest photodegradation efficiency among the membranes the optimum operating condition were found achieving at the ncqds loading of 1 5 g membrane area of 25 cm2 and under visible light giving rise to the removal efficiency of 62 3 and average permeation flux of 277 l m2 hr bar besides the n s cqds tio2 membranes showed improved hydrophilicity membrane porosity and pure water permeation flux compared to the tio2 membrane due to the presence of hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups on the psf membrane there are a few recommendations for further study to improve the performance of the modified membrane in the pharmaceutical waste removal different coating methods or additional treatment steps for the n s cqds tio2 membrane shall be explored for stable binding of the photocatalyst onto the psf membrane surface the membrane can be tested in membrane photoreactor to further study the retention time of the photodegradation process under continuous flow mode furthermore it is worth to investigate biomass based cqd in establishing a greener membrane technology in summary the n s cqds tio2 membrane have great potential for water purification applications which however required to be explored more thoroughly

14186,in this study a novel photocatalytic membrane had been successfully fabricated through the incorporation of n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite on polysulfone psf membrane for the photodegradation of pharmaceutical compound namely diclofenac dcf in water the n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites were synthesized with different loadings of n s cqds 1 0 g 1 5 g and 2 0 g on tio2 nanoparticles subsequently the synthesized n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites were deposited on the psf membrane via in situ phase inversion method the membranes were evaluated for the photodegradation of 10 ppm of dcf under uv light and visible light irradiation different characterization techniques including ftir xrd sem edx and sessile drop analysis methods were employed to characterize the membranes the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane exhibited the highest photodegradation performance among the membranes with 62 3 of dcf removal under visible light while the pure tio2 membrane only showed 3 33 removal the study showed that 1 5 g loading of n s cqds on tio2 had successfully shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range and enhanced the photodegradation performance in addition the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane showed improved hydrophilicity with the highest permeability of 277 l m2 hr bar this study demonstrated that n s cqds tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for the photocatalytic membrane fabrication keywords photocatalytic membrane carbon dots visible light pharmaceutical photocatalyst 1 introduction according to the sustainable development goal 6 established by united nation at 2015 approximately 884 million people have no access to safe and affordable drinking water 1 with the rapid development of biomedical science and pharmaceutical industry worldwide production and consumption of pharmaceuticals increased tremendously in recent years as the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis were extremely non biodegradable and pseudo persistent in the environment the conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtp fails to remove these apis completely 2 the incomplete removal of these pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment will result in the formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistant genes args which can be harmful to human praveena et al 3 reported that pharmaceutical wastes such as ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole nitrofurazone and diclofenac dcf were found in lui river selangor river and gombak river in malaysia therefore it is essential to eliminate the pharmaceutical content in the water recently there is an increase of emerging technologies like advanced oxidation processes aops to overcome the inefficiency of conventional wwtp for eliminating pharmaceuticals from water aops involve the use of hydroxyl radicals that generated from oxidation reduction techniques to degrade pharmaceuticals 4 photocatalysis is one of the aops which relies on the formation of hydroxyl radicals to oxidize the pharmaceuticals into less harmful substances however the main drawback of this technology is the difficulty in recovering the photocatalyst in suspension form and reusing in continuous water treatment 5 the unrecovered photocatalyst released into the environment may affect aquatic life and human health 6 by coupling the photocatalyst into membrane fabrication photocatalysts will be evenly dispersed and embedded in the membrane hence the photocatalyst recovery process can be simplified in short the integration of photocatalyst into membrane vis à vis photocatalytic membrane is able to degrade the pollutant produce high quality of permeate and eliminate the hassle in separating the photocatalyst previous studies showed that photocatalytic membrane was able to remove the persistent organic compounds at the same time improved the membrane properties such as hydrophilicity fouling propensity or mechanical strength 7 8 ren et al 9 found that tio2 incorporated in membrane could also control biofouling as the membrane demonstrated excellent removal of arb and args contained in wastewater after uv light illumination besides geng et al 10 showed that tio2 modified membrane exhibited self cleaning capability due to the hydroxyl radicals produced by the tio2 under uv irradiation sun et al 11 also reported that the catalytic removal of bisphenol using iron oxychloride polyvinylidene fluoride feocl pvdf composite membrane was further improved with the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the mostly used semiconductor photocatalyst is titanium dioxide tio2 which is inexpensive possesses stable light absorption and charge transport properties 12 sunlight irradiation usually comprises of 45 of visible light and 5 of uv light 13 however tio2 has a wide band gap energy eg of 3 2 ev and can only be excited by uv light with wavelength of less than 387 nm 14 in order to utilize more visible light which is more energy saving modification need to be done on tio2 to reduce the eg and produce such visible light responsive photocatalyst this could widen the application of tio2 in both uv and visible light range fang et al 15 found that the modification of tio2 by non metal or metal doping and carbon based composite can narrow the eg of tio2 subsequently this can increase the light absorption spectrum and modified the electron density to prevent charge carrier re combination in this study we improved the electrical properties of tio2 semiconductor by coupling with nitrogen and sulphur co doped carbon quantum dots n s cqds from concentrated acid and raw egg yolk sources the elimination of organic chemical and utilization of egg yolk for this cqd synthesis purpose conforms to the concept of green chemistry eggs are chosen as they are rich in proteins carbohydrate and fat that contain a lot of heteroatoms nitrogen sulfur and carbon carbon quantum dots cqds are carbon atoms that form quasi spherical shape with high quantum yield low toxicity and good stability 16 17 cqds particle size is extremely small and exhibits up converted photoluminescence upcl 18 ucpl means wavelength emitted by cqds upon light absorption is less than absorbed light wavelength thus the range of light wavelength that the cqds absorbed can be developed into visible region and near infrared red region the fabrication of cqds normally involves oxidation where oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl cooh carbonyl co and hydroxyl oh are introduced into the molecular structure cqd with conjugated π structure makes it exhibits excellent electron donating and accepting ability 19 ke et al 20 found that nitrogen doped cqds could induce charge delocalization efficiently lower work function of carbon and enhance the photoluminescence properties this was because the size of n atom was similar to carbon atom and it was available to form covalent bonds with carbon atom thus large conjugated carbon structure of cqds was broken and induced the surface defects of cqds this would lead to better electronic conductivity properties to accelerate electron transport as well as increased specific surface area for adsorption of pollutants 21 besides heteroatom sulphur s doping also has the similar function as the n atom which can significantly improve electron concentration of cqds and photo excitation performance 22 ultrafiltration uf with polymeric polysulfone psf membrane has been widely applied because it has good thermal stability superior film forming ability low cost and strong acid and alkaline resistance zhang et al 23 found that in situ phase inversion deposition approach had minimized the entrapment of nanoparticles within the membrane matrix compared to the blending method referring to the study by yang et al 24 blending the psf membrane with tio2 nanoparticles had produced membrane with super hydrophilicity uv resistance and ability to degrade bacteria however the main problem is that tio2 has wide eg which causes radiative re combination to occur thus in this study the tio2 photocatalytic membrane with improved performance was prepared by incorporating nitrogen sulfur cqds n s cqds nanocomposite in psf polymeric membrane through in situ phase inversion process this is the first report on the photodegradation of pseudo persistent pharmaceutical water i e dcf by photocatalytic membranes with visible light active n s cqds tio2 the objectives of this study were to examine the photodegradation performance of immobilized n s co doped cqds tio2 psf membrane by dcf decomposition and to determine the hydrophilicity photocatalytic performance and permeability of the n s cqds tio2 loaded psf membrane 2 experimental 2 1 materials eggs bought from market tio2 nanoparticles with particle size of 21 nm sigma aldrich nitric acid hno3 r m and sulphuric acid h2so4 sigma aldrich were used to synthesize n s co doped cqds tio2 photocatalyst psf polymer solvay polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp sigma aldrich and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp sigma aldrich were used to prepare membrane the nmp was the solvent used to dissolve the psf while pvp was used as membrane pore forming agent dcf alfa aesar was used as the model pharmaceutical in this study 2 2 preparation of n s co doped cqds tio2 photocatalyst solution egg yolk was used in this study due to its high amino acid content which contains n atoms firstly the egg was boiled and the egg yolk was separated from the egg white then the boiled egg yolk was placed in a vacuum oven and dried at 80 c after that the dried and mashed egg yolk was placed in a tube furnace and heated up to 300 c under n2 atmosphere for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 c min to produce black and sticky n doped cqds powder next the sample was cooled to room temperature for one day and a mixture of h2so4 and hno3 was added to the ncqds powder at 120 c for 6 h to produce n s cqds tio2 the ratio of concentrated acid added was 3 1 of h2so4 and hno3 based on volume volume percent v v the yellowish brown solution formed indicated the formation of n s cqds photocatalyst 25 later 0 2 g of tio2 nanoparticles was added to the resulting n s cqds solution after stirring it was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 c for 12 h to form nanocomposite the tem image of the produced n s cqds was presented in figure s1 besides the fluorescent n s cqds displayed green emission under 365 nm wavelength of uv light as shown in figure s2 the n s cqds produced was similar to the sample produced by 26 the amount of egg yolk used in this study was 1 0 g 1 5 g and 2 0 g and hence the nanocomposite samples synthesized in this study were named as 1 0 n s cqds tio2 1 5 n s cqds tio2 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 respectively 2 3 photocatalyst characterization the strong absorption peak wavelength λ for tio2 and n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites was obtained by using uv vis spectrophotometer the eg of the photocatalysts can be estimated using eq 1 by knowing the specific λ for each of the photocatalysts the photodegradation performance for each type of the photocatalyst could be estimated from the shift of light absorption range after the n s cqds doping 1 e

cqds tio2 membrane to prepare the membrane casting solution 17 psf and 1 0 of pvp with respect to the weight of psf were dissolved in 83 nmp solvent at 60 c the solution was stirred using magnetic stirrer until it became transparent and homogeneous then the solution was left overnight for degassing distilled water was added into the n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst solution and used as the coagulant bath the amount of tio2 nanoparticles used to fabricate tio2 membrane was 0 2 g which was similar to the amount used to produce n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst in situ phase inversion allowed the formation of membrane and simultaneously immobilized the n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst onto the membrane surface the prepared membrane casting solution was spread onto a dry and clean glass plate using a casting blade adjusted to 200 μm thickness after that the casted solution was smoothly immersed into the coagulant bath which filled with the as prepared n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst the n s cqds tio2 photocatalysts entrapped on psf membrane was formed after complete coagulation the membrane was left inside the coagulant bath with aluminium foil covered for a night this was to ensure complete entrapment of photocatalysts and to avoid exposure of the photocatalytic membrane to light irradiation 2 5 photocatalytic membrane characterization ftir is10 nicolet was used to identify functional groups of the membranes in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 the crystallization phase structure analysis of the membranes was performed by xrd xrd 6000 shidmazu the membrane morphology and surface elemental composition were investigated by sem edx s 3400 n hitachi the cross sectional view of the membrane was prepared by cryogenically fracturing the membrane in liquid nitrogen the membrane surface hydrophilicity can be determined by measuring the static water contact angle swca over the membrane surface using contact angle meter fm40mk2 krüss gmbh the porosity ε and mean pore radius rm of the fabricated membranes could be calculated according to gravimetric method and guerout elford ferry equation as shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 27 28 2 ε w w w d ρ h w w w d ρ h w d ρ c where ww is

test was conducted under three different transmembrane pressures tmps using a dead end cell with a membrane effective surface area of 14 6 cm2 at 1 bar 2 bar and 3 bar then the permeation flux of the membrane was calculated using eq 4 29 4 j p v a t where jp is the membrane permeation flux at time t l m2 hr v is the volume of permeate l a is the cross sectional area of membrane m2 and t is the filtration time hours 2 6 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic performance of n s cqds tio2 deposited on psf membrane was determined by measuring the rate of photodegradation of dcf solution under a strip of square shape with certain dimension the membranes with area of 25 cm2 were suspended into 200 ml of dcf solution with concentration of 10 ppm under stirring condition prior to photocatalytic reactions the photocatalytic membrane was immersed in the dcf solution for 30 min in the dark condition to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium then the photodegradation process was conducted under uv light 40 w and visible light 12 w irradiation the concentration of the dcf solution was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 agilent in a 30 min interval for 150 min including the initial dcf concentration before and after dark condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis absorption spectra of tio2 and n s cqds tio2 fig 1 shows different optical properties between the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites with different loading compare with pristine tio2 n s cqds tio2 shows a broad uv vis absorption below 400 nm besides it can be observed that the absorption intensity of n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite increased with increasing loading of the ncqds in addition 1 5 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 nanocomposite have better absorption intensity near visible light range 400 nm this confirmed that the n s cqds dopant has the ability to shift the light absorption range of tio2 from uv region to visible light region on the other hand the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 possesses lower absorption intensity near visible light range compare to 1 5 n s cqds tio2 weak visible light absorption by the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 was due to higher dose of the ncqds on n s cqds tio2 which tended to aggregate and reduced the active surface area 30 table 1 shows the bandgap energies of the photocatalysts the reasons of the improvement are explained as follow firstly the introduction of photosensitizer n s cqds to tio2 could effectively favors the spectral response ranging from uv to visible light through newly formed n ti o ti o c and ti o s chemical bonds between ncqds and tio2 photocatalysts 18 the shift of the light absorption range was due to the introduction of n s heteroatoms and carbon energy levels the introduction of the n atom created a mid gap energy state ti3 defect below the cb meanwhile s atom gave s 3p atomic orbital at higher energy than the o 2p atomic which shifted the vb of tio2 upward according to pauling electronegativity concept 31 thus the combination of both n and s heteroatom can lower the band gap energy of tio2 as shown in table 1 32 secondly the smaller particle size of n s cqds exhibited ucpl property due to quantum confinement which absorbed and converted visible light longer wavelength into shorter wavelength and excite tio2 to generate more hydroxyl radical for the dcf degradation 18 thirdly the n s cqds exhibited excellent electron transfer and reservoir due to the conjugated π structure form by n heteroatom binded the neighbour carbon atoms in the form of double bonds 33 for the electron reservoir property the excess excited or received mobile photogenerated electron could move from cb of tio2 to n s cqds which delayed the charge carriers re combination in tio2 lastly referring to the study by ke et al 20 the doping of n and s atom could lower the work function of n s cqds compared to solely cqds by lowering the work function a large barrier between n s cqds and tio2 was formed in another words more photogenerated electrons were efficiently transferred from cb of n s cqds to cb of tio2 through schottky junction until the fermi energy level reached equilibrium 21 therefore the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 had shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range 3 2 characteristics of membranes the chemical structure of the tio2 membrane and n s cqds tio2 membranes with different ncqds dosage were analyzed by ftir as shown in fig 2 all the signature peaks of the pure psf polymer were visible and similar among the membranes 34 the peak at 1583 cm 1 indicates the characteristic stretch of aromatic ring quadrant the peak of 1241 cm 1 is associated with phase stretching of sulfone so2 the peak of 1014 cm 1 represents c oc aryl out of phase stretch the peak at 834 cm 1 shows aromatic para substituted adjacent h wagging the peaks of 690 cm 1 and 558 cm 1 are associated with csc out of phase stretch and so2 scissors deformation respectively besides ftir spectra reveals two important peaks 3438 cm 1 and weak peak at 1660 cm 1 which correspond to oh and co stretching vibrations respectively originated from the n s cqds 18 it can be observed that the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 have a broad peak centre at 3438 cm 1 compared to the others membranes due to the presence of the huge number of hydroxyl groups from the surface of the nanocomposite the co also shows the presence of carboxyl groups in the nanocomposites 26 thus it was anticipated that the incorporation of the n s cqds on tio2 membrane could improve the membrane hydrophilicity the phase structure of the as synthesized tio2 and n s cqds tio2 composites membrane were determined by xrd as shown in figure s3 both diffraction pattern of the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 membranes exhibited similar diffraction peaks indicating the incorporation of the n s cqds tio2 did not alter the crystal structure of tio2 35 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of membrane the photocatalytic ability of the tio2 and n s cqds tio2 membranes towards dcf were evaluated under two light sources which were uv light irradiation λ 380 nm and visible light irradiation λ 400 nm as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively co is the initial concentration of dcf while c is the corresponding concentration in real time as noticed from the figures dcf had been greatly degraded in the first 30 min during dark condition of adsorption desorption equilibrium this was mainly due to the adsorption of the dcf by the n s cqds which was positively correlated with the amounts of n s cqds in the nanocomposites referring to the study by hu et al 36 the improved absorbability of dcf was due to the presence of oxygenated functional groups and this was the main reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic performance among all the n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites the tio2 membrane showed the highest photodegradation rate under the uv light irradiation compared with the visible light irradiation tio2 photocatalyst which had strong absorption peak at 370 nm able to gain much excitation energy under the uv light wavelength and released more photogenerated electron to degrade the pollutant in another words the uv light irradiation gave the highest photodegradation rate due to shorter wavelength 380 nm which provided tio2 with sufficient photoexcitation energy hence the tio2 photocatalyst had sufficient energy to overcome the wide eg of tio2 and excited the electrons from vb to cb 14 referring to fig 3b almost no dcf removal was observed using the tio2 and 1 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes after 2 h visible light irradiation on the other hand the photodegradation efficiency increased 12 59 for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane and 10 65 for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane this revealed that the addition of an appropriate amount of the ncqds on the tio2 could improve the photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposite the photodegradation efficiency of 1 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane did not show much improvement from tio2 membrane this was because the tio2 nanoparticles had negligible emission at visible light range and the lower loading of ncqds in the membrane was not able to shift the light absorption range completely from uv to visible light range and delayed the re combination of photogenerated electrons and holes the 1 0 n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst had higher eg and hence required more excitation energy to excite the localized electron from vb to cb besides the re combination of charge carriers happned faster than interfacial charge transfer when the mobilized electrons in cb fell to vb and re combined with holes due to lower energy available in cb 37 as can be observed from fig 3 the optimum loading of n s cqds was found to be 1 5 g as the photocatalytic activity of the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane was higher than the others membranes the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites displayed a strong and wide emission peak centered at around 380 nm 410 nm as discussed in section 3 1 the optimum loading of ncqds incorporated on n s cqds tio2 had shifted and broadening the light absorption wavelength from uv range to visible light range thus the light absorption range for the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 become wider and resulted in higher photocatalysis performance although more ncqds loaded on n s cqds tio2 composite could help to promote the adsorption of dcf superfluous dcf accumulation on photocatalyst surface could suppress the substance migration in addition the active sites of tio2 surface would also be buried by the overloaded ncqds 36 the resulted hindrance of photodegradation process explained the lower photocatalytic efficiency for the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 compared to the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane as presented in fig 3 besides the eg of the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 was high and required more excitation energy to overcome the barrier as a result 2 0 n s cqds tio2 photocatalytic membrane produced lesser amount of photogenerated electrons and holes which were responsible for the dcf photodegradation in this study the insignificant photocatalytic degradation of the membranes fig 3b could be related to several reasons such as high adsorption which prevent the subsequent degradation through oxidation and desorption processes low lamp power 12 w and low amount of n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst incorporated in the membrane the effect of membrane area on the photodegradation process was studied using 1 5 n s cqds tio2 under initial dcf concentration of 10 ppm visible light irradiation and contact time of 2 h the exposed surface area of photocatalytic membrane is a key factor in photodegradation process based on fig 4 the photodegradation efficiency increased 13 54 from membrane area of 9 cm2 to 25 cm2 this was because more active sites of n s cqds tio2 photocatalysts on psf membrane were available for the photodegradation process and guaranteed a good contact between photocatalysts and the dcf pollutants although increasing photocatalytic membrane area can gives higher photodegradation efficiency oversize of membrane area will result in bigger foot print higher fabrication and membrane cleaning cost 3 4 membrane permeability and hydrophilicity the contact angle of the membranes are shown in table 2 the swca decreased as the loading of ncqds increased in the membranes from 66 67 to 49 71 this revealed that the deposition of n s cqds onto tio2 and subsequently attached on the membrane surface had improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane 24 hence the surface density of the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups increased on the membrane surface and resulted in improved hydrophilicity 38 on the other hand the 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane showed high contact angle value due to excessive loading of the ncqds that aggregated and positioned irregularly on the membrane surface hydrophilicity plays an important role in affecting membrane porosity and pore size referring to table 2 the membrane porosity and mean pore size increased with the increment of n s cqds loading up to 1 5 g and decreased afterwards the porosity of the membrane increased from 79 88 for tio2 membrane to 81 29 for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane however the excessive ncqds loading showed negative effect on membrane porosity 78 88 similar trend was observed for the mean pore size of the membrane the average pore size increased from 73 70 μm for tio2 membrane to 77 20 μm for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane but dropped to 73 10 μm for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane the improvement in hydrophilicity of the membrane was due to doping of hydroxyl group of n s cqds which could speed up solvent and non solvent de mixing process and facilitated the formation of porous structure 39 the overall mechanism of the in situ phase inversion process was that the hydrophilic n s cqds tio2 nanocomposites migrated spontaneously to the interface between the uf membrane and water due to large difference of interfacial energy hence causing an increment of hydrophilic nanoparticles deposition on the surface of the membrane 40 on the other hand when the loading of n s cqds tio2 increased the increment of the viscosity of prepared suspension could hinder the exchange rate between nmp and n s cqds tio2 during the polymer precipitation process thus resulted in the aggregation of irregular positioning of n s cqds tio2 nanoparticles on the membrane pore and reduced the effective surface area of the nanocomposite 41 as a consequence membrane with less porosity was produced and resulted in lower permeation flux the effect of the incorporation of n s cqds with tio2 on the permeability of the photocatalytic membrane was studied under three different transmembrane pressures tmps as shown in fig 5 it can be observed that all of the studied membranes showed the similar trend where the pure water permeation flux increased with increasing tmp maximizing at 3 bar which was the principle driving force responsible for membrane filtration 42 the permeability of the photocatalytic membranes increased with the increment of ncqds loading and then decreased rapidly when the loading of ncqds reached 2 0 g for instance for tmp of 1 bar the permeation flux of the tio2 membrane was 203 72 l m2hr and increased steadily until it reached 277 80 l m2hr for 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane but dropped to 188 63 l m2hr for 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membrane the 1 5 g loading of ncqds showed great improvement in hydrophilicity properties and provided more open asymmetric membrane structure to attract water molecules to flow into the membrane matrix and promoted them to pass through the membrane under tmp driving force 43 the porous structure of the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane could be observed via sem which will be discussed in section 3 5 referring to the porosity and mean pore size results in table 2 we can further confirmed that the 1 5 n s cqds tio2 membrane had the highest flux compare to others membranes due to high connection between membrane pore structure and bigger pore size which allowed water to pass through 3 5 membrane morphology and elemental composition in order to understand the influence of photocatalyst embedding on the psf membrane structure and their overall composition the plane and cross sectional of the photocatalytic membranes were observed using sem edx the sem images in fig 6 show the highly porous membrane surface topped with a layer of photocatalysts the pores of tio2 membrane could be seen clearly as the layer of tio2 nanoparticles deposited on the membrane surface was thin compared with the n s cqds tio2 membranes the pore structure of 1 5 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes were not obvious due to irregular positioning of nanoparticles and higher concentration of sol in the coagulation bath formed a dense selective top layer on the membrane surface 23 referring to the cross sectional view in fig 7 all the photocatalytic membranes exhibits a typical asymmetric structure which consists of a thin dense top layer and a porous sublayer the tio2 membrane in fig 7a shows finger like structure with narrow pores the introduction of the hydrophilic n s cqds had widen the pore channels of the sublayer of the membranes compare to the tio2 membrane fig 7b to fig 7d as the loading of the hydrophilic ncqds increased the inflow of the non solvent water accelerated and the mass transfer was enhanced during the phase inversion process as a results the finger like pores in these membranes become bigger gradually the intermediate layer shows a sponge like structure and the thickness of the skin layer declined as shown in fig 7b and 7c 44 however when the loading of the ncqds increased to 2 0 g pore wall was formed in the sublayer and macro void size reduced as shown in fig 7d 40 hence the porosity of the membrane decreased this might due to the delay in liquid liquid de mixing process arising from the higher viscosity of the polymeric solution and slower phase inversion rate 39 these results are well consistent with the membrane porosity as reported in section 3 4 the elemental composition of the membranes were confirmed through edx analysis as shown in table 3 from the edx spectra table 3 and figure s4 peaks associated with the composition of carbon c oxygen o and sulphur s confirmed that the membrane was indeed pure psf 41 the tio2 membrane showed the peak of titanium ti due to the presence of tio2 and no peak for n was noticed from the analysis this indicated that the membrane only incorporated with tio2 photocatalyst for the n s cqds tio2 membranes there was an additional peak of nitrogen n ti and increment of s content compare to the tio2 membrane this confirmed the incorporation of n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst in the membranes which promoted better photocatalytic performance 45 besides the ratios of n to c are 0 0254 0 0169 0 0208 for the 1 0 n s cqds tio2 1 5 n s cqds tio2 and 2 0 n s cqds tio2 membranes respectively the ratio of n to c was the lowest when the ncqds loading increased to 1 5 g suggesting that some of the functional groups containing n were converted into carboxylic functional group as reported by zhang et al 46 therefore the amount of o increased and resulted in higher hydrophilicity 3 6 possible mechanism of photodegradation process based on the results discussed in section 3 3 a plausible mechanism for photocatalytic degradation by the n s cqds tio2 membrane was proposed schematically as shown in fig 8 firstly the dcf was adsorbed on the psf membrane surface deposited with n s cqds tio2 photocatalyst secondly when the membrane was exposed to light the localized electrons in the vb of tio2 and n s cqds were excited to their cb and holes were generated in the vb the cb of the n s cqds was located above the cb of tio2 due to the more negative fermi energy of the n s cqds compared to the tio2 which provided a driving force for photogenerated electron injection 47 therefore the photogenerated electrons flowed from the cb of n s cqds to the cb of tio2 which formed the schottky junction in the n s cqds tio2 membrane and generated an electromagnetic field that improved the efficiency of charge carrier separation 48 this confirmed that the n s cqds could act as an electron donor the transfer of delocalized photogenerated electron from the cb of n s cqds to the cb of tio2 also resulted the generation of ti3 defects in the tio2 matrix and favored the o2 adsorption on the membrane surface 36 thus more superoxide radicals could be generated to degrade dcf effectively these superoxide radicals not only directly oxidize organic pollutants 49 but also responsible for the generation of hydroxyl radicals according to the following reactions 50 5 o2 e o2 6 2o2 2h 2 oh o2 both oh and o2 contributed to the degradation of dcf 51 thirdly the deposition of the n s cqds on the tio2 could widen the light absorption range and helped harnessing the full spectrum of environment light this could be related to the ucpl properties of n s cqds that emitted shorter light wavelength 380 nm from longer absorbed light wavelength 400 nm 18 in another word it meant that the emission energy of photon from light source was larger than the excitation energy lastly the n s cqds photocatalyst also could act as an electron acceptor where photogenerated electrons on cb of the tio2 tended to transfer to the n s cqds this resulted in an efficient electrons and holes separation and enhanced photocatalytic activity 13 as a result the photoinduced electrons on the surface of membrane could further oxidize h2o to produce hydroxyl radical meanwhile the superoxide radicals would be formed by the combination of photogenerated electron with the adsorbed dissolved oxygen molecules from the membrane both of these radicals were extremely strong oxidants for the decomposition of the dcf 4 conclusions and recommendations in this work a novel type of tio2 membrane had been successfully produced through the incorporation of the n s cqds for the employment in the photodegradation of dcf pharmaceutical in water the resulting n s cqds tio2 membranes exhibited excellent photodegradation ability for removing dcf from water under the visible light irradiation the n s cqds tio2 membrane with 1 5 g of ncqds loading showed the highest photodegradation efficiency among the membranes the optimum operating condition were found achieving at the ncqds loading of 1 5 g membrane area of 25 cm2 and under visible light giving rise to the removal efficiency of 62 3 and average permeation flux of 277 l m2 hr bar besides the n s cqds tio2 membranes showed improved hydrophilicity membrane porosity and pure water permeation flux compared to the tio2 membrane due to the presence of hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups on the psf membrane there are a few recommendations for further study to improve the performance of the modified membrane in the pharmaceutical waste removal different coating methods or additional treatment steps for the n s cqds tio2 membrane shall be explored for stable binding of the photocatalyst onto the psf membrane surface the membrane can be tested in membrane photoreactor to further study the retention time of the photodegradation process under continuous flow mode furthermore it is worth to investigate biomass based cqd in establishing a greener membrane technology in summary the n s cqds tio2 membrane have great potential for water purification applications which however required to be explored more thoroughly

14187,an ozonation process combined with hydrophobic adsorbent high silica zsm 5 hszsm 5 was designed to enhance sulfamethoxazole smx removal and reduce the ozone consumption the promoted effect of hszsm 5 on smx removal was investigated in terms of smx removal and toc removal efficiency as well as the ozone consumption the impacts of ph and co3 2 hco3 were also analyzed the presence of hszsm 5 helped to increase the smx degradation and toc removal efficiency and their kinetics rate constants hszsm 5 adsorption behaviors for smx and its degradation intermediates were responsible for the findings direct ozone oxidation was the main mechanism of smx removal as hzsm 5 could not contribute to producing h2o2 and oh much higher co3 2 hco3 concentration 10 mm and ph value 7 were in favor of smx degradation hszsm 5 had a positive contribution to smx removal the mass ratio of ozone consumption to the removed smx reduced to 0 63 g o3 g smx this system of introducing high silica zeolite in the ozonation adsorption process is an environmentally and economically sound technology to removal micropollutants keywords high silica zeolites ozone adsorption oxidation consumption 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used as medicine to treat infections as well as human therapy livestock production and aquaculture 1 their residues were a significant source of environmental pollution as a result of overuse and improper disposal 2 antibiotics in the environment increase the resistant bacteria and genes 3 the toxicity of these antibiotics and their metabolites poses a potential ecotoxicological threat to aquatic organisms and human populations 4 sulfonamide antibiotics sas one of the most commonly used antibiotics can induce genetic mutation and chronic effect even at low concentrations 1 because sas have polarity and antibacterial properties the removal rate of sas in traditional wastewater treatment plant was only 20 30 3 therefore it is indispensable to develop an environmentally and economically sound technology to remove such compounds ozone an advanced and green oxidant is widely used to remove organic pollutants by oxidative degradation 5 recently many studies have focused on advanced oxidation processes aops involving ozone such as h2o2 o3 6 uv o3 and uv h2o2 o3 7 to enhance decomposition since the concentration of the produced oh radical increased 8 however oh reacted with other non targeted substrates led to more serious adverse effects this behavior decreased the oxidative specificity of the ozonation process and the presence of oh radical increased significantly the ozone depletion 9 to avoid the adverse effects of hydroxyl radicals and increase the reaction rate between ozone and organic substances fewer studies tried to introduce hydrophobic adsorbent into the oxidation system to improve the removal rate of target substances 10 11 the removal efficiencies of 2 methylisoborneol and trichloroethene by ozone were higher with high silica zsm 5 as the zeolites had better adsorption capacity for hydrophobic organic and water dissolved ozone 12 hence hydrophobic zeolite is a good choice for synergistic ozone oxidation and adsorption to date little study unveiled smx removal performance by ozonation with hszsm 5 zeolites under different condition this is the first time to investigate systematically the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics via ozonation combined with high silica zeolite zsm 5 a hydrophobic high silica zsm 5 zeolites hszsm 5 sio2 al2o3 ratio 500 was used in the process the widely used sas sulfamethoxazole smx was chosen as model pollutant the specific objectives of this study were i to investigate the performance of hszsm 5 for the removal of total organic carbon ii to elucidate the possible mechanism in the ozonation adsorption synchronous process iii to determine the ozone consumption of abating smx by ozonation adsorption system this finding can provide simultaneous adsorption and oxidation process for the removal of micropollutants from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials smx purity 99 was supplied by sigma aldrich co ltd st louis usa high silica zeolites zsm 5 hszsm 5 average pore size of 0 53 0 58 nm sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio of 500 were purchased from nanjing xfnano materials tech co ltd nanjing china other chemicals purity 99 were obtained from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china and used as received all solutions were prepared with 18 3 mω cm milli q water 2 2 experimental procedures ozonation experiments were performed in a reactor 4 0 l the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 a given amount of hszsm 5 was added to the reactor with 2 l of 20 mg l smx solution under stirring followed by continuous o3 input o3 was generated from high pure o2 purity 99 995 using an ozone generator with a maximum ozone production rate of around 5 g o3 h guolin cf g china the excess ozone in the outlet gas was adsorbed by ki solution the residual ozone in the sample for examination was quenched by adding 100 μl of 0 05 mol l na2s2o3 the residual ozone in the reactor was also quenched by na2s2o3 solution the specific experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of ph oh radical and co3 2 hco3 a ph set as 3 7 and 10 the initial ph was adjusted by hcl and naoh b tert butyl alcohol tba and nahso3 were chosen as oh scavenger c the concentration of co3 2 hco3 was 0 1 2 5 and 10 mm the formation of h2o2 was also conducted in the same reactor the adsorption of the intermediates by zsm 5 was conducted in a series of 100 ml conical flasks in which 100 ml of quenched water samples that collected from the smx ozonation process mixed with 20 mg of hszsm 5 at 200 rpm after 60 min of adsorption the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 μm pes membrane for total organic carbon toc determination the ozone consumption experiment was carried out in the reactor and the mixture was filtrated for ozone concentration test 2 3 analytical methods smx concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1600 usa with a uv detector set at 268 nm the separation was performed with an agilent sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 um by isocratic elution with 25 methanol and 75 ultrapure water containing 0 5 acetic acid the column temperature was maintained at 40 and the flow rate was fixed at 1 0 ml min toc removal was determined from the concentration change obtained by toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the concentration of h2o2 was determined by measuring the absorbance of the titanium peroxide tio2 2 complex formed by the reaction of tioso4 with h2o2 13 the ozone concentration in the inlet and outlet were obtained by the iodometric method 14 the aqueous ozone concentration was measured by the indigo method 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of smx and toc with or without zsm 5 in order to investigate the effect of hszsm on the removal of smx and toc the experiment was conducted in the absence and presence of hszsm 5 in o3 system fig 2 shows the evolution of smx and toc in ozone alone o3 and o3 hszsm 5 process respectively the smx removal percentages in o3 hszsm 5 and o3 hszsm 5 systems were 100 11 53 and 100 respectively as indicated in fig 2 the rapid and complete removal of smx was observed in less than 20 min in o3 alone process amino group nh2 increased the electron cloud density of smx aromatic ring thereby promoting the reactivity of smx to ozone 16 18 furthermore smx was completely removed after a shorter time 15 min for o3 hszsm 5 process which suggested that hszsm 5 had a positive contribution to smx removal these differences may be due to the combination of direct ozonation and zeolite adsorption as also demonstrated in previous study with high activated carbon adsorption affinity with other pharmaceutical compounds such as diclofenac 19 it is reported that smx and ozone could be adsorbed on hydrophobic adsorbent and distributed on its surface or pore 12 then the direct ozonation and physical adsorption contributed to the removal of smx it is inferred that ozone and smx were adsorbed on the same sites of hszsm 5 adsorption selectivity resulted from the molecular sieving effect 20 or hydrophobicity which made it possible to concentrate smx and ozone selectively in the adsorption phase enhancing the removal of targeted smx to further evaluate the effect of hszsm 5 on the smx removal using oxygen instead of ozone to feed into the reactor was conducted it was found that only 11 5 smx was removed after 30 min this revealed that the presence of hszsm 5 increased the reactione of o3 with smx to certain degree the apparent rate constants for smx removal also demonstrated it as presented in table 1 and fig s1 the rate constants of smx removal and toc removal increased by 38 1 from 2 57 10 3 m 1s 1 to 3 55 10 3 m 1s 1 and 121 5 from 6 50 10 5 m 1s 1 to 14 40 10 5 m 1s 1 due to the presence of hszsm 5 respectively therefore hszsm 5 not only promoted smx removal but also enhance the toc removal rate of pollutants thereby improving smx removal from the aquatic environment nevertheless toc removal obtained in standalone ozone process was unsatisfied and the toc removal efficiency in 30 min was 35 9 a similar result was observed by akhtar et al 21 who reported that activated carbon loaded with fe2o3 ceo2 as a combination of adsorption and catalytic ozonation to remove smx this was most likely associated with the fact that oxidation reaction with ozone is highly selective reaction and ozone s oxidizing ability can never directly mineralize organic in the presence of hszsm 5 the rate constant of toc removal was 1 2 times ozone alone and the corresponding removal of toc rose to 41 3 confirming again that hszsm 5 had a promoting effect on toc removal as also indicated by the pseudo first order rate of toc removal see table 1 3 2 formation of h2o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a by product of ozone reacting with electron rich or unsaturated bonds the reaction of h2o2 with o3 or other substances results in the formation of oh 22 which affects the oxidation ability of the reaction system the h2o2 concentrations in o3 and o3 hszsm 5 process are compared in fig 3 it is clear that the h2o2 concentration increased followed by decreased with the operation time ozone degraded smx resulted in h2o2 formation and accumulation but h2o2 concentration decreased due to the decrement of smx content in the solution with the reaction time and that h2o2 was consumed by o3 the maximum h2o2 concentration was 1 10 mg l obtained at 15 min gao et al 23 also reported that the rapid accumulation of h2o2 was probably explained by the rapid decay of smx due to some nucleophilic sites susceptible to ozone attack and the interaction of h2o2 with ozone caused its decay with time it should be noted that o3 hszsm 5 without smx produced marginal h2o2 as observed in fig 3 change of h2o2 concentration followed an almost similar trend in the two processes revealing that hszsm 5 could not contribute to producing h2o2 and then oh the result coincided with the report by reungoat et al 24 who found no catalytic effect of high silica zeolites on the oxidation rate of nitrobenzene by ozone contrary to other results published 25 3 3 adsorption of intermediates adsorption of smx and its degradation intermediates may play an important role in toc removal the mixture including smx and the intermediates sampled from the reactor at different times and then quenched for the adsorption experiment the concentration was determined in terms of toc in the first 20 min the adsorption efficiency of the intermediates on hszsm 5 gradually increased as the ozonation of smx proceeded and toc removal reached 22 after the adsorption of hszsm 5 towards smx and its intermediates the results showed that the reaction between ozone and smx could improve toc removal by adsorption after 30 min the toc removal rate was slightly different as shown in fig 4 it has been reported that the degradation of smx during sole ozonation eventually generated a large amount of refractory organic intermediates 17 the final intermediates formed are usually saturated carboxylic acids that hardly react with ozone 26 the ozone reactivity of these intermediate products is low and the organic composition and concentration change was small then there was no significant difference in adsorption capacity at the later stage of the reaction 3 4 role of oh oh is the key factor of organic degradation in order to investigate whether there is hydroxyl radical in high silica zsm 5 ozonation synchronous system fig 5 shows the effect of the hszsm 5 on smx removal with tert butanol tba and nahso3 as the oh scavenger respectively the addition of tba improved slightly the removal of smx meanwhile the smx removal rate constants increased see table 1 this meant that radical s removal by tba scavenger accelerated the reaction of smx with ozone revealing that smx degradation is directly by ozone and it is the dominant reaction pathway there were two possible phenomena after tba introduced into the system i the decomposition reaction of ozone was retarded as oh reacted preferentially with tba which led to a stable concentration of water dissolved ozone ii the addition of tba reduced the surface tension of the solution and increased the contact area between the gaseous ozone and the aqueous solution thereby advancing the mass transfer of ozone 27 this led to an increase in the amount of available water dissolved ozone which enhanced the direct ozonation pathway additionally tba had a similarly slight improvement in smx removal efficiency in ozone and o3 hszsm 5 processes as shown in fig 5 the result demonstrated again that hszsm 5 appeared to have no effect on o3 decomposition into oh the presence of nahso3 in the ozone and o3 hszsm 5 process showed a negative effect on smx degradation and toc removal as shown in fig 5 and table 1 fig s2 the removal of toc decreased by 1 2 after addition of nahso3 nahso3 as an oh scavenger can consume a large amount of water dissolved ozone leading to decrease toc removal the o3 hszsm 5 process showed slightly higher toc removal efficiency for smx than that without the zeolites and the removal efficiency of smx in the former was more than two fold of the latter this suggested that hszsm 5 played an important role in smx removal it is inferred that the hszsm 5 adsorption for smx enhanced their reaction furthermore the lower water dissolved ozone concentration affected the ozonation reaction resulting in a significant decrease in toc removal rate 3 5 role of ph ph is an important factor in the contact oxidation process as the stability of water dissolved ozone and morphology of the target material was ph dependent 28 ph can also change the charge of hszsm 5 affecting its adsorption capacity the effect of ph on the smx removal is illustrated in fig 6 smx could be completely removed regardless of ph and zeolites within 30 min both of the removal rates of smx with and without hszsm 5 followed the order ph 10 ph 7 ph 3 this may be ascribed to that i deprotonated smx species at higher solution ph had higher reactivity with ozone than other smx species neutral and protonated species 29 ii the form of smx varied with ph due to its dissociation constant pka fig s3 the smx removal ratio in the presence of zeolites increased by 86 7 29 1 and 37 9 at ph of 3 7 and 10 respectively there are inconsistent conclusions on the effect of ph on smx removal in sole ozonation system for example it was found that smx removal rates were nearly independent of ph as the direct rate constant of the smx ozone reaction varied slightly 30 in this work the adsorption behavior of smx by hszsm 5 at different ph could explain this phenomenon fig s3 fig 6b shows the changes of toc with time at different ph there was a low toc removal rate within 30 min and toc removal efficiency also followed the order ph 10 ph 7 ph 3 the rate constant of toc removal followed the same order as indicated in table 2 fig s4 these results could be explained by i solution ph of 10 enhanced significantly o3 degradation into h o 2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 31 32 which promoted ozone decomposition and oh production ii the reaction rate of protonated carboxylic acid groups of the intermediates oxalic acid formic acid etc with oh was significantly lower than that of deprotonated species toc removal rate in the presence of hszsm 5 increased by 30 9 44 1 and 17 7 at ph of 3 7 and 10 in contrast to those without zeolites respectively greater improvement happened at ph lower than 7 as the water dissolved ozone was stable while o3 was easier to decompose at higher ph 1 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 2 h o 2 o 3 o h o 2 o 2 3 6 role of co3 2 hco3 co3 2 and hco3 are important anions in water which are frequently detected in natural water with dozens to hundreds of mg l they have a strong influence on radical type reactions the effect of co3 2 hco3 1 10 mm on smx removal was studied and the experiment data is shown in fig 7 the smx removal efficiency decreased at lower co3 2 hco3 concentration compared to that without co3 2 hco3 the presence of bicarbonate hco3 inhibited the formation of hydroxyl radicals and higher concentrations of hco3 caused greater reductions in the rate of atrazine degradation 33 hence the decreased smx removal could be due to that the solution ph co3 2 hco3 affected slightly by the fewer amount of produced oh as a result of the reaction of oh with co3 2 moreover co3 2 hco3 could effectively capture oh and produce a second order free radical co3 eqs 3 and 4 while the reaction rate of co3 with smx was lower significantly than that of oh with smx 18 34 when co3 2 hco3 concentration was higher than 10 mm the smx degradation efficiency enhanced for the whole reaction stage without hszsm 5 which was higher at 5 mm in the presence of hszsm 5 as illustrated in fig 7 3 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 4 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h higher co3 2 hco3 concentration increased the smx removal rate shown in table 3 and fig s5 and the increasing ph made the main contribution to improve smx removal this finding agreed with the previous report in uv pds system for smx removal 34 it is noteworthy that the removal rate constant of smx in the presence of zeolites was generally higher than that of the single oxidation system especially higher co3 2 hco3 concentration 10 mm in the former would in favor of smx degradation 3 7 ozone consumption zeolites have been proved to increase the removal efficiency of organics 35 however since ozone oxidation is a costly oxidation process ozone consumption per mass of pollutant removed is a fundamental parameter to investigate the ozone consumption in the presence of hzsm 5 ozone consumption amount o3 r and the mass ratio of ozone consumption to the removed smx c mg mg were calculated by the following equations 5 o3 r o3 i o3 d o3 o o3 g d 6 c mg mg o3 r smx r where o3 i is the amount of o3 inlet o3 o is the amount of o3 outlet o3 d is the amount of water dissolved o3 o3 g d is the amount of o3 decomposition and o3 gas in the reactor respectively smx r is the accumulated amount of smx participating in the reaction at different times the experiment data is summarized in table 4 in the initial 1 min c values in the absence and presence of hszsm 5 were 0 08 and 0 14 mg mg respectively o3 could effectively select smx for electrophilic reaction and 15 4 and 17 3 of smx was removed for the two processes after the first 1 min respectively c values increased with the operating time as the ozone consumption increased caused by the intermediates the reaction of the intermediates with o3 increased the ozone consumption smx could be completely removed in 20 min and 15 min for the ozonation and ozonation adsorption process as observed in table 4 respectively and the corresponding mass ratios of ozone consumption to removed smx were 0 97 mg mg and 0 63 mg mg indicating that the presence of hszsm 5 saved 35 0 ozone consumption 4 conclusion this research examined for the first time smx and corresponding toc removal by ozonation hszsm 5 system smx could be completely removed and the reaction time was shortened to 15 min in the presence of hszsm 5 higher ph and co3 2 hco3 concentrations enhanced smx degradation hszsm 5 adsorption for smx and its degraded intermediates resulted in a higher toc removal efficiency the presence of hszsm 5 showed the higher rate constants of smx and toc removal kinetics smx was mainly eliminated by direct ozone reaction in o3 hszsm 5 process the required ozone dosage was approximately 0 63 g o3 g smx of the combined system saving 35 ozone consumption compared to the absence of hszsm 5 overall performance demonstrated that hszsm 5 combined with ozonation is a favorable way to remove smx from water declaration of competing interest

findings direct ozone oxidation was the main mechanism of smx removal as hzsm 5 could not contribute to producing h2o2 and oh much higher co3 2 hco3 concentration 10 mm and ph value 7 were in favor of smx degradation hszsm 5 had a positive contribution to smx removal the mass ratio of ozone consumption to the removed smx reduced to 0 63 g o3 g smx this system of introducing high silica zeolite in the ozonation adsorption process is an environmentally and economically sound technology to removal micropollutants keywords high silica zeolites ozone adsorption oxidation consumption 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used as medicine to treat infections as well as human therapy livestock production and aquaculture 1 their residues were a significant source of environmental pollution as a result of overuse and improper disposal 2 antibiotics in the environment increase the resistant bacteria and genes 3 the toxicity of these antibiotics and their metabolites poses a potential ecotoxicological threat to aquatic organisms and human populations 4 sulfonamide antibiotics sas one of the most commonly used antibiotics can induce genetic mutation and chronic effect even at low concentrations 1 because sas have polarity and antibacterial properties the removal rate of sas in traditional wastewater treatment plant was only 20 30 3 therefore it is indispensable to develop an environmentally and economically sound technology to remove such compounds ozone an advanced and green oxidant is widely used to remove organic pollutants by oxidative degradation 5 recently many studies have focused on advanced oxidation processes aops involving ozone such as h2o2 o3 6 uv o3 and uv h2o2 o3 7 to enhance decomposition since the concentration of the produced oh radical increased 8 however oh reacted with other non targeted substrates led to more serious adverse effects this behavior decreased the oxidative specificity of the ozonation process and the presence of oh radical increased significantly the ozone depletion 9 to avoid the adverse effects of hydroxyl radicals and increase the reaction rate between ozone and organic substances fewer studies tried to introduce hydrophobic adsorbent into the oxidation system to improve the removal rate of target substances 10 11 the removal efficiencies of 2 methylisoborneol and trichloroethene by ozone were higher with high silica zsm 5 as the zeolites had better adsorption capacity for hydrophobic organic and water dissolved ozone 12 hence hydrophobic zeolite is a good choice for synergistic ozone oxidation and adsorption to date little study unveiled smx removal performance by ozonation with hszsm 5 zeolites under different condition this is the first time to investigate systematically the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics via ozonation combined with high silica zeolite zsm 5 a hydrophobic high silica zsm 5 zeolites hszsm 5 sio2 al2o3 ratio 500 was used in the process the widely used sas sulfamethoxazole smx was chosen as model pollutant the specific objectives of this study were i to investigate the performance of hszsm 5 for the removal of total organic carbon ii to elucidate the possible mechanism in the ozonation adsorption synchronous process iii to determine the ozone consumption of abating smx by ozonation adsorption system this finding can provide simultaneous adsorption and oxidation process for the removal of micropollutants from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials smx purity 99 was supplied by sigma aldrich co ltd st louis usa high silica zeolites zsm 5 hszsm 5 average pore size of 0 53 0 58 nm sio2 al2o3 mol mol ratio of 500 were purchased from nanjing xfnano materials tech co ltd nanjing china other chemicals purity 99 were obtained from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china and used as received all solutions were prepared with 18 3 mω cm milli q water 2 2 experimental procedures ozonation experiments were performed in a reactor 4 0 l the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 a given amount of hszsm 5 was added to the reactor with 2 l of 20 mg l smx solution under stirring followed by continuous o3 input o3 was generated from high pure o2 purity 99 995 using an ozone generator with a maximum ozone production rate of around 5 g o3 h guolin cf g china the excess ozone in the outlet gas was adsorbed by ki solution the residual ozone in the sample for examination was quenched by adding 100 μl of 0 05 mol l na2s2o3 the residual ozone in the reactor was also quenched by na2s2o3 solution the specific experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of ph oh radical and co3 2 hco3 a ph set as 3 7 and 10 the initial ph was adjusted by hcl and naoh b tert butyl alcohol tba and nahso3 were chosen as oh scavenger c the concentration of co3 2 hco3 was 0 1 2 5 and 10 mm the formation of h2o2 was also conducted in the same reactor the adsorption of the intermediates by zsm 5 was conducted in a series of 100 ml conical flasks in which 100 ml of quenched water samples that collected from the smx ozonation process mixed with 20 mg of hszsm 5 at 200 rpm after 60 min of adsorption the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 μm pes membrane for total organic carbon toc determination the ozone consumption experiment was carried out in the reactor and the mixture was filtrated for ozone concentration test 2 3 analytical methods smx concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1600 usa with a uv detector set at 268 nm the separation was performed with an agilent sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 um by isocratic elution with 25 methanol and 75 ultrapure water containing 0 5 acetic acid the column temperature was maintained at 40 and the flow rate was fixed at 1 0 ml min toc removal was determined from the concentration change obtained by toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the concentration of h2o2 was determined by measuring the absorbance of the titanium peroxide tio2 2 complex formed by the reaction of tioso4 with h2o2 13 the ozone concentration in the inlet and outlet were obtained by the iodometric method 14 the aqueous ozone concentration was measured by the indigo method 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of smx and toc with or without zsm 5 in order to investigate the effect of hszsm on the removal of smx and toc the experiment was conducted in the absence and presence of hszsm 5 in o3 system fig 2 shows the evolution of smx and toc in ozone alone o3 and o3 hszsm 5 process respectively the smx removal percentages in o3 hszsm 5 and o3 hszsm 5 systems were 100 11 53 and 100 respectively as indicated in fig 2 the rapid and complete removal of smx was observed in less than 20 min in o3 alone process amino group nh2 increased the electron cloud density of smx aromatic ring thereby promoting the reactivity of smx to ozone 16 18 furthermore smx was completely removed after a shorter time 15 min for o3 hszsm 5 process which suggested that hszsm 5 had a positive contribution to smx removal these differences may be due to the combination of direct ozonation and zeolite adsorption as also demonstrated in previous study with high activated carbon adsorption affinity with other pharmaceutical compounds such as diclofenac 19 it is reported that smx and ozone could be adsorbed on hydrophobic adsorbent and distributed on its surface or pore 12 then the direct ozonation and physical adsorption contributed to the removal of smx it is inferred that ozone and smx were adsorbed on the same sites of hszsm 5 adsorption selectivity resulted from the molecular sieving effect 20 or hydrophobicity which made it possible to concentrate smx and ozone selectively in the adsorption phase enhancing the removal of targeted smx to further evaluate the effect of hszsm 5 on the smx removal using oxygen instead of ozone to feed into the reactor was conducted it was found that only 11 5 smx was removed after 30 min this revealed that the presence of hszsm 5 increased the reactione of o3 with smx to certain degree the apparent rate constants for smx removal also demonstrated it as presented in table 1 and fig s1 the rate constants of smx removal and toc removal increased by 38 1 from 2 57 10 3 m 1s 1 to 3 55 10 3 m 1s 1 and 121 5 from 6 50 10 5 m 1s 1 to 14 40 10 5 m 1s 1 due to the presence of hszsm 5 respectively therefore hszsm 5 not only promoted smx removal but also enhance the toc removal rate of pollutants thereby improving smx removal from the aquatic environment nevertheless toc removal obtained in standalone ozone process was unsatisfied and the toc removal efficiency in 30 min was 35 9 a similar result was observed by akhtar et al 21 who reported that activated carbon loaded with fe2o3 ceo2 as a combination of adsorption and catalytic ozonation to remove smx this was most likely associated with the fact that oxidation reaction with ozone is highly selective reaction and ozone s oxidizing ability can never directly mineralize organic in the presence of hszsm 5 the rate constant of toc removal was 1 2 times ozone alone and the corresponding removal of toc rose to 41 3 confirming again that hszsm 5 had a promoting effect on toc removal as also indicated by the pseudo first order rate of toc removal see table 1 3 2 formation of h2o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a by product of ozone reacting with electron rich or unsaturated bonds the reaction of h2o2 with o3 or other substances results in the formation of oh 22 which affects the oxidation ability of the reaction system the h2o2 concentrations in o3 and o3 hszsm 5 process are compared in fig 3 it is clear that the h2o2 concentration increased followed by decreased with the operation time ozone degraded smx resulted in h2o2 formation and accumulation but h2o2 concentration decreased due to the decrement of smx content in the solution with the reaction time and that h2o2 was consumed by o3 the maximum h2o2 concentration was 1 10 mg l obtained at 15 min gao et al 23 also reported that the rapid accumulation of h2o2 was probably explained by the rapid decay of smx due to some nucleophilic sites susceptible to ozone attack and the interaction of h2o2 with ozone caused its decay with time it should be noted that o3 hszsm 5 without smx produced marginal h2o2 as observed in fig 3 change of h2o2 concentration followed an almost similar trend in the two processes revealing that hszsm 5 could not contribute to producing h2o2 and then oh the result coincided with the report by reungoat et al 24 who found no catalytic effect of high silica zeolites on the oxidation rate of nitrobenzene by ozone contrary to other results published 25 3 3 adsorption of intermediates adsorption of smx and its degradation intermediates may play an important role in toc removal the mixture including smx and the intermediates sampled from the reactor at different times and then quenched for the adsorption experiment the concentration was determined in terms of toc in the first 20 min the adsorption efficiency of the intermediates on hszsm 5 gradually increased as the ozonation of smx proceeded and toc removal reached 22 after the adsorption of hszsm 5 towards smx and its intermediates the results showed that the reaction between ozone and smx could improve toc removal by adsorption after 30 min the toc removal rate was slightly different as shown in fig 4 it has been reported that the degradation of smx during sole ozonation eventually generated a large amount of refractory organic intermediates 17 the final intermediates formed are usually saturated carboxylic acids that hardly react with ozone 26 the ozone reactivity of these intermediate products is low and the organic composition and concentration change was small then there was no significant difference in adsorption capacity at the later stage of the reaction 3 4 role of oh oh is the key factor of organic degradation in order to investigate whether there is hydroxyl radical in high silica zsm 5 ozonation synchronous system fig 5 shows the effect of the hszsm 5 on smx removal with tert butanol tba and nahso3 as the oh scavenger respectively the addition of tba improved slightly the removal of smx meanwhile the smx removal rate constants increased see table 1 this meant that radical s removal by tba scavenger accelerated the reaction of smx with ozone revealing that smx degradation is directly by ozone and it is the dominant reaction pathway there were two possible phenomena after tba introduced into the system i the decomposition reaction of ozone was retarded as oh reacted preferentially with tba which led to a stable concentration of water dissolved ozone ii the addition of tba reduced the surface tension of the solution and increased the contact area between the gaseous ozone and the aqueous solution thereby advancing the mass transfer of ozone 27 this led to an increase in the amount of available water dissolved ozone which enhanced the direct ozonation pathway additionally tba had a similarly slight improvement in smx removal efficiency in ozone and o3 hszsm 5 processes as shown in fig 5 the result demonstrated again that hszsm 5 appeared to have no effect on o3 decomposition into oh the presence of nahso3 in the ozone and o3 hszsm 5 process showed a negative effect on smx degradation and toc removal as shown in fig 5 and table 1 fig s2 the removal of toc decreased by 1 2 after addition of nahso3 nahso3 as an oh scavenger can consume a large amount of water dissolved ozone leading to decrease toc removal the o3 hszsm 5 process showed slightly higher toc removal efficiency for smx than that without the zeolites and the removal efficiency of smx in the former was more than two fold of the latter this suggested that hszsm 5 played an important role in smx removal it is inferred that the hszsm 5 adsorption for smx enhanced their reaction furthermore the lower water dissolved ozone concentration affected the ozonation reaction resulting in a significant decrease in toc removal rate 3 5 role of ph ph is an important factor in the contact oxidation process as the stability of water dissolved ozone and morphology of the target material was ph dependent 28 ph can also change the charge of hszsm 5 affecting its adsorption capacity the effect of ph on the smx removal is illustrated in fig 6 smx could be completely removed regardless of ph and zeolites within 30 min both of the removal rates of smx with and without hszsm 5 followed the order ph 10 ph 7 ph 3 this may be ascribed to that i deprotonated smx species at higher solution ph had higher reactivity with ozone than other smx species neutral and protonated species 29 ii the form of smx varied with ph due to its dissociation constant pka fig s3 the smx removal ratio in the presence of zeolites increased by 86 7 29 1 and 37 9 at ph of 3 7 and 10 respectively there are inconsistent conclusions on the effect of ph on smx removal in sole ozonation system for example it was found that smx removal rates were nearly independent of ph as the direct rate constant of the smx ozone reaction varied slightly 30 in this work the adsorption behavior of smx by hszsm 5 at different ph could explain this phenomenon fig s3 fig 6b shows the changes of toc with time at different ph there was a low toc removal rate within 30 min and toc removal efficiency also followed the order ph 10 ph 7 ph 3 the rate constant of toc removal followed the same order as indicated in table 2 fig s4 these results could be explained by i solution ph of 10 enhanced significantly o3 degradation into h o 2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 31 32 which promoted ozone decomposition and oh production ii the reaction rate of protonated carboxylic acid groups of the intermediates oxalic acid formic acid etc with oh was significantly lower than that of deprotonated species toc removal rate in the presence of hszsm 5 increased by 30 9 44 1 and 17 7 at ph of 3 7 and 10 in contrast to those without zeolites respectively greater improvement happened at ph lower than 7 as the water dissolved ozone was stable while o3 was easier to decompose at higher ph 1 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 2 h o 2 o 3 o h o 2 o 2 3 6 role of co3 2 hco3 co3 2 and hco3 are important anions in water which are frequently detected in natural water with dozens to hundreds of mg l they have a strong influence on radical type reactions the effect of co3 2 hco3 1 10 mm on smx removal was studied and the experiment data is shown in fig 7 the smx removal efficiency decreased at lower co3 2 hco3 concentration compared to that without co3 2 hco3 the presence of bicarbonate hco3 inhibited the formation of hydroxyl radicals and higher concentrations of hco3 caused greater reductions in the rate of atrazine degradation 33 hence the decreased smx removal could be due to that the solution ph co3 2 hco3 affected slightly by the fewer amount of produced oh as a result of the reaction of oh with co3 2 moreover co3 2 hco3 could effectively capture oh and produce a second order free radical co3 eqs 3 and 4 while the reaction rate of co3 with smx was lower significantly than that of oh with smx 18 34 when co3 2 hco3 concentration was higher than 10 mm the smx degradation efficiency enhanced for the whole reaction stage without hszsm 5 which was higher at 5 mm in the presence of hszsm 5 as illustrated in fig 7 3 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 4 o h c o 3 2 c o 3 o h higher co3 2 hco3 concentration increased the smx removal rate shown in table 3 and fig s5 and the increasing ph made the main contribution to improve smx removal this finding agreed with the previous report in uv pds system for smx removal 34 it is noteworthy that the removal rate constant of smx in the presence of zeolites was generally higher than that of the single oxidation system especially higher co3 2 hco3 concentration 10 mm in the former would in favor of smx degradation 3 7 ozone consumption zeolites have been proved to increase the removal efficiency of organics 35 however since ozone oxidation is a costly oxidation process ozone consumption per mass of pollutant removed is a fundamental parameter to investigate the ozone consumption in the presence of hzsm 5 ozone consumption amount o3 r and the mass ratio of ozone consumption to the removed smx c mg mg were calculated by the following equations 5 o3 r o3 i o3 d o3 o o3 g d 6 c mg mg o3 r smx r where o3 i is the amount of o3 inlet o3 o is the amount of o3 outlet o3 d is the amount of water dissolved o3 o3 g d is the amount of o3 decomposition and o3 gas in the reactor respectively smx r is the accumulated amount of smx participating in the reaction at different times the experiment data is summarized in table 4 in the initial 1 min c values in the absence and presence of hszsm 5 were 0 08 and 0 14 mg mg respectively o3 could effectively select smx for electrophilic reaction and 15 4 and 17 3 of smx was removed for the two processes after the first 1 min respectively c values increased with the operating time as the ozone consumption increased caused by the intermediates the reaction of the intermediates with o3 increased the ozone consumption smx could be completely removed in 20 min and 15 min for the ozonation and ozonation adsorption process as observed in table 4 respectively and the corresponding mass ratios of ozone consumption to removed smx were 0 97 mg mg and 0 63 mg mg indicating that the presence of hszsm 5 saved 35 0 ozone consumption 4 conclusion this research examined for the first time smx and corresponding toc removal by ozonation hszsm 5 system smx could be completely removed and the reaction time was shortened to 15 min in the presence of hszsm 5 higher ph and co3 2 hco3 concentrations enhanced smx degradation hszsm 5 adsorption for smx and its degraded intermediates resulted in a higher toc removal efficiency the presence of hszsm 5 showed the higher rate constants of smx and toc removal kinetics smx was mainly eliminated by direct ozone reaction in o3 hszsm 5 process the required ozone dosage was approximately 0 63 g o3 g smx of the combined system saving 35 ozone consumption compared to the absence of hszsm 5 overall performance demonstrated that hszsm 5 combined with ozonation is a favorable way to remove smx from water declaration of competing interest

resistance water treatment anodic oxidation design of experiments 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a broad spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone group used worldwide in the treatment of urinary respiratory gastrointestinal skin bone and joint bacterial infections 1 2 the low biodegradability of cip 3 4 enhances its accumulation in the environment with associated interference on non target pathogens photosynthesis of plants alterations in the structure of algae 2 and risk of resistant bacteria development 5 8 this compound is widely detected in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps surface water and groundwater 9 13 concentrations up to 30 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 have been recorded in pharmaceuticals wastewaters 2 13 the maximum concentrations found in african water resources are higher than those reported in european based studies as drug return programs are barely implemented in african countries 14 hence inappropriate disposal of unused cip is a primary source of water pollution 12 after cip administration 50 2 or less 15 is absorbed in the body while the rest is excreted production plants and hospitals are the most important sources of contaminated wastewaters 6 conventional wwtps are not designed to deal with most of the emerging pollutants and the removal of cip is only partially attained 1 16 17 only 30 5 of the pollutant has been removed by dark chlorination in 30 min 1 it is resistant to microbial metabolism 4 activated sludge and trickling filters are not successful 6 moreover sludge of wwtps may become a relevant source of secondary pollution as high amounts of cip can be adsorbed up to 2 42 mg kg 1 2 hence the development of efficient technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps as well as for the treatment of wastewaters of manufacture plants is recommended 17 several methods have been investigated to remove cip from aquatic environments adsorption 13 18 22 biodegradation 23 electrocoagulation and

has shown promising potential in the remediation of water polluted by different pharmaceuticals 35 38 as well as by cip 17 sonochemical processes are based on the introduction of high power ultrasound into the medium to be treated high pressure and low pressure cycles with rates depending on the frequency are alternated bubbles are formed during the low pressure cycle grow to a critical size and then collapse during a high pressure cycle with the generation of hot spots with singular conditions of pressure 1000 atm and temperature 5000 k 39 sonication can be used to improve the adsorption efficiency of activated carbons 40 41 or as stand alone technology to remove water pollutants hence hydroxyl radicals are generated from water molecules and oxygen rupture and partially recombine to

khz 42 hence oxidative pathways induced by sonochemistry are not accompanied by significant mineralization ability 43 44 while the combination of this technique with others advanced oxidation processes aops promotes the transformation of the contaminants to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions 44 46 the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals is one of the most promising aops cip 50 mg l 1 in 0 10 mol l 1 na2so4 disappearance was recently attained in 2 h by a double sided ti pt β pbo2 anode in a filter press flow reactor while 75 of total organic carbon toc was removed after 5 h 47 the same antibiotic 30 mg l 1 has been completely removed and toc has been reduced to 30 by the use of a sno2 sb ti mesh anode in 2 h at 30 ma cm 2 48 rahmani et al obtained a 70 removal of cip with similar initial concentration time and electric current using a ti pbo2 anode whereas the chemical oxygen demand cod was reduced by 50 in 3 h of treatment 49 the weaker is the interaction with the anode surface the higher is the reactivity of the radicals boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are characterized by the weakest interaction yielding to high mineralization rates 50 hydroxyl radicals are generated by water electrolysis on the anode surface as first step in the electrochemical generation of ozone 6 h2o oh h e while the hydrogen evolution occurring at the cathode does not contribute to the mineralization of the pollutant 7 2h2o 2e h2 2oh here we coupled sonication with the electrochemical generation of hydroxyl radicals by bdd anode to remove cip from aqueous solutions a solid polymer electrolyte spe is used to overcome the low conductivity of the solution treated response surface methodology rsm was used to evaluate the main effects of pollutant concentration electric current and stirring rate on the energy requirements associated to the treatment furthermore optimum process conditions have been suggested in order to minimize the specific energy consumption 2

chromatography was purchased from sigma aldrich italy 2 2 electrolysis and sonoelectrolysis electrolysis was carried out in a single compartment electrochemical cell the electric current was provided by an amel 2055 potentiostat galvanostat nb boron doped diamond diachem condias and a ti ruo2 mesh de nora industries electrodes were used as anode and cathode respectively the solid polymer electrolyte was a nafion n324 ion exchange membrane sandwiched between the electrodes details of the cell were provided in a previous work 51 experiments were carried out under galvanostatic conditions and natural ph aqueous solutions 0 32 dm3 of ciprofloxacin 5 mg l 1 were treated for 1 h with current intensity ranged from 0 1 to 1 2 a stock solutions were prepared the same day of the tests and kept in dark at 15 c stirring rate was varied from 320 to 720 rpm sonication was provided at 40 khz by the ultrasonic device sonica 2200 soltec italy the samples were collected at defined intervals in glass vials and analyzed immediately prior each galvanostatic electrolysis assays the electrodes were cleaned to remove any kind of impurity from their surface 2 ml aliquots were analyzed immediately after sampling at defined intervals by uv vis spectrophotometry using a uv 1700 pharmaspec shimadzu set at the wavelength of 271 1 nm 2 3 experimental design the removal efficiency was recorded at different times and a central composite design ccd under response surface methodology was applied to investigate the effect of the process parameters with the aim to improve the energy efficiency of the process the software design expert 11 stat ease was used to carry out doe rsm procedures the variables here investigated were current intensity stirring rate and presence absence of sonication ranges and levels of the independent variables used for ccd design are shown in table 1 8 n k 2n 2n nc the ccd consists of 2 n factorial runs with 2n axial runs and nc center runs eq 8 where n is the number of process variables and k is the number of levels of the categoric factor sonication here the number of experimental runs n is 24 as 4 factorial points 4 axial points 4 replicates at the center points and 2 levels of the categoric factor are considered the values of the axial points were selected so as to ensure the rotatability of the response surface design the experimental sequence was randomized table 2 in order to reduce the effects of uncontrolled factors the removal efficiency was recorded and associated to the energy requirements of electrolysis and sonication the energy consumption due to the stirrer was not taken account as no significant change was associated to variation of the stirring rate while this input cannot be neglected at a major scale the responses analyzed were the removal and the specific energy consumption a second degree polynomial equation was used to define the target functions 9 yi k a1x1 a2x2 a3x3 a12x1x2 a13x1x3 a23x2x3 b1x1 2 b2x2 2 b3x3 2 where yi is the response xi xj are the coded values of the process variables k the constant coefficient ai the linear coefficient aij the interaction coefficient bi the quadratic coefficient the statistical significance of the obtained regression was verified by analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion based on the ccd matrix 24 experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of the process variables the removal efficiency is shown in fig 1 a sonication off and fig 1b sonication on the irradiation with ultrasounds had no significant effect on the removal efficiency while highly increased the energy demand as shown by table 3 the cell potential did not show significant variations during the process at 30 min of treatment 90 of removal was reached by more than one run while at longer processing times a significant increase of specific energy consumption can be observed for these runs hence this time has been selected to optimize the efficiency of the process the significant factors and their interactions have been evaluted by half normal plot pareto charts and anova the model statistics of the specific energy consumption showed a good correlation table 5 while acceptable values of r2 and r2 adjusted but poorer predictivity was found for the modeling of the removal response table 4 the specific energy demand was represented by the square root of the related response as this transformation was found to improve the accuracy of the modeling results the relationship between the analyzed factors can be visualized through the responses model equations of the electrolytic eqs 10 11 and the sonoelectrolytic treatment eqs 12 13 10 r e 27 697 79 434 a 0 041 b 37 69 a 2 11 e e 0 013 0 049 a 12 r s e 45 735 79 434 a 0 005 b 37 69 a 2 13 e s e 0 179 0 014 a three dimensional response surface plots are shown in figs 2 and 3 the current intensity was the main parameter affecting the removal of cip eqs 10 12 higher removals at higher intensity have already been observed in the anodic oxidation of terbuthylazine 51 the stirring rate also played a relevant role especially when sonication was off eq 10 due to the enhanced of mass transport of cip and metabolites to the anode surface region the same effect was observed by panizza and co workers for the electrodegradation of methyl red 52 as the cip concentration approaches to low values the mass transport limits the oxidation and the main anodic reaction is likely to be oxygen evolution 14 2h2o o2 4h 4e hence the specific energy consumption increases the same phenomenon was observed by klidi and co workers when high current intensity is applied 53 due to the high rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals unreacted hydroxyl radicals form hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxyl radical with less oxidation power than oh reducing the mineralization efficiency 54 15 2 oh h2o2 16 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o the solution ph significantly affects the degradation rate the higher the ph the greater this rate as recently demonstrated by the electrochemical degradation of cip 50 mg l 1 in 0 10 mol l 1 na2so4 in a filter press flow reactor using a double sided ti pt β pbo2 anode 47 the higher removal at higher ph was related to the two pka values presented by cip 6 1 carboxyl group and 8 7 nitrogen of the piperazine group the deprotonated cip molecules are more likely to be attracted by the anode thus entering the reaction cage 50 and becoming susceptible to the hydroxyl radicals attacks furthermore higher temperatures lead to greater diffusivity enhancing the mass transfer coefficient 55 the main removal pathways of the sonodegradation of cip have been reported as decarboxylation joined to hydroxylation dehalogenation and demethylation 44 the sonochemical degradation of antibiotics is strongly chemical structure dependent it has been observed that the compounds belonging to the penicillin class are faster degraded than fluoroquinolones the degradation depends on the proximity of the pollutant molecules to the cavitation bubbles hydrophobic compounds tend to accumulate at the cavitation bubble interface where hydroxyl radicals are at high concentration i e as hydrophobicity increases the removal rate is higher hence degradation of molecules as cip is hindered by functional groups e g amines and ketones which make these compounds less hydrophobics 17 here ultrasounds irradiation did not contribute to enhance the pollutant removal with the exception of runs carried out at current intensity of 0 095 a i e run 10 vs run 22 and 0 25 a run 15 vs run 2 stirring rate 380 rpm run 13 vs run 11 stirring rate 660 rpm at current intensities 0 625 a the increased amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by ultrasound application may lead only to parasite reactions due to mass transport limitations this hypothesis is also supported by the higher removal obtained by ultrasound irradiation at low current increasing the stirring rate run 13 vs run 15 hence notwithstanding the highest sonochemical production of hydroxyl radical is obtained at frequencies around 300 khz 56 high frequencies may not be recommended if ultrasounds are coupled with anodic oxidation however cavitation occurs non conformable and uncontrollably in an ultrasonic bath hence higher efficiency would be reached by the use of an ultrasonic probe type device due to a focused and uniform ultrasonic power input the optimum conditions required to reach 90 removal minimizing the energy demand have been estimated to be 0 642 a 660 rpm with an associated specific consumption 1 91 10 3 kwh mg 1 the energy demand of the mixing apparatus was not taken account as no significant change was associated to the variation of the stirring rate however this input cannot be neglected at a major scale especially approaching low residual concentrations where the mass transport near the anode becomes fundamental moreover the impact of humic acids and ions should be considered to apply this technology on surface water or wwtps water indeed natural organic matter might compete radicals with cip the reaction of hco3 with ho and cl could generate co3 which has a low oxidation potential nitrate ions have been reported to affect the degradation efficiency of cip maybe to their reduction to no2 by interaction with hydroxyl radicals while chloride ions could react with ho and cl to form weak oxidizing capability radicals which in turn could be decomposed into ho and cl again with a high rate constant 1 4 conclusions the removal of ciprofloxacin from aqueous solutions has been investigated electrolysis was carried out by a nb bdd anode a ti ruo2 mesh cathode and a nafion n324 ion exchange membrane as spe sonication was provided at 40 khz more than 90 of cip disappearance was attained within 20 min at 1 16 a and 520 rpm high current intensity provided fast removals the stirring rate also affected the rate of disappearance especially when sonication was off due to the enhanced of mass transport of cip and by products to the anode surface region ultrasounds irradiation strongly affected the energy demand contributing to enhance the pollutant removal only where low current was applied while at current intensity 0 25 a mass transport limitations likely hindered the removal potential of hydroxyl radicals hence high ultrasound frequencies may not be recommended if ultrasounds are coupled with anodic oxidation a treatment time of 30 min at 0 642 a and 660 rpm has been recommended to obtain a specific energy consumption 1 91 10 3 kwh mg 1

resistance water treatment anodic oxidation design of experiments 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip is a broad spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone group used worldwide in the treatment of urinary respiratory gastrointestinal skin bone and joint bacterial infections 1 2 the low biodegradability of cip 3 4 enhances its accumulation in the environment with associated interference on non target pathogens photosynthesis of plants alterations in the structure of algae 2 and risk of resistant bacteria development 5 8 this compound is widely detected in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps surface water and groundwater 9 13 concentrations up to 30 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 have been recorded in pharmaceuticals wastewaters 2 13 the maximum concentrations found in african water resources are higher than those reported in european based studies as drug return programs are barely implemented in african countries 14 hence inappropriate disposal of unused cip is a primary source of water pollution 12 after cip administration 50 2 or less 15 is absorbed in the body while the rest is excreted production plants and hospitals are the most important sources of contaminated wastewaters 6 conventional wwtps are not designed to deal with most of the emerging pollutants and the removal of cip is only partially attained 1 16 17 only 30 5 of the pollutant has been removed by dark chlorination in 30 min 1 it is resistant to microbial metabolism 4 activated sludge and trickling filters are not successful 6 moreover sludge of wwtps may become a relevant source of secondary pollution as high amounts of cip can be adsorbed up to 2 42 mg kg 1 2 hence the development of efficient technologies for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps as well as for the treatment of wastewaters of manufacture plants is recommended 17 several methods have been investigated to remove cip from aquatic environments adsorption 13 18 22 biodegradation 23 electrocoagulation and electroxidation 6 24 26 photodegradation over tio2 catalyst 27 30 uv h2o2 31 and uv chlorine treatment 1 ozonation fenton and sulphate radicals based oxidation processes 32 34 recently sonochemistry has shown promising potential in the remediation of water polluted by different pharmaceuticals 35 38 as well as by cip 17 sonochemical processes are based on the introduction of high power ultrasound into the medium to be treated high pressure and low pressure cycles with rates depending on the frequency are alternated bubbles are formed during the low pressure cycle grow to a critical size and then collapse during a high pressure cycle with the generation of hot spots with singular conditions of pressure 1000 atm and temperature 5000 k 39 sonication can be used to improve the adsorption efficiency of activated carbons 40 41 or as stand alone technology to remove water pollutants hence hydroxyl radicals are generated from water molecules and oxygen rupture and partially recombine to form hydrogen peroxide 17 1 h 2 o h o h 2 o 2 2 o 3 h 2 o o 2 o h 4 o 2 h o o h 5 2 o h h 2 o however only 8 09 of degradation efficiency of cip was observed after 2 h of ultrasonic irradiation at 35 khz 42 hence oxidative pathways induced by sonochemistry are not accompanied by significant mineralization ability 43 44 while the combination of this technique with others advanced oxidation processes aops promotes the transformation of the contaminants to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions 44 46 the electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals is one of the most promising aops cip 50 mg l 1 in 0 10 mol l 1 na2so4 disappearance was recently attained in 2 h by a double sided ti pt β pbo2 anode in a filter press flow reactor while 75 of total organic carbon toc was removed after 5 h 47 the same antibiotic 30 mg l 1 has been completely removed and toc has been reduced to 30 by the use of a sno2 sb ti mesh anode in 2 h at 30 ma cm 2 48 rahmani et al obtained a 70 removal of cip with similar initial concentration time and electric current using a ti pbo2 anode whereas the chemical oxygen demand cod was reduced by 50 in 3 h of treatment 49 the weaker is the interaction with the anode surface the higher is the reactivity of the radicals boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are characterized by the weakest interaction yielding to high mineralization rates 50 hydroxyl radicals are generated by water electrolysis on the anode surface as first step in the electrochemical generation of ozone 6 h2o oh h e while the hydrogen evolution occurring at the cathode does not contribute to the mineralization of the pollutant 7 2h2o 2e h2 2oh here we coupled sonication with the electrochemical generation of hydroxyl radicals by bdd anode to remove cip from aqueous solutions a solid polymer electrolyte spe is used to overcome the low conductivity of the solution treated response surface methodology rsm was used to evaluate the main effects of pollutant concentration electric current and stirring rate on the energy requirements associated to the treatment furthermore optimum process conditions have been suggested in order to minimize the specific energy consumption 2

chromatography was purchased from sigma aldrich italy 2 2 electrolysis and sonoelectrolysis electrolysis was carried out in a single compartment electrochemical cell the electric current was provided by an amel 2055 potentiostat galvanostat nb boron doped diamond diachem condias and a ti ruo2 mesh de nora industries electrodes were used as anode and cathode respectively the solid polymer electrolyte was a nafion n324 ion exchange membrane sandwiched between the electrodes details of the cell were provided in a previous work 51 experiments were carried out under galvanostatic conditions and natural ph aqueous solutions 0 32 dm3 of ciprofloxacin 5 mg l 1 were treated for 1 h with current intensity ranged from 0 1 to 1 2 a stock solutions were prepared the same day of the tests and kept in dark at 15 c stirring rate was varied from 320 to 720 rpm sonication was provided at 40 khz by the ultrasonic device sonica 2200 soltec italy the samples were collected at defined intervals in glass vials and analyzed immediately prior each galvanostatic electrolysis assays the electrodes were cleaned to remove any kind of impurity from their surface 2 ml aliquots were analyzed immediately after sampling at defined intervals by uv vis spectrophotometry using a uv 1700 pharmaspec shimadzu set at the wavelength of 271 1 nm 2 3 experimental design the removal efficiency was recorded at different times and a central composite design ccd under response surface methodology was applied to investigate the effect of the process parameters with the aim to improve the energy efficiency of the process the software design expert 11 stat ease was used to carry out doe rsm procedures the variables here investigated were current intensity stirring rate and presence absence of sonication ranges and levels of the independent variables used for ccd design are shown in table 1 8 n k 2n 2n nc the ccd consists of 2 n factorial runs with 2n axial runs and nc center runs eq 8 where n is the number of process variables and k is the number of levels of the categoric factor sonication here the number of experimental runs n is 24 as 4 factorial points 4 axial points 4 replicates at the center points and 2 levels of the categoric factor are considered the values of the axial points were selected so as to ensure the rotatability of the response surface design the experimental sequence was randomized table 2 in order to reduce the effects of uncontrolled factors the removal efficiency was recorded and associated to the energy requirements of electrolysis and sonication the energy consumption due to the stirrer was not taken account as no significant change was associated to variation of the stirring rate while this input cannot be neglected at a major scale the responses analyzed were the removal and the specific energy consumption a second degree polynomial equation was used to define the target functions 9 yi k a1x1 a2x2 a3x3 a12x1x2 a13x1x3 a23x2x3 b1x1 2 b2x2 2 b3x3 2 where yi is the response xi xj are the coded values of the process variables k the constant coefficient ai the linear coefficient aij the interaction coefficient bi the quadratic coefficient the statistical significance of the obtained regression was verified by analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion based on the ccd matrix 24 experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of the process variables the removal efficiency is shown in fig 1 a sonication off and fig 1b sonication on the irradiation with ultrasounds had no significant effect on the removal efficiency while highly increased the energy demand as shown by table 3 the cell potential did not show significant variations during the process at 30 min of treatment 90 of removal was reached by more than one run while at longer processing times a significant increase of specific energy consumption can be observed for these runs hence this time has been selected to optimize the efficiency of the process the significant factors and their interactions have been evaluted by half normal plot pareto charts and anova the model statistics of the specific energy consumption showed a good correlation table 5 while acceptable values of r2 and r2 adjusted but poorer predictivity was found for the modeling of the removal response table 4 the specific energy demand was represented by the square root of the related response as this transformation was found to improve the accuracy of the modeling results the relationship between the analyzed factors can be visualized through the responses model equations of the electrolytic eqs 10 11 and the sonoelectrolytic treatment eqs 12 13 10 r e 27 697 79 434 a 0 041 b 37 69 a 2 11 e e 0 013 0 049 a 12 r s e 45 735 79 434 a 0 005 b 37 69 a 2 13 e s e 0 179 0 014 a three dimensional response surface plots are shown in figs 2 and 3 the current intensity was the main parameter affecting the removal of cip eqs 10 12 higher removals at higher intensity have already been observed in the anodic oxidation of terbuthylazine 51 the stirring rate also played a relevant role especially when sonication was off eq 10 due to the enhanced of mass transport of cip and metabolites to the anode surface region the same effect was observed by panizza and co workers for the electrodegradation of methyl red 52 as the cip concentration approaches to low values the mass transport limits the oxidation and the main anodic reaction is likely to be oxygen evolution 14 2h2o o2 4h 4e hence the specific energy consumption increases the same phenomenon was observed by klidi and co workers when high current intensity is applied 53 due to the high rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals unreacted hydroxyl radicals form hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxyl radical with less oxidation power than oh reducing the mineralization efficiency 54 15 2 oh h2o2 16 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o the solution ph significantly affects the degradation rate the higher the ph the greater this rate as recently demonstrated by the electrochemical degradation of cip 50 mg l 1 in 0 10 mol l 1 na2so4 in a filter press flow reactor using a double sided ti pt β pbo2 anode 47 the higher removal at higher ph was related to the two pka values presented by cip 6 1 carboxyl group and 8 7 nitrogen of the piperazine group the deprotonated cip molecules are more likely to be attracted by the anode thus entering the reaction cage 50 and becoming susceptible to the hydroxyl radicals attacks furthermore higher temperatures lead to greater diffusivity enhancing the mass transfer coefficient 55 the main removal pathways of the sonodegradation of cip have been reported as decarboxylation joined to hydroxylation dehalogenation and demethylation 44 the sonochemical degradation of antibiotics is strongly chemical structure dependent it has been observed that the compounds belonging to the penicillin class are faster degraded than fluoroquinolones the degradation depends on the proximity of the pollutant molecules to the cavitation bubbles hydrophobic compounds tend to accumulate at the cavitation bubble interface where hydroxyl radicals are at high concentration i e as hydrophobicity increases the removal rate is higher hence degradation of molecules as cip is hindered by functional groups e g amines and ketones which make these compounds less

14189,the production of an efficient reusable stable and easily separable catalyst in the ozonation process through a reliable procedure is one of the essential requirements of the catalytic ozonation process cop in this study the nano mgo cnt graphite composite was synthesized to use as a new catalyst in the cop synthesis of the nano mgo cnt graphite was carried out based on the extreme vertices mixture design evmd using three components mgo nanoparticles carbon nanotubes cnts and graphite based on evmd 9 compositions were produced for assessing the catalytic activity of synthesized

times as high as those in the single ozonation sop respectively clearly the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite showed a significant ability in catalysis of the ozonation process of organic materials by means of increasing o3 decomposition and oh production the synthesized optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was reusable because of the stability and durability of the catalytic activities keywords catalytic ozonation mixture design nano mgo cnt graphite hydroxyl radical 1 introduction recently advanced oxidation methods aops such as o3 h2o2 1 o3 uv 2 uv h2o2 3 uv photolysis 3 photocatalytic oxidation with tio2 4 5 have been applied to remove organic substances from aqueous solution catalytic ozonation as an effective process has given special attention to the removal of organic matter from aqueous solutions catalytic ozonation has to bring about fast removal of organic contaminants and higher efficient mineralization of refractory substances 6 7 cop would be branched into two subcategory which accelerate the decomposition of ozone and formation of hydroxyl radicals homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has shown to have a high removal efficiency of organic contaminants from aqueous media 7 9 in these processes catalysts were applied for the acceleration of removal of ozone for generation of hydroxyl radicals radicals reactions with pollutant molecules are in contrary with molecular ozone direct reactions non selective and rapid 7 9 10 these non selective radicals can oxidize the toxic contaminants for converting to easily biodegradable substances 11 metal oxides metals on supports metal oxides and ac zeolites modified with ac and metals are the most common applied catalysts in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 7 11 many metal oxides such as magnesium oxide manganese dioxide zinc oxide cerium dioxide titanium dioxide aluminum oxides and iron oxides have been applied as catalysts 9 12 13 of those the applied catalysts mgo represented perfect catalytic ability to remove a wide range of contaminants because of the structural stability extensive activity low toxicity and environmental friendliness 14 16 the homogeneous precipitation technique is an efficient process in mgo synthesis because of feasibility availability of pristine substances cost effectiveness and excellent performance 17 18 the use of homogenous ozonation for water purification is not logical due to the need to remove metallic ions from purified water which is almost ineffective while given that the metal ions catalytic activity has been observed at low dosage their use in treating wastewater containing large quantities of organic matter is also not feasible the use of a heterogeneous catalytic ozonation method due to its capability of reuse is an advantage but in many cases its reuse is limited due to the release of the catalyst compounds into the solution which increases the cost of the treatment process 14 19 but the inevitable metal leaching limits their application in terms of green development 20 from 2004 the application of carbon substances as supports of catalyst has been widely considered in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation carbon materials such as fullerenes graphene and cnts are used for composites synthesizing 21 graphene has sheet like structure consisting sp2 carbons with high mechanical strength large surface area 2600 m2 g and appreciable charge carrier transportation 21 furthermore in recent years graphene and their oxide products as a single atomic layer of graphite have been applied as either catalysts or catalyst supports in ozonation which represented the extensive high catalytic ability on organic contaminants removal 19 also graphene has the ability to be applied as interesting reinforcements for composites due to the exceptional mechanical and physical characteristics 19 recently graphene has been applied as an effective reinforcement substance for metal matrix composites 22 graphite has been applied in wet air oxidation as a catalyst support which has more stability than cnts and activated carbon in ozonation because of its excellent graphitic structure and lower faults 18 cnts carbon xerogel and activated carbon ac have been applied as catalyst supporter in aops 13 23 25 cnts would have a higher ability to use a supports for catalyst in comparison with ac in the liquid phase reactions because of the excellent thermal chemical electrical and mechanical characteristics the good performance of cnts used as a catalyst or catalyst support has been proven in catalytic wet air oxidation 26 cnts are also known as applicable substances for several objectives including environmental clean up perspectives 27 28 regarding carbon substances cnts have a high ability to act as efficient catalysts or catalyst supports for helping ozone in organic substances degradation in aqueous solution similar to the performance of activated carbon 27 indeed regarding the mesoporous structures and high surface areas cnts would be appropriate to be applied as a supports in the acceleration of the uniform dispersion of active products and in providing higher active sites for catalytic reactions 27 furthermore the addition of nanocarbons influencing the mechanical properties of the composite 22 29 31 although the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has the advantages such as thorough mineralization of refractory pollutants or production of more biodegradable by products easily setting and operation of the system and no need for other chemicals 32 but the leaching of the catalyst components such as metal oxides into the bulk solution and more catalyst consumption is the main limitation of such processes 7 33 as regards the cop is a new method and understudying process studying and synthesizing a new persistent efficient easily separable and reusable catalyst is essential therefore the purpose of this research was developing a resistant and highly efficient catalyst with more reusability a constrained mixture design covers a smaller space within the mixture simplex design the phenomenon happens while extra limitations in the form of upper and or lower constraints are put onto the constituent features 34 these kinds of mixture designs are mentioned to as evmd for this purpose mgo nanoparticles was synthesized successfully then cnt and graphite were mixed with nano mgo with proportions obtained from the mixture design kaolinite used to bond materials to each other kaolinite is used for production of porcelain brick tiles and chamotte the chemical structure of kaolinite is al2si2o5 oh 4 35 the obtained composition was directly transferred to an electrical furnace to strength the temperature was then increased gradually up to 1350 c and was kept at this temperature for 2 h by enhancement of the sintering temperature the relative density and densification of the composites showed an increasing trend 22 noteworthy to say that the sintering temperature has a considerable effect on the densification features microstructural evolution and properties enhancement of matrix composites 22 the interaction with oxygen at high temperatures causes improving the oxidation of the materials and negatively affects the sintering process in order to prevent the oxidation of materials during sintering argon and hydrogen injection

250 ml stainless steel cup to create a homogeneous mixture the contents of the cup were rotated at 150 rpm in a planetary mill for a period of 2 h after drying the slurry at 120 c the resulting compositions were pressurized by a hydraulic press of 20 atm 1 ton cm2 to reach desired densification 31 in order to stabilize the structure and create a persistent compound all of the specimens were sintered in an electrically heated furnace under hydrogen and argon controlled atmosphere with a flow of 200 and 50 ml min 1 respectively for 2 h at 1350 c using a heating rate of 5 c min the

was destroyed by adding na2s2o3 to the samples the standard method of potassium dichromate oxidation was used for measuring cod 40 a toc analyzer shimadzu toc analyzer vcsh model was applied for measuring the toc of samples a ph meter sense ion 37 58 hack was applied for measuring the solution ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of the catalytic activity of various prepared compositions the cod and toc degradation efficiencies in the sop were constant at 9 62 and 7 42 respectively cod and toc adsorption onto compositions removal and destruction efficiencies of cod and toc in cop under the considered conditions were shown in table 1 according to table 1 the highest cod and toc removal efficiencies were attained with composition c 9 this high removal and destruction efficiencies might become from the presence of all each three components of composition in optimum quantity 81 5 nano mgo 14 graphite and 4 5 cnt compared to other compositions from these results it can be concluded that as prepared composition has a significant synergistic effect in coupling with ozone and effectively enhances the degradation the better performance of the cop in comparison to the sop indicated that optimum nano mgo cnt graphite possess an excellent catalytic activity in oxidative degradation processes 3 2 expert design and validation of model in this study the evmd was applied for determination of the measurement points this method fully symmetrical distributed experimental points and a well selected multinomial equation 39 performing accurate measurements at every point during the mixture design is expensive time consuming or simply impractical design of experiments doe is one possible method to address these issues 41 this approach may be used to optimize experiment plans the goal is performing the lowest number of experiments while gaining the maximum amount of data for the development of an efficient and reproducible model with the desired properties to study the significance and the adequacy of the model variance analysis anova was applied 41 analysis of variance results using a set of hierarchical models with increasing complexity using the anova linear model showed statistical significance see tables 2 and 3 according to table 3 r2 is 0 9793 and 0 9307 for cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively that indicated the model exactly fit the experimentally measured cod and toc the significance of each coefficient to the fit of the model was then evaluated by its p value which was calculated from the ratio of the coefficient to its standard deviation according to table 2 p value of cod and toc removal efficiencies are 0 0001 and 0 0003 respectively where the coefficients with a p value less than 0 05 were considered to have a significant influence on the fitting of the model the model f values of 141 79 and 40 31 for cod and toc removal efficiencies confirmed the model significance and there have been just a 0 01 and 0 03 chance that model occurs due to noise the predicted r2 of 0 9611 and 0 8575 for cod and toc removal efficiencies are in good agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9724 and 0 9077 respectively the adequate precision of the model measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is suitable the ratio of 32 371 and 17 991 indicate a sufficient signal the model would be applied for navigation of the design space surface fitting of the tested models is illustrated in fig s1 table 4 shows the model general analysis which confirms that it is statistically significant a comparison of actual with the predicted results revealed a significant correlation of r2 0 9793 and 0 9307 in cod and toc removal efficiencies fig s2a a normal distribution was obtained by comparing internally studentized residue results to the normal probability values fig s2b a comparison of internally studentized residues with run number and the predicted data is illustrated in fig s3 that confirms the application of the regression model in which the random distribution trend was not seen the main aim of the test was obtaining the obvious information about the component proportions in a mixture marked by the maximum percentage removal efficiency according to the fit to the model of the linear equation desired for this experiment the applicability profile for approximating data was produced and subsequently the optimum combination of the catalyst composition was obtained a predicted composition of the mixture is presented in table 5 with regard to the desirability and the maximum removal efficiency the composition c 9 was desired as the optimum catalyst for the next experiments 3 3 characteristics of the optimum catalyst the optimum catalyst was entirely characterized the xrd diagram of the optimum catalyst is illustrated in fig 2 sharp peaks observed at 2θ 37 17 43 17 62 59 74 93 and 78 86 associate with mgo this result matches the major peaks of periclase mgo in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards 45 0946 37 weak peaks observed at 2θ 31 58 36 76 37 17 45 59 65 65 49 69 79 and 78 86 associate with al2mgo4 2θ 35 9 36 76 37 17 42 05 62 59 and 65 49 associate with al0 58 mg0 42 2θ 32 48 36 76 37 17 43 17 45 and 67 15 associate with al2o3 2θ 23 07 25 75 26 71 30 31 58 32 48 35 91 36 76 37 17 39 87 42 05 43 17 45 52 48 and 67 15 associate with caal2o4 the cnts and graphite peaks on the xrd did not observed because mgo coated the cnts and graphite these results suggest that the mgo as the main constituents of the sintered features had a significant correlation with the features prior synthesizing the surface morphologies of the optimum catalyst were characterized using fesem fig 3 as seen in fig 3 the surface of the optimum catalyst is heterogeneous and porous that has irregular shapes and sizes and mgo keeps its main surface morphology after catalyst synthesizing and were fixed onto each other these results are in accordance with the results of other researchers 37 42 elemental analysis of the catalyst was used edax and results are given in fig 4 magnesium mg carbon c aluminum al silica si and oxygen o with weight percentages of 27 55 35 04 2 13 2 65 and 32 63 respectively are the main elements in the optimum catalyst figs 4 and s4 also show that the amounts of aluminum and silica elements that were added by kaolinite to the catalyst as a binding material are negligible and carbon oxygen and magnesium are the main element in composite these findings indicate that all elements were effectively bonded with each other in the selected method and mgo successfully coated the cnts and graphite the ftir spectra of the composite in fig 5 shows main peaks at 3430 2927 2855 1735 1630 1457 1171 and 600 cm 1 on the spectra according to fig 5 a strong broad band at 3430 cm 1 can be ascribed to the stretching mode of surface hydroxyl groups oh because of the molecular water physical adsorption 43 whereas the peaks at 1630 cm 1 is corresponding to the cc terminal double bonds 37 and the peaks at 1735 cm 1 is associated with the co stretching vibration of the catalyst 44 45 the peaks at 2855 cm 1 and 2927 cm 1 illustrate ch symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibration respectively 45 a wide band at 1457 cm 1 can be assigned to mgo stretching mode 18 37 the peak at 1171 cm 1 is because of the h ion a broad peak appeared around 600 cm 1 is associated with mgo stretching mode 18 45 tem image fig 6 shows that the dispersion of the optimum catalyst particles is relatively high and that there is a broad particle size distribution the size and shape of the particles are preserved at nano ranges in the different steps of synthesizing and did not obviously destroy the structure of the components the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were applied to find the textural features bet surface area and total pore volume and the resutls are shown in fig 7 and table 6 as shown the surface area of optimum catalyst was calculated to be 221 631 m2 g 1 the sample exhibits the mesopore structure with an average pore diameter at 36 582 nm however as shown in the sem image a few agglomerated sites are also visible in the tem image which may be related to pressing the composite the high catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite can be justified with the interactions among o3 molecules and the increased basic functional groups on the high specific surface of optimum catalyst and formation of very reactive species especially oh 7 in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation the basic surface functional groups have a significant effect on increasing the ozone transformation to oh because of the electrophilic features of solution 46 47 regarding the chosen ph of aqueous media 7 and phpzc of the optimum catalyst 9 3 the surface of nano mgo particles were positively charged in the form of mgoh2 in chosen experimental conditions 48 furthermore based on fig 5 ftir spectra a high density of hydroxyl groups was present on the catalyst surface while ozone has both nucleophilic and electrophilic sites so when catalyst was added to the reactor the dissolved ozone molecules can interact with both the h electrophilic and o nucleophilic atoms of the oh groups available on the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite surface consequently the basic functional groups acted as the ozone destruction initiator and accelerated the oh formation 49 leading to the cod and toc removal enhancement for confirming the enhancement of decomposition of ozone with optimum catalyst the dosages of o3 in the inlet and exhaust gas of the sop and cop experiments were determined apparently ozone removal in the sop and cop experiments at the same dosages of o3 were 21 2 2 and 78 2 respectively so the optimum catalyst caused a significant increase in the removal of ozone and oh production which led to increasing the cod and toc removal percentages it was deduced that addition of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite into the ozonation reactor catalyzed the organic materials oxidation by means of increasing the decomposition of ozone and production of oxidative radical species such as oh 3 4 effect of the presence of radical scavengers to confirm that the organic compounds were oxidized by generated oh in cop cod and toc removal efficiencies were measured with several common radical scavengers including tert butanol sulfate and carbonate 50 fig s5 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies at the ph of 7 catalyst dosage 1 g l initial cod and toc concentration of 617 and 121 mg l and run time of 60 min it is observed that the tert butanol inhibited the cod and toc removal the tert butanol is a potent radical scavenger with a much higher reaction rate with oh species 51 52 therefore the cod and toc removal efficiencies decreases in the vicinity of tert butanol that clearly confirmed the oh formation in the cop another point observed in fig s5 is that the sulfate and carbonate as compared with tert butanol had less effect on cod and toc removal efficiencies in the cop it can be attributed to the point that these anions have a lower reaction rate constant with oh and thereby oh was mainly scavenged by tert butanol 52 indeed radical scavengers react with oh converting to anion radicals whereas the oxidation capacity of hydroxyl radicals is much more than anion radicals 53 3 5 mineralization of organic compounds in cop and sop the average oxidation state of carbon aosc as a most important factor that describes the nature of wastewater compounds and declares indirectly about the average oxidation state of the organic substances in aqueous media via comparison between toc and cod using the eq 3 54 55 3 a o s c 4 4 0 375 c o d t o c where 0 375 is a ratio between the carbon molecular mass and oxygen to display cod and toc in mmol by description aosc amounts are ranged between 4 i e methane and 4 i e carbon dioxide higher aosc values indicate the better oxidation of the organic materials however it should be noted that aosc does not consider for substances entirely mineralized it can be seen that in all experiments aosc increases with time from an initial value around zero as a result of slight degradation of organic substances however this increment was higher in catalytic experiments 54 the aosc value of the starting pesticide wastewater sample was about 1 as the aosc is low for sole ozonation the average oxidation amount of the organic substances increased to 0 2 after 3 h reaction which however remains low adding the optimum catalyst during the ozonation process resulted in a three step process from 0 to 30 min aosc from 1 to 0 32 from 30 to 60 min aosc 1 17 and 1 up to 3 h aosc from 1 17 to 3 see fig s6 3 6 catalyst stability and reusability the catalyst performance durability and reusability have a significant effect on the catalytic reactions the durability and reusability studies of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite were performed in five consecutive ozonation experiments these findings suggest that prepared optimum nano mgo cnt graphite could preserve its catalytic property as well as its stability after five consecutive usages and thus it is a reusable catalyst capable of preserving its catalytic activity see fig s7 3 7 catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite kinetic analysis different pathways for the cod and toc removal efficiencies by ozonation with optimum nano mgo cnt graphite should be taken into account parent substances or intermediates adsorption onto the catalysts simple oxidation via o3 molecules in aqueous media oxidation in the aqueous media by free radicals obtained by destruction of ozone initiated by oh and ho2 ions oxidation by free radicals in the aqueous media due to catalytic destruction of o3 and oxidation on the catalyst surface 56 with regard to mentioned pathways and obtained findings the mechanistic approach would be defined as follows first the organic substances were degraded via direct ozonation for transformation in intermediates that were more recalcitrant than the parent substances a group of intermediates can be attached to the surfaces of catalyst once ozone begins accumulating in aqueous media it will lead to reaching the surfaces of catalyst there o3 could be adsorbed onto the surface of catalyst and converting to surface oxide species and releasing free radicals to aqueous media 57 meanwhile ozone has the possibility of reaction with adsorbed compounds reactions of surface oxidation and bulk water free radicals had the most effect on the mineralization of the oxidation intermediates for a better illustration of the catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process the kinetics of cod and toc removal efficiencies were compared accordance with the following reaction model eqs 4 and 5 4 l n c t c 0 k o b s t 5 r 1 d c d t k o b s c 0 where c0 and ct represent the initial and residual amount of cod and toc respectively and kobs is pseudo first order pfo reaction rate constant according to the obtained findings the pfo model had a desirable fitness r2 0 99 with both the cod and toc removal efficiencies table 7 shows the findings of the kinetics of cod and toc removal efficiencies accordingly the rate of cod removal in the cop rcop 13 24 mg cod l min was about 12 73 times greater than that in the sop rsop 1 04 mg cod l min moreover the rate of toc removal in the sop and cop was 0 2 mg toc l min and 1 44 mg toc l min respectively it confirm the significant catalytic activities of the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process of cod and toc removal the removal efficiency of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was investigated in the cod and toc removal efficiencies at constant variables ph 7 catalyst dosage 1 g l fig 8 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the sop and o3 nano mgo cnt graphite process cop the sop efficacy in the removal of cod and toc increased from about 1 31 12 19 and 0 89 9 56 respectively with the increase of the reaction time from 5 min to 60 min according to fig 8 addition of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite into the reactor significantly improved the cod and toc removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of cod and toc in the cop increased from 5 81 and 3 18 72 41 and 51 07 respectively when the reaction time was increased from 5 to 60 min accordingly the destruction efficiency of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process of cod and toc removal efficiencies enhanced from 80 17 94 17 with the reaction time increasing from 5 min to 60 min indicated that the time did not have negative effect on destruction efficiency and it may be related to low adsorption of organic materials on catalyst fig s6 illustrates the organic materials mineralization level as a function of contact time according to the findings cod and toc adsorption onto optimum nano mgo cnt graphite were obtained 4 23 and 3 64 at the maximum contact time 60 min respectively the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite potential for catalyzing the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the ozonation reactor was around 56 during 60 min hence fig 8 illustrates that optimum nano mgo cnt graphite represent significant catalytic activities to degrade and mineralize the organic substances in the ozonation reactor 4 conclusions magnesium oxide nanoparticles carbon nanotube and graphite were used to prepare a new catalyst for applying in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of pmpw the compatibility of the catalyst with desired components was determined according to an evmd kinetics of pmpw catalytic oxidation showed that the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite o3 process were 12 73 13 24 1 04 mg cod l min and 7 11 1 44 0 2 mg toc l min times higher than those in the sole ozonation process sop respectively apparently the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite showed a significant ability to catalyze the ozonation procedure of organic substances via increasing the decomposition of o3 and production of oh the synthesized optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was proved to be reusable due to its durability of catalytic activity ultimately the developed process is an applicable technique for synthesizing nano mgo cnt graphite to catalyze the ozonation of organic pollutants in

14189,the production of an efficient reusable stable and easily separable catalyst in the ozonation process through a reliable procedure is one of the essential requirements of the catalytic ozonation process cop in this study the nano mgo cnt graphite composite was synthesized to use as a new catalyst in the cop synthesis of the nano mgo cnt graphite was carried out based on the extreme vertices mixture design evmd using three components mgo nanoparticles carbon nanotubes cnts and graphite based on evmd 9 compositions were produced for assessing the catalytic activity of synthesized compositions pesticide manufacturing plant wastewater pmpw initial cod 617 mg l and toc 121 was treated in cop with new synthesized catalytic the highest cod and toc removal and destruction efficiencies were attained with composition c 9 the surface area of the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was calculated to be had 221 631 m2 g 1 and a high density of basic surface functional groups kinetics of pmpw oxidation indicated that the rate of cod and toc removal efficiencies in the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite o3 process were 12 73 13 24 1 04 mg cod l min and 7 11 1 44 0 2 mg toc l min times as high as those in the single ozonation sop respectively clearly the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite showed a significant ability in catalysis of the ozonation process of organic materials by means of increasing o3 decomposition and oh production the synthesized optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was reusable because of the stability and durability of the catalytic activities keywords catalytic ozonation mixture design nano mgo cnt graphite hydroxyl radical 1 introduction recently advanced oxidation methods aops such as o3 h2o2 1 o3 uv 2 uv h2o2 3 uv photolysis 3 photocatalytic oxidation with tio2 4 5 have been applied to remove organic substances from aqueous solution catalytic ozonation as an effective process has given special attention to the removal of organic matter from aqueous solutions catalytic ozonation has to bring about fast removal of organic contaminants and higher efficient mineralization of refractory substances 6 7 cop would be branched into two subcategory which accelerate the decomposition of ozone and formation of hydroxyl radicals homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic ozonation heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has shown to have a high removal efficiency of organic contaminants from aqueous media 7 9 in these processes catalysts were applied for the acceleration of removal of ozone for generation of hydroxyl radicals radicals reactions with pollutant molecules are in contrary with molecular ozone direct reactions non selective and rapid 7 9 10 these non selective radicals can oxidize the toxic contaminants for converting to easily biodegradable substances 11 metal oxides metals on supports metal oxides and ac zeolites modified with ac and metals are the most common applied catalysts in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 7 11 many metal oxides such as magnesium oxide manganese dioxide zinc oxide cerium dioxide titanium dioxide aluminum oxides and iron oxides have been applied as catalysts 9 12 13 of those the applied catalysts mgo represented perfect catalytic ability to remove a wide range of contaminants because of the structural stability extensive activity low toxicity and environmental friendliness 14 16 the homogeneous precipitation technique is an efficient process in mgo synthesis because of feasibility availability of pristine substances cost effectiveness and excellent performance 17 18 the use of homogenous ozonation for water purification is not logical due to the need to remove metallic ions from purified water which is almost ineffective while given that the metal ions catalytic activity has been observed at low dosage their use in treating wastewater containing large quantities of organic matter is also not feasible the use of a heterogeneous catalytic ozonation method due to its capability of reuse is an advantage but in many cases its reuse is limited due to the release of the catalyst compounds into the solution which increases the cost of the treatment process 14 19 but the inevitable metal leaching limits their application in terms of green development 20 from 2004 the application of carbon substances as supports of catalyst has been widely considered in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation carbon materials such as fullerenes graphene and cnts are used for composites synthesizing 21 graphene has sheet like structure consisting sp2 carbons with high mechanical strength large surface area 2600 m2 g and appreciable charge carrier transportation 21 furthermore in recent years graphene and their oxide products as a single atomic layer of graphite have been applied as either catalysts or catalyst supports in ozonation which represented the extensive high catalytic ability on organic contaminants removal 19 also graphene has the ability to be applied as interesting reinforcements for composites due to the exceptional mechanical and physical characteristics 19 recently graphene has been applied as an effective reinforcement substance for metal matrix composites 22 graphite has been applied in wet air oxidation as a catalyst support which has more stability than cnts and activated carbon in ozonation because of its excellent graphitic structure and lower faults 18 cnts carbon xerogel and activated carbon ac have been applied as catalyst supporter in aops 13 23 25 cnts would have a higher ability to use a supports for catalyst in comparison with ac in the liquid phase reactions because of the excellent thermal chemical electrical and mechanical characteristics the good performance of cnts used as a catalyst or catalyst support has been proven in catalytic wet air oxidation 26 cnts are also known as applicable substances for several objectives including environmental clean up perspectives 27 28 regarding carbon substances cnts have a high ability to act as efficient catalysts or catalyst supports for helping ozone in organic substances degradation in aqueous solution similar to the performance of activated carbon 27 indeed regarding the mesoporous structures and high surface areas cnts would be appropriate to be applied as a supports in the acceleration of the uniform dispersion of active products and in providing higher active sites for catalytic reactions 27 furthermore the addition of nanocarbons influencing the mechanical properties of the composite 22 29 31 although the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has the advantages such as thorough mineralization of refractory pollutants or production of more biodegradable by products easily setting and operation of the system and no need for other chemicals 32 but the leaching of the catalyst components such as metal oxides into the bulk solution and more catalyst consumption is the main limitation of such processes 7 33 as regards the cop is a new method and understudying process studying and synthesizing a new persistent efficient easily separable and reusable catalyst is essential therefore the purpose of this research was developing a resistant and highly efficient catalyst with more reusability a constrained mixture design covers a smaller space within the mixture simplex design the phenomenon happens while extra limitations in the form of upper and or lower constraints are put onto the constituent features 34 these kinds of mixture designs are mentioned to as evmd for this purpose mgo nanoparticles was synthesized successfully then cnt and graphite were mixed with nano mgo with proportions obtained from the mixture design kaolinite used to bond materials to each other kaolinite is used for production of porcelain brick tiles and chamotte the chemical structure of kaolinite is al2si2o5 oh 4 35 the obtained composition was directly transferred to an electrical furnace to strength the temperature was then increased gradually up to 1350 c and was kept at this temperature for 2 h by enhancement of the sintering temperature the relative density and densification of the composites showed an increasing trend 22 noteworthy to say that the sintering temperature has a considerable effect on the densification features microstructural evolution and properties enhancement of matrix composites 22 the interaction with oxygen at high temperatures causes improving the oxidation of the materials and negatively affects the sintering process in order to prevent the oxidation of materials during sintering argon and hydrogen injection was applied 36 finally the composition was crushed and passed through a 40 30 mesh sieve and then stored in a desiccator for use in the experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all applied

mgno3 6h2o was mixed in approximately 100 ml of de ionized water in 1 l beaker after that 1 6 g 0 4 m sodium hydroxide was mixed in 100 ml of de ionized water then was added to the magnesium nitrate solution which was prepared earlier drop wise with continuous stirring 30 min the stirring of the solution was performed during 4 h for the generation of the mg oh 2 precipitate the centrifugation of obtained precipitate was carried out at 3000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the magnesium hydroxide gel subsequently the process of washing was done using methanol and distilled water then it was dried at 120 c during 24 h finally the calcination of obtained material was performed at 450 c during 2 h and nano mgo particles were created 37 2 3 catalyst preparation the compatibility of compositions with desired components was obtained based on an evmd using three components magnesium oxide nanoparticles nano mgo as the main constituent of catalyst with a ratio of 81 5 98 cnts with an external diameter of less than 20 nm with a ratio of less than 4 5 and graphite in the size range of 200 150 meshes astm with a ratio of 2 14 to form the bond between components kaolinite 38 in the size range of smaller than 50 meshes astm was added up to 20 by weight of the mixture as described in table 1 the raw materials in accordance with table 1 and distilled water as much as needed were poured into a 250 ml stainless steel cup to create a homogeneous mixture the contents of the cup were rotated at 150 rpm in a planetary mill for a period of 2 h after drying the slurry at 120 c the resulting compositions were pressurized by a hydraulic press of 20 atm 1 ton cm2 to reach desired densification 31 in order to stabilize the structure and create a persistent compound all of the specimens were sintered in an electrically heated furnace under hydrogen and argon controlled atmosphere with a flow of 200 and 50 ml min 1 respectively for 2 h at 1350 c using a heating rate of 5 c min the compositions were grinded to obtain fine granules 40 30 mesh and were washed 3 times with distilled water then were dried at 90 c for 48 h and were stored in a desiccator for use in the further experiments 36 2 4 catalytic ozonation experiments and optimum catalyst selection based on the evmd 9 compositions were synthesized for assessing the efficiency of catalytic activity of compositions experiments were taken on pmpw samples the tests were done in a pyrex cylindrical impinger as a reactor with total working volume of 500cc which carried out in a semi batch mode the system consisted of three parts ozone generation and injection reactor and an exhaust gas purification the exhaust gas was further purified with a 2 ki solution to destruct the effluent ozone see fig 1 ozone was generated by an ozone generator arda mog 5g h the ozonation rate was constant at 1 g h throughout the experiments all runs were performed at laboratory temperature of 23 3 c control experiments were carried out with sole ozonation to confirm the catalytic activity of the compositions all variables were considered constant ph 7 initial cod and toc of 10 times diluted wastewater 617 and 121 mg l respectively catalyst dosage 1 g l and ozonation time 30 min the ph of the solution was adjusted using hcl or naoh normal solutions the catalyst was easily separated by sedimentation after each run before analysis the residual catalyst was separated through a 0 2 μm ptfe syringe filter all samples were analyzed for cod and toc besides adsorption capacity of all compositions was evaluated for quantification of their removal efficiencies the spent catalyst mc was separated from the suspension by the sedimentation at the end of the target test and the amounts of adsorbed cod and toc md were calculated by measuring the concentrations of cod and toc after and before the adsorption experiment considering the volume of the working solutions 500 ml the amounts of cod and toc before mb and after ma the catalytic reaction finally the removal and destruction efficiencies were calculated from below equations 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y m b m a m b 100 2 d e s t r u c t i o n e f f

of variance one way anova the best fitting model was selected for each composition response based on the p values f values and the predictive equations containing only significant terms were built from stepwise multiple regression analysis 39 the optimum catalyst was selected by using minitab 17 and design expert 7 anova was used to determine the effective level of responses of this model the catalytic ozonation mineralization efficacy was evaluated with optimum catalyst additionally for understanding the durability and reusability of the optimum catalyst the applied catalyst was collected from solution dried and the catalytic activity was examined for five consecutive cycles 2 5 characterization of optimum catalyst the pore volume and size distribution specific surface area and

the nano mgo cnt graphite measured via x ray diffraction xrd pw1730 philips scanned for 2θ between 10 and 80 the functional groups on the surface of catalyst were measured by ftir avatar thermo at the wave numbers ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the microstructural evaluation was performed by means of fesem fe sem mira iii czech republic equipped with energy dispersive x ray edx microanalysis to characterize the surface structure of the catalyst the result of edx microanalysis was used to show the existence of primary components in the synthesized catalyst the specific surface area ssa and the pore size measurement of catalyst particles were carried out by the bet using the n2 adsorption desorption method at 77 k by using a belsorp mini ii japan surface area analyzer and calculated

compositions the cod and toc degradation efficiencies in the sop were constant at 9 62 and 7 42 respectively cod and toc adsorption onto compositions removal and destruction efficiencies of cod and toc in cop under the considered conditions were shown in table 1 according to table 1 the highest cod and toc removal efficiencies were attained with composition c 9 this high removal and destruction efficiencies might become from the presence of all each three components of composition in optimum quantity 81 5 nano mgo 14 graphite and 4 5 cnt compared to other compositions from these results it can be concluded that as prepared composition has a significant synergistic effect in coupling with ozone and effectively enhances the degradation the better performance of the cop in comparison to the sop indicated that optimum nano mgo cnt graphite possess an excellent catalytic activity in oxidative degradation processes 3 2 expert design and validation of model in this study the evmd was applied for determination of the measurement points this method fully symmetrical distributed experimental points and a well selected multinomial equation 39 performing accurate measurements at every point during the mixture design is expensive time consuming or simply impractical design of experiments doe is one possible method to address these issues 41 this approach may be used to optimize experiment plans the goal is performing the lowest number of experiments while gaining the maximum amount of data for the development of an efficient and reproducible model with the desired properties to study the significance and the adequacy of the model variance analysis anova was applied 41 analysis of variance results using a set of hierarchical models with increasing complexity using the anova linear model showed statistical significance see tables 2 and 3 according to table 3 r2 is 0 9793 and 0 9307 for cod and toc removal efficiencies respectively that indicated the model exactly fit the experimentally measured cod and toc the significance of each coefficient to the fit of the model was then evaluated by its p value which was calculated from the ratio of the coefficient to its standard deviation according to table 2 p value of cod and toc removal efficiencies are 0 0001 and 0 0003 respectively where the coefficients with a p value less than 0 05 were considered to have a significant influence on the fitting of the model the model f values of 141 79 and 40 31 for cod and toc removal efficiencies confirmed the model significance and there have been just a 0 01 and 0 03 chance that model occurs due to noise the predicted r2 of 0 9611 and 0 8575 for cod and toc removal efficiencies are in good agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9724 and 0 9077 respectively the adequate precision of the model measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is suitable the ratio of 32 371 and 17 991 indicate a sufficient signal the model would be applied for navigation of the design space surface fitting of the tested models is illustrated in fig s1 table 4 shows the model general analysis which confirms that it is statistically significant a comparison of actual with the predicted results revealed a significant correlation of r2 0 9793 and 0 9307 in cod and toc removal efficiencies fig s2a a normal distribution was obtained by comparing internally studentized residue results to the normal probability values fig s2b a comparison of internally studentized residues with run number and the predicted data is illustrated in fig s3 that confirms the application of the regression model in which the random distribution trend was not seen the main aim of the test was obtaining the obvious information about the component proportions in a mixture marked by the maximum percentage removal efficiency according to the fit to the model of the linear equation desired for this experiment the applicability profile for approximating data was produced and subsequently the optimum combination of the catalyst composition was obtained a predicted composition of the mixture is presented in table 5 with regard to the desirability and the maximum removal efficiency the composition c 9 was desired as the optimum catalyst for the next experiments 3 3 characteristics of the optimum catalyst the optimum catalyst was entirely characterized the xrd diagram of the optimum catalyst is illustrated in fig 2 sharp peaks observed at 2θ 37 17 43 17 62 59 74 93 and 78 86 associate with mgo this result matches the major peaks of periclase mgo in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards 45 0946 37 weak peaks observed at 2θ 31 58 36 76 37 17 45 59 65 65 49 69 79 and 78 86 associate with al2mgo4 2θ 35 9 36 76 37 17 42 05 62 59 and 65 49 associate with al0 58 mg0 42 2θ 32 48 36 76 37 17 43 17 45 and 67 15 associate with al2o3 2θ 23 07 25 75 26 71 30 31 58 32 48 35 91 36 76 37 17 39 87 42 05 43 17 45 52 48 and 67 15 associate with caal2o4 the cnts and graphite peaks on the xrd did not observed because mgo coated the cnts and graphite these results suggest that the mgo as the main constituents of the sintered features had a significant correlation with the features prior synthesizing the surface morphologies of the optimum catalyst were characterized using fesem fig 3 as seen in fig 3 the surface of the optimum catalyst is heterogeneous and porous that has irregular shapes and sizes and mgo keeps its main surface morphology after catalyst synthesizing and were fixed onto each other these results are in accordance with the results of other researchers 37 42 elemental analysis of the catalyst was used edax and results are given in fig 4 magnesium mg carbon c aluminum al silica si and oxygen o with weight percentages of 27 55 35 04 2 13 2 65 and 32 63 respectively are the main elements in the optimum catalyst figs 4 and s4 also show that the amounts of aluminum and silica elements that were added by kaolinite to the catalyst as a binding material are negligible and carbon oxygen and magnesium are the main element in composite these findings indicate that all elements were effectively bonded with each other in the selected method and mgo successfully coated the cnts and graphite the ftir spectra of the composite in fig 5 shows main peaks at 3430 2927 2855 1735 1630 1457 1171 and 600 cm 1 on the spectra according to fig 5 a strong broad band at 3430 cm 1 can be ascribed to the stretching mode of surface hydroxyl groups oh because of the molecular water physical adsorption 43 whereas the peaks at 1630 cm 1 is corresponding to the cc terminal double bonds 37 and the peaks at 1735 cm 1 is associated with the co stretching vibration of the catalyst 44 45 the peaks at 2855 cm 1 and 2927 cm 1 illustrate ch symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibration respectively 45 a wide band at 1457 cm 1 can be assigned to mgo stretching mode 18 37 the peak at 1171 cm 1 is because of the h ion a broad peak appeared around 600 cm 1 is associated with mgo stretching mode 18 45 tem image fig 6 shows that the dispersion of the optimum catalyst particles is relatively high and that there is a broad particle size distribution the size and shape of the particles are preserved at nano ranges in the different steps of synthesizing and did not obviously destroy the structure of the components the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were applied to find the textural features bet surface area and total pore volume and the resutls are shown in fig 7 and table 6 as shown the surface area of optimum catalyst was calculated to be 221 631 m2 g 1 the sample exhibits the mesopore structure with an average pore diameter at 36 582 nm however as shown in the sem image a few agglomerated sites are also visible in the tem image which may be related to pressing the composite the high catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite can be justified with the interactions among o3 molecules and the increased basic functional groups on the high specific surface of optimum catalyst and formation of very reactive species especially oh 7 in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation the basic surface functional groups have a significant effect on increasing the ozone transformation to oh because of the electrophilic features of solution 46 47 regarding the chosen ph of aqueous media 7 and phpzc of the optimum catalyst 9 3 the surface of nano mgo particles were positively charged in the form of mgoh2 in chosen experimental conditions 48 furthermore based on fig 5 ftir spectra a high density of hydroxyl groups was present on the catalyst surface while ozone has both nucleophilic and electrophilic sites so when catalyst was added to the reactor the dissolved ozone molecules can interact with both the h electrophilic and o nucleophilic atoms of the oh groups available on the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite surface consequently the basic functional groups acted as the ozone destruction initiator and accelerated the oh formation 49 leading to the cod and toc removal enhancement for confirming the enhancement of decomposition of ozone with optimum catalyst the dosages of o3 in the inlet and exhaust gas of the sop and cop experiments were determined apparently ozone removal in the sop and cop experiments at the same dosages of o3 were 21 2 2 and 78 2 respectively so the optimum catalyst caused a significant increase in the removal of ozone and oh production which led to increasing the cod and toc removal percentages it was deduced that addition of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite into the ozonation reactor catalyzed the organic materials oxidation by means of increasing the decomposition of ozone and production of oxidative radical species such as oh 3 4 effect of the presence of radical scavengers to confirm that the organic compounds were oxidized by generated oh in cop cod and toc removal efficiencies were measured with several common radical scavengers including tert butanol sulfate and carbonate 50 fig s5 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies at the ph of 7 catalyst dosage 1 g l initial cod and toc concentration of 617 and 121 mg l and run time of 60 min it is observed that the tert butanol inhibited the cod and toc removal the tert butanol is a potent radical scavenger with a much higher reaction rate with oh species 51 52 therefore the cod and toc removal efficiencies decreases in the vicinity of tert butanol that clearly confirmed the oh formation in the cop another point observed in fig s5 is that the sulfate and carbonate as compared with tert butanol had less effect on cod and toc removal efficiencies in the cop it can be attributed to the point that these anions have a lower reaction rate constant with oh and thereby oh was mainly scavenged by tert butanol 52 indeed radical scavengers react with oh converting to anion radicals whereas the oxidation capacity of hydroxyl radicals is much more than anion radicals 53 3 5 mineralization of organic compounds in cop and sop the average oxidation state of carbon aosc as a most important factor that describes the nature of wastewater compounds and declares indirectly about the average oxidation state of the organic substances in aqueous media via comparison between toc and cod using the eq 3 54 55 3 a o s c 4 4 0 375 c o d t o c where 0 375 is a ratio between the carbon molecular mass and oxygen to display cod and toc in mmol by description aosc amounts are ranged between 4 i e methane and 4 i e carbon dioxide higher aosc values indicate the better oxidation of the organic materials however it should be noted that aosc does not consider for substances entirely mineralized it can be seen that in all experiments aosc increases with time from an initial value around zero as a result of slight degradation of organic substances however this increment was higher in catalytic experiments 54 the aosc value of the starting pesticide wastewater sample was about 1 as the aosc is low for sole ozonation the average oxidation amount of the organic substances increased to 0 2 after 3 h reaction which however remains low adding the optimum catalyst during the ozonation process resulted in a three step process from 0 to 30 min aosc from 1 to 0 32 from 30 to 60 min aosc 1 17 and 1 up to 3 h aosc from 1 17 to 3 see fig s6 3 6 catalyst stability and reusability the catalyst performance durability and reusability have a significant effect on the catalytic reactions the durability and reusability studies of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite were performed in five consecutive ozonation experiments these findings suggest that prepared optimum nano mgo cnt graphite could preserve its catalytic property as well as its stability after five consecutive usages and thus it is a reusable catalyst capable of preserving its catalytic activity see fig s7 3 7 catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite kinetic analysis different pathways for the cod and toc removal efficiencies by ozonation with optimum nano mgo cnt graphite should be taken into account parent substances or intermediates adsorption onto the catalysts simple oxidation via o3 molecules in aqueous media oxidation in the aqueous media by free radicals obtained by destruction of ozone initiated by oh and ho2 ions oxidation by free radicals in the aqueous media due to catalytic destruction of o3 and oxidation on the catalyst surface 56 with regard to mentioned pathways and obtained findings the mechanistic approach would be defined as follows first the organic substances were degraded via direct ozonation for transformation in intermediates that were more recalcitrant than the parent substances a group of intermediates can be attached to the surfaces of catalyst once ozone begins accumulating in aqueous media it will lead to reaching the surfaces of catalyst there o3 could be adsorbed onto the surface of catalyst and converting to surface oxide species and releasing free radicals to aqueous media 57 meanwhile ozone has the possibility of reaction with adsorbed compounds reactions of surface oxidation and bulk water free radicals had the most effect on the mineralization of the oxidation intermediates for a better illustration of the catalytic activity of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process the kinetics of cod and toc removal efficiencies were compared accordance with the following reaction model eqs 4 and 5 4 l n c t c 0 k o b s t 5 r 1 d c d t k o b s c 0 where c0 and ct represent the initial and residual amount of cod and toc respectively and kobs is pseudo first order pfo reaction rate constant according to the obtained findings the pfo model had a desirable fitness r2 0 99 with both the cod and toc removal efficiencies table 7 shows the findings of the kinetics of cod and toc removal efficiencies accordingly the rate of cod removal in the cop rcop 13 24 mg cod l min was about 12 73 times greater than that in the sop rsop 1 04 mg cod l min moreover the rate of toc removal in the sop and cop was 0 2 mg toc l min and 1 44 mg toc l min respectively it confirm the significant catalytic activities of the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process of cod and toc removal the removal efficiency of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was investigated in the cod and toc removal efficiencies at constant variables ph 7 catalyst dosage 1 g l fig 8 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the sop and o3 nano mgo cnt graphite process cop the sop efficacy in the removal of cod and toc increased from about 1 31 12 19 and 0 89 9 56 respectively with the increase of the reaction time from 5 min to 60 min according to fig 8 addition of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite into the reactor significantly improved the cod and toc removal efficiencies the removal efficiencies of cod and toc in the cop increased from 5 81 and 3 18 72 41 and 51 07 respectively when the reaction time was increased from 5 to 60 min accordingly the destruction efficiency of optimum nano mgo cnt graphite on the ozonation process of cod and toc removal efficiencies enhanced from 80 17 94 17 with the reaction time increasing from 5 min to 60 min indicated that the time did not have negative effect on destruction efficiency and it may be related to low adsorption of organic materials on catalyst fig s6 illustrates the organic materials mineralization level as a function of contact time according to the findings cod and toc adsorption onto optimum nano mgo cnt graphite were obtained 4 23 and 3 64 at the maximum contact time 60 min respectively the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite potential for catalyzing the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the ozonation reactor was around 56 during 60 min hence fig 8 illustrates that optimum nano mgo cnt graphite represent significant catalytic activities to degrade and mineralize the organic substances in the ozonation reactor 4 conclusions magnesium oxide nanoparticles carbon nanotube and graphite were used to prepare a new catalyst for applying in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of pmpw the compatibility of the catalyst with desired components was determined according to an evmd kinetics of pmpw catalytic oxidation showed that the cod and toc removal efficiencies in the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite o3 process were 12 73 13 24 1 04 mg cod l min and 7 11 1 44 0 2 mg toc l min times higher than those in the sole ozonation process sop respectively apparently the optimum nano mgo cnt graphite showed a significant ability to catalyze the ozonation procedure of organic substances via increasing the decomposition of o3 and production of oh the synthesized optimum nano mgo cnt graphite was proved to be reusable due to its durability of catalytic activity ultimately the developed process is an applicable technique for synthesizing nano mgo cnt graphite to catalyze the ozonation of organic pollutants in
