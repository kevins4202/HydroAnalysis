11455,groundwater overexploitation due to unsustainable agricultural development is a widespread problem in irrigation districts relying on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources nearly 90 of global groundwater supported irrigated areas have conjunctive use of both surface and groundwater a major driver behind the use of groundwater in these regions in addition to surface water scarcity is the poor operational performance of the irrigation schemes the lack of reliability of water deliveries at farm gates forces farmers to increasingly turn to groundwater therefore they intensively extract water and continuously deteriorate groundwater aquifers this case study investigates the potential impact of improved water distribution and delivery through implementing canal automation techniques these techniques can enhance the reliability of irrigation deliveries to the endpoint resulting in reduction of groundwater extraction and associated benefits in decreasing energy consumption and co2 emissions the current study focuses on six main irrigation districts located in the zayandeh rud river basin zrb in central iran where a total area of 200 000 ha is irrigated using surface water in conjunction with groundwater to improve the performance of the irrigation networks for each of these districts three operational model alternatives including fully automated systems were considered each of these models was designed and run for each of the six districts separately the results showed a reduction of operational water losses in the range of 15 25 depending on the implemented operational model these potential water savings are then available to be used in the agricultural sector and can result in a reduction in groundwater extraction of up to 300 million cubic meters mcm the associated reduction in energy consumption and carbon emission was about 450 gwh and 57 500 t each year respectively the results of this study can be employed in designing a centralized configuration of automated systems that enable water managers to reduce pressure on groundwater resources keywords groundwater overexploitation canal operation automation reliable water delivery energy saving 1 introduction providing a reliable source of water for irrigation districts is a major concern especially in regions with frequent water shortage periods to remedy the situation a wide range of solutions have been prescribed and sometimes implemented in whole or in part the solutions offered range from short term supply oriented measures such as interbasin water transfer projects madani and mariño 2009 desalinization ghaffour et al 2013 conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources singh 2014 construction of reservoirs zhuo et al 2017 and mid term and long term demand management strategies i e converting to pressurized irrigation techniques garcía et al 2017 increasing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture taghvaeian and neale 2011 and change of cropping pattern inas et al 2017 within these solutions the simultaneous use of surface and groundwater resources also known as the conjunctive use has become the preliminary action to overcome water deficiencies and improve the environmental impacts of most irrigation districts liu et al 2013 singh 2014 nearly 90 of global groundwater supported irrigated areas have conjunctive use of surface and groundwater thenkabail et al 2009 according to a global irrigation map 41 of the total area is irrigated by conjunctive use with less than 15 surface water contribution siebert et al 2010 groundwater remains as the ultimate source of irrigation due to the unreliable performance of the surface water distribution systems in arid and semi arid areas burt 2013 singh 2014 for instance the middle east with 36 6 and southern and east asia with 37 include the highest total irrigated area as a percentage of cultivated land however the value of consumptive groundwater use for irrigation as a percentage of internally produced groundwater is 43 3 for dry regions of the middle east while the value is 12 7 for east asia indicating a significant pressure on groundwater resources for arid areas subject to over extraction and even the exploitation of fossil groundwater siebert et al 2010 substantial investments have been made in canal networks to allocate surface water through farms in the arid and semi arid regions however reliable water distribution has not been attained due to poor canal operation burt 2013 moreover traditional canal operation methods are not capable of dealing with multiple objectives these objectives include equitable water distribution between the upstream and downstream users in drought periods clemmens 2012 water storing strategies using inline or offline reservoirs during the water shortages hashemy et al 2013b and implementing local water markets to incentivise stakeholders to increase profits by saving water and performing efficient operation based on the economic value of water hashemy shahdany et al 2017 negative outcomes are resulting from poor operational management throughout the irrigation districts and this is shifting the dependency of farmers from surface water to the groundwater resources karimi et al 2012 additionally it must be noted that supply oriented measures despite being popular short term solutions are of no benefit in the longer term because there is an underlying issue of physical water scarcity rijsberman 2006 such short term solutions often only postpone the problem at the cost of increasing its magnitude later since they increase the use of water pittock et al 2009 for this reason modernization rehabilitation and renovation of irrigation districts including farm scale and off farm water management need to be focused on long term demand management to achieve this objective operational management strategies need to be upgraded from traditional unreliable methods i e manual operation by ditch riders and employing the hydro mechanical control structures to modern canal operational methods previous studies have shown that automatic operational services can provide consistent and reliable water delivery to water users from those located at the most upstream laterals to all the end users of the main canal due to increases in the reliable performance of the systems clemmens 2012 guan et al 2011 hashemy shahdany et al 2015 an intelligent operation of the canals provided by optimal control systems can significantly reduce the operational water losses within the canals and consequently lead to significant water saving canal system automation requires implementing advanced real time control algorithms to deal with the sophisticated interactions between control objectives and the water saving operational strategy in this study two configurations of decentralized pi and centralized control model predictive control mpc are designed and tested in addition the impacts of performance improvements on reducing operational water losses are thoroughly investigated application of decentralized pi control systems has been investigated in different irrigation canals burt 1999 hashemy et al 2013a van overloop et al 2005 wahlin and clemmens 2006 successful experiences with the first generation of automatic water level regulators encouraged the authorities to upgrade their operational strategies mpc camacho and bordons 2004 which has been widely applied in the studies related to canal automation maestre and negenborn 2014 van overloop et al 2010 zafra cabeza et al 2011 has shown promising performance since it combines feedback control on measured water levels at different locations along the canal with feedforward control to deal with predictable disturbances and optimal control to provide the highly intelligent operational performance of the canal network camacho and bordons 2004 this article hypothesizes that improved canal operational management through automation techniques can improve the surface water distribution system and reduce operational water losses groundwater exploitation energy consumption and co2 emissions throughout the six irrigation districts accordingly the main objectives of this article can be summarized as follows to assess the capability of canal automation techniques to distribute surface water adequately and equitably within the main canals of the study area to examine the potential reductions in groundwater exploitation energy consumption and co2 emission as a result of improving surface water distribution with the automation of irrigation canals finally the present study uses the zayandeh rud river basin a sub basin of the central plateau basin cpb in the central part of iran with six main irrigation network districts as a benchmark 2 overview of the study area 2 1 study area description zayandeh rud river basin zrb is located in the central part of iran on the east side of the zagros mountains in the esfahan province the zayanderud river is one of the major rivers in the central part of iran extending from west to east and draining into the gave khuni swamp fig 1 the zrb has a total area of 41 524 km2 and is characterized by a semi arid climate with a range of 50 1500 mm of annual precipitation 125 mm is the annual average and 1500 mm of annual evapotranspiration for this basin the primary source of water is snowmelt which peaks during spring bhadra et al 2010 an overview diagram of the zrb water budget in the 2011 2012 water year consisting of water resources and total demands according to official data records ide 2015 is presented in fig 2 irresponsible water management has led to an unsustainable condition where there is a 460 million cubic meters mcm annual overexploitation from the groundwater sources surface water sources also face a similar situation although to a lesser extent in which the annual over diversion of the surface water has led to a 16 4 mcm deficit in the water budget currently there are six irrigation districts id within the basin and basic information regarding these including infrastructure operation and groundwater extraction is given in table 1 according to table 1 the total amount of groundwater extraction throughout the 28116 number of tube wells within the six ids in the 2015 2016 water year was about 1232 mcm ide 2015 in addition fig 3 shows the growth in tube well installations in the zrb which are classified as deep deeper than 90 m semi deep 60 90 m and shallow less than 60 m fig 3 shows that the number of tube wells has increased by two to four times in all of the irrigation districts with the exception of id no 3 during the last decade all six ids in zrb receive enough surface water from the zayandeh rud river based on the available information in the local water authority s database to meet their demand during years with normal precipitation ide 2015 however due to poor irrigation efficiency between 32 1 and 42 1 abbasi et al 2017 ide 2015 farmers are forced to extract groundwater continually to meet the crop demand poor operational management and unreliable water distribution within the irrigation canal networks are sources of distrust for the farmers and even the local authorities as a consequence the districts are shifting towards groundwater oriented networks instead of improving the operational performance of conveyance and delivery systems 3 methods and materials 3 1 control systems to investigate the potential of the alternatives for dealing with operational activities a hydrodynamic model of the main canals was developed considering the geometry hydraulic features and resonance behaviour characteristics employing the identification approach explained in detail in van overloop and bombois 2012 van overloop et al 2008 two configurations of the control systems including decentralized and centralized were selected as two sets of practical alternatives to achieve the objectives of the study in this way it is possible to assess the potential for performance improvement in canal operational management to appropriate surface water resources throughout the irrigation districts in the following we deal first with the design calibration and verification of the operational models for the proposed modernization systems for each of the six ids id no 1 to id no 6 then the results are utilized to assess the water energy and carbon emission reduction potentials 3 2 canal operation alternatives to improve the performance of the irrigation networks several operational methods have been proposed and utilized malaterre et al 1998 these can be categorized into two main operational classes improved manual operation and automated operation in this study we investigate intelligent canal operational alternatives by employing automated systems an implementation of these alternatives has been prepared and is coupled with the hydrodynamic model of the irrigation canal the proposed options for operational modernization of the main irrigation canal in this study are summarized and presented in table 2 3 2 1 decentralized controller the decentralized controller configuration is one of the most practical and widely accepted alternatives in canal automation projects it is preferable over centralized controllers due to its reduced implementation requirements operational and maintenance complications and costs ooi and weyer 2008 the single input single output siso control system computes the control actions for each gate by considering only measurements taken in the vicinity van overloop et al 2005 in this study a combination of feedback and feedforward control configurations was used to provide a reasonable operational performance within the controlled canal system the former manipulates the water level at a gate location while the latter feedforward adjusts the head gate based on a known water delivery schedule based on the method proposed by van overloop et al 2005 a low pass filter is added in series with the designed proportional integral pi controllers to make a pif controller the application of this controller leads to the following flow changes through the gate van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k p e f k e f k 1 k i e f k where k is the time step δ q k is the calculated flow change through a controlled gate and k i and k p are the integral and proportional gains respectively e f i s the filtered water level error which is computed as 2 e f k f c e k 1 1 f c e k where f c is the filter constant and e is the water level deviation from the target level at the gate location according to figs 4 and 5 two functional configurations of the pif controller are employed for the alternatives a1 and a2 in a1 the upstream control configuration is utilized while the distant downstream configuration is applied in a2 implementation of the latter configuration requires a communication system connecting the downstream end of the canal sensor to the controller at the upstream side of the pool the components of the pi controller namely the proportional and integral gains in the distant downstream configuration are calculated based on the tuning method proposed by hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop et al 2005 gain values are assigned based on a multiple model optimization of the pi parameters the tuning procedure for the upstream control configuration is derived using an integral delay id model for each of the main canals schuurmans et al 1999 according to the second approach for pi controllers with a low pass filter the tuning rules can be derived separately for short and deep canal reaches and also for long and shallow reaches the hydraulic behaviour of the short and deep canal reaches is dominated by resonance waves schuurmans et al 1999 for this study all the canal reaches from id no 1 to no 6 are long canal reaches with a damping ratio an index that shows the presence of this behaviour in a particular reach smaller than one miltenburg 2008 accordingly the controller s gains for the upstream configuration are calculated by the proposed tuning method for long and shallow reaches the proportional and integral gain values obtained for canal reaches of id no 1 to no 6 considering the type of control configuration are listed in appendix a 3 2 2 centralized controller the centralized controller configuration takes all the variables of the system into account for assigning controlled actions state variables including water level at gate locations are measured and transmitted to a master control station through a communication system the gate adjustments are simultaneously calculated by the centralized controller at each time step and sent to the actuators the centralized control settings are used in the alternative a3 and a schematic view of this is depicted in fig 6 in particular mpc has been designed and tested for the six main canals this centralized strategy is popular due to its satisfactory operational performance and its capacity of dealing with a broad range of optimization objectives within conveyance and delivery systems and uncertainties in the inflow of the supplying canal delay times of water travel and structural and system variables constraints camacho and bordons 2004 to achieve this goal the controller employs the measured values of the state variables of the canal an internal model to predict the hydraulic behaviour of the canal and an objective function identifying the deviation of the system from the target conditions and control objectives the objective function of the mpc which penalizes the deviation of the current regime with respect to the reference during the next n h time steps is described by 3 j u x 0 k 0 n h 1 x t k q x k q l x k u t k r u k x t n h q x n h q l x n h where x k is the state of the system u k represents the controlled variable matrix q q l and r are constant weighting matrices of the proper size n h is the prediction horizon x 0 is the current state and u u 0 u 1 u n h 1 is the sequence of values of the manipulated variables the information required for constructing the internal models for the mpc including the storage area and delay time values for all canal reaches of the study areas is presented in appendix a next the impact of the proposed modern operational alternatives on improving the operational condition of the irrigation districts is assessed the alternatives a1 to a3 were investigated for a normal operating condition with no critical operational circumstances such as water deficit among the main canals or inflow fluctuations due to drought periods to this end the current operations of id no 1 to id no 6 were simulated through an open sources hydrodynamic model manz 1990 to establish the reference condition for comparison the model geometry was constructed by implementing the detailed configuration of the main conveyance and delivery system i e the geometry of canal pools water regulating structures and the off take types subsequently the model was calibrated and verified by field collected operational information the current operational status of the irrigation districts was then simulated for average annual inflow and the performance indicators were calculated to provide a reference for the comparison of the modern operational alternatives 3 3 operational performance indicators the performance indicators for this study are related to the ability of the controller to meet the primary objective which is saving water within the canal by reducing the operational water loss therefore the water conveyance and distribution adequacy ad and equity eq criteria proposed by molden and gates 1990 were employed the ad represents sufficient water delivery according to the agreement between the canal authorities and the water user associations wuas to meet the farmer s demands at the off takes along the main canal otherwise stated the adequacy indicator shows the ability of the operational method to deliver enough water to users and is defined as follows molden and gates 1990 4 a d 1 t t 1 r r p a w i t h p a q d q r i f q d q r p a 1 o t h e r w i s e where q d and q r are respectively the total and required amounts of delivered water to an off take at each time step m3 s t is simulation time ad values closer to unity show a reasonable operational performance from the adequacy perspectives the operational performance from an equity perspective is assessed by determining the degree of variability in relation to water delivery from all the off takes over a canal reach the equity indicator is defined as molden and gates 1990 5 e q 1 t t c v r q d q r where cv r q d q r is the spatial variation of the ratio q d q r along the canal reach eq values closer to zero show a greater degree of equity over the canal reach 3 4 water shortage scenarios this study focuses on assessing the capability of the proposed alternatives a1 a3 in operational performance under a wide range of hypothetical water shortage scenarios within each irrigation district for a specific irrigation district each operational alternative is able to reduce the conveyance and delivery water loss by a certain degree and accordingly tolerate an extent of water shortage without compromising the water delivery goals e g adequacy and equity therefore the objective is to determine the robustness of each alternative in dealing with different water shortage scenarios and consequently the degree of reduction in the conveyance and delivery loss which they can offer to achieve this purpose five scenarios with 5 10 15 20 and 25 water shortages were defined and the operational performance of the alternatives a1 a3 were investigated for each irrigation district individually according to the level of water shortage in these scenarios the canal inflow at the head source was reduced to create water shortage circumstances within the canals for instance under the water shortage scenario with 15 water shortages the released discharge to main canals of each irrigation district was decreased to 85 of the inflow at normal condition the operational alternatives were expected to reduce the risk of operational failures in proportion to their performance robustness therefore the ability of each alternative to optimally manipulate the gate openings providing proper hydraulic conditions and satisfactory water delivery was investigated 3 5 energy consumption and environmental indicators the potential improvement in the water conveyance and delivery efficiency is translated into groundwater conservation energy preservation and carbon emission reduction in other words the reduction in energy and carbon emissions becomes possible mainly by extracting smaller amount of groundwater energy is a valuable resource that plays an inevitable role in the modernization of irrigation projects while carbon emission is an environmental concern to determine the spatial distribution of preserved surface water recompensing the groundwater extraction the adequacy and equity indicators of each alternative was compared to the current condition to this end the area influenced by each alternative i e the region along the main canal with an improved adequacy indicator beyond 80 and 90 for every single off take located alongside the main canal was determined consequently the number of tube wells within the influenced area including semi deep and deep and the volume of groundwater which will not be extracted after implementing the proposed operational alternatives were calculated accordingly by comparing the semi deep and deep tube well numbers in the influenced areas two separate classes of tube wells were made the first class includes the tube wells that should be shut down since they are located in the area with adequacy value of more than 90 the second group consists of the tube wells where the pumping working hours can be decreased due to an increase in the adequacy indicator to values between 80 and 90 according to the results of surveys field visits and the regional water authority s database ide 2015 the majority of tube well owners used electrical power for groundwater pumping the consumption of electricity for extracting groundwater can be calculated from the energy required to lift the water karimi et al 2012 demonstrated that 2 73 kwh of energy is required to lift 1000 m3 of water by 1 m at 100 efficiency of the pump station similarly in this study the electricity consumption was calculated using the following expression karimi et al 2012 6 e c 2 73 d v o p e 1 t l 1000 where ec is the energy consumption in kwh d is the lifting height m v the volume of water m3 tl is the transmission and distribution loss and ope is the overall pumping plant efficiency the tl and ope parameters are estimated to be around 40 and 20 respectively for the electric pumps in iran karimi et al 2012 to assess the capability of the alternative operating polices in the reduction of carbon emissions the ratio of carbon footprint in groundwater irrigation activities proposed by karimi et al 2012 is employed according to this ratio generating 1 kwh electricity in iran results in the emission of 0 62 kg of co2 therefore the carbon intensity of electricity in groundwater extraction is 0 17 kgckwh 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessing the improved operational performance of the canals the models of the operational alternatives a1 a2 decentralized configurations and a3 centralized configuration were designed and coupled with the hydraulic model the operational performance of the alternatives was then evaluated by the performance indicators proposed and compared with the current condition for every irrigation district operational performance indicators of adequacy and equity were determined by assessing water delivery activities within the main canal from the first pool at the upstream location to the last pool at the downstream location the results are presented in fig 7 according to fig 7 the current operating condition of the six irrigation districts id no 1 through id no 6 shows a poor water distribution within the main canal both in terms of adequacy and equity the assessed adequacy indicator values range from 72 to 80 in id no 2 and id no 6 respectively this reveals a poor water delivery condition that requires the farmers to obtain the 20 deficit from other sources this 20 deficit is the amount of water that will most likely be extracted from groundwater wells the equity indicator varied from 19 to 35 in id no 1 and id no 6 respectively these values also indicate a poor operational status according to the classification of the indicator provided by molden et al 2007 which leads to unreasonable water distribution between the upstream and downstream off takes therefore based on the current values of the operational performance indicators there is a high potential for implementation of the automation techniques an analysis of the alternatives a1 through a3 shows improvements in both equity and adequacy indicators in fact a2 and a3 delivered water to the users without any deficiency 100 adequacy and 0 equity these results show that the current operational status of irrigation districts could be noticeably improved under normal operations by implementing these alternatives the ability of the automatic canal control system to deal with operational complexities is investigated and demonstrated for a broad range of water shortage scenarios due to water scarcity in the following sections 4 2 potential operational upgrade during water shortages the operational performance of alternatives for 5 and 10 inflow reduction scenarios are given in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 reveals that in the scenario with 5 of inflow reduction in each of the six irrigation districts all the alternatives have better indicators in comparison to the current operating conditions without shortages the alternatives a2 and a3 show the best water delivery efficiency and both of the indicators reach their optimum values for the six irrigation districts this excellent performance is achieved in water distribution even when the canal inflow is decreased by 10 the calculated adequacy and equity indicators are given in fig 9 the results in figs 8 and 8 confirm that upgrading traditional operational management of the canals with automatic control systems can result in fairer and more adequate water distribution to the farmers and is likely to reduce complaints regarding insufficient water delivery compared to the current operational conditions figs 10 and 11 show the response of the controlled irrigation canals in 15 20 and 25 water shortage scenarios application of both upstream and distant downstream decentralized pi controllers alternatives a1 and a2 in the 15 inflow reduction scenario resulted in a relatively similar performance to the current condition without inflow reduction in another words up to 15 of the inflow into each irrigation district can potentially be reduced and saved by implementing alternatives a1 and a2 without other changes in the current performance conditions this also shows that the maximum capability that the decentralized controller can tolerate is a 15 inflow reduction in the case of the centralized mpc a 15 canal inflow reduction is tolerated without any mismatch between supplied water at the canal head source and the demand throughout the main canal 100 adequacy and 0 equity indicator values the centralized mpc also handles the 20 water deficit scenario according to fig 11 maintaining an adequacy indicator of about 100 and maximum equity of 4 finally the centralized mpc delivers water to the irrigation districts with a minimum adequacy of 77 and a maximum equity of 9 for the 25 inflow reduction scenario this implies that even for such a drastic inflow reduction scenario the mpc was capable of performing slightly better than the current operation with no inflow reduction based on the centralized mpc performance it can be concluded that total operating losses within the main canals of the irrigation districts of this study are likely to be in the range of 20 to 25 as can be seen the centralized mpc reduces the operational losses by providing optimum gate adjustments and stable hydraulic conditions within every single canal pool 4 3 environmental impact of the operational improvements of the canal the assessment of the canal modernization alternatives showed that the performance of all irrigation districts could be improved even under the scenarios with up to 25 inflow reduction at the main canal which occurs in severe drought conditions accordingly every operational alternative investigated in this study provides a level of secure operational services to the farmers additionally this is also a significant outcome from an environmental point of view fair water distribution can be translated into a smaller number of active tube wells in downstream regions used as a fallback water supply source for the canal systems also the reduction in groundwater extraction means less pumping which reduces the energy consumption and carbon emission and also less cost for the farmers this section focuses on how the reduction in operational water losses can be reflected in reductions in groundwater extraction energy consumption and carbon emission the operational water losses reduction is translated into a decrease in groundwater extraction from semi deep and deep tube wells fig 12 it should be noted that this figure shows the maximum capacity of each alternative to reduce operational water losses according to the simulation results for the scenarios of 5 25 based on the results presented in fig 12 the operational performance improvement due to the implementation of alternative a3 could lead to approximately 102 85 and 205 22 mcm year reduction in groundwater extraction in semi deep and deep tube wells respectively in the districts where the application of the modern centralized control system are limited due to economic considerations decentralized control methods a1 and a2 show significant impacts more than half of the annual groundwater overdraft within the zayandeh rud river basin 88 37 mcm year in semi deep and 88 59 mcm year in deep tube wells could be compensated by using an upstream configuration using the alternative a1 according to fig 12 the patterns obtained for id no 1 no 3 no 4 and no 6 are similar for both deep and semi deep tube wells while for alternatives a1 to a3 the system becomes more efficient and more groundwater can be saved however for id no 5 the pattern indicates that alternatives a1 and a2 have a higher impact on groundwater saving within semi deep tube wells compared to a3 the evaluation of the spatial pattern of the semi deep tube wells in this irrigation district reveals that they are scattered mostly at the upstream parts of the main canal with the deep tube wells located in the tail end downstream regions of the canal regarding the centralized configuration of the mpc in a3 the controller places the same penalties on the entire water level errors regardless of their locations therefore the controller focuses on providing fair and adequate water delivery along the main canal accordingly the extraction from the deep tube wells located in the downstream regions is significantly reduced when employing a3 the energy consumption due to a reduction in groundwater extraction was also investigated the decline in the amount of energy consumption was calculated by using eq 6 for semi deep and deep tube wells fig 13 the carbon emission reduction as a direct consequence of decreased energy consumption was also computed fig 14 according to figs 13 and 14 the centralized automatic control system is more efficient in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions however outstanding results are also achieved by employing the decentralized control approach through alternatives a1 and a2 likewise the results indicate that the proposed alternatives can be applied to any irrigation district regardless of their extent i e according to figs 13 and 14 the objectives mentioned above are obtained in large irrigation districts e g id no 4 as well as in small scale ones e g id no 6 5 conclusion in the zayandeh rud river basin a constant flow is diverted from the surface water resources to meet the demands for six irrigation districts although sufficient water was allocated from surface water resources to the districts the inefficient operational performance of the existing irrigation canal networks has forced the farmers to satisfy their water demand from groundwater resources moreover drought periods and water shortages during recent years have increased the farmers tendency to set up more tube wells these conditions have led to a noticeable overdraft of the groundwater table and increased energy consumption and carbon emissions off farm activities including operational management of the irrigation canals require urgent reforms to provide reliable services to the districts and consequently to decrease the groundwater extraction by means of irrigation modernization an extensive study was carried out to investigate the application and implementation of various modernization alternatives within the above districts and the potential managerial and environmental impacts three operational options using automatic control systems were developed and assessed in this study the potential of each alternative to increase the reliability of water distribution to increase the efficiency of the water conveyance and delivery and to reduce the operational losses within canals was quantitatively assessed expected operational improvements were compared with the current operational state of the districts to this end five water shortages scenarios were defined considering 5 10 15 20 and 25 of inflow reduction in the irrigation districts next the ability of the different modernization alternatives to deliver water in a fair manner to the users based on the demand plan was investigated the results showed that 10 15 and 25 of the total inflows could be saved by implementing a1 a2 and a3 respectively the percentage of saved surface water can be used to reduce the groundwater extraction by about 120 180 and 300 mcm respectively this saving would result in a reduction of 170 280 and 450 million kwh of energy consumption respectively and a reduction of 23 000 34 500 and 57 500 t of carbon emissions per year respectively application of automatic control systems enables the authorities of the district to develop strategic plans regarding operational improvement based on the current policies followed by isfahan water regional authorities and the top priorities of the zrb watershed the potential improvement through operational modernization can be used to reduce groundwater extraction meet the environmental water rights especially for gav khuni swamp at the tail end of the river enhance the regional ecosystem and to establish a local water market within the districts to meet the increasing industrial and agricultural water demands currently the centralized mpc system can be employed for at least four districts ids no 1 no 3 no 5 and no 6 due to social considerations to ensure operational satisfaction and to reduce groundwater extraction however upgrading operational activities within the entire irrigation districts in zrb is inevitable since this measure is certainly one of the existing practical solutions to stop overdraft of the

11455,groundwater overexploitation due to unsustainable agricultural development is a widespread problem in irrigation districts relying on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources nearly 90 of global groundwater supported irrigated areas have conjunctive use of both surface and groundwater a major driver behind the use of groundwater in these regions in addition to surface water scarcity is the poor operational performance of the irrigation schemes the lack of reliability of water deliveries at farm gates forces farmers to increasingly turn to groundwater therefore they intensively extract water and continuously deteriorate groundwater aquifers this case study investigates the potential impact of improved water distribution and delivery through implementing canal automation techniques these techniques can enhance the reliability of irrigation deliveries to the endpoint resulting in reduction of groundwater extraction and associated benefits in decreasing energy consumption and co2 emissions the current study focuses on six main irrigation districts located in the zayandeh rud river basin zrb in central iran where a total area of 200 000 ha is irrigated using surface water in conjunction with groundwater to improve the performance of the irrigation networks for each of these districts three operational model alternatives including fully automated systems were considered each of these models was designed and run for each of the six districts separately the results showed a reduction of operational water losses in the range of 15 25 depending on the implemented operational model these potential water savings are then available to be used in the agricultural sector and can result in a reduction in groundwater extraction of up to 300 million cubic meters mcm the associated reduction in energy consumption and carbon emission was about 450 gwh and 57 500 t each year respectively the results of this study can be employed in designing a centralized configuration of automated systems that enable water managers to reduce pressure on groundwater resources keywords groundwater overexploitation canal operation automation reliable water delivery energy saving 1 introduction providing a reliable source of water for irrigation districts is a major concern especially in regions with frequent water shortage periods to remedy the situation a wide range of solutions have been prescribed and sometimes implemented in whole or in part the solutions offered range from short term supply oriented measures such as interbasin water transfer projects madani and mariño 2009 desalinization ghaffour et al 2013 conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources singh 2014 construction of reservoirs zhuo et al 2017 and mid term and long term demand management strategies i e converting to pressurized irrigation techniques garcía et al 2017 increasing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture taghvaeian and neale 2011 and change of cropping pattern inas et al 2017 within these solutions the simultaneous use of surface and groundwater resources also known as the conjunctive use has become the preliminary action to overcome water deficiencies and improve the environmental impacts of most irrigation districts liu et al 2013 singh 2014 nearly 90 of global groundwater supported irrigated areas have conjunctive use of surface and groundwater thenkabail et al 2009 according to a global irrigation map 41 of the total area is irrigated by conjunctive use with less than 15 surface water contribution siebert et al 2010 groundwater remains as the ultimate source of irrigation due to the unreliable performance of the surface water distribution systems in arid and semi arid areas burt 2013 singh 2014 for instance the middle east with 36 6 and southern and east asia with 37 include the highest total irrigated area as a percentage of cultivated land however the value of consumptive groundwater use for irrigation as a percentage of internally produced groundwater is 43 3 for dry regions of the middle east while the value is 12 7 for east asia indicating a significant pressure on groundwater resources for arid areas subject to over extraction and even the exploitation of fossil groundwater siebert et al 2010 substantial investments have been made in canal networks to allocate surface water through farms in the arid and semi arid regions however reliable water distribution has not been attained due to poor canal operation burt 2013 moreover traditional canal operation methods are not capable of dealing with multiple objectives these objectives include equitable water distribution between the upstream and downstream users in drought periods clemmens 2012 water storing strategies using inline or offline reservoirs during the water shortages hashemy et al 2013b and implementing local water markets to incentivise stakeholders to increase profits by saving water and performing efficient operation based on the economic value of water hashemy shahdany et al 2017 negative outcomes are resulting from poor operational management throughout the irrigation districts and this is shifting the dependency of farmers from surface water to the groundwater resources karimi et al 2012 additionally it must be noted that supply oriented measures despite being popular short term solutions are of no benefit in the longer term because there is an underlying issue of physical water scarcity rijsberman 2006 such short term solutions often only postpone the problem at the cost of increasing its magnitude later since they increase the use of water pittock et al 2009 for this reason modernization rehabilitation and renovation of irrigation districts including farm scale and off farm water management need to be focused on long term demand management to achieve this objective operational management strategies need to be upgraded from traditional unreliable methods i e manual operation by ditch riders and employing the hydro mechanical control structures to modern canal operational methods previous studies have shown that automatic operational services can provide consistent and reliable water delivery to water users from those located at the most upstream laterals to all the end users of the main canal due to increases in the reliable performance of the systems clemmens 2012 guan et al 2011 hashemy shahdany et al 2015 an intelligent operation of the canals provided by optimal control systems can significantly reduce the operational water losses within the canals and consequently lead to significant water saving canal system automation requires implementing advanced real time control algorithms to deal with the sophisticated interactions between control objectives and the water saving operational strategy in this study two configurations of decentralized pi and centralized control model predictive control mpc are designed and tested in addition the impacts of performance improvements on reducing operational water losses are thoroughly investigated application of decentralized pi control systems has been investigated in different irrigation canals burt 1999 hashemy et al 2013a van overloop et al 2005 wahlin and clemmens 2006 successful experiences with the first generation of automatic water level regulators encouraged the authorities to upgrade their operational strategies mpc camacho and bordons 2004 which has been widely applied in the studies related to canal automation maestre and negenborn 2014 van overloop et al 2010 zafra cabeza et al 2011 has shown promising performance since it combines feedback control on measured water levels at different locations along the canal with feedforward control to deal with predictable disturbances and optimal control to provide the highly intelligent operational performance of the canal network camacho and bordons 2004 this article hypothesizes that improved canal operational management through automation techniques can improve the surface water distribution system and reduce operational water losses groundwater exploitation energy consumption and co2 emissions throughout the six irrigation districts accordingly the main objectives of this article can be summarized as follows to assess the capability of canal automation techniques to distribute surface water adequately and equitably within the main canals of the study area to examine the potential reductions in groundwater exploitation energy consumption and co2 emission as a result of improving surface water distribution with the automation of irrigation canals finally the present study uses the zayandeh rud river basin a sub basin of the central plateau basin cpb in the central part of iran with six main irrigation network districts as a benchmark 2 overview of the study area 2 1 study area description zayandeh rud river basin zrb is located in the central part of iran on the east side of the zagros mountains in the esfahan province the zayanderud river is one of the major rivers in the central part of iran extending from west to east and draining into the gave khuni swamp fig 1 the zrb has a total area of 41 524 km2 and is characterized by a semi arid climate with a range of 50 1500 mm of annual precipitation 125 mm is the annual average and 1500 mm of annual evapotranspiration for this basin the primary source of water is snowmelt which peaks during spring bhadra et al 2010 an overview diagram of the zrb water budget in the 2011 2012 water year consisting of water resources and total demands according to official data records ide 2015 is presented in fig 2 irresponsible water management has led to an unsustainable condition where there is a 460 million cubic meters mcm annual overexploitation from the groundwater sources surface water sources also face a similar situation although to a lesser extent in which the annual over diversion of the surface water has led to a 16 4 mcm deficit in the water budget currently there are six irrigation districts id within the basin and basic information regarding these including infrastructure operation and groundwater extraction is given in table 1 according to table 1 the total amount of groundwater extraction throughout the 28116 number of tube wells within the six ids in the 2015 2016 water year was about 1232 mcm ide 2015 in addition fig 3 shows the growth in tube well installations in the zrb which are classified as deep deeper than 90 m semi deep 60 90 m and shallow less than 60 m fig 3 shows that the number of tube wells has increased by two to four times in all of the irrigation districts with the exception of id no 3 during the last decade all six ids in zrb receive enough surface water from the zayandeh rud river based on the available information in the local water authority s database to meet their demand during years with normal precipitation ide 2015 however due to poor irrigation efficiency between 32 1 and 42 1 abbasi et al 2017 ide 2015 farmers are forced to extract groundwater continually to meet the crop demand poor operational management and unreliable water distribution within the irrigation canal networks are sources of distrust for the farmers and even the local authorities as a consequence the districts are shifting towards groundwater oriented networks instead of improving the operational performance of conveyance and delivery systems 3 methods and materials 3 1 control systems to investigate the potential of the alternatives for dealing with operational activities a hydrodynamic model of the main canals was developed considering the geometry hydraulic features and resonance behaviour characteristics employing the identification approach explained in detail in van overloop and bombois 2012 van overloop et al 2008 two configurations of the control systems including decentralized and centralized were selected as two sets of practical alternatives to achieve the objectives of the study in this way it is possible to assess the potential for performance improvement in canal operational management to appropriate surface water resources throughout the irrigation districts in the following we deal first with the design calibration and verification of the operational models for the proposed modernization systems for each of the six ids id no 1 to id no 6 then the results are utilized to assess the water energy and carbon emission reduction potentials 3 2 canal operation alternatives to improve the performance of the irrigation networks several operational methods have been proposed and utilized malaterre et al 1998 these can be categorized into two main operational classes improved manual operation and automated operation in this study we investigate intelligent canal operational alternatives by employing automated systems an implementation of these alternatives has been prepared and is coupled with the hydrodynamic model of the irrigation canal the proposed options for operational modernization of the main irrigation canal in this study are summarized and presented in table 2 3 2 1 decentralized controller the decentralized controller configuration is one of the most practical and widely accepted alternatives in canal automation projects it is preferable over centralized controllers due to its reduced implementation requirements operational and maintenance complications and costs ooi and weyer 2008 the single input single output siso control system computes the control actions for each gate by considering only measurements taken in the vicinity van overloop et al 2005 in this study a combination of feedback and feedforward control configurations was used to provide a reasonable operational performance within the controlled canal system the former manipulates the water level at a gate location while the latter feedforward adjusts the head gate based on a known water delivery schedule based on the method proposed by van overloop et al 2005 a low pass filter is added in series with the designed proportional integral pi controllers to make a pif controller the application of this controller leads to the following flow changes through the gate van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k p e f k e f k 1 k i e f k where k is the time step δ q k is the calculated flow change through a controlled gate and k i and k p are the integral and proportional gains respectively e f i s the filtered water level error which is computed as 2 e f k f c e k 1 1 f c e k where f c is the filter constant and e is the water level deviation from the target level at the gate location according to figs 4 and 5 two functional configurations of the pif controller are employed for the alternatives a1 and a2 in a1 the upstream control configuration is utilized while the distant downstream configuration is applied in a2 implementation of the latter configuration requires a communication system connecting the downstream end of the canal sensor to the controller at the upstream side of the pool the components of the pi controller namely the proportional and integral gains in the distant downstream configuration are calculated based on the tuning method proposed by hashemy and van overloop 2013 van overloop et al 2005 gain values are assigned based on a multiple model optimization of the pi parameters the tuning procedure for the upstream control configuration is derived using an integral delay id model for each of the main canals schuurmans et al 1999 according to the second approach for pi controllers with a low pass filter the tuning rules can be derived separately for short and deep canal reaches and also for long and shallow reaches the hydraulic behaviour of the short and deep canal reaches is dominated by resonance waves schuurmans et al 1999 for this study all the canal reaches from id no 1 to no 6 are long canal reaches with a damping ratio an index that shows the presence of this behaviour in a particular reach smaller than one miltenburg 2008 accordingly the controller s gains for the upstream configuration are calculated by the proposed tuning method for long and shallow reaches the proportional and integral gain values obtained for canal reaches of id no 1 to no 6 considering the type of control configuration are listed in appendix a 3 2 2 centralized controller the centralized controller configuration takes all the variables of the system into account for assigning controlled actions state variables including water level at gate locations are measured and transmitted to a master control station through a communication system the gate adjustments are simultaneously calculated by the centralized controller at each time step and sent to the actuators the centralized control settings are used in the alternative a3 and a schematic view of this is depicted in fig 6 in particular mpc has been designed and tested for the six main canals this centralized strategy is popular due to its satisfactory operational performance and its capacity of dealing with a broad range of optimization objectives within conveyance and delivery systems and uncertainties in the inflow of the supplying canal delay times of water travel and structural and system variables constraints camacho and bordons 2004 to achieve this goal the controller employs the measured values of the state variables of the canal an internal model to predict the hydraulic behaviour of the canal and an objective function identifying the deviation of the system from the target conditions and control objectives the objective function of the mpc which penalizes the deviation of the current regime with respect to the reference during the next n h time steps is described by 3 j u x 0 k 0 n h 1 x t k q x k q l x k u t k r u k x t n h q x n h q l x n h where x k is the state of the system u k represents the controlled variable matrix q q l and r are constant weighting matrices of the proper size n h is the prediction horizon x 0 is the current state and u u 0 u 1 u n h 1 is the sequence of values of the manipulated variables the information required for constructing the internal models for the mpc including the storage area and delay time values for all canal reaches of the study areas is presented in appendix a next the impact of the proposed modern operational alternatives on improving the operational condition of the irrigation districts is assessed the alternatives a1 to a3 were investigated for a normal operating condition with no critical operational circumstances such as water deficit among the main canals or inflow fluctuations due to drought periods to this end the current operations of id no 1 to id no 6 were simulated through an open sources hydrodynamic model manz 1990 to establish the reference condition for comparison the model geometry was constructed by implementing the detailed configuration of the main conveyance and delivery system i e the geometry of canal pools water regulating structures and the off take types subsequently the model was calibrated and verified by field collected operational information the current operational status of the irrigation districts was then simulated for average annual inflow and the performance indicators were calculated to provide a reference for the comparison of the modern operational alternatives 3 3 operational performance indicators the performance indicators for this study are related to the ability of the controller to meet the primary objective which is saving water within the canal by reducing the operational water loss therefore the water conveyance and distribution adequacy ad and equity eq criteria proposed by molden and gates 1990 were employed the ad represents sufficient water delivery according to the agreement between the canal authorities and the water user associations wuas to meet the farmer s demands at the off takes along the main canal otherwise stated the adequacy indicator shows the ability of the operational method to deliver enough water to users and is defined as follows molden and gates 1990 4 a d 1 t t 1 r r p a w i t h p a q d q r i f q d q r p a 1 o t h e r w i s e where q d and q r are respectively the total and required amounts of delivered water to an off take at each time step m3 s t is simulation time ad values closer to unity show a reasonable operational performance from the adequacy perspectives the operational performance from an equity perspective is assessed by determining the degree of variability in relation to water delivery from all the off takes over a canal reach the equity indicator is defined as molden and gates 1990 5 e q 1 t t c v r q d q r where cv r q d q r is the spatial variation of the ratio q d q r along the canal reach eq values closer to zero show a greater degree of equity over the canal reach 3 4 water shortage scenarios this study focuses on assessing the capability of the proposed alternatives a1 a3 in operational performance under a wide range of hypothetical water shortage scenarios within each irrigation district for a specific irrigation district each operational alternative is able to reduce the conveyance and delivery water loss by a certain degree and accordingly tolerate an extent of water shortage without compromising the water delivery goals e g adequacy and equity therefore the objective is to determine the robustness of each alternative in dealing with different water shortage scenarios and consequently the degree of reduction in the conveyance and delivery loss which they can offer to achieve this purpose five scenarios with 5 10 15 20 and 25 water shortages were defined and the operational performance of the alternatives a1 a3 were investigated for each irrigation district individually according to the level of water shortage in these scenarios the canal inflow at the head source was reduced to create water shortage circumstances within the canals for instance under the water shortage scenario with 15 water shortages the released discharge to main canals of each irrigation district was decreased to 85 of the inflow at normal condition the operational alternatives were expected to reduce the risk of operational failures in proportion to their performance robustness therefore the ability of each alternative to optimally manipulate the gate openings providing proper hydraulic conditions and satisfactory water delivery was investigated 3 5 energy consumption and environmental indicators the potential improvement in the water conveyance and delivery efficiency is translated into groundwater conservation energy preservation and carbon emission reduction in other words the reduction in energy and carbon emissions becomes possible mainly by extracting smaller amount of groundwater energy is a valuable resource that plays an inevitable role in the modernization of irrigation projects while carbon emission is an environmental concern to determine the spatial distribution of preserved surface water recompensing the groundwater extraction the adequacy and equity indicators of each alternative was compared to the current condition to this end the area influenced by each alternative i e the region along the main canal with an improved adequacy indicator beyond 80 and 90 for every single off take located alongside the main canal was determined consequently the number of tube wells within the influenced area including semi deep and deep and the volume of groundwater which will not be extracted after implementing the proposed operational alternatives were calculated accordingly by comparing the semi deep and deep tube well numbers in the influenced areas two separate classes of tube wells were made the first class includes the tube wells that should be shut down since they are located in the area with adequacy value of more than 90 the second group consists of the tube wells where the pumping working hours can be decreased due to an increase in the adequacy indicator to values between 80 and 90 according to the results of surveys field visits and the regional water authority s database ide 2015 the majority of tube well owners used electrical power for groundwater pumping the consumption of electricity for extracting groundwater can be calculated from the energy required to lift the water karimi et al 2012 demonstrated that 2 73 kwh of energy is required to lift 1000 m3 of water by 1 m at 100 efficiency of the pump station similarly in this study the electricity consumption was calculated using the following expression karimi et al 2012 6 e c 2 73 d v o p e 1 t l 1000 where ec is the energy consumption in kwh d is the lifting height m v the volume of water m3 tl is the transmission and distribution loss and ope is the overall pumping plant efficiency the tl and ope parameters are estimated to be around 40 and 20 respectively for the electric pumps in iran karimi et al 2012 to assess the capability of the alternative operating polices in the reduction of carbon emissions the ratio of carbon footprint in groundwater irrigation activities proposed by karimi et al 2012 is employed according to this ratio generating 1 kwh electricity in iran results in the emission of 0 62 kg of co2 therefore the carbon intensity of electricity in groundwater extraction is 0 17 kgckwh 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessing the improved operational performance of the canals the models of the operational alternatives a1 a2 decentralized configurations and a3 centralized configuration were designed and coupled with the hydraulic model the operational performance of the alternatives was then evaluated by the performance indicators proposed and compared with the current condition for every irrigation district operational performance indicators of adequacy and equity were determined by assessing water delivery activities within the main canal from the first pool at the upstream location to the last pool at the downstream location the results are presented in fig 7 according to fig 7 the current operating condition of the six irrigation districts id no 1 through id no 6 shows a poor water distribution within the main canal both in terms of adequacy and equity the assessed adequacy indicator values range from 72 to 80 in id no 2 and id no 6 respectively this reveals a poor water delivery condition that requires the farmers to obtain the 20 deficit from other sources this 20 deficit is the amount of water that will most likely be extracted from groundwater wells the equity indicator varied from 19 to 35 in id no 1 and id no 6 respectively these values also indicate a poor operational status according to the classification of the indicator provided by molden et al 2007 which leads to unreasonable water distribution between the upstream and downstream off takes therefore based on the current values of the operational performance indicators there is a high potential for implementation of the automation techniques an analysis of the alternatives a1 through a3 shows improvements in both equity and adequacy indicators in fact a2 and a3 delivered water to the users without any deficiency 100 adequacy and 0 equity these results show that the current operational status of irrigation districts could be noticeably improved under normal operations by implementing these alternatives the ability of the automatic canal control system to deal with operational complexities is investigated and demonstrated for a broad range of water shortage scenarios due to water scarcity in the following sections 4 2 potential operational upgrade during water shortages the operational performance of alternatives for 5 and 10 inflow reduction scenarios are given in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 reveals that in the scenario with 5 of inflow reduction in each of the six irrigation districts all the alternatives have better indicators in comparison to the current operating conditions without shortages the alternatives a2 and a3 show the best water delivery efficiency and both of the indicators reach their optimum values for the six irrigation districts this excellent performance is achieved in water distribution even when the canal inflow is decreased by 10 the calculated adequacy and equity indicators are given in fig 9 the results in figs 8 and 8 confirm that upgrading traditional operational management of the canals with automatic control systems can result in fairer and more adequate water distribution to the farmers and is likely to reduce complaints regarding insufficient water delivery compared to the current operational conditions figs 10 and 11 show the response of the controlled irrigation canals in 15 20 and 25 water shortage scenarios application of both upstream and distant downstream decentralized pi controllers alternatives a1 and a2 in the 15 inflow reduction scenario resulted in a relatively similar performance to the current condition without inflow reduction in another words up to 15 of the inflow into each irrigation district can potentially be reduced and saved by implementing alternatives a1 and a2 without other changes in the current performance conditions this also shows that the maximum capability that the decentralized controller can tolerate is a 15 inflow reduction in the case of the centralized mpc a 15 canal inflow reduction is tolerated without any mismatch between supplied water at the canal head source and the demand throughout the main canal 100 adequacy and 0 equity indicator values the centralized mpc also handles the 20 water deficit scenario according to fig 11 maintaining an adequacy indicator of about 100 and maximum equity of 4 finally the centralized mpc delivers water to the irrigation districts with a minimum adequacy of 77 and a maximum equity of 9 for the 25 inflow reduction scenario this implies that even for such a drastic inflow reduction scenario the mpc was capable of performing slightly better than the current operation with no inflow reduction based on the centralized mpc performance it can be concluded that total operating losses within the main canals of the irrigation districts of this study are likely to be in the range of 20 to 25 as can be seen the centralized mpc reduces the operational losses by providing optimum gate adjustments and stable hydraulic conditions within every single canal pool 4 3 environmental impact of the operational improvements of the canal the assessment of the canal modernization alternatives showed that the performance of all irrigation districts could be improved even under the scenarios with up to 25 inflow reduction at the main canal which occurs in severe drought conditions accordingly every operational alternative investigated in this study provides a level of secure operational services to the farmers additionally this is also a significant outcome from an environmental point of view fair water distribution can be translated into a smaller number of active tube wells in downstream regions used as a fallback water supply source for the canal systems also the reduction in groundwater extraction means less pumping which reduces the energy consumption and carbon emission and also less cost for the farmers this section focuses on how the reduction in operational water losses can be reflected in reductions in groundwater extraction energy consumption and carbon emission the operational water losses reduction is translated into a decrease in groundwater extraction from semi deep and deep tube wells fig 12 it should be noted that this figure shows the maximum capacity of each alternative to reduce operational water losses according to the simulation results for the scenarios of 5 25 based on the results presented in fig 12 the operational performance improvement due to the implementation of alternative a3 could lead to approximately 102 85 and 205 22 mcm year reduction in groundwater extraction in semi deep and deep tube wells respectively in the districts where the application of the modern centralized control system are limited due to economic considerations decentralized control methods a1 and a2 show significant impacts more than half of the annual groundwater overdraft within the zayandeh rud river basin 88 37 mcm year in semi deep and 88 59 mcm year in deep tube wells could be compensated by using an upstream configuration using the alternative a1 according to fig 12 the patterns obtained for id no 1 no 3 no 4 and no 6 are similar for both deep and semi deep tube wells while for alternatives a1 to a3 the system becomes more efficient and more groundwater can be saved however for id no 5 the pattern indicates that alternatives a1 and a2 have a higher impact on groundwater saving within semi deep tube wells compared to a3 the evaluation of the spatial pattern of the semi deep tube wells in this irrigation district reveals that they are scattered mostly at the upstream parts of the main canal with the deep tube wells located in the tail end downstream regions of the canal regarding the centralized configuration of the mpc in a3 the controller places the same penalties on the entire water level errors regardless of their locations therefore the controller focuses on providing fair and adequate water delivery along the main canal accordingly the extraction from the deep tube wells located in the downstream regions is significantly reduced when employing a3 the energy consumption due to a reduction in groundwater extraction was also investigated the decline in the amount of energy consumption was calculated by using eq 6 for semi deep and deep tube wells fig 13 the carbon emission reduction as a direct consequence of decreased energy consumption was also computed fig 14 according to figs 13 and 14 the centralized automatic control system is more efficient in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions however outstanding results are also achieved by employing the decentralized control approach through alternatives a1 and a2 likewise the results indicate that the proposed alternatives can be applied to any irrigation district regardless of their extent i e according to figs 13 and 14 the objectives mentioned above are obtained in large irrigation districts e g id no 4 as well as in small scale ones e g id no 6 5 conclusion in the zayandeh rud river basin a constant flow is diverted from the surface water resources to meet the demands for six irrigation districts although sufficient water was allocated from surface water resources to the districts the inefficient operational performance of the existing irrigation canal networks has forced the farmers to satisfy their water demand from groundwater resources moreover drought periods and water shortages during recent years have increased the farmers tendency to set up more tube wells these conditions have led to a noticeable overdraft of the groundwater table and increased energy consumption and carbon emissions off farm activities including operational management of the irrigation canals require urgent reforms to provide reliable services to the districts and consequently to decrease the groundwater extraction by means of irrigation modernization an extensive study was carried out to investigate the application and implementation of various modernization alternatives within the above districts and the potential managerial and environmental impacts three operational options using automatic control systems were developed and assessed in this study the potential of each alternative to increase the reliability of water distribution to increase the efficiency of the water conveyance and delivery and to reduce the operational losses within canals was quantitatively assessed expected operational improvements were compared with the current operational state of the districts to this end five water shortages scenarios were defined considering 5 10 15 20 and 25 of inflow reduction in the irrigation districts next the ability of the different modernization alternatives to deliver water in a fair manner to the users based on the demand plan was investigated the results showed that 10 15 and 25 of the total inflows could be saved by implementing a1 a2 and a3 respectively the percentage of saved surface water can be used to reduce the groundwater extraction by about 120 180 and 300 mcm respectively this saving would result in a reduction of 170 280 and 450 million kwh of energy consumption respectively and a reduction of 23 000 34 500 and 57 500 t of carbon emissions per year respectively application of automatic control systems enables the authorities of the district to develop strategic plans regarding operational improvement based on the current policies followed by isfahan water regional authorities and the top priorities of the zrb watershed the potential improvement through operational modernization can be used to reduce groundwater extraction meet the environmental water rights especially for gav khuni swamp at the tail end of the river enhance the regional ecosystem and to establish a local water market within the districts to meet the increasing industrial and agricultural water demands currently the centralized mpc system can be employed for at least four districts ids no 1 no 3 no 5 and no 6 due to social considerations to ensure operational satisfaction and to reduce groundwater extraction however upgrading operational activities within the entire irrigation districts in zrb is inevitable since this measure is certainly one of the existing practical solutions to stop overdraft of the

11456,adaptaolive is a simplified physically based model that has been developed to assess the behavior of olive under future climate conditions in andalusia southern spain the integration of different approaches based on experimental data from previous studies combined with weather data from 11 climate models is aimed at overcoming the high degree of uncertainty in the simulation of the response of agricultural systems under predicted climate conditions the adaptaolive model was applied in a representative olive orchard in the baeza area one of the main producer zone in spain with the cultivar picual simulations for the end of the 21st century showed olive oil yield increases of 7 1 and 28 9 under rainfed and full irrigated conditions respectively while irrigation requirements decreased between 0 5 and 6 2 for full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation respectively these effects were caused by the positive impact of the increase in atmospheric co2 that counterbalanced the negative impacts of the reduction in rainfall the high degree of uncertainty associated with climate projections translated into a high range of yield and irrigation requirement projections confirming the need for an ensemble of climate models in climate change impact assessment the adaptaolive model also was applied for evaluating adaptation strategies related to cultivars irrigation strategies and locations the best performance was registered for cultivars with early flowering dates and regulated deficit irrigation thus in the baeza area full irrigation requirements were reduced by 12 and the yield in rainfed conditions increased by 7 compared with late flowering cultivars similarly regulated deficit irrigation requirements and yield were reduced by 46 and 18 respectively compared with full irrigation the results confirm the promise offered by these strategies as adaptation measures for managing an olive crop under semi arid conditions in a changing climate keywords irrigation requirements yield irrigation water productivity olive climate change 1 introduction olive constitutes the main economic and social crop in numerous areas of the region of andalusia southern spain currently andalusia is the main olive oil producer in the world and olive cultivation is almost the sole economic driver in many areas of this region recently there has been growing concern about the future sustainability of this agricultural system gómez limón and riesgo 2010 fernández escobar et al 2013 in this regard the installation of irrigation systems in traditional rainfed olive orchards in andalusia during the 1990s resulted in a significant increase in yields and inter annual yield stability sanchez martinez and paniza 2015 however despite the huge effort made by farmers and public institutions vast olive growing areas of andalusia still have deficient irrigation water management this together with other factors such as high energy costs result in a low profitability lanzas and moral 2008 parras 2013 which is threatening the sustainability of this agricultural system in this context the impact of climate change on olive orchards located in semi arid regions such as andalusia could generate severe economic losses and even lead to the disappearance of this crop in many areas areal and riesgo 2014 to identify adaptation strategies for olive orchards the first step is the development of a robust simulation approach for evaluating olive crop behavior under baseline and future climate conditions to date however olive modeling has been limited three clear methodologies have been used to assess crop development yield and irrigation requirements the first is based on complex physiological approaches villalobos et al 2006 morales et al 2016 the second applies a simplified focus based on crop coefficients allen et al 1998 clarke et al 1998 and the third employs statistical models such as the one described by quiroga and iglesias 2009 however despite the advanced methodologies that have been developed for the characterization and evaluation of mediterranean olive orchards santos et al 2012 numerous uncertainties undermine the quality of the simulation results regardless of the methodology applied phenology is a crucial component of any study related to olive and climate change thus ayerza and sibbett 2001 and rapoport et al 2012 considered flowering as a key phenological stage for final oil yield therefore the likely occurrence of high temperatures and or water stress due to normal or extreme events during this period would have a strong impact on irrigation scheduling and olive oil production however the existing uncertainties about the impact of climate change on olive phenology osborne et al 2000 de melo abreu et al 2004 oteros et al 2013 require the development of new phenological models able to simulate the crop s response under future climate conditions gabaldón leal et al 2017 besides phenology a key process for olive yield is water management the assessment of future irrigation requirements of olive orchards has generally involved simplified and statistical approaches rodríguez díaz et al 2007 tanasijevic et al 2014 however due to the limited available knowledge of the physiological response of the olive crop under future climate conditions these approaches fail to account for several important processes such as the impact of an increase in atmospheric co2 or the interactions between phenology and heat and water stress the above mentioned limitations make climate change impact assessments prone to a high degree of uncertainty primarily arising from the field data the crop modeling and the climate projections the quality and quantity of available field data means that there is limited existing knowledge about olive and therefore few crop models able to accurately reproduce olive development and growth the crop and climate model related uncertainty can be partially handled by ensemble modeling which has proven to be an efficient alternative ruiz ramos et al 2011 pirttioja et al 2015 ruiz ramos et al 2018 in this study the lack of simulation models for olive able to simulate future climate conditions has been tackled by integrating simplified physically based approaches based on experimental data to obtain a new simulation model named adaptaolive thus data on key components such as phenology atmospheric co2 effects on transpiration efficiency or the impact of water stress during flowering on yield have been considered in addition the adaptaolive model with an ensemble of bias corrected regional climate projections dosio et al 2012 has been applied for the first time in order to assess future olive crop response to climate change and the related uncertainty the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the impact of climate change on yield water requirements and economic components of traditional mediterranean olive orchards by means of a simulation model based on experimental data from previous studies and 2 to identify the most suitable strategies for climate change adaptation for the olive crop under semi arid conditions by analyzing a number of climate projections olive genotypes irrigation management strategies and locations within andalusia 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate andalusia displays a high variability of climate conditions ranging from rainy areas with moderate temperatures lower section of the guadalquivir valley to warm and arid areas east of the region to represent this spatial climate variability eight andalusian locations were selected fig 1 antequera baena baeza córdoba martos osuna and seville all located within the traditional andalusian olive growing area and jerez which lies outside it but is a future alternative olive cultivating area albeit probably affected by potential limitations related to fulfilling chilling requirements gabaldón leal et al 2017 baseline and future climate simulations of the andalusian climate were taken from 11 regional climate models rcms from the european project ensembles http ensembles eu metoffice com for the sres a1b scenario nakićenović et al 2000 the climate models rcm driving gcm used were dmi arpege dmi bcm ethz c4i hadcm3q16 hc hadcm3q0 knmi mpi reshaped cnrm arpege smhi bcm smhi echam5 and smhi hadcm3q3 for each one outputs of daily weather data minimum and maximum temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed grouped in three temporal periods baseline b from 1981 to 2010 near future nf from 2021 to 2050 and far future ff from 2071 to 2100 were taken for the 145 cells composing andalusia with a cell size of 625 km2 25 25 km each rcm output was corrected for temperature and precipitation by a bias correction technique dosio and paruolo 2011 consisting of the construction of a transfer function with modeled and observed daily mean minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation the observed gridded data used as a reference for the bias correction was the database spain02 herrera et al 2012 a gridded dataset developed for continental spain and the balearic islands with 2756 quality controlled stations covering the period from 1950 to 2007 with a spatial resolution of 25 km the corrected ensemble of rcm projections is hereafter referred to as ens sp ruiz ramos et al 2015 the daily reference evapotranspiration was calculated following the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 this study used mean annual atmospheric co2 concentrations based on measurements made at mauna loa observatory since 1958 on data from close to the coast of antarctica etheridge et al 1996 and future predictions from noaa raes et al 2013 2 2 crop simulation model a simulation model hereafter referred to as adaptaolive based on experimental data generated by previous studies has been developed to obtain yield irrigation requirement and economic projections for traditional olive orchards under several climate and management scenarios the core of the simulation model is olive yield assessment based on olive transpiration estimation olive transpiration t is assessed using the experimental procedure developed by orgaz et al 2006 for determining t under optimal irrigation and baseline conditions to b based on the fraction of intercepted diffuse radiation to determine t under optimal irrigation and future climate conditions to b is reduced by a term named rgc representing the reduction in canopy conductance when atmospheric co2 increases this term was estimated by field et al 1995 for tree species based on experimental data and reads as follows 1 r g c 0 0665 c o 2 22 934 where co2 is the atmospheric co2 concentration in parts per million ppm this assumption was validated by drake et al 1997 based on face experiments and by moriana et al 2002 villalobos and fereres 2004 and viola et al 2014 specifically for the olive crop transpiration efficiency te is defined as the ratio between net assimilation and transpiration and depends on the ambient ca and inner leaf ci co2 concentration and on vapor pressure deficit vpd as defined by beer et al 2009 in this study ca was determined for baseline and future periods by measurements and projections from noaa raes et al 2013 a constant value of 0 69 for ci ca was used as measured by tognetti et al 2002 similarly villalobos et al 2012 indicated an overall improvement in water use efficiency in olive trees under water deficit and several authors have reported a reduction in ci ca and thus an increase in te when water stress increased brodribb 1996 bacelar et al 2007 gómez del campo 2013 lópez bernal et al 2015 as specific functions for olive were not available a new approach was developed for the adaptaolive model thus the new function defined a reduction factor termed fci ca for modifying ci ca using a polynomial curve based on the ratio of seasonal transpiration under the analyzed and non stressed conditions rt generating an increase in te when stomatal closure caused by crop water stress occurred the proposed function was obtained from experimental data for different deficit irrigation strategies in olive described in bacelar et al 2007 with values of rt ranging from 0 3 to 1 and reads as 2 f c i c a 0 309 r t 2 0 773 r t 0 536 potential oil yield for baseline b weather conditions ymax b was calculated following the simplified equation defined by villalobos et al 2006 based on annual incoming photosynthetically active radiation par radiation use efficiency rue equal to 0 17 following villalobos et al 2006 and the fraction of par intercepted by the canopy equal to 0 45 following monteith 1965 and meek et al 1984 based on ymax b potential oil yield for any year t ymax t can be determined using a change factor calculated as 3 y max t y max b t t t b t e t t e b h i t h i b where hit and hib are the harvest index defined as the ratio between olive oil yield and the annual increase in total biomass t is the analyzed year and b the baseline period in this study the ratio hit hib was taken as equal to 1 for any year analyzed as there are no available projections of future changes in this ratio finally to calculate oil yield under water stressed scenarios yw a function proposed by mesa jurado et al 2010 based on moriana et al 2003 was taken 4 y w y max 0 9558 r t 2 1 9646 r t 0 088 where rt is the ratio of seasonal transpiration under a baseline and non stressed scenario the reduction in t caused by water stress was computed following allen et al 1998 this simulated yield could be affected in addition by many factors such as lack of chilling hours water stress during flowering and or ripening heat stress during flowering or the impact of alternate bearing unfortunately information is available for very few of these factors only the impact of water stress during flowering has been analyzed in detail moriana et al 2003 rapoport et al 2012 demonstrating that water deficit during inflorescence development reduces inflorescence and flower number and ovule development using experimental data collected by rapoport et al 2012 a linear function was developed for calculating a reduction factor fr of yw ranging from 0 to 1 to determine the olive oil yield yc when accounting for water stress during the flowering stage r0c strategy this function reads as 5 f r 1 7364 k s f l o 0 2155 f r 1 k s f l o 0 7 k s f l o 0 7 where ks flo is a coefficient describing the intensity of the water stress during the flowering stage to identify the flowering date for each location period and cultivar a phenological model developed by gabaldón leal et al 2017 was used in that study flowering failure related to insufficient chilling hours was only found for coastal areas of andalusia outside the traditional olive area with the results showing a very low percentage of occurrence and a high level of uncertainty gabaldón leal et al 2017 therefore this kind of flowering failure was not considered in this study finally irrigation water requirements were estimated by means of a water balance approach for full irrigation strategy r2 irrigation supply was managed in such a way that the soil water deficit did not exceed 75 of the water holding capacity orgaz and fereres 2004 during the whole crop cycle for the regulated deficit irrigation strategy r1 it was only during flowering and ripening stages that irrigation was applied under the same rules as for r2 once yield and irrigation requirements had been estimated net margin nm water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were calculated nm computes incomes and outcomes based on the agro economical parameterization carried out by mesa jurado et al 2010 for a typical olive orchard located in andalusia the main parameters were the olive price p and the irrigation water cost kw with values equal to 0 52 kg 1 and 0 26 m 3 respectively based on averaged data compiled by mesa jurado et al 2010 for the period 2005 2008 but valid for current conditions the ratio between oil and olive fruit yield varies with water supply and the harvesting date but in this study it was taken as constant for the whole period and equal to 0 22 mesa jurado et al 2010 water productivity wp was calculated as the ratio between oil yield and the sum of rainfall and irrigation supply and irrigation water productivity iwp was defined as the ratio between the increase in yield caused by irrigation and the irrigation supply fig 2 shows a flowchart depicting the integration of the approaches described above 2 3 agronomic scenarios the study focused on a representative olive orchard with characteristics typical of the modern orchards in the region of andalusia tree density was 250 olive trees per hectare with a 5 m canopy diameter around 50 of soil cover in a field with 10 slope soil with water holding capacity of 150 mm m 1 and a depth of 1 2 m for this representative olive orchard simulations were carried out for different irrigation strategies olive genotypes climate projections periods and locations three irrigation strategies were considered rainfed r0 regulated deficit irrigation providing irrigation only during flowering and ripening stages r1 and full irrigation avoiding water stress in any period during the crop cycle r2 five olive genotypes were evaluated arbequina picual gm22 fv18 and chiquitita arbequina and picual are traditional spanish cultivars originating from northern and southern spain respectively gm22 and fv18 are wild olive genotypes that belong to the olea europaea subsp guanchica and are indigenous to the subtropical climate of the canary islands which have annual mean temperatures of 20 c and a relatively small intra annual temperature oscillation these two wild trees were included in this study to assess the potential behavior of late flowering cultivars finally chiquitita is a new cultivar obtained by systematic breeding from progeny of the arbequina x picual cross rallo et al 2008 the evaluation of olive response under future climate conditions in terms of transpiration t transpiration efficiency te phenology water stress net margin nm water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp was based on the olive orchard described above located in the baeza area fig 1 with the olive cultivar picual weather data were sourced from the ensemble member closest to the average of the ens sp ensemble the dmi bcm outputs table 1 this agronomic scenario is hereafter referred to as dmib pic ba in addition a spatial and genotype analysis of the impact of future climate conditions on olive yield irrigation requirements and economic projections with dmi bcm climate projection was carried out in a second step the same orchard was analyzed to examine how the uncertainty from climate projections propagate through the main components of the olive crop for this task the entire ensemble of climate projections ens sp described in section 2 1 was considered 3 results 3 1 olive response to climate change the results of the adaptaolive model applied in a representative olive orchard cultivated in the baeza area with picual cultivar table 1 and under the dmib pic ba scenario indicate that olive crop transpiration t would be reduced in nf and ff periods compared with the b period with the most severe reductions under rainfed conditions decreases of around 9 and 22 for nf and ff respectively fig 3 a the opposite was found for transpiration efficiency te with increases in nf and ff periods fig 3b thus te increased by around 22 and 47 under rainfed conditions r0 for nf and ff respectively fig 3b the adaptaolive model showed that simulated crop water stress during flowering was reduced by the advance in the flowering date from doy 151 in b to doy 146 and 133 for nf and ff periods respectively regardless of the irrigation treatment and amplified by the reduction in rainfall table 1 the combination of these two factors resulted in increased water stress during flowering wsf under rainfed conditions average ks flo decreased by around 8 and 19 from b to nf and ff periods respectively fig 3c as result of these changes under rainfed conditions simulated olive oil yield yc from the dmib pic ba projection increased by around 4 in the nf period and decreased by around 1 5 in the ff period compared with b fig 4 a similar results were found for net margin nmc with increases of 6 5 for nf and decreases of around 2 for ff compared with the b period fig 4b the impact of water stress during flowering on yield yw vs yc generated reductions of 16 7 20 8 and 26 0 for b nf and ff respectively while the corresponding decreases in net margin nmw vs nmc were 22 7 27 4 and 34 2 finally wpc showed increases of around 7 and 33 for nf and ff respectively compared with the b period fig 4c similarly under irrigation mean yc increases of around 16 and 27 were found for nf and ff respectively fig 4a and mean nmc increases of 24 and 41 for nf and ff respectively fig 4b in both cases increases were higher for the r2 strategy irrigation requirements ir derived from the dmib pic ba agronomic scenario were hardly affected in the future periods considering regulated deficit irrigation ir were 216 225 and 215 mm for b nf and ff respectively and considering full irrigation the corresponding values were 402 403 and 397 mm for b nf and ff periods respectively fig 4d wpc increased in future periods with mean values of around 20 and 47 for nf and ff respectively iwpc with r1 increased for nf and ff compared with b by 19 and 50 respectively but this trend changed for r2 with the highest increases for the nf period 45 fig 4c water cost threshold for nm 0 wc nm 0 during the b period showed high values of around 1 5 and 1 0 m 3 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 4d these values increased by around 14 and 20 for nf and by around 30 and 38 for the ff period finally for oil yield price threshold for nm 0 yp nm 0 during the b period the values were low enough to ensure a positive net margin with values equal to 1 2 1 0 and 1 1 kg 1 for r0c r1 and r2 respectively and with even lower values for future periods under irrigated strategies fig 4d 3 2 inter annual variability of the impacts graphing the simulated annual yield vs the crop transpiration reveals the inter annual variability in yield and allows the identification of yield functions including the impact of water stress during flowering depending on the period and irrigation availability e g in fig 5 for the dmib pic ba climate projection yield values can be grouped depending on the period and irrigation strategy exhibiting a higher inter annual variability for nf and ff compared with the b period e g for the r0c strategy inter annual coefficients of variation cvs were equal to 52 3 71 4 and 78 3 for b nf and ff respectively figs 4a and 5 similarly inter annual variability for yield was affected by the irrigation strategy considered dramatically decreasing with the irrigation supply figs 4a and 5 thus cvs for yield during the b period were equal to 52 8 and 4 for r0c r1 and r2 strategies respectively figs 4a and 5 finally accounting for water stress during flowering increased the inter annual variability of yield with cvs equal to 32 and 52 for r0 and r0c respectively figs 4a and 5 for net margin nmc a high inter annual variability was found especially under rainfed conditions with differences between the yearly minimum and maximum nmc values of 3420 4231 and 4638 ha 1 for b nf and ff periods respectively fig 6 when irrigation was applied the differences were much lower with r2 the maximum differences between years were 1196 1191 and 1021 ha 1 for b nf and ff respectively fig 6 the analysis of the inter annual variability permitted the assessment of the probability of occurrence that the net margin was negative nmc 0 thus considering rainfed conditions and an olive oil price of 2 36 kg 1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 increases in the future from 10 in b to 23 3 and 28 6 for nf and ff respectively fig 6 under irrigation the trend is the opposite with the current water costs 0 26 m 3 and olive oil price 2 36 kg 1 no years with nmc 0 are predicted when increasing the water cost to 1 2 m 3 which is feasible when non conventional water resources such as reclaimed or desalinated water are considered the probability of occurrence of years with nmc 0 decreases in the future thus for r1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 decreased from 20 in b to 6 7 and 3 6 for nf and ff respectively and with r2 from 86 7 in b to 56 7 and 35 7 for nf and ff respectively finally with current water costs 0 26 m 3 and low oil yield prices 1 5 kg 1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 for rainfed conditions was equal to 20 33 3 and 35 7 for b nf and ff respectively however for r1 and r2 strategies the probability of occurrence of nm 0 was negligible even for low oil prices 3 3 spread of olive response to climate change to evaluate how uncertainty from the ensemble of climate projections propagates through impact projections the adaptaolive model was applied to the same olive orchard in the baeza area and all ensemble members of ens sp the average advance in flowering date was around 6 and 18 days for nf and ff periods respectively ranging from 4 to 12 days for nf and from 13 to 25 days for ff table 2 when evaluating olive oil yield under rainfed conditions average increases of 14 8 and 7 1 for nf and ff periods were found in comparison with the b period table 2 ranging from 4 0 to 50 2 for nf and from 14 1 to 44 2 for ff table 2 and fig 7 under irrigation regimes oil yield increases varied according to the analyzed period and irrigation strategy for nf 12 6 and 14 7 for r1 and r2 respectively and for ff 21 5 and 28 9 for r1 and r2 respectively the ensemble spread in oil yield decreased with the amount of water applied e g for ff the spread was 9 9 31 5 and 24 0 35 7 for r1 and r2 respectively likewise both net margin nmc and water productivity wpc increased from b to nf and ff with a substantial spread in projections mainly under rainfed conditions tables 2 and 3 the behavior described is a consequence of changes in transpiration t transpiration efficiency te and stress coefficients ks flo during flowering for nf and ff periods compared with b thus under rainfed conditions te increased around by 20 and 51 for nf and ff periods respectively with a slightly lower increase under irrigation table 4 and with a moderate spread in projections e g the spread for ff ranged from 41 to 63 for rainfed conditions table 4 there was a reduction in transpiration t for future periods especially under rainfed conditions 8 and 28 for nf and ff respectively with a large spread in projections reductions of between 6 and 39 for rainfed conditions in ff table 4 finally ks flo registered increases of 4 in nf and reductions of 7 in ff under rainfed conditions but it also showed a large spread e g ks flo values for ff ranged from increases of 12 to reductions of 19 table 4 for the baseline period b water stress during flowering under rainfed conditions generated average reductions in yield of 19 8 varying between 11 9 and 34 0 depending on the ensemble projection in net margin of 25 9 between 15 1 and 45 6 and in water productivity of 24 7 between 16 0 and 45 2 for future conditions similar average reductions e g for ff 20 1 26 0 and 26 4 for yield net margin and water productivity respectively and spread were found table 1s average irrigation requirements were slightly reduced for r1 and r2 irrigation strategies when nf and ff periods were compared with b table 3 in both cases there was significant ensemble spread e g in ff for r1 values ranged between 14 9 and 4 5 and for r2 between 10 7 and 8 5 table 3 similarly due to yield increases and irrigation decreases irrigation water productivity increased for future periods compared with b with mean increases for ff equal to 46 1 and 17 3 for r1 and r2 respectively and with a large spread in projections within the ensemble table 3 3 4 spatial variability of the impacts extending the study to the whole region of andalusia fig 1 high spatial climate variability was detected specifically considering the dmi bcm climate projection for andalusia annual rainfall ranged spatially from 105 to 924 mm and from 80 to 648 mm for b and ff periods respectively while average temperature ranged between 11 1 and 18 7 c and 14 3 and 21 7 c for b and ff periods respectively changes in temperature and precipitation for nf were between those reported for b and ff as a result of the differences in the temperature pattern the flowering date for picual cultivar in the b period ranged spatially across andalusia from 128 doy to 180 doy and from 116 doy to 156 doy for the ff period similarly simulated yc considering the scenario described in section 2 3 showed high spatial variability within andalusia ranging from 23 to 1861 kg ha 1 for b from 41 to 2163 kg ha 1 for nf and from 32 to 2163 kg ha 1 for ff fig 8 a the areas with the highest values are in the southwest and the lowest in the east of the region fig 9 when analyzing the cumulative frequency curves of yc and nmc over andalusia the highest spatial variability was found under rainfed conditions figs 1sa and 1sb for ir cumulative frequency curves showed a very similar spatial pattern for the three periods with high spatial variability but small differences between r1 and r2 fig 1sc thus ir ranged from 80 to 290 mm and from 100 to 602 mm for r1 and r2 respectively with only small variations between the baseline and future periods fig 8b the areas with the highest requirements were in the east of the region and in the guadalquivir valley while the areas with the lowest requirements were in hilly areas in the north and south figs 8b and 9 analyzing each location under irrigated conditions simulated changes in yc nmc and wpc for nf and ff compared with the b period were similar for all the locations selected table 5 however changes in ir ranged from increases of around 10 for areas such as the jerez area to limited changes for the baeza area tables 5 and 2s under rainfed conditions the yc pattern varied between locations and periods with an increase in yc in nf in all the analyzed locations table 2s but with most locations registering a decrease in ff table 5 one cause of this pattern was the difference in water stress during flowering wsf between locations thus in the baeza area wsf reduced yc compared with yw by around 17 21 and 26 for b nf and ff respectively but in other areas such as córdoba the corresponding reduction was only 3 4 and 12 table 6 nmc followed the same spatial pattern as yc e g changes in ff compared with the b period ranging from reductions of around 12 for the baena and martos areas to increases of 5 for the seville area table 5 3 5 variability among olive genotypes the simulated flowering date in the baeza area using the dmi bcm climate projection was very similar for the genotypes under study except for gm22 which showed a consistent delay of around 21 days on average across periods b nf ff compared with the rest of the genotypes table 7 due to this delayed flowering date under regulated deficit irrigation strategy r1 the gm22 genotype registered increases in ir of around 19 12 5 and 10 5 for b nf and ff respectively very limited increases in oil yield 3 8 3 6 and 1 9 and negligible changes in wpc and iwpc compared with the rest of the genotypes table 7 differences between other genotypes and gm22 in yc nmc ir wpc and iwpc were smaller for the ff period than the b period table 7 under rainfed conditions yc for gm22 in the córdoba area was 6 4 and 1 lower than the rest of the genotypes under study for b nf and ff respectively and in drier areas such as the baeza area the reduction in yield was 17 10 and 7 for b nf and ff respectively fig 10 for nmc greater reductions were detected for gm22 than the rest of the genotypes in the córdoba area nmc for gm22 was lower than for the rest of the genotypes by around 7 5 and 1 for b nf and ff respectively and in the baeza area around 25 15 and 10 as with the results under irrigation in the baeza area the differences between genotypes in yc and nmc were smaller for the ff period than the b period 4 discussion the development of a specific simulation model for olive named adaptaolive based on experimental data from previous studies and considering key physiological components enabled the evaluation of the response of olive yield irrigation water requirements and economic projections to climate change under semi arid conditions the adaptaolive model constitutes an intermediate option between simple models rodríguez díaz et al 2007 quiroga and iglesias 2009 tanasijevic et al 2014 and full biophysically based models morales et al 2016 for assessing olive response under baseline and future climate conditions avoiding the high level of detail required by some process based models which may mean their use is restricted to a local scale moriondo et al 2015 for the predicted future climate conditions in andalusia the mean olive yield will increase depending on irrigation availability for the baeza area the change in yield was positive under both rainfed and irrigation conditions the values of yield increase found are in agreement with or higher than those found in previous studies carried out by viola et al 2013 2014 under rainfed conditions and morales et al 2016 under irrigation who reported an average increase in oil yield of around 7 7 under future climate conditions thus the positive effects on olive transpiration efficiency of the crop stress lópez bernal et al 2015 and the increased atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 offset the negative impacts of climate change such as the reduction in transpiration or the increase in water stress events during flowering gabaldón leal et al 2017 according to the adaptaolive model future irrigation requirements are projected to decrease slightly under regulated deficit irrigation strategy these results differ from the increases estimated by rodríguez díaz et al 2007 tanasijevic et al 2014 and valverde et al 2015 who projected average increases of around 20 the differences detected were due to the inclusion in our model of the positive effects of the future reduction in crop transpiration which reduced the irrigation requirements the reduction of crop transpiration was due to the reduction in canopy conductance caused by the increase in atmospheric co2 a fact confirmed by numerous previous studies moriana et al 2002 villalobos and fereres 2004 this study has shown the correlation between phenology and irrigation management and damage caused by heat and water stress events thus demonstrating the need for an accurate characterization of phenology under future weather conditions flowering is confirmed as a key phenological phase for the assessment of olive yield yc net margin nmc and irrigation requirements ir delays in flowering date under rainfed conditions resulted in additional damage caused by water stress with deficit irrigation strategies such delays led to increased irrigation requirements a finding previously described by senthilkumar et al 2015 who reported reduced irrigation requirements with early flowering in maize despite its importance phenology has been evaluated in relatively few studies examining the impact of climate change on olive development and growth galán et al 2008 gabaldón leal et al 2017 our results indicate that climate change adaptation strategies for olive should be focused on promoting regulated deficit irrigation strategies selecting early flowering cultivars especially under rainfed conditions and identifying new cultivation areas considering chilling hour needs future water requirements and olive response under limited water availability by applying these adaptation strategies olive orchards under semi arid conditions will not be dramatically affected in terms of yield net income water productivity or irrigation requirements the promotion of deficit irrigation strategies even with a very limited volumes lower than 2000 m3 ha 1 is already considered an excellent adaptation strategy in a climate change scenario fereres and soriano 2007 trentacoste et al 2015 other alternatives such as rainfed or full irrigation for future periods showed non satisfactory results thus under specific circumstances such as when using reclaimed water with irrigation water cost of over 1 m 3 full irrigation is unsustainable with negative nmc for many years under scenarios of high irrigation water cost and reduced olive oil price common in many areas and years in andalusia e g in the baeza area during the 2012 and 2014 seasons irrigation water cost reached 0 48 m 3 and oil yield price was 1 6 kg 1 economic analysis confirms that full irrigation is a non optimal irrigation strategy given that regulated deficit irrigation resulted in higher irrigation water productivity in addition deficit irrigation stabilized the net income year on year compared with rainfed conditions where nmc was negative for around 36 of the years thus providing an additional advantage previous studies carried out by fereres and soriano 2007 or iniesta et al 2009 confirmed these results along with recommending regulated deficit irrigation strategies for olive farmers should receive improved training by regional and local advisory services lorite et al 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 the selection of appropriate olive cultivars as a driving factor in phenological impacts is also a key adaptation strategy although only a few studies have addressed it koubouris et al 2009 orlandi et al 2013 this study evaluated differences in irrigation requirements for regulated deficit irrigation associated with changes in flowering dates and in yield under rainfed conditions associated with water stress during flowering thus the assessment of irrigation requirements accounted for two predicted factors that were likely to have opposite effects on the crop first that eto will increase and rainfall will decrease and second that the flowering date when irrigation is more critical will occur earlier and thus closer to the period of time with lower eto and more frequent rainfall for the cultivars arbequina picual and chiquitita and the wild genotype fv18 the first of these two was the decisive factor generating a steadily increasing trend of future irrigation requirements despite the earlier flowering dates however for late flowering gm22 the decisive factor was the flowering date and its projected advance implied a reduction in irrigation requirements when simulated yield under rainfed conditions was analyzed gm22 showed the lowest values as the sensitive period flowering was delayed and so the probability of water stress damage increased compared with the rest of the genotypes similarly although gm22 registered a high yield under the regulated deficit irrigation strategy the higher probability of heat stress during flowering gabaldón leal et al 2017 and the greater irrigation requirements make it an unsuitable choice finally the genotypes under study behaved differently depending on the location meaning that the impact of climate change may be exacerbated for some combinations of cultivars and locations for example with late flowering cultivars in dry locations while cultivar selection is less important in temperate rainy locations finally the selection of appropriate new areas for olive cultivation is an additional potential adaptation strategy which involves identifying areas with an adequate combination of rainfall and moderate temperatures some andalusian areas such as the region of jerez are very promising options for olive cultivation as indicated by the highly satisfactory simulated yield even under rainfed conditions and with moderate irrigation requirements however an informed recommendation should take into account other aspects such as chilling hour requirements morales et al 2016 gabaldón leal et al 2017 determined that the jerez area would be affected by a lack of chilling hours in the future leading to flowering failure which in turn would severely impact olive yield this illustrates how any adaptation strategy should be recommended with caution and only applied after a full site specific examination of all the aspects involved in this study a detailed spatial analysis of the analyzed region revealed clear differences between areas especially under rainfed conditions this implies that spatially averaged values are not reliable impact indicators instead site specific studies are required to demarcate those areas most severely impacted by climate change however under irrigation yc and nmc showed a more homogeneous spatial distribution as both the water stress during flowering and the effect of the uncertainty associated with precipitation projections were reduced sánchez and miguez macho 2010 this was because yield variability was primarily linked to variability in water availability as previous studies have indicated giorgi et al 2004 this fact was also observed when analyzing the inter annual variability of oil yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions with less variability as the irrigation supply increased one inherent concern in the use of climate projections for the identification of climate change impacts and adaptation measures is their variability according to the climate model considered mínguez et al 2007 which represents an important source of uncertainty garrido et al 2011 in our study the consideration of an ensemble of 11 climate models allowed the assessment of uncertainty in the impact estimations carried out for future conditions showing that the degree of uncertainty was especially high under rainfed conditions in light of this fact there is a clear need to consider an ensemble of climate models when assessing future climate impacts and adaptation strategies in order to gauge both the average response and the divergences between estimates generated by different climate projections in addition the evaluation and bias correction if needed of the climate model outputs is advisable dosio et al 2012 ruiz ramos et al 2015 regarding the reliability of the crop model although this study includes several processes involved in the response of olive to climate change such as increased atmospheric co2 and the impact of water stress on yield some sources of uncertainty have not been fully addressed and thus require further study connor and fereres 2005 in addition despite numerous valuable studies on olive under current conditions fernandez et al 1997 moriana et al 2003 tognetti et al 2006 berni et al 2009 villalobos et al 2013 there is little information available on olive response under projected future climate thus processes such as the impact of heat stress during flowering changes in the duration of the flowering period soil temperature effect the reduction in radiation use efficiency with the age of the orchards morales et al 2016 or the consideration of physiological processes specific to olive cultivars adapted to extremely stressful environments orlandi et al 2013 have not been included in the approach proposed here similarly the impact of the failure to meet chilling hour requirements morales et al 2016 was omitted from the study due to the small probability of occurrence under the future climate conditions of most of the region of andalusia and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the chilling hour requirements for olive gabaldón leal et al 2017 other processes not yet fully understood relate to the impact of climate change on the harvest index hi and on ci ca the acclimatization process of olive to high atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 the functions for representing the reduction in stomatal conductance with co2 and the impact of water stress on flowering connor 2005 likewise some responses considered in this study such as the increase in te with water stress were regarded as uncertain by connor and fereres 2005 and moriana et al 2002 who detected te reductions in severely stressed olives for other crops such as wheat the uncertainties associated with crop modeling are addressed by means of crop model ensembles pirttioja et al 2015 however this is not currently a feasible solution for olive due to the very limited number of models available thus these limitations and uncertainties show the need for more olive experimentation under future climatic conditions evaluating physiological processes outside of current meteorological ranges and analyzing interactions between such processes to develop more mechanistic models able to capture the responses to multiple and interrelated environmental factors buckley and mott 2013 5 conclusions a simulation model named adaptaolive based on experimental data from previous studies has been developed for evaluating key processes such as the response of transpiration transpiration efficiency and yield to atmospheric co2 and crop water stress this mechanistic simulation has enabled an assessment of olive response to climate model predictions of changes in weather conditions and atmospheric co2 in the andalusia region during the 21st century despite the predicted reduction in rainfall and the increases in heat and water stress associated with increases in temperature olive yield and irrigation water requirements in andalusia would not be severely impacted thus the positive response of olive to the increase in atmospheric co2 offsets the negative impacts of climate change on olive as such increases in mean yield are estimated even under rainfed conditions however dry areas in the east of the region could be severely impacted by water stress during flowering causing marked reductions in potential yield to mitigate this impact adaptation measures such as regulated deficit irrigation strategies have been evaluated with the adaptaolive model results are excellent showing average increases in yield of 28 9 at the end of this century other adaptation strategies involve the selection of early flowering cultivars such as arbequina as this means a lower probability of occurrence of water stress events during critical periods such as flowering this strategy is therefore especially recommended under rainfed conditions the high degree of uncertainty affecting both impacts and adaptation has been addressed with site specific analysis and by using an ensemble of 11 climate models this uncertainty could be reduced even further by promoting the development of simulation models driven by new field experimentation and considering key processes such as the interaction between water stress and the increase in co2 on olive under future climate conditions although some such advances have been achieved in this study an intensive research effort is still

11456,adaptaolive is a simplified physically based model that has been developed to assess the behavior of olive under future climate conditions in andalusia southern spain the integration of different approaches based on experimental data from previous studies combined with weather data from 11 climate models is aimed at overcoming the high degree of uncertainty in the simulation of the response of agricultural systems under predicted climate conditions the adaptaolive model was applied in a representative olive orchard in the baeza area one of the main producer zone in spain with the cultivar picual simulations for the end of the 21st century showed olive oil yield increases of 7 1 and 28 9 under rainfed and full irrigated conditions respectively while irrigation requirements decreased between 0 5 and 6 2 for full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation respectively these effects were caused by the positive impact of the increase in atmospheric co2 that counterbalanced the negative impacts of the reduction in rainfall the high degree of uncertainty associated with climate projections translated into a high range of yield and irrigation requirement projections confirming the need for an ensemble of climate models in climate change impact assessment the adaptaolive model also was applied for evaluating adaptation strategies related to cultivars irrigation strategies and locations the best performance was registered for cultivars with early flowering dates and regulated deficit irrigation thus in the baeza area full irrigation requirements were reduced by 12 and the yield in rainfed conditions increased by 7 compared with late flowering cultivars similarly regulated deficit irrigation requirements and yield were reduced by 46 and 18 respectively compared with full irrigation the results confirm the promise offered by these strategies as adaptation measures for managing an olive crop under semi arid conditions in a changing climate keywords irrigation requirements yield irrigation water productivity olive climate change 1 introduction olive constitutes the main economic and social crop in numerous areas of the region of andalusia southern spain currently andalusia is the main olive oil producer in the world and olive cultivation is almost the sole economic driver in many areas of this region recently there has been growing concern about the future sustainability of this agricultural system gómez limón and riesgo 2010 fernández escobar et al 2013 in this regard the installation of irrigation systems in traditional rainfed olive orchards in andalusia during the 1990s resulted in a significant increase in yields and inter annual yield stability sanchez martinez and paniza 2015 however despite the huge effort made by farmers and public institutions vast olive growing areas of andalusia still have deficient irrigation water management this together with other factors such as high energy costs result in a low profitability lanzas and moral 2008 parras 2013 which is threatening the sustainability of this agricultural system in this context the impact of climate change on olive orchards located in semi arid regions such as andalusia could generate severe economic losses and even lead to the disappearance of this crop in many areas areal and riesgo 2014 to identify adaptation strategies for olive orchards the first step is the development of a robust simulation approach for evaluating olive crop behavior under baseline and future climate conditions to date however olive modeling has been limited three clear methodologies have been used to assess crop development yield and irrigation requirements the first is based on complex physiological approaches villalobos et al 2006 morales et al 2016 the second applies a simplified focus based on crop coefficients allen et al 1998 clarke et al 1998 and the third employs statistical models such as the one described by quiroga and iglesias 2009 however despite the advanced methodologies that have been developed for the characterization and evaluation of mediterranean olive orchards santos et al 2012 numerous uncertainties undermine the quality of the simulation results regardless of the methodology applied phenology is a crucial component of any study related to olive and climate change thus ayerza and sibbett 2001 and rapoport et al 2012 considered flowering as a key phenological stage for final oil yield therefore the likely occurrence of high temperatures and or water stress due to normal or extreme events during this period would have a strong impact on irrigation scheduling and olive oil production however the existing uncertainties about the impact of climate change on olive phenology osborne et al 2000 de melo abreu et al 2004 oteros et al 2013 require the development of new phenological models able to simulate the crop s response under future climate conditions gabaldón leal et al 2017 besides phenology a key process for olive yield is water management the assessment of future irrigation requirements of olive orchards has generally involved simplified and statistical approaches rodríguez díaz et al 2007 tanasijevic et al 2014 however due to the limited available knowledge of the physiological response of the olive crop under future climate conditions these approaches fail to account for several important processes such as the impact of an increase in atmospheric co2 or the interactions between phenology and heat and water stress the above mentioned limitations make climate change impact assessments prone to a high degree of uncertainty primarily arising from the field data the crop modeling and the climate projections the quality and quantity of available field data means that there is limited existing knowledge about olive and therefore few crop models able to accurately reproduce olive development and growth the crop and climate model related uncertainty can be partially handled by ensemble modeling which has proven to be an efficient alternative ruiz ramos et al 2011 pirttioja et al 2015 ruiz ramos et al 2018 in this study the lack of simulation models for olive able to simulate future climate conditions has been tackled by integrating simplified physically based approaches based on experimental data to obtain a new simulation model named adaptaolive thus data on key components such as phenology atmospheric co2 effects on transpiration efficiency or the impact of water stress during flowering on yield have been considered in addition the adaptaolive model with an ensemble of bias corrected regional climate projections dosio et al 2012 has been applied for the first time in order to assess future olive crop response to climate change and the related uncertainty the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the impact of climate change on yield water requirements and economic components of traditional mediterranean olive orchards by means of a simulation model based on experimental data from previous studies and 2 to identify the most suitable strategies for climate change adaptation for the olive crop under semi arid conditions by analyzing a number of climate projections olive genotypes irrigation management strategies and locations within andalusia 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate andalusia displays a high variability of climate conditions ranging from rainy areas with moderate temperatures lower section of the guadalquivir valley to warm and arid areas east of the region to represent this spatial climate variability eight andalusian locations were selected fig 1 antequera baena baeza córdoba martos osuna and seville all located within the traditional andalusian olive growing area and jerez which lies outside it but is a future alternative olive cultivating area albeit probably affected by potential limitations related to fulfilling chilling requirements gabaldón leal et al 2017 baseline and future climate simulations of the andalusian climate were taken from 11 regional climate models rcms from the european project ensembles http ensembles eu metoffice com for the sres a1b scenario nakićenović et al 2000 the climate models rcm driving gcm used were dmi arpege dmi bcm ethz c4i hadcm3q16 hc hadcm3q0 knmi mpi reshaped cnrm arpege smhi bcm smhi echam5 and smhi hadcm3q3 for each one outputs of daily weather data minimum and maximum temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed grouped in three temporal periods baseline b from 1981 to 2010 near future nf from 2021 to 2050 and far future ff from 2071 to 2100 were taken for the 145 cells composing andalusia with a cell size of 625 km2 25 25 km each rcm output was corrected for temperature and precipitation by a bias correction technique dosio and paruolo 2011 consisting of the construction of a transfer function with modeled and observed daily mean minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation the observed gridded data used as a reference for the bias correction was the database spain02 herrera et al 2012 a gridded dataset developed for continental spain and the balearic islands with 2756 quality controlled stations covering the period from 1950 to 2007 with a spatial resolution of 25 km the corrected ensemble of rcm projections is hereafter referred to as ens sp ruiz ramos et al 2015 the daily reference evapotranspiration was calculated following the penman monteith approach allen et al 1998 this study used mean annual atmospheric co2 concentrations based on measurements made at mauna loa observatory since 1958 on data from close to the coast of antarctica etheridge et al 1996 and future predictions from noaa raes et al 2013 2 2 crop simulation model a simulation model hereafter referred to as adaptaolive based on experimental data generated by previous studies has been developed to obtain yield irrigation requirement and economic projections for traditional olive orchards under several climate and management scenarios the core of the simulation model is olive yield assessment based on olive transpiration estimation olive transpiration t is assessed using the experimental procedure developed by orgaz et al 2006 for determining t under optimal irrigation and baseline conditions to b based on the fraction of intercepted diffuse radiation to determine t under optimal irrigation and future climate conditions to b is reduced by a term named rgc representing the reduction in canopy conductance when atmospheric co2 increases this term was estimated by field et al 1995 for tree species based on experimental data and reads as follows 1 r g c 0 0665 c o 2 22 934 where co2 is the atmospheric co2 concentration in parts per million ppm this assumption was validated by drake et al 1997 based on face experiments and by moriana et al 2002 villalobos and fereres 2004 and viola et al 2014 specifically for the olive crop transpiration efficiency te is defined as the ratio between net assimilation and transpiration and depends on the ambient ca and inner leaf ci co2 concentration and on vapor pressure deficit vpd as defined by beer et al 2009 in this study ca was determined for baseline and future periods by measurements and projections from noaa raes et al 2013 a constant value of 0 69 for ci ca was used as measured by tognetti et al 2002 similarly villalobos et al 2012 indicated an overall improvement in water use efficiency in olive trees under water deficit and several authors have reported a reduction in ci ca and thus an increase in te when water stress increased brodribb 1996 bacelar et al 2007 gómez del campo 2013 lópez bernal et al 2015 as specific functions for olive were not available a new approach was developed for the adaptaolive model thus the new function defined a reduction factor termed fci ca for modifying ci ca using a polynomial curve based on the ratio of seasonal transpiration under the analyzed and non stressed conditions rt generating an increase in te when stomatal closure caused by crop water stress occurred the proposed function was obtained from experimental data for different deficit irrigation strategies in olive described in bacelar et al 2007 with values of rt ranging from 0 3 to 1 and reads as 2 f c i c a 0 309 r t 2 0 773 r t 0 536 potential oil yield for baseline b weather conditions ymax b was calculated following the simplified equation defined by villalobos et al 2006 based on annual incoming photosynthetically active radiation par radiation use efficiency rue equal to 0 17 following villalobos et al 2006 and the fraction of par intercepted by the canopy equal to 0 45 following monteith 1965 and meek et al 1984 based on ymax b potential oil yield for any year t ymax t can be determined using a change factor calculated as 3 y max t y max b t t t b t e t t e b h i t h i b where hit and hib are the harvest index defined as the ratio between olive oil yield and the annual increase in total biomass t is the analyzed year and b the baseline period in this study the ratio hit hib was taken as equal to 1 for any year analyzed as there are no available projections of future changes in this ratio finally to calculate oil yield under water stressed scenarios yw a function proposed by mesa jurado et al 2010 based on moriana et al 2003 was taken 4 y w y max 0 9558 r t 2 1 9646 r t 0 088 where rt is the ratio of seasonal transpiration under a baseline and non stressed scenario the reduction in t caused by water stress was computed following allen et al 1998 this simulated yield could be affected in addition by many factors such as lack of chilling hours water stress during flowering and or ripening heat stress during flowering or the impact of alternate bearing unfortunately information is available for very few of these factors only the impact of water stress during flowering has been analyzed in detail moriana et al 2003 rapoport et al 2012 demonstrating that water deficit during inflorescence development reduces inflorescence and flower number and ovule development using experimental data collected by rapoport et al 2012 a linear function was developed for calculating a reduction factor fr of yw ranging from 0 to 1 to determine the olive oil yield yc when accounting for water stress during the flowering stage r0c strategy this function reads as 5 f r 1 7364 k s f l o 0 2155 f r 1 k s f l o 0 7 k s f l o 0 7 where ks flo is a coefficient describing the intensity of the water stress during the flowering stage to identify the flowering date for each location period and cultivar a phenological model developed by gabaldón leal et al 2017 was used in that study flowering failure related to insufficient chilling hours was only found for coastal areas of andalusia outside the traditional olive area with the results showing a very low percentage of occurrence and a high level of uncertainty gabaldón leal et al 2017 therefore this kind of flowering failure was not considered in this study finally irrigation water requirements were estimated by means of a water balance approach for full irrigation strategy r2 irrigation supply was managed in such a way that the soil water deficit did not exceed 75 of the water holding capacity orgaz and fereres 2004 during the whole crop cycle for the regulated deficit irrigation strategy r1 it was only during flowering and ripening stages that irrigation was applied under the same rules as for r2 once yield and irrigation requirements had been estimated net margin nm water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp were calculated nm computes incomes and outcomes based on the agro economical parameterization carried out by mesa jurado et al 2010 for a typical olive orchard located in andalusia the main parameters were the olive price p and the irrigation water cost kw with values equal to 0 52 kg 1 and 0 26 m 3 respectively based on averaged data compiled by mesa jurado et al 2010 for the period 2005 2008 but valid for current conditions the ratio between oil and olive fruit yield varies with water supply and the harvesting date but in this study it was taken as constant for the whole period and equal to 0 22 mesa jurado et al 2010 water productivity wp was calculated as the ratio between oil yield and the sum of rainfall and irrigation supply and irrigation water productivity iwp was defined as the ratio between the increase in yield caused by irrigation and the irrigation supply fig 2 shows a flowchart depicting the integration of the approaches described above 2 3 agronomic scenarios the study focused on a representative olive orchard with characteristics typical of the modern orchards in the region of andalusia tree density was 250 olive trees per hectare with a 5 m canopy diameter around 50 of soil cover in a field with 10 slope soil with water holding capacity of 150 mm m 1 and a depth of 1 2 m for this representative olive orchard simulations were carried out for different irrigation strategies olive genotypes climate projections periods and locations three irrigation strategies were considered rainfed r0 regulated deficit irrigation providing irrigation only during flowering and ripening stages r1 and full irrigation avoiding water stress in any period during the crop cycle r2 five olive genotypes were evaluated arbequina picual gm22 fv18 and chiquitita arbequina and picual are traditional spanish cultivars originating from northern and southern spain respectively gm22 and fv18 are wild olive genotypes that belong to the olea europaea subsp guanchica and are indigenous to the subtropical climate of the canary islands which have annual mean temperatures of 20 c and a relatively small intra annual temperature oscillation these two wild trees were included in this study to assess the potential behavior of late flowering cultivars finally chiquitita is a new cultivar obtained by systematic breeding from progeny of the arbequina x picual cross rallo et al 2008 the evaluation of olive response under future climate conditions in terms of transpiration t transpiration efficiency te phenology water stress net margin nm water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp was based on the olive orchard described above located in the baeza area fig 1 with the olive cultivar picual weather data were sourced from the ensemble member closest to the average of the ens sp ensemble the dmi bcm outputs table 1 this agronomic scenario is hereafter referred to as dmib pic ba in addition a spatial and genotype analysis of the impact of future climate conditions on olive yield irrigation requirements and economic projections with dmi bcm climate projection was carried out in a second step the same orchard was analyzed to examine how the uncertainty from climate projections propagate through the main components of the olive crop for this task the entire ensemble of climate projections ens sp described in section 2 1 was considered 3 results 3 1 olive response to climate change the results of the adaptaolive model applied in a representative olive orchard cultivated in the baeza area with picual cultivar table 1 and under the dmib pic ba scenario indicate that olive crop transpiration t would be reduced in nf and ff periods compared with the b period with the most severe reductions under rainfed conditions decreases of around 9 and 22 for nf and ff respectively fig 3 a the opposite was found for transpiration efficiency te with increases in nf and ff periods fig 3b thus te increased by around 22 and 47 under rainfed conditions r0 for nf and ff respectively fig 3b the adaptaolive model showed that simulated crop water stress during flowering was reduced by the advance in the flowering date from doy 151 in b to doy 146 and 133 for nf and ff periods respectively regardless of the irrigation treatment and amplified by the reduction in rainfall table 1 the combination of these two factors resulted in increased water stress during flowering wsf under rainfed conditions average ks flo decreased by around 8 and 19 from b to nf and ff periods respectively fig 3c as result of these changes under rainfed conditions simulated olive oil yield yc from the dmib pic ba projection increased by around 4 in the nf period and decreased by around 1 5 in the ff period compared with b fig 4 a similar results were found for net margin nmc with increases of 6 5 for nf and decreases of around 2 for ff compared with the b period fig 4b the impact of water stress during flowering on yield yw vs yc generated reductions of 16 7 20 8 and 26 0 for b nf and ff respectively while the corresponding decreases in net margin nmw vs nmc were 22 7 27 4 and 34 2 finally wpc showed increases of around 7 and 33 for nf and ff respectively compared with the b period fig 4c similarly under irrigation mean yc increases of around 16 and 27 were found for nf and ff respectively fig 4a and mean nmc increases of 24 and 41 for nf and ff respectively fig 4b in both cases increases were higher for the r2 strategy irrigation requirements ir derived from the dmib pic ba agronomic scenario were hardly affected in the future periods considering regulated deficit irrigation ir were 216 225 and 215 mm for b nf and ff respectively and considering full irrigation the corresponding values were 402 403 and 397 mm for b nf and ff periods respectively fig 4d wpc increased in future periods with mean values of around 20 and 47 for nf and ff respectively iwpc with r1 increased for nf and ff compared with b by 19 and 50 respectively but this trend changed for r2 with the highest increases for the nf period 45 fig 4c water cost threshold for nm 0 wc nm 0 during the b period showed high values of around 1 5 and 1 0 m 3 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 4d these values increased by around 14 and 20 for nf and by around 30 and 38 for the ff period finally for oil yield price threshold for nm 0 yp nm 0 during the b period the values were low enough to ensure a positive net margin with values equal to 1 2 1 0 and 1 1 kg 1 for r0c r1 and r2 respectively and with even lower values for future periods under irrigated strategies fig 4d 3 2 inter annual variability of the impacts graphing the simulated annual yield vs the crop transpiration reveals the inter annual variability in yield and allows the identification of yield functions including the impact of water stress during flowering depending on the period and irrigation availability e g in fig 5 for the dmib pic ba climate projection yield values can be grouped depending on the period and irrigation strategy exhibiting a higher inter annual variability for nf and ff compared with the b period e g for the r0c strategy inter annual coefficients of variation cvs were equal to 52 3 71 4 and 78 3 for b nf and ff respectively figs 4a and 5 similarly inter annual variability for yield was affected by the irrigation strategy considered dramatically decreasing with the irrigation supply figs 4a and 5 thus cvs for yield during the b period were equal to 52 8 and 4 for r0c r1 and r2 strategies respectively figs 4a and 5 finally accounting for water stress during flowering increased the inter annual variability of yield with cvs equal to 32 and 52 for r0 and r0c respectively figs 4a and 5 for net margin nmc a high inter annual variability was found especially under rainfed conditions with differences between the yearly minimum and maximum nmc values of 3420 4231 and 4638 ha 1 for b nf and ff periods respectively fig 6 when irrigation was applied the differences were much lower with r2 the maximum differences between years were 1196 1191 and 1021 ha 1 for b nf and ff respectively fig 6 the analysis of the inter annual variability permitted the assessment of the probability of occurrence that the net margin was negative nmc 0 thus considering rainfed conditions and an olive oil price of 2 36 kg 1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 increases in the future from 10 in b to 23 3 and 28 6 for nf and ff respectively fig 6 under irrigation the trend is the opposite with the current water costs 0 26 m 3 and olive oil price 2 36 kg 1 no years with nmc 0 are predicted when increasing the water cost to 1 2 m 3 which is feasible when non conventional water resources such as reclaimed or desalinated water are considered the probability of occurrence of years with nmc 0 decreases in the future thus for r1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 decreased from 20 in b to 6 7 and 3 6 for nf and ff respectively and with r2 from 86 7 in b to 56 7 and 35 7 for nf and ff respectively finally with current water costs 0 26 m 3 and low oil yield prices 1 5 kg 1 the probability of occurrence of nmc 0 for rainfed conditions was equal to 20 33 3 and 35 7 for b nf and ff respectively however for r1 and r2 strategies the probability of occurrence of nm 0 was negligible even for low oil prices 3 3 spread of olive response to climate change to evaluate how uncertainty from the ensemble of climate projections propagates through impact projections the adaptaolive model was applied to the same olive orchard in the baeza area and all ensemble members of ens sp the average advance in flowering date was around 6 and 18 days for nf and ff periods respectively ranging from 4 to 12 days for nf and from 13 to 25 days for ff table 2 when evaluating olive oil yield under rainfed conditions average increases of 14 8 and 7 1 for nf and ff periods were found in comparison with the b period table 2 ranging from 4 0 to 50 2 for nf and from 14 1 to 44 2 for ff table 2 and fig 7 under irrigation regimes oil yield increases varied according to the analyzed period and irrigation strategy for nf 12 6 and 14 7 for r1 and r2 respectively and for ff 21 5 and 28 9 for r1 and r2 respectively the ensemble spread in oil yield decreased with the amount of water applied e g for ff the spread was 9 9 31 5 and 24 0 35 7 for r1 and r2 respectively likewise both net margin nmc and water productivity wpc increased from b to nf and ff with a substantial spread in projections mainly under rainfed conditions tables 2 and 3 the behavior described is a consequence of changes in transpiration t transpiration efficiency te and stress coefficients ks flo during flowering for nf and ff periods compared with b thus under rainfed conditions te increased around by 20 and 51 for nf and ff periods respectively with a slightly lower increase under irrigation table 4 and with a moderate spread in projections e g the spread for ff ranged from 41 to 63 for rainfed conditions table 4 there was a reduction in transpiration t for future periods especially under rainfed conditions 8 and 28 for nf and ff respectively with a large spread in projections reductions of between 6 and 39 for rainfed conditions in ff table 4 finally ks flo registered increases of 4 in nf and reductions of 7 in ff under rainfed conditions but it also showed a large spread e g ks flo values for ff ranged from increases of 12 to reductions of 19 table 4 for the baseline period b water stress during flowering under rainfed conditions generated average reductions in yield of 19 8 varying between 11 9 and 34 0 depending on the ensemble projection in net margin of 25 9 between 15 1 and 45 6 and in water productivity of 24 7 between 16 0 and 45 2 for future conditions similar average reductions e g for ff 20 1 26 0 and 26 4 for yield net margin and water productivity respectively and spread were found table 1s average irrigation requirements were slightly reduced for r1 and r2 irrigation strategies when nf and ff periods were compared with b table 3 in both cases there was significant ensemble spread e g in ff for r1 values ranged between 14 9 and 4 5 and for r2 between 10 7 and 8 5 table 3 similarly due to yield increases and irrigation decreases irrigation water productivity increased for future periods compared with b with mean increases for ff equal to 46 1 and 17 3 for r1 and r2 respectively and with a large spread in projections within the ensemble table 3 3 4 spatial variability of the impacts extending the study to the whole region of andalusia fig 1 high spatial climate variability was detected specifically considering the dmi bcm climate projection for andalusia annual rainfall ranged spatially from 105 to 924 mm and from 80 to 648 mm for b and ff periods respectively while average temperature ranged between 11 1 and 18 7 c and 14 3 and 21 7 c for b and ff periods respectively changes in temperature and precipitation for nf were between those reported for b and ff as a result of the differences in the temperature pattern the flowering date for picual cultivar in the b period ranged spatially across andalusia from 128 doy to 180 doy and from 116 doy to 156 doy for the ff period similarly simulated yc considering the scenario described in section 2 3 showed high spatial variability within andalusia ranging from 23 to 1861 kg ha 1 for b from 41 to 2163 kg ha 1 for nf and from 32 to 2163 kg ha 1 for ff fig 8 a the areas with the highest values are in the southwest and the lowest in the east of the region fig 9 when analyzing the cumulative frequency curves of yc and nmc over andalusia the highest spatial variability was found under rainfed conditions figs 1sa and 1sb for ir cumulative frequency curves showed a very similar spatial pattern for the three periods with high spatial variability but small differences between r1 and r2 fig 1sc thus ir ranged from 80 to 290 mm and from 100 to 602 mm for r1 and r2 respectively with only small variations between the baseline and future periods fig 8b the areas with the highest requirements were in the east of the region and in the guadalquivir valley while the areas with the lowest requirements were in hilly areas in the north and south figs 8b and 9 analyzing each location under irrigated conditions simulated changes in yc nmc and wpc for nf and ff compared with the b period were similar for all the locations selected table 5 however changes in ir ranged from increases of around 10 for areas such as the jerez area to limited changes for the baeza area tables 5 and 2s under rainfed conditions the yc pattern varied between locations and periods with an increase in yc in nf in all the analyzed locations table 2s but with most locations registering a decrease in ff table 5 one cause of this pattern was the difference in water stress during flowering wsf between locations thus in the baeza area wsf reduced yc compared with yw by around 17 21 and 26 for b nf and ff respectively but in other areas such as córdoba the corresponding reduction was only 3 4 and 12 table 6 nmc followed the same spatial pattern as yc e g changes in ff compared with the b period ranging from reductions of around 12 for the baena and martos areas to increases of 5 for the seville area table 5 3 5 variability among olive genotypes the simulated flowering date in the baeza area using the dmi bcm climate projection was very similar for the genotypes under study except for gm22 which showed a consistent delay of around 21 days on average across periods b nf ff compared with the rest of the genotypes table 7 due to this delayed flowering date under regulated deficit irrigation strategy r1 the gm22 genotype registered increases in ir of around 19 12 5 and 10 5 for b nf and ff respectively very limited increases in oil yield 3 8 3 6 and 1 9 and negligible changes in wpc and iwpc compared with the rest of the genotypes table 7 differences between other genotypes and gm22 in yc nmc ir wpc and iwpc were smaller for the ff period than the b period table 7 under rainfed conditions yc for gm22 in the córdoba area was 6 4 and 1 lower than the rest of the genotypes under study for b nf and ff respectively and in drier areas such as the baeza area the reduction in yield was 17 10 and 7 for b nf and ff respectively fig 10 for nmc greater reductions were detected for gm22 than the rest of the genotypes in the córdoba area nmc for gm22 was lower than for the rest of the genotypes by around 7 5 and 1 for b nf and ff respectively and in the baeza area around 25 15 and 10 as with the results under irrigation in the baeza area the differences between genotypes in yc and nmc were smaller for the ff period than the b period 4 discussion the development of a specific simulation model for olive named adaptaolive based on experimental data from previous studies and considering key physiological components enabled the evaluation of the response of olive yield irrigation water requirements and economic projections to climate change under semi arid conditions the adaptaolive model constitutes an intermediate option between simple models rodríguez díaz et al 2007 quiroga and iglesias 2009 tanasijevic et al 2014 and full biophysically based models morales et al 2016 for assessing olive response under baseline and future climate conditions avoiding the high level of detail required by some process based models which may mean their use is restricted to a local scale moriondo et al 2015 for the predicted future climate conditions in andalusia the mean olive yield will increase depending on irrigation availability for the baeza area the change in yield was positive under both rainfed and irrigation conditions the values of yield increase found are in agreement with or higher than those found in previous studies carried out by viola et al 2013 2014 under rainfed conditions and morales et al 2016 under irrigation who reported an average increase in oil yield of around 7 7 under future climate conditions thus the positive effects on olive transpiration efficiency of the crop stress lópez bernal et al 2015 and the increased atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 offset the negative impacts of climate change such as the reduction in transpiration or the increase in water stress events during flowering gabaldón leal et al 2017 according to the adaptaolive model future irrigation requirements are projected to decrease slightly under regulated deficit irrigation strategy these results differ from the increases estimated by rodríguez díaz et al 2007 tanasijevic et al 2014 and valverde et al 2015 who projected average increases of around 20 the differences detected were due to the inclusion in our model of the positive effects of the future reduction in crop transpiration which reduced the irrigation requirements the reduction of crop transpiration was due to the reduction in canopy conductance caused by the increase in atmospheric co2 a fact confirmed by numerous previous studies moriana et al 2002 villalobos and fereres 2004 this study has shown the correlation between phenology and irrigation management and damage caused by heat and water stress events thus demonstrating the need for an accurate characterization of phenology under future weather conditions flowering is confirmed as a key phenological phase for the assessment of olive yield yc net margin nmc and irrigation requirements ir delays in flowering date under rainfed conditions resulted in additional damage caused by water stress with deficit irrigation strategies such delays led to increased irrigation requirements a finding previously described by senthilkumar et al 2015 who reported reduced irrigation requirements with early flowering in maize despite its importance phenology has been evaluated in relatively few studies examining the impact of climate change on olive development and growth galán et al 2008 gabaldón leal et al 2017 our results indicate that climate change adaptation strategies for olive should be focused on promoting regulated deficit irrigation strategies selecting early flowering cultivars especially under rainfed conditions and identifying new cultivation areas considering chilling hour needs future water requirements and olive response under limited water availability by applying these adaptation strategies olive orchards under semi arid conditions will not be dramatically affected in terms of yield net income water productivity or irrigation requirements the promotion of deficit irrigation strategies even with a very limited volumes lower than 2000 m3 ha 1 is already considered an excellent adaptation strategy in a climate change scenario fereres and soriano 2007 trentacoste et al 2015 other alternatives such as rainfed or full irrigation for future periods showed non satisfactory results thus under specific circumstances such as when using reclaimed water with irrigation water cost of over 1 m 3 full irrigation is unsustainable with negative nmc for many years under scenarios of high irrigation water cost and reduced olive oil price common in many areas and years in andalusia e g in the baeza area during the 2012 and 2014 seasons irrigation water cost reached 0 48 m 3 and oil yield price was 1 6 kg 1 economic analysis confirms that full irrigation is a non optimal irrigation strategy given that regulated deficit irrigation resulted in higher irrigation water productivity in addition deficit irrigation stabilized the net income year on year compared with rainfed conditions where nmc was negative for around 36 of the years thus providing an additional advantage previous studies carried out by fereres and soriano 2007 or iniesta et al 2009 confirmed these results along with recommending regulated deficit irrigation strategies for olive farmers should receive improved training by regional and local advisory services lorite et al 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 the selection of appropriate olive cultivars as a driving factor in phenological impacts is also a key adaptation strategy although only a few studies have addressed it koubouris et al 2009 orlandi et al 2013 this study evaluated differences in irrigation requirements for regulated deficit irrigation associated with changes in flowering dates and in yield under rainfed conditions associated with water stress during flowering thus the assessment of irrigation requirements accounted for two predicted factors that were likely to have opposite effects on the crop first that eto will increase and rainfall will decrease and second that the flowering date when irrigation is more critical will occur earlier and thus closer to the period of time with lower eto and more frequent rainfall for the cultivars arbequina picual and chiquitita and the wild genotype fv18 the first of these two was the decisive factor generating a steadily increasing trend of future irrigation requirements despite the earlier flowering dates however for late flowering gm22 the decisive factor was the flowering date and its projected advance implied a reduction in irrigation requirements when simulated yield under rainfed conditions was analyzed gm22 showed the lowest values as the sensitive period flowering was delayed and so the probability of water stress damage increased compared with the rest of the genotypes similarly although gm22 registered a high yield under the regulated deficit irrigation strategy the higher probability of heat stress during flowering gabaldón leal et al 2017 and the greater irrigation requirements make it an unsuitable choice finally the genotypes under study behaved differently depending on the location meaning that the impact of climate change may be exacerbated for some combinations of cultivars and locations for example with late flowering cultivars in dry locations while cultivar selection is less important in temperate rainy locations finally the selection of appropriate new areas for olive cultivation is an additional potential adaptation strategy which involves identifying areas with an adequate combination of rainfall and moderate temperatures some andalusian areas such as the region of jerez are very promising options for olive cultivation as indicated by the highly satisfactory simulated yield even under rainfed conditions and with moderate irrigation requirements however an informed recommendation should take into account other aspects such as chilling hour requirements morales et al 2016 gabaldón leal et al 2017 determined that the jerez area would be affected by a lack of chilling hours in the future leading to flowering failure which in turn would severely impact olive yield this illustrates how any adaptation strategy should be recommended with caution and only applied after a full site specific examination of all the aspects involved in this study a detailed spatial analysis of the analyzed region revealed clear differences between areas especially under rainfed conditions this implies that spatially averaged values are not reliable impact indicators instead site specific studies are required to demarcate those areas most severely impacted by climate change however under irrigation yc and nmc showed a more homogeneous spatial distribution as both the water stress during flowering and the effect of the uncertainty associated with precipitation projections were reduced sánchez and miguez macho 2010 this was because yield variability was primarily linked to variability in water availability as previous studies have indicated giorgi et al 2004 this fact was also observed when analyzing the inter annual variability of oil yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions with less variability as the irrigation supply increased one inherent concern in the use of climate projections for the identification of climate change impacts and adaptation measures is their variability according to the climate model considered mínguez et al 2007 which represents an important source of uncertainty garrido et al 2011 in our study the consideration of an ensemble of 11 climate models allowed the assessment of uncertainty in the impact estimations carried out for future conditions showing that the degree of uncertainty was especially high under rainfed conditions in light of this fact there is a clear need to consider an ensemble of climate models when assessing future climate impacts and adaptation strategies in order to gauge both the average response and the divergences between estimates generated by different climate projections in addition the evaluation and bias correction if needed of the climate model outputs is advisable dosio et al 2012 ruiz ramos et al 2015 regarding the reliability of the crop model although this study includes several processes involved in the response of olive to climate change such as increased atmospheric co2 and the impact of water stress on yield some sources of uncertainty have not been fully addressed and thus require further study connor and fereres 2005 in addition despite numerous valuable studies on olive under current conditions fernandez et al 1997 moriana et al 2003 tognetti et al 2006 berni et al 2009 villalobos et al 2013 there is little information available on olive response under projected future climate thus processes such as the impact of heat stress during flowering changes in the duration of the flowering period soil temperature effect the reduction in radiation use efficiency with the age of the orchards morales et al 2016 or the consideration of physiological processes specific to olive cultivars adapted to extremely stressful environments orlandi et al 2013 have not been included in the approach proposed here similarly the impact of the failure to meet chilling hour requirements morales et al 2016 was omitted from the study due to the small probability of occurrence under the future climate conditions of most of the region of andalusia and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the chilling hour requirements for olive gabaldón leal et al 2017 other processes not yet fully understood relate to the impact of climate change on the harvest index hi and on ci ca the acclimatization process of olive to high atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 the functions for representing the reduction in stomatal conductance with co2 and the impact of water stress on flowering connor 2005 likewise some responses considered in this study such as the increase in te with water stress were regarded as uncertain by connor and fereres 2005 and moriana et al 2002 who detected te reductions in severely stressed olives for other crops such as wheat the uncertainties associated with crop modeling are addressed by means of crop model ensembles pirttioja et al 2015 however this is not currently a feasible solution for olive due to the very limited number of models available thus these limitations and uncertainties show the need for more olive experimentation under future climatic conditions evaluating physiological processes outside of current meteorological ranges and analyzing interactions between such processes to develop more mechanistic models able to capture the responses to multiple and interrelated environmental factors buckley and mott 2013 5 conclusions a simulation model named adaptaolive based on experimental data from previous studies has been developed for evaluating key processes such as the response of transpiration transpiration efficiency and yield to atmospheric co2 and crop water stress this mechanistic simulation has enabled an assessment of olive response to climate model predictions of changes in weather conditions and atmospheric co2 in the andalusia region during the 21st century despite the predicted reduction in rainfall and the increases in heat and water stress associated with increases in temperature olive yield and irrigation water requirements in andalusia would not be severely impacted thus the positive response of olive to the increase in atmospheric co2 offsets the negative impacts of climate change on olive as such increases in mean yield are estimated even under rainfed conditions however dry areas in the east of the region could be severely impacted by water stress during flowering causing marked reductions in potential yield to mitigate this impact adaptation measures such as regulated deficit irrigation strategies have been evaluated with the adaptaolive model results are excellent showing average increases in yield of 28 9 at the end of this century other adaptation strategies involve the selection of early flowering cultivars such as arbequina as this means a lower probability of occurrence of water stress events during critical periods such as flowering this strategy is therefore especially recommended under rainfed conditions the high degree of uncertainty affecting both impacts and adaptation has been addressed with site specific analysis and by using an ensemble of 11 climate models this uncertainty could be reduced even further by promoting the development of simulation models driven by new field experimentation and considering key processes such as the interaction between water stress and the increase in co2 on olive under future climate conditions although some such advances have been achieved in this study an intensive research effort is still required especially for olive crops under semi arid conditions acknowledgements this study has been financially supported by the project rta2014 00030 00 00 funded by inia feder 2014 2020 programa

11457,increasing cropping intensification in the southern saline region of bangladesh is a national priority however increased intensification should not be at the cost of exploiting the precious groundwater resources the best strategy for increasing intensification is through using saline water for irrigation wherever and or whenever it is possible in this context a two years field study was conducted at the agricultural research station of bangladesh agricultural research institute bari in satkhira southern bangladesh during the rabi winter season of 2015 16 year i and 2016 17 year ii with a view to identify an appropriate irrigation scheduling for cultivation of maize in salt affected areas by conjunctively using the available saline and limited fresh water resources six irrigation treatments t1 two irrigation with fresh water at vegetative 45 days after sowing das and tasseling 75 das t2 three irrigation with fresh water at vegetative tasseling and grain filling 105 das t3 two irrigation at vegetative with fresh water at tasseling with saline canal water t4 three irrigation at vegetative with fresh water at tasseling and at grain filling with saline canal water t5 two irrigation with saline canal water at vegetative and tasseling and t6 three irrigation with saline canal water at vegetative tasseling and grain filling were set groundwater with salinity ranging 1 10 2 23 ds m 1 during the growing season across two years and water from nearby canal with salinity ranging 4 18 9 74 ds m 1 were used as fresh and saline water respectively results showed that irrigation with fresh ground water and saline canal water has statistically significant effect p 0 05 on yield and yield attributing parameters of maize application of three irrigation all with fresh water t2 resulted in highest grain and straw yield as well as improvement in yield attributing characters of maize followed by three irrigation first with fresh water and the next two with saline canal water t4 while the poorest performance was recorded with two t3 or three irrigation t6 all with saline water compared to t2 grain yield decreased by 1 2 31 0 across all other treatments in year i and by 7 4 30 0 across all treatments except t4 in year ii considering yield gain t4 was best followed by t1 and t3 while t6 t5 and t2 performed poorest in contrast significantly highest p 0 05 water productivity was recorded with t1 followed by t3 while the lowest with t6 results indicated that the moderately saline canal water can be a very handy source of irrigation water for winter maize when fresh water is scarce instead of reducing the number of irrigation events conjunctive use of freshwater at early sensitive stage combined with saline canal water at a later stage s can minimize yield loss of maize keywords salinity management maize irrigation scheduling conjunctive use southern bangladesh 1 introduction scarcity of quality irrigation water has now been recognized globally as the major constraint to increasing cropping intensification insufficiency of water for irrigation is restraining the development of agriculture in many parts of the world barrow 2016 elliott et al 2014 molden et al 2010 the scarcity of water for agriculture is growing not only because the sources are reducing but also the quality of water is deteriorating elliott et al 2014 parsons et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 among the threats that are deteriorating the quality of irrigation water soil salinization is the major one in many countries and the severity of such threat is higher in the low lying coastal regions connor et al 2012 daliakopoulos et al 2016 ladeiro 2012 mcfarlane et al 2016 as the sources of good quality water are decreasing in these regions the pressure on farmers to utilize moderately saline water for irrigation is also increasing gandahi et al 2017 mcfarlane et al 2016 the united nations food and agriculture organization and the united nations environment programme estimate that there are currently 4 million km2 of salinized land globally of which approximately 20 of agricultural land and 50 of cropland are affected by salinity and threatening the agricultural productivity ravindran et al 2007 rozena and flowers 2008 soil salinity caused by high concentration of salts in the soil is one of the most severe environmental factors limiting the productivity of agricultural crops in such lands among the countries affected by the worst salinity bangladesh is affected by both soil and water salinity hoque and haque 2016 parvin et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 nineteen districts in the coastal areas in southern bangladesh cover about 32 percent area of the country where more than 40 million people are seriously affected by salinity displacement solutions 2012 mondal and haque 2015 parvin et al 2017 over the last 40 years the area under salinity in the coastal bangladesh has increased by about 27 percent and prediction suggests that an additional 2 3 percent area will be affected by 2030 displacement solutions 2012 huq et al 2015 mahmuduzzaman et al 2014 due to increasing soil and water salinity farmers in these areas are suffering from lack of fresh quality water for irrigation as a result vast land areas are kept aside of agricultural production and left the small landowners poor hoque and haque 2016 huq et al 2015 despite the continual deterioration of the fresh water in the coastal areas there are ample sources of saline water which could be an alternative option for irrigation if suitable crops and appropriate soil and water management practices are followed the scarcity of freshwater in bangladesh as well as in other saline coastal areas in south asia has led the agricultural scientists to recommend the conjunctive use of freshwater and moderately saline water to irrigate crops in the salinity affected areas al khamisi et al 2013 mojid and hossain 2013 singh 2014 modern maize hybrids have been identified as high yielding crops during all seasons especially in rabi winter season across south asia timsina et al 2010 2016 maize has very high potential in both saline and non saline areas in the coastal region of southern bangladesh due to its high yielding potentiality and relatively tolerance to salinity farooq et al 2015 rahman 2012 mondal et al 2001 the effect of saline irrigation water on maize yield has been studied by a number of investigators however most of the experiments in those studies were conducted in controlled environment using synthetic saline water billah et al 2017 blanco et al 2008 leogrande et al 2016 ma et al 2008 also most of these researches studied salt sensitivity by imposing a fixed level of water salinity during entire or some parts of the growing season billah et al 2017 blanco et al 2008 feng et al 2017 despite the fact that the actual growing situations at the field level are fairly different in most of the areas in coastal bangladesh significant spatial and temporal variations in soil and water salinity exist rahman et al 2017 parvin et al 2017 therefore it is important that the research should be carried out in the truly saline affected areas to find out the ways to sensibly utilize the scarce fresh and abundant saline water by generating knowledge of how plants respond to salinity at different growth stages in this context a field experiment was conducted in two consecutive years in the coastal saline area of bangladesh with a view to identify an appropriate irrigation scheduling method for cultivation of maize by conjunctively using the limited fresh water and the abundant saline water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted during rabi winter season of 2015 16 year 1 and 2016 17 year ii at the experimental field of agricultural research station ars bangladesh agricultural research institute bari benarpota satkhira the same field was used for experiments in both years the annual average maximum temperature of the study location is 35 5 c and minimum temperature is 12 5 c where april may is the warmest period and december january is the coolest period of the year table 1 the experimental site lies in agro ecological zone 13 aez 13 that consists of tidal floodplain with extensive area affected by medium to high salinity in the southwest of the country major soil type under aez 13 is non calcareous grey floodplain soil mostly clay with medium to high organic matter content high bulk density and high field capacity 38 5 40 9 banglapedia 2014 shil et al 2016 according to fao unesco soil map of the world soil of the experimental site can be classified as humic gleysol fao 2018 table 2 provides the basic soil physical properties and table 3 soil chemical properties of the experimental site analyzed prior to establishment of the experiment 2 2 treatments and experimental design the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four 4 replications six irrigation treatments t1 two irrigation first at vegetative 45 days after sowing das and second at tasseling 75 das with fresh water t2 three irrigation first at vegetative second at tasseling and third at grain filling 105 das with fresh water t3 two irrigation first at vegetative stage with fresh water s at tasseling with canal saline water t4 three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water s at tasseling and third at grain filling with canal saline water t5 two irrigation first at vegetative and second at tasseling with canal saline water and t6 three irrigation first at vegetative second at tasseling and third at grain filling with canal saline water were set the unit plot size was 7 m 5 m the experimental blocks were separated by a distance of 2 m and the plots in each block were separated by a buffer of 1 m 2 3 application of fertilizers variety and intercultural operation fertilizers were applied in the form of urea 250 kg n ha 1 triple super phosphate tsp 55 kg p ha 1 muriate of potash mop 100 kg k ha 1 gypsum 40 kg s ha 1 borax 1 4 kg b ha 1 and zinc sulphate 4 kg zn ha 1 according to the fertilizer recommendation guide of bangladesh frg 2012 decomposed cowdung was also applied at a rate of 6 t ha 1 two thirds of the total urea along with all other fertilizers were applied at the time of final land preparation before sowing while the remaining one third of the total urea was top dressed at the time of first irrigation bari hybrid maize 9 variety was used for the study maize seeds were sown on 25 november 2015 year i and 5 december 2016 year ii keeping row to row spacing of 75 cm and plant to plant distance of 25 cm intercultural operations were done according to the guidelines for bari hybrid maize 9 and recommended doses of pesticides were sprayed timely to prevent disease and pest infestation finally maize was harvested on 15 april 2016 year i and 20 april 2017 year ii 2 4 application of irrigation two sources of water were used for irrigation i relatively fresh groundwater with salinity ranging 1 10 2 23 ds m 1 during the growing season across years ii moderately saline canal water with salinity of 4 18 9 74 ds m 1 during the season canals are connected to the tidal rivers which are further connected to the bay of bengal when highly saline water from the tidal rivers enters the canals during tides water in the canals and surrounding lowlands also become saline and the salinity of the canal water increases progressively during the rabi winter season irrigation water was applied to bring the soil moisture content in the root zone to field capacity considering the effective root zone depth irrigation water was calculated using the following equation michael 2008 d f c i m c i 100 a s d where d depth of water applied cm fc moisture content at the field capacity of soil mci moisture content of the soil at the time of irrigation as apparent specific gravity of the soil in this study we considered the average value of apparent specific gravity as as 1 42 and d effective depth of root zone cm in this study we considered the effective root zone depth of maize d as 30 cm at vegetative stage 60 cm at tasseling stage and 90 cm at grain filling stage 2 5 data collection and processing soil water content was measured at different soil depths varied from 15 to 90 cm by gravimetric method before sowing and after harvesting therefore the seasonal crop water use was estimated for each treatment by the following equation michael 2008 s w u n i r r f n m b i m e i 100 a s i d i where swu seasonal water use mm nir total irrigation water applied during the crop season mm rf seasonal rainfall mm mbi percent moisture content at the beginning of

30 30 60 and 60 90 cm di depth of the ith layer of soil within the root zone mm asi apparent specific gravity of ith layer of the soil since irrigation with plastic hose pipes was provided directly from the pump to the research plots there was practically no conveyance losses therefore we assumed irrigation efficiency of 99 also it should be noted that though soil physical and chemical properties were measured only up to 45 cm tables 2 and 3 soil moisture contents were measured up to 90 cm considering the maximum root zone depth of 90 cm soil moisture was also monitored in each plot prior to each irrigation event therefore measured soil moisture in weight basis was converted to volumetric basis by multiplying with bulk density the volumetric soil moisture content or simply soil moisture content of a soil θ is defined as the volume of water vw that can be removed from a volume of soil vs by drying the soil at 105 c ednicky and richter 1972 θ v w v s m 3 m 3 where θ is expressed as a percentage rather than a fraction i e by multiplying by 100 in the present research irrigation water was applied to the unit plots according to the calculated volumes using hose pipe regulated by a flow meter soil salinity ece was monitored at 15 days interval throughout the crop season with digital ec meter hanna hi9813 ece was estimated by multiplying the ec1 5 value by an appropriate factor related to the soil texture monteleone et al 2016 slavich and petterson 1993 while ec1 5 was determined by mixing 1 part of soil with 5 parts of distilled or deionized water and allowing the sediment to settle followed by testing of the electrical conductivity of the solution khorsandi and yazdi 2011 slavich and petterson 1993 meanwhile water salinity ecw of both sources groundwater and canal water was also measured at 15 days interval as well as before each irrigation event amount of water used in different treatments from two different sources fresh groundwater and saline canal water in both years are provided in table 4 the threshold level of soil ece for bari hybrid maize 9 used in this study is 8 ds m 1 at physiological maturity a harvest area of 1 m 1 m was selected in the middle of each plot to record data on plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length and cob diameter number of rows cob 1 number of grains cob 1 1000 grain weight biomass yield and grain yield water productivity of maize was calculated by dividing the grain yield with the estimated seasonal crop water use mojid and hossain 2013 finally analysis of variance for growth and yield parameters in both years was conducted using the randomized complete block design rcbd 1 factor with r package agricolae de mendiburu 2010 3 results 3 1 growth attributes of maize various growth parameters of maize as influenced by conjunctive use of saline and fresh water irrigation at different growth parameters plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 of maize varied significantly p 0 05 among different irrigation treatments table 5 plant height was found between 193 0 cm with two irrigation first at vegetative 45 das and second at tasseling 75 das with saline canal water t5 to 218 4 cm three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water second at tasseling and third at grain filling 105 das with saline canal water t4 in year i and between 199 5 cm t5 to 224 9 cm t4 in year ii similar significant trends p 0 05 were also observed in cob length where the highest value was found in t4 19 2 cm in year i and 20 7 cm in year ii and the lowest value was recorded in t5 18 4 cm in year i and 18 0 cm in year ii the number of irrigation application also influenced the plant height and cob length significantly p 0 05 treatments with three irrigation t2 t4 and t6 whether all applied with only fresh water or only with saline water or one with freshwater followed by two with saline water had taller plants and longer cobs compared to treatments with two irrigation t1 t3 and t5 the shortest plants and shortest cobs in t5 and t6 indicate that the first irrigation with saline canal water significantly reduced both of these attributes cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 also responded significantly p 0 05 to the number of irrigation and irrigation water salinity imposed at different growth stages in both years treatment 2 t2 resulted the highest cob diameter 4 1 cm while t5 resulted in lowest 3 9 cm in year i but in year ii the highest cob diameter 4 1 cm was found in t4 though t5 again resulted in lowest diameter 3 6 cm on the other hand the highest number of rows cob 1 15 2 and 15 1 respectively and grains cob 1 412 5 and 434 9 respectively in year i and ii were obtained in t2 similar to the other two attributes both number of rows cob 1 14 5 and 13 4 respectively and number of grains cob 1 388 4 and 413 1 respectively were lowest in t5 for both attributes second lowest values were observed in t6 in both years 3 2 grain yield and yield attributes of maize table 6 illustrates that the number of grains cob 1 varied significantly p 0 05 among different irrigation treatments in year i however in year ii the variation was statistically insignificant in year i the highest number of grains cob 1 413 was found with three irrigations t2 and t4 while the lowest number of grains cob 1 was found in t5 388 and t6 397 comparatively higher number of grains cob 1 was observed for all treatments in year ii than in year i however the trend was identical here also the number of grains cob 1 was higher in t2 and t4 435 while the lower number of grains were found in t5 413 and t6 416 on the other hand significant variation for 1000 grains weight was obtained among the treatments in year i table 6 with grains weight highest in t2 265 2 g followed by other treatments 252 2 263 4 g and lowest in t5 246 8 g the scenario was slightly different in year ii although the highest and lowest 1000 grain weight 281 2 g in t2 and 258 4 g in t5 were observed for the same treatments as in the previous year the grain weight was very close to maximum for other three treatments t1 t3 and t4 significant treatment effect p 0 05 for grain yield of maize was also recorded in both years the treatment with three freshwater irrigation had highest grain yield 8 73 t ha 1 in year i in contrast another three irrigation treatment t4 with conjunctive use of fresh and saline water resulted in highest grain yield 9 55 t ha 1 in year ii nonetheless these two treatments were top two performers in both years even so the lowest grain yield was recorded for t5 6 0 and 6 66 t ha 1 in year i and ii respectively which is a treatment with two saline water irrigation only another treatment with three irrigation with saline water t6 had the second lowest grain yield in both years 6 24 and 6 92 t ha 1 respectively in year i compared to control t2 grain yield was reduced by around 31 in t5 28 in t6 7 2 in t3 6 66 in t1 and only 1 15 in t4 on the other hand in year ii compared to t2 grain yield was reduced by around 30 27 9 21 and 7 42 in t5 t6 t1 and t3 respectively and increased slightly by 0 7 in t4 in both years the straw yield was highest for t4 12 95 and 12 33 t ha 1 respectively and lowest for t5 10 17 and 9 84 t ha 1 in consistent with the trend observed for the previous attributes the second highest straw yield was obtained from t2 12 73 and 12 24 t ha 1 respectively whereas the second lowest straw yield was from t6 10 38 and 10 01 t ha 1 respectively 3 3 water requirement and water productivity of maize the total seasonal water used and irrigation water productivity for maize under different irrigation treatments are presented in table 7 results showed that the total water used by the crop varied among different treatments where the number of irrigation played the driving role as the number of irrigation increased total water use also increased however soil moisture contribution was higher in treatments with less two irrigation significantly highest p 0 05 irrigation water productivity 3 01 kg m 3 in year i and 2 88 kg m 3 in year ii was obtained from treatment t1 with two irrigation applied with fresh water in both years the second highest water productivity was found with t3 with first irrigation applied with fresh water and second with saline water on the other hand the lowest water productivity 1 81 kg m 3 in year i and 1 82 kg m 3 in year ii was attained from treatment t6 as it received all three irrigation from canal saline water and resulted in lowest yield table 7 3 4 salinity status in experimental soil fig 1 illustrates the trend of soil salinity development at different crop growth stages of maize during the study period of year i at the beginning of the season soil salinity at all the treatments were identical around 3 2 ds m 1 as the crop growing season continued soil salinity increased gradually at 15 days after sowing das and 30 das soil salinities were also found similar in all six treatments however at 45 das salinity of soil increased slightly in t5 and t6 because both of them received comparatively saline canal water as first irrigation where the others were irrigated with groundwater this trend continued up to 90 das where soil salinities in all treatments were found closer again ranges around 7 7 7 9 ds m 1 due to few rainfall events however significant variations in soil salinity were observed after the application of third irrigation at 120 das t6 had significantly highest salinity of 9 95 ds m 1 while t2 had significantly lowest salinity of 9 25 ds m 1 maximum values of soil salinity were recorded against all the treatment at harvesting ranges between 10 16 10 64 ds m 1 similar trend of soil salinity development was also observed in year ii fig 2 here sowing time soil salinities in all the treatments were also lower 3 2 3 4 ds m 1 at 15 das and 30 das soil salinity increased slowly and all the treatments had similar salinity immediately after first irrigation soil salinity in t5 and t6 jumped higher than in the other treatments soil salinity in t5 and t6 was also found higher than in the rest at 60 das and 75 das after second irrigation there were four rainfall events that minimized the effect of saline water irrigation on soil salinity therefore at 90 das and 105 das soil salinities of all five treatments were found closer however salinity level of soil continued to increase as the time increased but after third irrigation soil salinities in five irrigation treatments were found different again while the salinity in t4 and t6 was recorded as high as 9 69 ds m 1 and 9 65 ds m 1 respectively it was only 8 86 in t2 at harvest salinity was also found significantly higher in t2 10 82 ds m 1 and t4 10 87 ds m 1 where salinity of t1 t2 t3 and t5 were 10 27 ds m 1 10 17 ds m 1 10 21 ds m 1 10 33 ds m 1 respectively 3 5 salinity levels in irrigation water the salinity status of the groundwater and nearest canal water was measured at sowing before each irrigation event and at harvesting in year i during the sowing time the salinity of groundwater was around 1 1 ds m 1 while that of the canal water was around 4 18 ds m 1 fig 3 from sowing to harvesting the salinity of groundwater rose steadily and with a very slow rate on the other hand over the same period salinity of canal water increased with a significant rate during first irrigation the salinity of groundwater and canal water were 1 47 ds m 1 and 5 95 ds m 1 respectively second irrigation was applied with groundwater with salinity of 1 76 ds m 1 and canal water with 7 89 ds m 1 while the third irrigation was applied with groundwater with salinity of 2 08 ds m 1 and canal water with 9 13 ds m 1 both the groundwater and canal water had highest salinity levels during the time of harvesting similar trends of groundwater and canal water salinity were also observed in year ii fig 4 here the salinity of groundwater during sowing first second and third irrigation and during harvesting were 1 18 1 54 1 88 2 15 and 2 33 ds m 1 respectively on the other hand the corresponding values of canal water salinities were 4 25 6 23 8 14 9 2 and 9 74 ds m 1 respectively 4 discussion among the most affected countries by salinity bangladesh is one which is affected by high levels of both soil and water salinity rahman et al 2017 due to increase in both soil and water salinity more than 40 million people in nineteen districts in the southern coastal region of bangladesh 32 percent area of the country are seriously affected by salinity mondal and haque 2015 parvin et al 2017 and prediction suggests that an additional 2 3 percent area will be affected by 2030 huq et al 2015 mahmuduzzaman et al 2014 farmers in these areas have been constantly suffering from lack of fresh quality water for irrigation as a result vast land areas are kept aside of agricultural production and left the small landowners poor hoque and haque 2016 huq et al 2015 modern maize hybrids have been identified as high yielding crops during all seasons especially in rabi winter season across south asia timsina et al 2010 2016 maize has very high potential in both saline and non saline areas in the coastal region of southern bangladesh due to its potential for high yield and its relative tolerance to salinity farooq et al 2015 rahman 2012 mondal et al 2001 it is considered as a moderately salinity tolerant crop katerji et al 2000 mojid et al 2014b as compared to other cereals however excessive salinity hinders propagation leaf cell expansion and leaf development dry mater accretion rate of net co2 absorption and overall physiological growth katerji et al 2000 letey et al 2011 munns and tester 2008 in the current study it was observed that the soil salinity levels in both years increased gradually over the maize growing period and peaked at the harvesting time just after each irrigation event soil salinity was found higher in treatments that were applied with saline water while the treatments with freshwater irrigation showed less salinity figs 1 and 2 however rainfall events sometimes minimized the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity development soils of saline areas in southern bangladesh are inheritably developed by saline parent materials and by deposition of salt ions year by year generally soil salinity increases gradually during dry period from november to may despite of the source of irrigation water whether fresh or saline or even under fallow condition salinity would have been reduced if there was flush irrigation with freshwater allowing leaching but our treatments considered only 2 3 irrigation that was up to field capacity so there was slight salinity build up of groundwater also the results of the current study showed that both the irrigation water salinity and the number of irrigation had significant influence over the growth yield and yield attributes of maize in both years when same number of irrigation was provided maize yields were generally higher when comparatively fresh groundwater was used compared to only saline canal water however the difference was insignificant when the crop was irrigated with the conjunctive use of fresh groundwater and saline canal water when freshwater sources are limited the number of irrigation can be increased by intelligently utilizing the available moderately saline water if the crop is somehow established with an early fresh water irrigation it can then be irrigated with available saline water sources without compromising the crop yield figs 3 and 4 the results of this study also demonstrated that different growth parameters plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 of maize vary significantly for different irrigation treatments these results also indicate that application of first irrigation with fresh water at vegetative stage is more effective than application of fresh water at reproductive stage table 5 the significantly lower values of all the growth attributes of maize obtained in t5 and t6 suggest that comparatively saline water for irrigation from the nearby canal at the earliest stage vegetative 45 das asserted physiological stress and affected plants to maintain its natural growth although t2 t4 and t6 received the same three numbers of irrigation all growth attributes were significantly higher in t2 and t4 on the other hand comparative values of growth attributes in t2 and t4 imply that when the plant survived its early stage it endures salinity stress up to certain limit and thus maintains normal physiological vigor therefore when fresh water is limited the irrigator can explore nearby moderately saline water sources to apply additional irrigation at a later stage rather than skipping irrigation events the results of the present study agree with mojid et al 2014a who stated that the sensitivity of any crop to salinity often changes from one stage of growth to the other as most of the crops are extremely sensitive to irrigation water salinity in early stage flowers 2004 mojid et al 2014a saline water can be used to irrigate at other stages where plants have better resistance ability mojid and hossain 2013 munns and tester 2008 gandahi et al 2017 found the highest fresh biomass plant height number of leaves plant 1 number of bolls and boll weight in the treatments where tap water was used on the other hand these parameters decreased significantly with the increasing salinity levels from 4 to 12 ds m 1 and when saline water was applied continuously throughout the growing period among the field crops maize is grown under a wide spectrum of soil and climatic conditions and is moderately sensitive to salt stress tanji and kielen 2003 the threshold and slope concepts have their greatest values in providing general salt tolerance guidelines for crop management decisions and generally threshold levels of salinity varies from plant to plant as well as from cultivar to cultivar bernstein and ayers 1949 kaddah and ghowail 1964 these authors also suggested that farmers need to know the soil salinity levels that begin to reduce yield and rate of yield reduction at levels above the threshold in the present study the lowest values of yield attributes were recorded for treatment with two irrigation with saline canal water t5 first at vegetative 40 das and second at tasseling 75 das followed by three irrigation with saline canal water t6 first at vegetative 45 das second at tasseling 75 das and third at grain filling 105 das tables 5 and 6 these results indicate that sensitivity of salinity in reproductive stage reduced the yield attributes which ultimately reduced the final grain weight of maize previous studies have also concluded that saline water could be used for irrigation with minimal adverse effects on crop and soil if management is done intelligently al khamisi et al 2013 mojid and hossain 2013 singh 2014 the presence of excessive salt in the plant root zone affects the natural physio morphological characters of most crops at all growth stages de oliveira et al 2013 pessarakli 2016 however the level of resistance of plant to salinity depends on the type frequency and timing of irrigation li et al 2015 mojid and hossain 2013 soil salinity level increases in between two irrigation events as the soil water content decreases mojid and hossain 2013 mojid et al 2014a consequently plants suffer most in this period and experience osmotic as well as matric stresses mojid et al 2014b the fundamental of sustainable irrigation using saline water is that the salt concentration in the root zone soil must be maintained below a threshold level specific for each crop species maas and hoffman 1977 letey et al 2011 munns and tester 2008 the results of this study also showed that the maximum water productivity was obtained when two irrigation was applied through fresh ground water t1 followed by two irrigation first with fresh and second with saline water t3 and the lowest water productivity was recorded with t6 where all three irrigations were applied with saline canal water table 7 the higher water productivity from t1 and t3 suggests that when water is precious and saving water is a priority two irrigations with fresh water at vegetative 45 das and at tasseling 75 das stage or with conjunctive use of fresh and saline water is profitable with marginal effect on yield although treatment t3 and t5 both received two irrigation single irrigation with fresh groundwater in vegetative stage t3 significantly improved the water productivity table 7 these results agree with xue and ren 2017 who also found that with conjunctive use of saline and non saline irrigation water the average yields of spring wheat spring maize and sunflower were increased or decreased by 0 2 5 3 and 8 2 and the water productivities were increased or decreased by 5 5 2 6 and 7 6 respectively as compared with non saline irrigation water our results also agree with minhas and gupta 1993 and minhas 1996 who reported that conjunctive use of saline and fresh water increases the productivity of maize under the salinity condition thus the results of the current study conducted in the actual saline environment and growing conditions suggest that the moderately saline canal water can be a very handy source of irrigation water for winter maize in saline coastal areas of southern bangladesh and similar saline coastal areas in south asia where fresh water for irrigation is scarce we suggest that instead of reducing the number of irrigation events conjunctive use of freshwater at early sensitive stage combined with saline canal water at a later stage can minimize the yield loss and increase water productivity of maize 5 conclusions based on the results of the two years of study we conclude that irrigating maize with fresh or saline water has significant effect on its yield and yield attributing parameters three irrigation either all with fresh water or first with fresh and the next two with saline water can result in highest yield due to the greatest improvement of yield attributes followed by two irrigation either both with fresh water or first irrigation with fresh water and the second with saline water compared to three irrigations with fresh water grain yield can decrease by 1 2 31 0 across all other treatments with either conjunctive use of fresh and saline water or irrigation by saline water only results also suggest that the conjunctive use of relatively fresh groundwater and moderate saline canal water can benefit maize with marginal effect on yield an early irrigation with freshwater followed by two irrigations with saline water can improve maize yield significantly rather than using saline water in all stages considering yield gain compared to three irrigation all with fresh water three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water and second at tasseling and third at grain filling each with saline canal water is best followed by other irrigation treatments on contrary significantly highest p 0 05 water productivity can be obtained with two irrigations with fresh water lowest with three irrigations all with saline water finally it can be concluded that location specific appropriate irrigation scheduling methods and criteria need to be developed for the saline affected zones for popular crops to minimize yield reductions and to optimize sustainable use of limited fresh groundwater and abundant saline water conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest financial support

11457,increasing cropping intensification in the southern saline region of bangladesh is a national priority however increased intensification should not be at the cost of exploiting the precious groundwater resources the best strategy for increasing intensification is through using saline water for irrigation wherever and or whenever it is possible in this context a two years field study was conducted at the agricultural research station of bangladesh agricultural research institute bari in satkhira southern bangladesh during the rabi winter season of 2015 16 year i and 2016 17 year ii with a view to identify an appropriate irrigation scheduling for cultivation of maize in salt affected areas by conjunctively using the available saline and limited fresh water resources six irrigation treatments t1 two irrigation with fresh water at vegetative 45 days after sowing das and tasseling 75 das t2 three irrigation with fresh water at vegetative tasseling and grain filling 105

t5 two irrigation with saline canal water at vegetative and tasseling and t6 three irrigation with saline canal water at vegetative tasseling and grain filling were set groundwater with salinity ranging 1 10 2 23 ds m 1 during the growing season across two years and water from nearby canal with salinity ranging 4 18 9 74 ds m 1 were used as fresh and saline water respectively results showed that irrigation with fresh ground water and saline canal water has statistically significant effect p 0 05 on yield and yield attributing parameters of maize application of three irrigation all with fresh water t2 resulted in highest grain and straw yield as well as improvement in yield attributing characters of maize followed by three irrigation first with fresh water and the next two with saline canal water t4 while the poorest performance was recorded with two t3 or three irrigation t6 all with saline water compared to t2 grain yield decreased by 1 2 31 0 across all other treatments in year i and by 7 4 30 0 across all treatments except t4 in year ii considering yield gain t4 was best followed by t1 and t3 while t6 t5 and t2 performed poorest in contrast significantly highest p 0 05 water productivity was recorded with t1 followed by t3 while the lowest with t6 results indicated that the moderately saline canal water can be a very handy source of irrigation water for winter maize when fresh water is scarce instead of reducing the number of irrigation events conjunctive use of freshwater at early sensitive stage combined with saline canal water at a later stage s can minimize yield loss of maize keywords salinity management maize irrigation scheduling conjunctive use southern bangladesh 1 introduction scarcity of quality irrigation water has now been recognized globally as the major constraint to increasing cropping intensification insufficiency of water for irrigation is restraining the development of agriculture in many parts of the world barrow 2016 elliott et al 2014 molden et al 2010 the scarcity of water for agriculture is growing not only because the sources are reducing but also the quality of water is deteriorating elliott et al 2014 parsons et al 2010 qadir et al 2010 among the threats that are deteriorating the quality of irrigation water soil salinization is the major one in many countries and the severity of such threat is higher in the low lying coastal regions connor et al 2012 daliakopoulos et al 2016 ladeiro 2012 mcfarlane et al 2016 as the sources of good quality water are decreasing in these regions the pressure on farmers to utilize moderately saline water for irrigation is also increasing gandahi et al 2017 mcfarlane et al 2016 the united nations food and agriculture organization and the united nations environment programme estimate that there are currently 4 million km2 of salinized land globally of which approximately 20 of agricultural land and 50 of cropland are affected by salinity and threatening the agricultural productivity ravindran et al 2007 rozena and flowers 2008 soil salinity caused by high concentration of salts in the soil is one of the most severe environmental factors limiting the productivity of agricultural crops in such lands among the countries affected by the worst salinity bangladesh is affected by both soil and water salinity hoque and haque 2016 parvin et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 nineteen districts in the coastal areas in southern bangladesh cover about 32 percent area of the country where more than 40 million people are seriously affected by salinity displacement solutions 2012 mondal and haque 2015 parvin et al 2017 over the last 40 years the area under salinity in the coastal bangladesh has increased by about 27 percent and prediction suggests that an additional 2 3 percent area will be affected by 2030 displacement solutions 2012 huq et al 2015 mahmuduzzaman et al 2014 due to increasing soil and water salinity farmers in these areas are suffering from lack of fresh quality water for irrigation as a result vast land areas are kept aside of agricultural production and left the small landowners poor hoque and haque 2016 huq et al 2015 despite the continual deterioration of the fresh water in the coastal areas there are ample sources of saline water which could be an alternative option for irrigation if suitable crops and appropriate soil and water management practices are followed the scarcity of freshwater in bangladesh as well as in other saline coastal areas in south asia has led the agricultural scientists to recommend the conjunctive use of freshwater and moderately saline water to irrigate crops in the salinity affected areas al khamisi et al 2013 mojid and hossain 2013 singh 2014 modern maize hybrids have been identified as high yielding crops during all seasons especially in rabi winter season across south asia timsina et al 2010 2016 maize has very high potential in both saline and non saline areas in the coastal region of southern bangladesh due to its high yielding potentiality and relatively tolerance to salinity farooq et al 2015 rahman 2012 mondal et al 2001 the effect of saline irrigation water on maize yield has been studied by a number of investigators however most of the experiments in those studies were conducted in controlled environment using synthetic saline water billah et al 2017 blanco et al 2008 leogrande et al 2016 ma et al 2008 also most of these researches studied salt sensitivity by imposing a fixed level of water salinity during entire or some parts of the growing season billah et al 2017 blanco et al 2008 feng et al 2017 despite the fact that the actual growing situations at the field level are fairly different in most of the areas in coastal bangladesh significant spatial and temporal variations in soil and water salinity exist rahman et al 2017 parvin et al 2017 therefore it is important that the research should be carried out in the truly saline affected areas to find out the ways to sensibly utilize the scarce fresh and abundant saline water by generating knowledge of how plants respond to salinity at different growth stages in this context a field experiment was conducted in two consecutive years in the coastal saline area of bangladesh with a view to identify an appropriate irrigation scheduling method for cultivation of maize by conjunctively using the limited fresh water and the abundant saline water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted during rabi winter season of 2015 16 year 1 and 2016 17 year ii at the experimental field of agricultural research station ars bangladesh agricultural research institute bari benarpota satkhira the same field was used for experiments in both years the annual average maximum temperature of the study location is 35 5 c and minimum temperature is 12 5 c where april may is the warmest period and december january is the coolest period of the year table 1 the experimental site lies in agro ecological zone 13 aez 13 that consists of tidal floodplain with extensive area affected by medium to high salinity in the southwest of the country major soil type under aez 13 is non calcareous grey floodplain soil mostly clay with medium to high organic matter content high bulk density and high field capacity 38 5 40 9 banglapedia 2014 shil et al 2016 according to fao unesco soil map of the world soil of the experimental site can be classified as humic gleysol fao 2018 table 2 provides the basic soil physical properties and table 3 soil chemical properties of the experimental site analyzed prior to establishment of the experiment 2 2 treatments and experimental design the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four 4 replications six irrigation treatments t1 two irrigation first at vegetative 45 days after sowing das and second at tasseling 75 das with fresh water t2 three irrigation first at vegetative second at tasseling and third at grain filling 105 das with fresh water t3 two irrigation first at vegetative stage with fresh water s at tasseling with canal saline water t4 three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water s at tasseling and third at grain filling with canal saline water t5 two irrigation first at vegetative and second at tasseling with canal saline water and t6 three irrigation first at vegetative second at tasseling and third at grain filling with canal saline water were set the unit plot size was 7 m 5 m the experimental blocks were separated by a distance of 2 m and the plots in each block were separated by a buffer of 1 m 2 3 application of fertilizers variety and intercultural operation fertilizers were applied in the form of urea 250 kg n ha 1 triple super phosphate tsp 55 kg p ha 1 muriate of potash mop 100 kg k ha 1 gypsum 40 kg s ha 1 borax 1 4 kg b ha 1 and zinc sulphate 4 kg zn ha 1 according to the fertilizer recommendation guide of bangladesh frg 2012 decomposed cowdung was also applied at a rate of 6 t ha 1 two thirds of the total urea along with all other fertilizers were applied at the time of final land preparation before sowing while the remaining one third of the total urea was top dressed at the time of first irrigation bari hybrid maize 9 variety was used for the study maize seeds were sown on 25 november 2015 year i and 5 december 2016 year ii keeping row to row spacing of 75 cm and plant to plant distance of 25 cm intercultural operations were done according to the guidelines for bari hybrid maize 9 and recommended doses of pesticides were sprayed timely to prevent disease and pest infestation finally maize was harvested on 15 april 2016 year i and 20 april 2017 year ii 2 4 application of irrigation two sources of water were used for irrigation i relatively fresh groundwater with salinity ranging 1 10 2 23 ds m 1 during the growing season across years ii moderately saline canal water with salinity of 4 18 9 74 ds m 1 during the season canals are connected to the tidal rivers which are further connected to the bay of bengal when highly saline water from the tidal rivers enters the canals during tides water in the canals and surrounding lowlands also become saline and the salinity of the canal water increases progressively during the rabi winter season irrigation water was applied to bring the soil moisture content in the root zone to field capacity considering the effective root zone depth irrigation water was calculated using the following equation michael 2008 d f c i m c i 100 a s d where d depth of water applied cm fc moisture content at the field capacity of soil mci moisture content of the soil at the time of irrigation as apparent specific gravity of the soil in this study we considered the average value of apparent specific gravity as as 1 42 and d effective depth of root zone cm in this study we considered the effective root zone depth of maize d as 30 cm at vegetative stage 60 cm at tasseling stage and 90 cm at grain filling stage 2 5 data collection and processing soil water content was measured at different soil depths varied from 15 to 90 cm by gravimetric method before sowing and after harvesting therefore the seasonal crop water use was estimated for each treatment by the following equation michael 2008 s w u n i r r f n m b i m e i 100 a s i d i where swu seasonal water use mm nir total irrigation water applied during the crop season mm rf seasonal rainfall mm mbi percent moisture content at the beginning of

30 30 60 and 60 90 cm di depth of the ith layer of soil within the root zone mm asi apparent specific gravity of ith layer of the soil since irrigation with plastic hose pipes was provided directly from the pump to the research plots there was practically no conveyance losses therefore we assumed irrigation efficiency of 99 also it should be noted that though soil physical and chemical properties were measured only up to 45 cm tables 2 and 3 soil moisture contents were measured up to 90 cm considering the maximum root zone depth of 90 cm soil moisture was also monitored in each plot prior to each irrigation event therefore measured soil moisture in weight basis was converted to volumetric basis by multiplying with bulk density the volumetric soil moisture content or simply soil moisture content of a soil θ is defined as the volume of water vw that can be removed from a volume of soil vs by drying the soil at 105 c ednicky and richter 1972 θ v w v s m 3 m 3 where θ is expressed as a percentage rather than a fraction i e by multiplying by 100 in the present research irrigation water was applied to the unit plots according to the calculated volumes using hose pipe regulated by a flow meter soil salinity ece was monitored at 15 days interval throughout the crop season with digital ec meter hanna hi9813 ece was estimated by multiplying the ec1 5 value by an appropriate factor related to the soil texture monteleone et al 2016 slavich and petterson 1993 while ec1 5 was determined by mixing 1 part of soil with 5 parts of distilled or deionized water and allowing the sediment to settle followed by testing of the electrical conductivity of the solution khorsandi and yazdi 2011 slavich and petterson 1993 meanwhile water salinity ecw of both sources groundwater and canal water was also measured at 15 days interval as well as before each irrigation event amount of water used in different treatments from two different sources fresh groundwater and saline canal water in both years are provided in table 4 the threshold level of soil ece for bari hybrid maize 9 used in this study is 8 ds m 1 at physiological maturity a harvest area of 1 m 1 m was selected in the middle of each plot to record data on plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length and cob diameter number of rows cob 1 number of grains cob 1 1000 grain weight biomass yield and grain yield water productivity of maize was calculated by dividing the grain yield with the estimated seasonal crop water use mojid and hossain 2013 finally analysis of variance for growth and yield parameters in both years was conducted using the randomized complete block design rcbd 1 factor with r package agricolae de mendiburu 2010 3 results 3 1 growth attributes of maize various growth parameters of maize as influenced by conjunctive use of saline and fresh water irrigation at different growth parameters plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 of maize varied significantly p 0 05 among different irrigation treatments table 5 plant height was found between 193 0 cm with two irrigation first at vegetative 45 das and second at tasseling 75 das with saline canal water t5 to 218 4 cm three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water second at tasseling and third at grain filling 105 das with saline canal water t4 in year i and between 199 5 cm t5 to 224 9 cm t4 in year ii similar significant trends p 0 05 were also observed in cob length where the highest value was found in t4 19 2 cm in year i and 20 7 cm in year ii and the lowest value was recorded in t5 18 4 cm in year i and 18 0 cm in year ii the number of irrigation application also influenced the plant height and cob length significantly p 0 05 treatments with three irrigation t2 t4 and t6 whether all applied with only fresh water or only with saline water or one with freshwater followed by two with saline water had taller plants and longer cobs compared to treatments with two irrigation t1 t3 and t5 the shortest plants and shortest cobs in t5 and t6 indicate that the first irrigation with saline canal water significantly reduced both of these attributes cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 also responded significantly p 0 05 to the number of irrigation and irrigation water salinity imposed at different growth stages in both years treatment 2 t2 resulted the highest cob diameter 4 1 cm while t5 resulted in lowest 3 9 cm in year i but in year ii the highest cob diameter 4 1 cm was found in t4 though t5 again resulted in lowest diameter 3 6 cm on the other hand the highest number of rows cob 1 15 2 and 15 1 respectively and grains cob 1 412 5 and 434 9 respectively in year i and ii were obtained in t2 similar to the other two attributes both number of rows cob 1 14 5 and 13 4 respectively and number of grains cob 1 388 4 and 413 1 respectively were lowest in t5 for both attributes second lowest values were observed in t6 in both years 3 2 grain yield and yield attributes of maize table 6 illustrates that the number of grains cob 1 varied significantly p 0 05 among different irrigation treatments in year i however in year ii the variation was statistically insignificant in year i the highest number of grains cob 1 413 was found with three irrigations t2 and t4 while the lowest number of grains cob 1 was found in t5 388 and t6 397 comparatively higher number of grains cob 1 was observed for all treatments in year ii than in year i however the trend was identical here also the number of grains cob 1 was higher in t2 and t4 435 while the lower number of grains were found in t5 413 and t6 416 on the other hand significant variation for 1000 grains weight was obtained among the treatments in year i table 6 with grains weight highest in t2 265 2 g followed by other treatments 252 2 263 4 g and lowest in t5 246 8 g the scenario was slightly different in year ii although the highest and lowest 1000 grain weight 281 2 g in t2 and 258 4 g in t5 were observed for the same treatments as in the previous year the grain weight was very close to maximum for other three treatments t1 t3 and t4 significant treatment effect p 0 05 for grain yield of maize was also recorded in both years the treatment with three freshwater irrigation had highest grain yield 8 73 t ha 1 in year i in contrast another three irrigation treatment t4 with conjunctive use of fresh and saline water resulted in highest grain yield 9 55 t ha 1 in year ii nonetheless these two treatments were top two performers in both years even so the lowest grain yield was recorded for t5 6 0 and 6 66 t ha 1 in year i and ii respectively which is a treatment with two saline water irrigation only another treatment with three irrigation with saline water t6 had the second lowest grain yield in both years 6 24 and 6 92 t ha 1 respectively in year i compared to control t2 grain yield was reduced by around 31 in t5 28 in t6 7 2 in t3 6 66 in t1 and only 1 15 in t4 on the other hand in year ii compared to t2 grain yield was reduced by around 30 27 9 21 and 7 42 in t5 t6 t1 and t3 respectively and increased slightly by 0 7 in t4 in both years the straw yield was highest for t4 12 95 and 12 33 t ha 1 respectively and lowest for t5 10 17 and 9 84 t ha 1 in consistent with the trend observed for the previous attributes the second highest straw yield was obtained from t2 12 73 and 12 24 t ha 1 respectively whereas the second lowest straw yield was from t6 10 38 and 10 01 t ha 1 respectively 3 3 water requirement and water productivity of maize the total seasonal water used and irrigation water productivity for maize under different irrigation treatments are presented in table 7 results showed that the total water used by the crop varied among different treatments where the number of irrigation played the driving role as the number of irrigation increased total water use also increased however soil moisture contribution was higher in treatments with less two irrigation significantly highest p 0 05 irrigation water productivity 3 01 kg m 3 in year i and 2 88 kg m 3 in year ii was obtained from treatment t1 with two irrigation applied with fresh water in both years the second highest water productivity was found with t3 with first irrigation applied with fresh water and second with saline water on the other hand the lowest water productivity 1 81 kg m 3 in year i and 1 82 kg m 3 in year ii was attained from treatment t6 as it received all three irrigation from canal saline water and resulted in lowest yield table 7 3 4 salinity status in experimental soil fig 1 illustrates the trend of soil salinity development at different crop growth stages of maize during the study period of year i at the beginning of the season soil salinity at all the treatments were identical around 3 2 ds m 1 as the crop growing season continued soil salinity increased gradually at 15 days after sowing das and 30 das soil salinities were also found similar in all six treatments however at 45 das salinity of soil increased slightly in t5 and t6 because both of them received comparatively saline canal water as first irrigation where the others were irrigated with groundwater this trend continued up to 90 das where soil salinities in all treatments were found closer again ranges around 7 7 7 9 ds m 1 due to few rainfall events however significant variations in soil salinity were observed after the application of third irrigation at 120 das t6 had significantly highest salinity of 9 95 ds m 1 while t2 had significantly lowest salinity of 9 25 ds m 1 maximum values of soil salinity were recorded against all the treatment at harvesting ranges between 10 16 10 64 ds m 1 similar trend of soil salinity development was also observed in year ii fig 2 here sowing time soil salinities in all the treatments were also lower 3 2 3 4 ds m 1 at 15 das and 30 das soil salinity increased slowly and all the treatments had similar salinity immediately after first irrigation soil salinity in t5 and t6 jumped higher than in the other treatments soil salinity in t5 and t6 was also found higher than in the rest at 60 das and 75 das after second irrigation there were four rainfall events that minimized the effect of saline water irrigation on soil salinity therefore at 90 das and 105 das soil salinities of all five treatments were found closer however salinity level of soil continued to increase as the time increased but after third irrigation soil salinities in five irrigation treatments were found different again while the salinity in t4 and t6 was recorded as high as 9 69 ds m 1 and 9 65 ds m 1 respectively it was only 8 86 in t2 at harvest salinity was also found significantly higher in t2 10 82 ds m 1 and t4 10 87 ds m 1 where salinity of t1 t2 t3 and t5 were 10 27 ds m 1 10 17 ds m 1 10 21 ds m 1 10 33 ds m 1 respectively 3 5 salinity levels in irrigation water the salinity status of the groundwater and nearest canal water was measured at sowing before each irrigation event and at harvesting in year i during the sowing time the salinity of groundwater was around 1 1 ds m 1 while that of the canal water was around 4 18 ds m 1 fig 3 from sowing to harvesting the salinity of groundwater rose steadily and with a very slow rate on the other hand over the same period salinity of canal water increased with a significant rate during first irrigation the salinity of groundwater and canal water were 1 47 ds m 1 and 5 95 ds m 1 respectively second irrigation was applied with groundwater with salinity of 1 76 ds m 1 and canal water with 7 89 ds m 1 while the third irrigation was applied with groundwater with salinity of 2 08 ds m 1 and canal water with 9 13 ds m 1 both the groundwater and canal water had highest salinity levels during the time of harvesting similar trends of groundwater and canal water salinity were also observed in year ii fig 4 here the salinity of groundwater during sowing first second and third irrigation and during harvesting were 1 18 1 54 1 88 2 15 and 2 33 ds m 1 respectively on the other hand the corresponding values of canal water salinities were 4 25 6 23 8 14 9 2 and 9 74 ds m 1 respectively 4 discussion among the most affected countries by salinity bangladesh is one which is affected by high levels of both soil and water salinity rahman et al 2017 due to increase in both soil and water salinity more than 40 million people in nineteen districts in the southern coastal region of bangladesh 32 percent area of the country are seriously affected by salinity mondal and haque 2015 parvin et al 2017 and prediction suggests that an additional 2 3 percent area will be affected by 2030 huq et al 2015 mahmuduzzaman et al 2014 farmers in these areas have been constantly suffering from lack of fresh quality water for irrigation as a result vast land areas are kept aside of agricultural production and left the small landowners poor hoque and haque 2016 huq et al 2015 modern maize hybrids have been identified as high yielding crops during all seasons especially in rabi winter season across south asia timsina et al 2010 2016 maize has very high potential in both saline and non saline areas in the coastal region of southern bangladesh due to its potential for high yield and its relative tolerance to salinity farooq et al 2015 rahman 2012 mondal et al 2001 it is considered as a moderately salinity tolerant crop katerji et al 2000 mojid et al 2014b as compared to other cereals however excessive salinity hinders propagation leaf cell expansion and leaf development dry mater accretion rate of net co2 absorption and overall physiological growth katerji et al 2000 letey et al 2011 munns and tester 2008 in the current study it was observed that the soil salinity levels in both years increased gradually over the maize growing period and peaked at the harvesting time just after each irrigation event soil salinity was found higher in treatments that were applied with saline water while the treatments with freshwater irrigation showed less salinity figs 1 and 2 however rainfall events sometimes minimized the effects of saline water irrigation on soil salinity development soils of saline areas in southern bangladesh are inheritably developed by saline parent materials and by deposition of salt ions year by year generally soil salinity increases gradually during dry period from november to may despite of the source of irrigation water whether fresh or saline or even under fallow condition salinity would have been reduced if there was flush irrigation with freshwater allowing leaching but our treatments considered only 2 3 irrigation that was up to field capacity so there was slight salinity build up of groundwater also the results of the current study showed that both the irrigation water salinity and the number of irrigation had significant influence over the growth yield and yield attributes of maize in both years when same number of irrigation was provided maize yields were generally higher when comparatively fresh groundwater was used compared to only saline canal water however the difference was insignificant when the crop was irrigated with the conjunctive use of fresh groundwater and saline canal water when freshwater sources are limited the number of irrigation can be increased by intelligently utilizing the available moderately saline water if the crop is somehow established with an early fresh water irrigation it can then be irrigated with available saline water sources without compromising the crop yield figs 3 and 4 the results of this study also demonstrated that different growth parameters plant height number of cobs plant 1 cob length cob diameter number of rows cob 1 and number of grains cob 1 of maize vary significantly for different irrigation treatments these results also indicate that application of first irrigation with fresh water at vegetative stage is more effective than application of fresh water at reproductive stage table 5 the significantly lower values of all the growth attributes of maize obtained in t5 and t6 suggest that comparatively saline water for irrigation from the nearby canal at the earliest stage vegetative 45 das asserted physiological stress and affected plants to maintain its natural growth although t2 t4 and t6 received the same three numbers of irrigation all growth attributes were significantly higher in t2 and t4 on the other hand comparative values of growth attributes in t2 and t4 imply that when the plant survived its early stage it endures salinity stress up to certain limit and thus maintains normal physiological vigor therefore when fresh water is limited the irrigator can explore nearby moderately saline water sources to apply additional irrigation at a later stage rather than skipping irrigation events the results of the present study agree with mojid et al 2014a who stated that the sensitivity of any crop to salinity often changes from one stage of growth to the other as most of the crops are extremely sensitive to irrigation water salinity in early stage flowers 2004 mojid et al 2014a saline water can be used to irrigate at other stages where plants have better resistance ability mojid and hossain 2013 munns and tester 2008 gandahi et al 2017 found the highest fresh biomass plant height number of leaves plant 1 number of bolls and boll weight in the treatments where tap water was used on the other hand these parameters decreased significantly with the increasing salinity levels from 4 to 12 ds m 1 and when saline water was applied continuously throughout the growing period among the field crops maize is grown under a wide spectrum of soil and climatic conditions and is moderately sensitive to salt stress tanji and kielen 2003 the threshold and slope concepts have their greatest values in providing general salt tolerance guidelines for crop management decisions and generally threshold levels of salinity varies from plant to plant as well as from cultivar to cultivar bernstein and ayers 1949 kaddah and ghowail 1964 these authors also suggested that farmers need to know the soil salinity levels that begin to reduce yield and rate of yield reduction at levels above the threshold in the present study the lowest values of yield attributes were recorded for treatment with two irrigation with saline canal water t5 first at vegetative 40 das and second at tasseling 75 das followed by three irrigation with saline canal water t6 first at vegetative 45 das second at tasseling 75 das and third at grain filling 105 das tables 5 and 6 these results indicate that sensitivity of salinity in reproductive stage reduced the yield attributes which ultimately reduced the final grain weight of maize previous studies have also concluded that saline water could be used for irrigation with minimal adverse effects on crop and soil if management is done intelligently al khamisi et al 2013 mojid and hossain 2013 singh 2014 the presence of excessive salt in the plant root zone affects the natural physio morphological characters of most crops at all growth stages de oliveira et al 2013 pessarakli 2016 however the level of resistance of plant to salinity depends on the type frequency and timing of irrigation li et al 2015 mojid and hossain 2013 soil salinity level increases in between two irrigation events as the soil water content decreases mojid and hossain 2013 mojid et al 2014a consequently plants suffer most in this period and experience osmotic as well as matric stresses mojid et al 2014b the fundamental of sustainable irrigation using saline water is that the salt concentration in the root zone soil must be maintained below a threshold level specific for each crop species maas and hoffman 1977 letey et al 2011 munns and tester 2008 the results of this study also showed that the maximum water productivity was obtained when two irrigation was applied through fresh ground water t1 followed by two irrigation first with fresh and second with saline water t3 and the lowest water productivity was recorded with t6 where all three irrigations were applied with saline canal water table 7 the higher water productivity from t1 and t3 suggests that when water is precious and saving water is a priority two irrigations with fresh water at vegetative 45 das and at tasseling 75 das stage or with conjunctive use of fresh and saline water is profitable with marginal effect on yield although treatment t3 and t5 both received two irrigation single irrigation with fresh groundwater in vegetative stage t3 significantly improved the water productivity table 7 these results agree with xue and ren 2017 who also found that with conjunctive use of saline and non saline irrigation water the average yields of spring wheat spring maize and sunflower were increased or decreased by 0 2 5 3 and 8 2 and the water productivities were increased or decreased by 5 5 2 6 and 7 6 respectively as compared with non saline irrigation water our results also agree with minhas and gupta 1993 and minhas 1996 who reported that conjunctive use of saline and fresh water increases the productivity of maize under the salinity condition thus the results of the current study conducted in the actual saline environment and growing conditions suggest that the moderately saline canal water can be a very handy source of irrigation water for winter maize in saline coastal areas of southern bangladesh and similar saline coastal areas in south asia where fresh water for irrigation is scarce we suggest that instead of reducing the number of irrigation events conjunctive use of freshwater at early sensitive stage combined with saline canal water at a later stage can minimize the yield loss and increase water productivity of maize 5 conclusions based on the results of the two years of study we conclude that irrigating maize with fresh or saline water has significant effect on its yield and yield attributing parameters three irrigation either all with fresh water or first with fresh and the next two with saline water can result in highest yield due to the greatest improvement of yield attributes followed by two irrigation either both with fresh water or first irrigation with fresh water and the second with saline water compared to three irrigations with fresh water grain yield can decrease by 1 2 31 0 across all other treatments with either conjunctive use of fresh and saline water or irrigation by saline water only results also suggest that the conjunctive use of relatively fresh groundwater and moderate saline canal water can benefit maize with marginal effect on yield an early irrigation with freshwater followed by two irrigations with saline water can improve maize yield significantly rather than using saline water in all stages considering yield gain compared to three irrigation all with fresh water three irrigation first at vegetative with fresh water and second at tasseling and third at grain filling each with saline canal water is best followed by other irrigation treatments on contrary significantly highest p 0 05 water productivity can be obtained with two irrigations with fresh water lowest with three irrigations all with saline water finally it can be concluded that location specific appropriate irrigation scheduling methods and criteria need to be developed for the saline affected zones for popular crops to minimize yield reductions and to optimize sustainable use of limited fresh groundwater and abundant saline water conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest financial support

11458,changes in soil moisture influence the water availability to crop plants and soil ecological processes like carbon and nutrient cycling impacting on crop productivity and environmental performance greenhouse gas emissions leaching of agricultural systems while traditional soil moisture measurements are done using point based methods the recent development of the cosmic ray soil moisture neutron sensor crns offers the opportunity to measure soil water at the field scale however due to its shallow 300 mm and variable measurement depth the relevance of the measurements to crop water use has been questioned in this paper we combine point based soil moisture measurements soil cores tdr areal based soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements crns eddy covariance and soil plant systems modelling together to investigate the consistency in measured soil moisture and crop water use with these different methods we also quantify how relevant the crns soil moisture measurements are in understanding the water use of cereal crops wheat and barley our results show that crop water uptake from crns layers accounted for 50 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year with annual rainfall 300 mm but only 30 50 of the total crop water uptake in wetter environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes the high temporal resolution of soil moisture data from crns can be assimilated with eddy covariance measurements and point measurements in field to better calibrate soil plant models and to more accurately simulate field water balance keywords soil water dynamics surface versus deep layers evapotranspiration modelling apsim 1 introduction soil moisture dynamics and field water balance affect crop growth grain yield and other ecological processes like salinity nutrient transformation and emission of greenhouse gases ghgs n2o co2 ch4 from soil most current environmental problems that occur in agricultural areas arise from altering the dynamics of the agricultural water balance without an understanding of the long term response of the system for example salinization is associated with changes in the surface water balance induced by removal of native grassland and clearing of deep rooted native vegetation these changes increase groundwater recharge which in turn leads to rising water tables and salinization zhang and walker 2002 other examples include the impact of altered soil moisture dynamics on emission of ghgs from soil xing et al 2011 thorburn et al 2010 short term agronomic studies alone cannot identify optimal or appropriate land use or management practices to address the changes that occur over long periods the problem can be addressed by combining well instrumented field experiments and system models van dijk 2011 in that regard continuous and reliable measurements of profile soil water and the other terms in the water balance evaporation crop transpiration runoff drainage are the key to understanding the processes and validation of process based models traditionally most ground based measurements of soil water content swc cm3 cm3 are made at a point the methods used vary from core samples gravimetric or volumetric time domain reflectrometry tdr or capacitance probes or neutron probes because of the spatial heterogeneity present in swc it is often difficult to determine the average value for large agricultural fields although time consuming replicates of measurements can be made at different points in a field the cosmic ray neutron sensor for measuring soil water content crns zreda et al 2012 franz et al 2012 offers the opportunity to measure soil water at the field scale 5 28 ha for depths from 100 to 850 mm depending on swc mcjannet et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 bogena et al 2013 köhli et al 2015 efforts have been made to use such measurements for estimating field scale swc and crop water use avery et al 2016 foolad et al 2017 however due to the shallow and variable measurement depth of the crns peterson et al 2016 and the much deeper water extraction of crop root systems particularly in semi arid and arid areas verburg and bond 2003 the relevance of the measurements with regard to crop water use has been questioned the eddy covariance provides a direct measure of the net exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapour across the canopy atmosphere interface over an area meyers and

mature a total of 135 mm was recorded during the fallow period nov 1 april 2013 and 274 mm during the barley growing season the periods selected to do the cumulative sums do not match exactly to the growing season rather the start and end dates were selected to match the soil coring at the beginning of each phase 2 3 crop measurements crop measurements were made by cutting 5 adjacent rows 0 39 m

the cosmic ray probe are given by zreda et al 2008 2012 franz et al 2012 desilets and zreda 2013 and rivera villarreyes et al 2011 the areal footprint ranges from 130 to about 240 m radius depending on air humidity swc and vegetation köhli et al 2015 which is less than the original estimate of 300 m radius by zreda et al 2008 and desilets et al 2010 the moisture dependent penetration depth varies from 15 to 83 dm and decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor kohlu et al 2015 recently schrön et al 2017 has proposed a revised averaging method to improve the performance and increases the overall accuracy of crns products for this experiment we use the set up field calibration and correction procedure given by hawdon et al 2014 this set up includes a rain gauge that records rainfall at hourly time step the bulk lattice water τ and soil organic carbon soc expressed as a water equivalents were 0 029 g g 1 soil and 0 007 g g 1 soil respectively theory behind the technique for measuring average soil water is given in zreda et al 2012 briefly by placing the neutron detector above the ground surface average swc measurements can be made over horizontal footprint of hectares ha and to a soil depth of decimetres dm the sensor measures hydrogen in the water in plants and soil mcjannet et al 2014 baatz et al 2015 under annual cropping we estimate that the equivalent water contribution from biomass ranges from nil to a maximum of about 0 3 mm of water similarly mcjannet et al 2014 concluded that hydrogen in biomass makes a relatively small contribution to the total hydrogen pool size with the exception heavily forested sites the depth z cm to which the sensor detects water is largely dependent on the swc franz et al 2012 and was determined using the following equation 1 z 5 8 ρ b d ρ w τ s o c s w c 0 0829 where ρbd is dry bulk density of the soil g cm 3 ρw is the density of liquid water assumed to be 1 g cm 3 τ is the weight fraction of lattice water g water g of dry material and soc is mass of water equivalent per gram of dry soil in the soil organic matter hawdon et al 2014 and swc is the volumetric pore water content cm3 cm3 the effective crns measurement depth z is 2 ϕ z w s 0 z ρ b d z τ z s o c z s w c z d z where φ z is the 86 cumulative depth sensitivity and ws is surface water cm for the calculation of the effective measurement depth the apsim predicted swc cm3 cm3 of the soil layer were used the calculation were done on 10 mm increments 2 7 apsim model and parameterisation detailed description of the agricultural production systems simulator apsim are given by holzworth et al 2014 and keating et al 2003 in summary apsim is a daily time step model that comprise of a set of biophysical modules that simulate the response of farming systems to management and climate variability the key apsim modules used include wheat barley soilwat soiln and soiltemp for wheat and barley apsim simulates the biomass growth rate using radiation use efficiency rue multiplied by light interception or transpiration efficiency te multiplied by plant water uptake whichever is smaller rue can be reduced by suboptimal temperature and nitrogen stress while te is inversely affected by vapour pressure deficit vpd of the air wang et al 2004 crop water uptake is determined by water demand and available soil water supply apsim soilwat simulates water movement between soil layers using the tipping bucket approach with key parameters listed in table 1 it also simulates infiltration runoff and evaporation from surface soil layers the maximum depth of water uptake by wheat and barley was set at 1600 mm however our infrequent soil coring did not confirm water extraction below 1000 mm depth nor was the soil wet below this depth apsim soiln simulates the soil organic matter decomposition and nitrogen transformation processes in soil in response to changes in soil conditions mainly temperature and moisture these processes affect the n availability in soil and consequently crop growth we used the soiltemp module that simulates the soil temperature in each soil layer requiring water content evaporation from soil e obtained from the soilwat module air temperature and incident radiation as inputs this module was used instead of the default approach for soil temperature simulation embedded in soiln due to its superior performance compared to the measurement data the default soil temperature approach uses air temperature and an assumed sinusoidal function based on mean annual air temperature annual amplitude in mean monthly air temperature and latitude some examples of the different applications of the model and model performance are shown in papers by luo et al 2017 luo et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 xing et al 2011 wang et al

however for barley cultivar scope the vernalisation sensitivity was increased from 1 to 1 5 and thermal time required for the grain filling stage was increased from 503 5 to 645 c days to match the observed flowering and maturity dates the potential grain filling rate was increased from 0 0031 to 0 0045 to match the observed grain yield the transpiration efficiencies were modified table 2 to account for any seasonal impact and to match measured water use and crop biomass for the purpose of simulating soil water dynamics to compare point and areal based soil water measurements the apsim soil parameters used were based on those from the apsoil data base for a soil profile near our site temora 913 specific measurements of bulk density organic carbon clay content swc and inorganic n in our experimental field were used to modify the apsoil soil profile temora 913 and to initialise the apsim model soil hydraulic parameters including the saturated water content sat drained upper limit dul and crop lower limit cll were further derived based on soil water content swc measured in the upper soil layers 300 mm and from core samples for the deeper layers using the method of dalgliesh and foale 2005 table 1 the water content at 15 bar suction ll15 was modified based on 15 bar swc measurements made in the laboratory the plant available water capacity pawc of the soil is calculated as the water held between dul and cll across the soil depth the initial swc and mineral n in each soil layer were initialised using the measurements made on 9 core samples collected on 2 may 2013 2 8 consistency in soil water measurements and water balance consistency in soil water measurements from the three methods soil core tdr and crns were analysed by comparing the time series of measured swc cm3 cm3 in the different soil layers half hourly average swc values measured with the time domain soil moisture probes tdr were averaged to give daily water contents for any comparisons with the cosmic ray probe the water content in the crns measurement is used water fluxes were analysed in terms of daily evapotranspiration et transpiration t and cumulative seasonal total seasonal total et was calculated using two methods i field water balance using the seasonal change in swc rainfall and assuming zero run off and drainage beyond the root zone ii eddy covariance measurements of et and were compared with those from apsim simulations 2 9 cosmic ray probe crns soil water measurements and crop water use to check the usefulness of the crns soil water measurements for estimating crop water use we firstly calculated the swc in soil from the surface to the crns measurement depth using swc simulated with apsim for these simulations the rooting depth of wheat was set to 1 6 m the measurement depth of the crns was estimated from eq 2 as stated above the calculations were made at 10 mm increments in each soil layers and the predicted average swc of the layer swc1 n comparison of the measured and simulated swc was used to check the performance of apsim for simulating swc up to the crns measurement depth we further calculated the apsim simulated crop water uptake from the whole soil profile wut and from the soil layers up to the crns measurement depth wuc we used the ratio ζ wuc wut to represent the importance of the soil water measured from the crns measurement depth additional simulations were also performed along an east to west rainfall gradient from griffith to young using the temora soil at all sites the simulations were run for a 55 year period 1960 2014 and the predicted swc 1 n contents were used to determine the measurement depth of the crns crop water uptake from the effective crns measurement depth wuc and the total wut by wheat were compared at the four sites the annual average rainfall and standard deviation at griffith station number 075174 was 404 128 mm ardlethan station number 074000 486 133 mm temora station number 73038 529 155 mm and young 073138 619 181 mm 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics evapotranspiration and crop water use there was general agreement between volumetric water contents measured with the tdr and the soil cores in the top soil layers at 50 100 200 and 300 mm soil depth indicating consistency in measurement using the two methods fig 2 based on the dynamics of deeper soil core measurements it appears that both the wheat and barley crop only used water up to 1000 mm depth no significant changes in swc were measured at depth below 1000 mm however the infrequent deep soil sampling prevented us from concluding that there was water extraction in the soil below 1000 mm or whether the soil even became wet below this depth apsim simulated swc dynamics closely followed the measurements from both soil cores and tdr in the top 300 mm soil layers and the soil core measurements at deeper layers fig 2 the cumulative evapotranspiration from apsim simulations also matched that estimated from water balance using the soil core measurements for wheat and barley growing seasons as well as for the fallow period fig 3 a there was good agreement between the simulated apsim and measured eddy covariance et during the fallow and barely however during the wheat season the measured et was lower than the simulated et and that calculated from the soil water balance we consider the measured et to be an underestimate because of the large amount of gap filling in the data fig 3c results in figs 2 and 3 together demonstrate that apsim was able to simulate crop water uptake and soil water dynamics from each soil layer as well as the total seasonal water uptake the predicted swc at depth 1 0 m suggest some water uptake in the 1000 1300 and 1300 1600 mm soil layer by wheat after the initial decrease in the swc sep 2013 there was little or no change with time these data suggest that there was no further water extraction from depth by the barley crop furthermore it shows no rewetting of the soil below 1000 mm 3 2 comparison of point and areal measurements of soil moisture and et comparison of swc measurements from point based methods of soil cores or tdr and those from crns cannot be made directly due to the variable measurement depth of crns reliable performance of the apsim model to simulate swc in different soil layers enabled us to calculate the depth weighted average swc franz et al 2012 in the crns measurement depth using the apsim simulated soil moisture and compared them with crns measurements the area averaged swc measured by crns ranged from 0 05 m3 m3 during the summer to maximum of 0 38 m3 m3 during the winter fig 4 a the depth of crns measurement varied from 30 dm when the soil was dry to 10 dm when the soil was wet in the experimental period fig 4b the average swc calculated from apsim simulated soil moisture within the crns measurement depth matched well to the crns measurements rsme 0 05 figs 4a 5 mcjannet et al 2014 and baztz et al 2015 report that hydrogen in the biomass leads to higher swc estimates however in our study biomass increased from zero to 200 g m 2 by the end july and increased rapidly during the spring fig 3 the contribution from biomass in this study is considered to be small and at maximum biomass the estimated biomass contribution was 0 3 mm consistent with mcjannet et al 2014 the good agreement between crns measurement and apsim simulations figs 5a 5 together with the good agreement between swc point measurements and apsim simulations fig 2 implies a general consistency between point soil cores tdr and areal measurements crns schrön et al 2017 showed that the crns probe has a variable foot print that changes with swc the area closer to the probe have greater influence especially in non homogenous land use system however in agricultural field as used at temora 30 ha the soil cropping system is considered to be homogenous and all area are considered to contribute equally to the crns footprint the deviation observed between the apsim predicted and crns swc are considered to be due to over prediction of the swc with apsim which was most noticeable during the summer fallow figs 4a 5 the areal measurements of et from the eddy covariance ec were also in good agreement with the et calculated from water balance and those simulated by apsim except for the wheat season the ec measurements did not start until 6 june 2013 the larger amount of infilling for the eddy covariance data before september 2013 fig 3c makes it questionable for the wheat season the better agreement with water balance for the fallow and barley seasons seem to indicate that the et from ec and water balance are consistent 3 3 crns measured soil water and crop water use due to the variable measurement depth of the crns the fraction of crop water uptake from the crns measurement ζ wuc wut varied from stage to stage and from year to year fig 6 for a given year the fraction decreased with crop development stage due to increasing root depth and consequent greater water uptake from deeper layers however in dry years rainfall later in the season increases soil water in shallow soil layers leading to increased water uptake in those layers thus an increase in ζ for different years the fraction of water uptake from the crns measurement layers decreases with increasing seasonal rainfall fig 6 simulation of the crop water uptake from the crns measurement depth and the total soil profile across a rainfall gradient is shown in fig 7 it is clear that the fraction water uptake decreases with annual seasonal rainfall both across sites and different types of year at one site fig 7 at the driest sites e g griffith and in the driest years the water uptake from crns layers accounted for up to 80 90 of the total water uptake fig 7b however in wet regions e g young and in wet years it only accounted for less than 40 of the total crop water uptake 4 discussion our results shows that swc dynamics measured using the point based methods of soil coring and tdr are consistent with those measured by the area based method of cosmic ray probe crns while soil coring with replicates provides soil samples for reliable measurements of soil moisture and other soil properties the continuous recording of tdr and crns enables better tracking of swc dynamics soil moisture change is a key driver for not only crop water uptake but also soil processes that control nutrient transformation availability and greenhouse gas n2o co2 emissions methods that provide high temporal resolution data tdr crns enable better validation of process based models like apsim for simulation of those soil processes and crop water uptake dynamics while the crns does not provide any information on changes in the water dynamic in individual soil layers combing point measurements such as tdr with the crns measurements enables better verification of model simulations of soil water dynamics ideally the continuous soil water measurements in the upper soil layers should be combined with continuous measurement in the deeper soil layers which can be achieved for example with the use of dielectric soil moisture probes e g http hussat wixsite com terrasonde soil moisture probes the cosmic ray probe provides continuous measurements of average swc over a large spatial area 28 ha due to the shallow and variable measurement depth 10 30 dm fig 4 question remained about the relevance of crns measured swc with regard to crop water use which has not been previously quantified our modelling results enabled quantification of this relevance and showed that the water uptake from crns layers accounted for up to 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year but less than 50 of the total crop water uptake in wet environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes in addition the crns provides high temporal resolution soil moisture data in the top soil layers where most of the nutrient n transformation processes occur and these are responsible for greenhouse gas n2o co2 emissions the consistency in et estimated from the water balance approach and those from the eddy covariance measurements further demonstrate the validity of both approaches the same as with the soil moisture measurements the high temporal resolution of et from eddy covariance help to better check the accuracy of apsim for simulation of the day to day variations of soil evaporation during fallow period and early stage of crop development and crop water uptake transpiration ep during the rapid growth stages of crops fig 3 our data tends to suggest the apsim ep is over predicted in the spring as compared to eddy covariance et the over prediction of et appears to be in transpiration which is consistent with the observation of wang et al 2004 that the apsim rue te approach predicts potential transpiration higher than potential et the et overprediction may also be related to inaccuracies in rooting depth and root water supply whilst there was some over prediction in ep during the spring the impact on simulated biomass and yield is small however data sets such as those presented here provide the opportunity to improve the model to respond to water limitations 5 conclusion the cosmic ray probe provides continuous measurements of average swc within a variable depth of 10 30 dm in the surface soil layer over a large spatial area range 5 28 ha water uptake of cereal crops wheat barley from crns layers accounted for 50 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year with annual rainfall 300 mm but only 30 50 of the total crop water uptake in wetter environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes the high temporal resolution of swc data from crns can be assimilated with eddy covariance measurements and point measurements in field to better calibrate soil plant models and to more

11458,changes in soil moisture influence the water availability to crop plants and soil ecological processes like carbon and nutrient cycling impacting on crop productivity and environmental performance greenhouse gas emissions leaching of agricultural systems while traditional soil moisture measurements are done using point based methods the recent development of the cosmic ray soil moisture neutron sensor crns offers the opportunity to measure soil water at the field scale however due to its shallow 300 mm and variable measurement depth the relevance of the measurements to crop water use has been questioned in this paper we combine point based soil moisture measurements soil cores tdr areal based soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements crns eddy covariance and soil plant systems modelling together to investigate the consistency in measured soil moisture and crop water use with these different methods we also quantify how relevant the crns soil moisture measurements are in understanding the water use of cereal crops wheat and barley our results show that crop water uptake from crns layers accounted for 50 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year with annual rainfall 300 mm but only 30 50 of the total crop water uptake in wetter environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes the high temporal resolution of soil moisture data from crns can be assimilated with eddy

layers evapotranspiration modelling apsim 1 introduction soil moisture dynamics and field water balance affect crop growth grain yield and other ecological processes like salinity nutrient transformation and emission of greenhouse gases ghgs n2o co2 ch4 from soil most current environmental problems that occur in agricultural areas arise from altering the dynamics of the agricultural water balance without an understanding of the long term response of the system for example salinization is associated with changes in the surface water balance induced by removal of native grassland and clearing of deep rooted native vegetation these changes increase groundwater recharge which in turn leads to rising water tables and salinization zhang and walker 2002 other examples include the impact of altered soil moisture dynamics on emission of ghgs from soil xing et al 2011 thorburn et al 2010 short term agronomic studies alone cannot identify optimal or appropriate land use or management practices to address the changes that occur over long periods the problem can be addressed by combining well instrumented field experiments and system models van dijk 2011 in that regard continuous and reliable measurements of profile soil water and the other terms in the water balance evaporation crop transpiration runoff drainage are the key to understanding the processes and validation of process based models traditionally most ground based measurements of soil water content swc cm3 cm3 are made at a point the methods used vary from core samples gravimetric or volumetric time domain reflectrometry tdr or capacitance probes or neutron probes because of the spatial heterogeneity present in swc it is often difficult to determine the average value for large agricultural fields although time consuming replicates of measurements can be made at different points in a field the cosmic ray neutron sensor for measuring soil water content crns zreda et al 2012 franz et al 2012 offers the opportunity to measure soil water at the field scale 5 28 ha for depths from 100 to 850 mm depending on swc mcjannet et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 bogena et al 2013 köhli et al 2015 efforts have been made to use such measurements for estimating field scale swc and crop water use avery et al 2016 foolad et al 2017 however due to the shallow and variable measurement depth of the crns peterson et al 2016 and the much deeper water extraction of crop root systems particularly in semi arid and arid areas verburg and bond 2003 the relevance of the measurements with regard to crop water use has been questioned the eddy covariance provides a direct measure of the net exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapour across the canopy atmosphere interface over an area meyers and

the eddy covariance system and hourly measurement from the rain gauge together with the cosmic ray probe crns gaps in the data were in filled by combining both data sources and these site specific rainfall data were used for the simulation in summary 263 mm of rain p was recorded from 2 may 2013 to the end of the wheat growing season with 22 mm falling on 16 november 2013 when the wheat was mature a total of 135 mm was recorded during the fallow period nov 1 april 2013 and 274 mm during the barley growing season the periods selected to do the cumulative sums do not match exactly to the growing season rather the start and end dates were selected to match the soil coring at the beginning of each phase 2 3 crop measurements crop measurements were made by cutting 5 adjacent rows 0 39 m

the cosmic ray probe are given by zreda et al 2008 2012 franz et al 2012 desilets and zreda 2013 and rivera villarreyes et al 2011 the areal footprint ranges from 130 to about 240 m radius depending on air humidity swc and vegetation köhli et al 2015 which is less than the original estimate of 300 m radius by zreda et al 2008 and desilets et al 2010 the moisture dependent penetration depth varies from 15 to 83 dm and decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor kohlu et al 2015 recently schrön et al 2017 has proposed a revised averaging method to improve the performance and increases the overall accuracy of crns products for this experiment we use the set up field calibration and correction procedure given by hawdon et al 2014 this set up includes a rain gauge that records rainfall at hourly time step the bulk lattice water τ and soil organic carbon soc expressed as a water equivalents were 0 029 g g 1 soil and 0 007 g g 1 soil respectively theory behind the technique for measuring average soil water is given in zreda et al 2012 briefly by placing the neutron detector above the ground surface average swc measurements can be made over horizontal footprint of hectares ha and to a soil depth of decimetres dm the sensor measures hydrogen in the water in plants and soil mcjannet et al 2014 baatz et al 2015 under annual cropping we estimate that the equivalent water contribution from biomass ranges from nil to a maximum of about 0 3 mm of water similarly mcjannet et al 2014 concluded that hydrogen in biomass makes a relatively small contribution to the total hydrogen pool size with the exception heavily forested sites the depth z cm to which the sensor detects water is largely dependent on the swc franz et al 2012 and was determined using the following equation 1 z 5 8 ρ b d ρ w τ s o c s w c 0 0829 where ρbd is dry bulk density of the soil g cm 3 ρw is the density of liquid water assumed to be 1 g cm 3 τ is the weight fraction of lattice water g water g of dry material and soc is mass of water equivalent per gram of dry soil in the soil organic matter hawdon et al 2014 and swc is the volumetric pore water content cm3 cm3 the effective crns measurement depth z is 2 ϕ z w s 0 z ρ b d z τ z s o c z s w c z d z where φ z is the 86 cumulative depth sensitivity and ws is surface water cm for the calculation of the effective measurement depth the apsim predicted swc cm3 cm3 of the soil layer were used the calculation were done on 10 mm increments 2 7 apsim model and parameterisation detailed description of the agricultural production systems simulator apsim are given by holzworth et al 2014 and keating et al 2003 in summary apsim is a daily time step model that comprise of a set of biophysical modules that simulate the response of farming systems to management and climate variability the key apsim modules used include wheat barley soilwat soiln and soiltemp for wheat and barley apsim simulates the biomass growth rate using radiation use efficiency rue multiplied by light interception or transpiration efficiency te multiplied by plant water uptake whichever is smaller rue can be reduced by suboptimal temperature and nitrogen stress while te is inversely affected by vapour pressure deficit vpd of the air wang et al 2004 crop water uptake is determined by water demand and available soil water supply apsim soilwat simulates water movement between soil layers using the tipping bucket approach with key parameters listed in table 1 it also simulates infiltration runoff and evaporation from surface soil layers the maximum depth of water uptake by wheat and barley was set at 1600 mm however our infrequent soil coring did not confirm water extraction below 1000 mm depth nor was the soil wet below this depth apsim soiln simulates the soil organic matter decomposition and nitrogen transformation processes in soil in response to changes in soil conditions mainly temperature and moisture these processes affect the n availability in soil and consequently crop growth we used the soiltemp module that simulates the soil temperature in each soil layer requiring water content evaporation from soil e obtained from the soilwat module air temperature and incident radiation as inputs this module was used instead of the default approach for soil temperature simulation embedded in soiln due to its superior performance compared to the measurement data the default soil temperature approach uses air temperature and an assumed sinusoidal function based on mean annual air temperature annual amplitude in mean monthly air temperature and latitude some examples of the different applications of the model and model performance are shown in papers by luo et al 2017 luo et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 xing et al 2011 wang et al 2009 2011 a comprehensive list of publications can be found at http www apsim info products publications aspx the wheat cultivar gregory parameters were unchanged from the standard in apsim release however for barley cultivar scope the vernalisation sensitivity was increased from 1 to 1 5 and thermal time required for the grain filling stage was increased from 503 5 to 645 c days to match the observed flowering and maturity dates the potential grain filling rate was increased from 0 0031 to 0 0045 to match the observed grain yield the transpiration efficiencies were modified table 2 to account for any seasonal impact and to match measured water use and crop biomass for the purpose of simulating soil water dynamics to compare point and areal based soil water measurements the apsim soil parameters used were based on those from the apsoil data base for a soil profile near our site temora 913 specific measurements of bulk density organic carbon clay content swc and inorganic n in our experimental field were used to modify the apsoil soil profile temora 913 and to initialise the apsim model soil hydraulic parameters including the saturated water content sat drained upper limit dul and crop lower limit cll were further derived based on soil water content swc measured in the upper soil layers 300 mm and from core samples for the deeper layers using the method of dalgliesh and foale 2005 table 1 the water content at 15 bar suction ll15 was modified based on 15 bar swc measurements made in the laboratory the plant available water capacity pawc of the soil is calculated as the water held between dul and cll across the soil depth the initial swc and mineral n in each soil layer were initialised using the measurements made on 9 core samples collected on 2 may 2013 2 8 consistency in soil water measurements and water balance consistency in soil water measurements from the three methods soil core tdr and crns were analysed by comparing the time series of measured swc cm3 cm3 in the different soil layers half hourly average swc values measured with the time domain soil moisture probes tdr were averaged to give daily water contents for any comparisons with the cosmic ray probe the water content in the crns measurement is used water fluxes were analysed in terms of daily evapotranspiration et transpiration t and cumulative seasonal total seasonal total et was calculated using two methods i field water balance using the seasonal change in swc rainfall and assuming zero run off and drainage beyond the root zone ii eddy covariance measurements of et and were compared with those from apsim simulations 2 9 cosmic ray probe crns soil water measurements and crop water use to check the usefulness of the crns soil water measurements for estimating crop water use we firstly calculated the swc in soil from the surface to the crns measurement depth using swc simulated with apsim for these simulations the rooting depth of wheat was set to 1 6 m the measurement depth of the crns was estimated from eq 2 as stated above the calculations were made at 10 mm increments in each soil layers and the predicted average swc of the layer swc1 n comparison of the measured and simulated swc was used to check the performance of apsim for simulating swc up to the crns measurement depth we further calculated the apsim simulated crop water uptake from the whole soil profile wut and from the soil layers up to the crns measurement depth wuc we used the ratio ζ wuc wut to represent the importance of the soil water measured from the crns measurement depth additional simulations were also performed along an east to west rainfall gradient from griffith to young using the temora soil at all sites the simulations were run for a 55 year period 1960 2014 and the predicted swc 1 n contents were used to determine the measurement depth of the crns crop water uptake from the effective crns measurement depth wuc and the total wut by wheat were compared at the four sites the annual average rainfall and standard deviation at griffith station number 075174 was 404 128 mm ardlethan station number 074000 486 133 mm temora station number 73038 529 155 mm and young 073138 619 181 mm 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics evapotranspiration and crop water use there was general agreement between volumetric water contents measured with the tdr and the soil cores in the top soil layers at 50 100 200 and 300 mm soil depth indicating consistency in measurement using the two methods fig 2 based on the dynamics of deeper soil core measurements it appears that both the wheat and barley crop only used water up to 1000 mm depth no significant changes in swc were measured at depth below 1000 mm however the infrequent deep soil sampling prevented us from concluding that there was water extraction in the soil below 1000 mm or whether the soil even became wet below this depth apsim simulated swc dynamics closely followed the measurements from both soil cores and tdr in the top 300 mm soil layers and the soil core measurements at deeper layers fig 2 the cumulative evapotranspiration from apsim simulations also matched that estimated from water balance using the soil core measurements for wheat and barley growing seasons as well as for the fallow period fig 3 a there was good agreement between the simulated apsim and measured eddy covariance et during the fallow and barely however during the wheat season the measured et was lower than the simulated et and that calculated from the soil water balance we consider the measured et to be an underestimate because of the large amount of gap filling in the data fig 3c results in figs 2 and 3 together demonstrate that apsim was able to simulate crop water uptake and soil water dynamics from each soil layer as well as the total seasonal water uptake the predicted swc at depth 1 0 m suggest some water uptake in the 1000 1300 and 1300 1600 mm soil layer by wheat after the initial decrease in the swc sep 2013 there was little or no change with time these data suggest that there was no further water extraction from depth by the barley crop furthermore it shows no rewetting of the soil below 1000 mm 3 2 comparison of point and areal measurements of soil moisture and et comparison of swc measurements from point based methods of soil cores or tdr and those from crns cannot be made directly due to the variable measurement depth of crns reliable performance of the apsim model to simulate swc in different soil layers enabled us to calculate the depth weighted average swc franz et al 2012 in the crns measurement depth using the apsim simulated soil moisture and compared them with crns measurements the area averaged swc measured by crns ranged from 0 05 m3 m3 during the summer to maximum of 0 38 m3 m3 during the winter fig 4 a the depth of crns measurement varied from 30 dm when the soil was dry to 10 dm when the soil was wet in the experimental period fig 4b the average swc calculated from apsim simulated soil moisture within the crns measurement depth matched well to the crns measurements rsme 0 05 figs 4a 5 mcjannet et al 2014 and baztz et al 2015 report that hydrogen in the biomass leads to higher swc estimates however in our study biomass increased from zero to 200 g m 2 by the end july and increased rapidly during the spring fig 3 the contribution from biomass in this study is considered to be small and at maximum biomass the estimated biomass contribution was 0 3 mm consistent with mcjannet et al 2014 the good agreement between crns measurement and apsim simulations figs 5a 5 together with the good agreement between swc point measurements and apsim simulations fig 2 implies a general consistency between point soil cores tdr and areal measurements crns schrön et al 2017 showed that the crns probe has a variable foot print that changes with swc the area closer to the probe have greater influence especially in non homogenous land use system however in agricultural field as used at temora 30 ha the soil cropping system is considered to be homogenous and all area are considered to contribute equally to the crns footprint the deviation observed between the apsim predicted and crns swc are considered to be due to over prediction of the swc with apsim which was most noticeable during the summer fallow figs 4a 5 the areal measurements of et from the eddy covariance ec were also in good agreement with the et calculated from water balance and those simulated by apsim except for the wheat season the ec measurements did not start until 6 june 2013 the larger amount of infilling for the eddy covariance data before september 2013 fig 3c makes it questionable for the wheat season the better agreement with water balance for the fallow and barley seasons seem to indicate that the et from ec and water balance are consistent 3 3 crns measured soil water and crop water use due to the variable measurement depth of the crns the fraction of crop water uptake from the crns measurement ζ wuc wut varied from stage to stage and from year to year fig 6 for a given year the fraction decreased with crop development stage due to increasing root depth and consequent greater water uptake from deeper layers however in dry years rainfall later in the season increases soil water in shallow soil layers leading to increased water uptake in those layers thus an increase in ζ for different years the fraction of water uptake from the crns measurement layers decreases with increasing seasonal rainfall fig 6 simulation of the crop water uptake from the crns measurement depth and the total soil profile across a rainfall gradient is shown in fig 7 it is clear that the fraction water uptake decreases with annual seasonal rainfall both across sites and different types of year at one site fig 7 at the driest sites e g griffith and in the driest years the water uptake from crns layers accounted for up to 80 90 of the total water uptake fig 7b however in wet regions e g young and in wet years it only accounted for less than 40 of the total crop water uptake 4 discussion our results shows that swc dynamics measured using the point based methods of soil coring and tdr are consistent with those measured by the area based method of cosmic ray probe crns while soil coring with replicates provides soil samples for reliable measurements of soil moisture and other soil properties the continuous recording of tdr and crns enables better tracking of swc dynamics soil moisture change is a key driver for not only crop water uptake but also soil processes that control nutrient transformation availability and greenhouse gas n2o co2 emissions methods that provide high temporal resolution data tdr crns enable better validation of process based models like apsim for simulation of those soil processes and crop water uptake dynamics while the crns does not provide any information on changes in the water dynamic in individual soil layers combing point measurements such as tdr with the crns measurements enables better verification of model simulations of soil water dynamics ideally the continuous soil water measurements in the upper soil layers should be combined with continuous measurement in the deeper soil layers which can be achieved for example with the use of dielectric soil moisture probes e g http hussat wixsite com terrasonde soil moisture probes the cosmic ray probe provides continuous measurements of average swc over a large spatial area 28 ha due to the shallow and variable measurement depth 10 30 dm fig 4 question remained about the relevance of crns measured swc with regard to crop water use which has not been previously quantified our modelling results enabled quantification of this relevance and showed that the water uptake from crns layers accounted for up to 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year but less than 50 of the total crop water uptake in wet environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes in addition the crns provides high temporal resolution soil moisture data in the top soil layers where most of the nutrient n transformation processes occur and these are responsible for greenhouse gas n2o co2 emissions the consistency in et estimated from the water balance approach and those from the eddy covariance measurements further demonstrate the validity of both approaches the same as with the soil moisture measurements the high temporal resolution of et from eddy covariance help to better check the accuracy of apsim for simulation of the day to day variations of soil evaporation during fallow period and early stage of crop development and crop water uptake transpiration ep during the rapid growth stages of crops fig 3 our data tends to suggest the apsim ep is over predicted in the spring as compared to eddy covariance et the over prediction of et appears to be in transpiration which is consistent with the observation of wang et al 2004 that the apsim rue te approach predicts potential transpiration higher than potential et the et overprediction may also be related to inaccuracies in rooting depth and root water supply whilst there was some over prediction in ep during the spring the impact on simulated biomass and yield is small however data sets such as those presented here provide the opportunity to improve the model to respond to water limitations 5 conclusion the cosmic ray probe provides continuous measurements of average swc within a variable depth of 10 30 dm in the surface soil layer over a large spatial area range 5 28 ha water uptake of cereal crops wheat barley from crns layers accounted for 50 90 of the total water uptake in dry environments location year with annual rainfall 300 mm but only 30 50 of the total crop water uptake in wetter environments locations years this demonstrates a higher relevance of crns measurements in semi arid and arid regions where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and other ecological processes the high temporal resolution of swc data from crns can be assimilated with eddy covariance measurements and point measurements in field to better calibrate soil plant models and to more

while activity of malondialdehyde mda concentration in leaves significant rise and reached up to maximum 16 7 μmol g 1 fw value at maturity stage under conventional flat planting based on these results we conclude that the pm treatment with 430 mm simulated rainfall significantly increased the soil water storage adjusting antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves debasing lipid peroxidation and balance of hormones in the grains as a result improve maize productivity under semi arid regions of china keywords micro rainfall harvesting hormone antioxidative enzyme activities yield maize simulated rainfall 1 introduction maize zea mays l is the fundamental cereals crop in dry land farming system of northwest china and rainfall is the key source of water for corn productivity shao et al 2007 however rainfall in these areas does not match with the growth stages of maize crop limited and unpredictable rainfall lead to produce drought stress during different growth stages of corn as a result negatively affected corn productivity zhang et al 2007 hence the key to improving corn productivity is to maximize preservation and consumption of the soil moisture and to improve water use efficiency wue of corn crop ren et al 2008 previous studies showed that ridge furrow precipitation collecting technique has been used in semi arid regions of china to address the problems of water scarcity li and gong 2002 ridge covered with plastic mulch and furrow planting had significantly improved soil moisture increase soil temperature decrease soil evaporation and enhance wue of corn crop zhu et al 1988 previous research works showed that plastic and biodegradable mulch significantly increase grain yield which may be interrelated with soil moisture evaporation and fertility status of soil moraru and rusu 2010 however the antioxidant metabolism and hormonal changes are the fundamental to increase or decrease seed yield of corn crop while it is essential to find out whether and how ridge covered mulch materials under simulated precipitation conditions affects the antioxidant metabolism activities and biochemical mechanism of corn corp however no research work is available concerning the influence of various mulching materials under simulated precipitation levels on the antioxidant enzymes activities of corn crop and the essential biochemical mechanism maize yield in northwest china suffers during severe water deficiency which occurs during april to mid september leading to reduce the grain yield of corn crop adda et al 2005 hence it has become an important subject to elucidate the probable reactions and adjustment of corn crop under drought conditions pervious studies suggested that water deficiency can cause oxidative stress which leads to improved active oxygen species aos in plant cells as a result damaging the cellular permeability wang et al 2002 as a reaction plants develop antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat can be produced to remove those aos concentrations of o2 and h2o2 malondialdehyde mda concentration determine of lipid peroxidation is encourage to buildup of large aos under water deficiency condition dhanda et al 2004 the reaction mechanisms of reactive oxygen species ros to water stress are very complex thus this issue has not yet been understood clearly plant hormonal changes play a key role in the regulatory seed filling in cereals crop gao et al 2000 revealed that zeatin z and zeatin riboside zr indole 3 acetic acid iaa and abscisic acid aba all improve quickly during the early seed development stage of maize and then decrease slowly until mature higher aba and lower ethylene eth in corn seeds considerably correlated with maximum seed filling yang and zhang 2006 the iaa content was found to be maximum in superior seeds than in inferior seeds in the early seed filling stage of maize xu et al 2007 the gibberellic acid gas in corn seeds is also significantly associated with the seed filling rate yang et al 2001 previous research works have revealed that hormonal changes obviously influence corn seed filling process yet the association between hormonal changes in corn seeds and antioxidant enzymes activities induced by simulated rainfall levels with ridge covering mulch materials remains unclear many earlier research works have been showed that the top seeds of corn were more susceptible to drought than that of basal seeds gao and li 2005 ren et al 2008 confirmed that furrow planting and rainwater collection with ridge significantly improve grain yield at 340 mm rainfall level however non significant variation was indicated for maize yield between two planting models at 440 mm rainfall level in the present study various ridge covering mulch materials and different precipitation levels during the growth stage of maize were used and the hormonal changes in the grains during filling and antioxidant enzymes activities were measured the objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between the effect of various ridge covering mulch materials and different precipitation levels during the maize growth stage and to determine how the changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains and adjusting antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves of maize under plastic film mulching 2 materials and

at 10 cm increments using an 8 cm diameter hand auger an access tube made of seamless aluminum alloy was installed in the center of each experimental plot for soil moisture measurements soil moisture in 20 200 cm soil layers at 20 cm increments were estimated by tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany the evapotranspiration et was calculated on a seasonal basis by using the soil water balance equation as follows ren et al 2008 1 et p i c d r δw where p mm is the total precipitation i mm is the irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw mm is the soil moisture content for the depth range of 0 200 cm between sowing and harvesting in this experiment there is no irrigation so i in eq 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant over 200 cm depth 2 3

all the treatments 3 2 2 aba content corn seeds quickly improved the aba content in the early seed filling process and then gradually reduced as compared with inferior seeds aba content was significantly higher in the superior and middle seeds fig 5 aba in the superior seeds was considerably increased as compared inferior seeds from 3 to 30 days after silking ridge covered with plastic mulch affected significantly aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds under both precipitation levels at 320 430 mm precipitation levels pm treatment had considerably improved the aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds than that of ck treatment respectively however various ridge covering mulch materials had non significant effect on the aba in the superior middle and

discussion 4 1 grain hormonal changing responses to different cultivation systems a dry land farming system is highly dependent on precipitation amount and its distribution rainwater has an intense effect on maize yield in the semi arid areas ren et al 2008 regular water deficiency and drought are key factors to affected negatively hormonal changes in grain and antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves due to preventive rainfall water supply under different growth stages monneveux et al 2006 previous research works have indicated that rfrh system with plastic mulch improve soil moisture which enhance soil water storage and fertility status of soil as a result increased corn productivity in semi arid regions norton 2008 however lack of field study on how mulching materials under different precipitation conditions would influence on corn yield antioxidative enzyme activities and hormonal changes in this research work we find out the influence of various mulching under simulated precipitation conditions on yield antioxidative enzyme activities and hormonal changes and this study would have to fill up this research gaps a previous study suggests that soil moisture may have different effects on the filling of superior and inferior grains xu et al 2007 xu et al 2007 have suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior grains of rice compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture seed filling is significantly regulated by cytokinins ctks it has been reported that ctks in maize ear were significantly associated with grain development yang et al 2002 ctks are generally found maximum in the seeds of maize rice and wheat endosperm and may be necessary for cell partition during the early growth stage yang et al 2000 ctks and iaa contents also play a significant role in regulating seed filling process zhang et al 2009a the current research work showed that iaa and z zr in the maize seeds showed the similar pattern of changing during entire seed filling process the iaa and z zr in the superior seeds were significantly higher as compared with middle and inferior seeds the iaa and z zr in the pm320 bm320 and sc320 treatments achieved a highest value at 15 das for the superior middle and inferior seeds iaa and z zr contents in the ck320 treatment attained a highest value at 18 das for the superior and middle seeds and at 24 das for the inferior seeds at the 430 mm rainfall plastic mulch treatment considerably improved the iaa and z zr in the superior middle and inferior seeds at 3 27 days after sliking as compared with ck treatment after that had non significant difference was observed among all the treatments the ctks and auxin control cell division and developing of endosperm in maize seeds davies 1987 xu et al 2007 singh and gerung 1982 suggested that maximum iaa content in a sink organ can make an attractive power leading to increased ctks in seeds these results suggest that iaa and z zr may regulate maize grain filling in the early silking stage most likely via the manipulation of endosperm cell division thereby creating sink strength the iaa z zr eth and aba contents play key roles in regulated seed filling yang and zhang 2006 suggested that the higher aba concentration and lower eth concentration found in superior versus inferior wheat grains were associated with a higher filling rate in the superior grains the current research work also find a same result the aba in the corn seeds quickly improved in the early seed filling process and then gradually reduced the aba content in the superior and middle seeds was considerably increased as compared with inferior seeds fig 6 the aba in the superior seeds was considerably increased as compared inferior seeds from 3 to 30 days after silking at the 320 430 mm precipitation the pm treatment had considerably improved aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds than that of ck treatment respectively however various ridge covering mulch materials had non significant effect on aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 33 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively the eth evolution rate in superior middle and inferior seeds gradually decline with different seed filling stage fig 6 the eth evolution rate in the inferior seeds had considerably higher than that of middle and inferior seeds during the entire seed filling process plastic mulch treatment with 320 430 mm rainfall levels was significantly lower eth content than that of bm sc and ck treatments however the rf cultivation method under various mulching materials had non significant effects on the eth in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 39 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively yang and zhang 2006 showed that aba content enhances and eth content restrains maize seed filling process during rapid pod elongation in peas highest gas levels in the liquid endosperm eeuwens and schwabe 1975 have stated that a ga like material is at the highest level in the liquid endosperm of peas during rapid pod elongation relatively high levels of ga1 4 19 exist in the large panicles of rice just before and at anthesis kurogochi et al 1979 suzuki et al 1981 the current research the gas content was considerably increased in the inferior seeds as compared with in middle and inferior seeds ck320 treatment significantly improved the gas content in the inferior middle and superior seeds as compared with sc320 bm320 and pm320 treatments respectively at 430 mm rainfall level ck treatment also significantly improved the gas in inferior seeds as compared with middle and supper seeds these results indicate that aba promotes corn grain filling and that eth inhibits corn grain filling findings that are consistent with a previous study yang and zhang 2006 4 2 antioxidative enzyme activities responses to different mulching materials active oxygen species aos such as o2 and h2o2 trigger enhanced in plant cell under water deficit conditions which affected crop metabolism in a diversity ways such as cellular injure ge et al 2006 adaptations of crop under water scarcity conditions have been connected to retain a maximum level of antioxidant enzymes activities under water stress conditions fotelli et al 2002 therefore antioxidant enzymes activities and mda concentration determined the degree of injure occurred by water deficit crop mencon et al 1995 the sod cat and pod activities gradually increased from jointing stage to filling stage sharply decreased occurred from filling stage to maturity stage in all treatments tables 2 4 acevedo et al 2001 suggested that reduced level of cat activity is strongly associated with low yield of barley ping et al 2006 observed decline in the 1000 grain weight because of the decrease in cat activity and increase in tbars in wheat the sod cat and pod activities improved with raising the amount of simulated precipitation from 320 mm to 430 mm under plastic mulch and the peak values of sod cat and pod activities appeared in pm430 treatment at filling stage yu et al 1995 reported that the soluble protein content and sod activity of flag leaves in wheat decreased and the process of flag leaves senescence accelerated during the late stage of growth due to reducing irrigation water amount the mda concentration gradually increased from jointing stage to maturity stage in all treatments in maize leaves table 5 the mda concentration decreased with raising the amount of simulated rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under ck treatment the peak values of mda content appeared in ck320 treatment at maturity stage membrane damage caused by ros will produce mda thereby further damage however crops have developed advanced antioxidant defense systems in both enzymatic e g sod cat and pod and non enzymatic forms e g osmotic adjustment substances such as soluble sugar protein and free proline to reduce the o2 and h2o2 production thereby preventing membrane peroxidation farooq et al 2009 mda content in maize leaves was significantly increased under drought stress condition as compared with normal condition in agreement with other research works saneoka et al 2004 4 3 cultivation systems effect on soil water storage and maize production previous studies have suggested that rf system could improve the moisture temperature and the nutrients of soil and that the rf system is an effective way to increase water availability for crop yield blanco moure et al 2012 martinez et al 2011 moraru and rusu 2010 zhang et al 2011 the highest yield of corn is related to the balance of hormonal changes in grain and promoting antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves zhang et al 2009b suggested that balance of hormones in grain and promoting antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves significantly contribute to characteristics of ear as a result improved seed yield plastic mulch with 230 mm 340 mm and 440 mm precipitation levels might be enhance grain yield by 12 4 44 5 and 79 9 when precipitation level exceeded from 440 mm the grain yield decreased ren et al 2008 however the effect of rf system on grain yield is disputed some studies have indicated that rf system significantly increases grain yield chen et al 2011 tang et al 2011 whereas other studies have found that rf reduces rather than increases grain yield xie et al 2008 su et al 2007 our results also confirm that mulching materials under simulated precipitation conditions considerably enhanced soil water storage and grain yield these results indicated that pm430 treatment is an efficient farming strategy in semi arid regions due to significantly increased soil water storage antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves thereby balance hormonal changes in corn seeds and thus affected characteristics of ear as a result enhance maize productivity under semi arid regions 5 conclusions the current study clearly suggested that antioxidant enzyme activities and hormonal changes of maize are significantly related with mulching materials under simulated precipitation conditions iaa z zr and aba contents were significantly affected by pm430 treatment and decreased eth and gas contents in inferior seeds than that of ck treatment the rf cultivation under pm430 had considerably improved characteristics of ear antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves hormonal changes in seeds and reducing lipid peroxidation which led to improve grain yield than that of ck treatment the rf cultivation with pm430 treatment considerably improved the sod pod and cat activities with various growth stages of maize and attained a highest value at filling stage while activity of mda content in leaves significant decline and reached up to maximum value at maturity stage based on present research work we suggest that pm430 significantly increased soil water storage antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves thereby balance hormonal changes in corn seeds and thus affected characteristics of ear as a result enhance maize productivity under dry land farming system acknowledgments this work was supported by china support program in the 13th

11459,the objectives of this study was to investigate the effect of different ridges covered mulching materials on maize production under different simulated rainfall levels and the relationship with anti oxidant enzyme activities in leaves and hormonal changes in grains in the present study conventional flat cultivation ck was compared with several ridge covered mulching materials pm plastic film bm biodegradable film sc soil crust ridges under 320 mm and 430 mm simulated rainfall levels the results clearly indicated that the effect of ridge covering mulching materials on antioxidant enzyme activities and hormonal changes of maize were significantly related to precipitation levels at 430 mm rainfall level pm significantly promoted indole 3 acetic acid zeatin zeatin riboside and abscisic acid contents and decreased ethylene and gibberellic acid contents in superior middle and inferior seeds as compared with ck430 treatment at 430 mm rainfall level pm significantly increased soil water storage characteristics of ear antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves hormonal changes in seeds and reducing lipid peroxidation which led to increased 43 1 grain yield of maize than that of ck430 treatment at 430 mm rainfall level and ridges covered with plastic film significantly increased the activities of peroxidase 33 5 catalase 76 0 and superoxide dismutase 43 6 at grain filling stage while activity of malondialdehyde mda concentration in leaves significant rise and reached up to maximum 16 7 μmol g 1 fw value at maturity stage under conventional flat planting based on these results we conclude that the pm treatment with 430 mm simulated rainfall significantly increased the soil water storage adjusting antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves debasing lipid peroxidation and balance of hormones in the grains as a result improve maize productivity under semi arid regions of china keywords micro rainfall harvesting hormone antioxidative enzyme activities yield maize simulated rainfall 1 introduction maize zea mays l is the fundamental cereals crop in dry land farming system of northwest china and rainfall is the key source of water for corn productivity shao et al 2007 however rainfall in these areas does not match with the growth stages of maize crop limited and unpredictable rainfall lead to produce drought stress during different growth stages of corn as a result negatively affected corn productivity zhang et al 2007 hence the key to improving corn productivity is to maximize preservation and consumption of the soil moisture and to improve water use efficiency wue of corn crop ren et al 2008 previous studies showed that ridge furrow precipitation collecting technique has been used in semi arid regions of china to address the problems of water scarcity li and gong 2002 ridge covered with plastic mulch and furrow planting had significantly improved soil moisture increase soil temperature decrease soil evaporation and enhance wue of corn crop zhu et al 1988 previous research works showed that plastic and biodegradable mulch significantly increase grain yield which may be interrelated with soil moisture evaporation and fertility status of soil moraru and rusu 2010 however the antioxidant metabolism and hormonal changes are the fundamental to increase or decrease seed yield of corn crop while it is essential to find out whether and how ridge covered mulch materials under simulated precipitation conditions affects the antioxidant metabolism activities and biochemical mechanism of corn corp however no research work is available concerning the influence of various mulching materials under simulated precipitation levels on the antioxidant enzymes activities of corn crop and the essential biochemical mechanism maize yield in northwest china suffers during severe water deficiency which occurs during april to mid september leading to reduce the grain yield of corn crop adda et al 2005 hence it has become an important subject to elucidate the probable reactions and adjustment of corn crop under drought conditions pervious studies suggested that water deficiency can cause oxidative stress which leads to improved active oxygen species aos in plant cells as a result damaging the cellular permeability wang et al 2002 as a reaction plants develop antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat can be produced to remove those aos concentrations of o2 and h2o2 malondialdehyde mda concentration determine of lipid peroxidation is encourage to buildup of large aos under water deficiency condition dhanda et al 2004 the reaction mechanisms of reactive oxygen species ros to water stress are very complex thus this issue has not yet been understood clearly plant hormonal changes play a key role in the regulatory seed filling in cereals crop gao et al 2000 revealed that zeatin z and zeatin riboside zr indole 3 acetic acid iaa and abscisic acid aba all improve quickly during the early seed development stage of maize and then decrease slowly until mature higher aba and lower ethylene eth in corn seeds considerably correlated with maximum seed filling yang and zhang 2006 the iaa content was found to be maximum in superior seeds than in inferior seeds in the early seed filling stage of maize xu et al 2007 the gibberellic acid gas in corn seeds is also significantly associated with the seed filling rate yang et al 2001 previous research works have revealed that hormonal changes obviously influence corn seed filling process yet the association between hormonal changes in corn seeds and antioxidant enzymes activities induced by simulated rainfall levels with ridge covering mulch materials remains unclear many earlier research works have been showed that the top seeds of corn were more susceptible to drought than that of basal seeds gao and li 2005 ren et al 2008 confirmed that furrow planting and rainwater collection with ridge significantly improve grain yield at 340 mm rainfall level however non significant variation was indicated for maize yield between two planting models at 440 mm rainfall level in the present study various ridge covering mulch materials and different precipitation levels during the growth stage of maize were used and the hormonal changes in the grains during filling and antioxidant enzymes activities were measured the objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between the effect of various ridge covering mulch materials and different precipitation levels during the maize growth stage and to determine how the changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains and adjusting antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves of maize under plastic film mulching 2 materials and

mulch affected significantly aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds under both precipitation levels at 320 430 mm precipitation levels pm treatment had considerably improved the aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds than that of ck treatment respectively however various ridge covering mulch materials had non significant effect on the aba in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 33 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively 3 2 3 eth and gas contents the eth and gas in corn seeds indicated similar pattern during seed filling process the eth and gas in superior middle and inferior seeds gradually decline with different seed filling stage figs 6 and 7 the eth and gas in the inferior seeds was considerably increased as compared with in middle and inferior seeds during the entire seed filling stage ck320 treatment significantly improved the eth and gas contents in the inferior middle and superior seeds as compared with sc320 bm320 and pm320 treatments respectively at 430 mm precipitation ck treatment considerably improved the gas and eth in inferior seeds as compared with middle and supper seeds at the 320 430 mm rainfall levels pm treatment were significantly lower gas and eth contents than that of bm sc and ck treatments however the rf cultivation method under various mulching materials had non significant effects on the eth and gas contents in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 39 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively 3 3 antioxidant enzymes activities and mda content during 2014 2015 antioxidant enzymes activities and mda were affected significantly by ridge covering mulch materials under precipitation levels the sod activity in corn leaves rapidly increased from jointing stage to filling stage sharply decreased occurred from filling stage to maturity stage in all treatments table 2 the sod activity improved with raising the amount of rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under plastic mulch and the maximum values of sod activity appeared in pm430 treatment at filling stage of corn crop the two years average mean values of four growth stages shows that sod activity with pm430 pm320 bm430 bm320 sc430 and sc320 were significantly improved by 28 37 26 17 21 17 15 17 9 92 and 5 70 respectively than that of ck320 and ck430 treatments pod activity in corn leaves gradually increased from jointing stage to filling stage sharply decreased occurred from filling stage to maturity stage in all treatments table 3 the pod activity increased with raising the concentration of rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under plastic mulch and the peak values of pod activity appeared in pm430 treatment at filling stage the two years average mean values of four growth stages shows that pod activity with pm430 pm320 bm430 bm320 sc430 and sc320 were significantly improved by 66 14 59 82 51 68 48 71 26 31 and 26 23 respectively than that of ck320 and ck430 treatments cat activity gradually increased from jointing stage to filling stage after that sharply decreased occurred from filling stage to maturity stage in all treatments in maize leaves table 4 the cat activity increased with raising the amount of simulated rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under plastic mulch and the peak values of cat activity appeared in pm430 treatment at filling stage the two years average mean values of four growth stages shows that cat activity with pm430 pm320 bm430 bm320 sc430 and sc320 were significantly improved by 42 67 40 55 30 88 32 79 20 78 and 17 93 respectively than that of ck320 and ck430 treatments dissimilar to the change trend of sod pod and cat enzymes activities the mda content gradually increased from jointing stage to maturity stage in all treatments in maize leaves table 5 the mda content decreased with raising the amount of simulated rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under ck treatment the peak values of mda content appeared in ck320 treatment at maturity stage mad content sharply build up for both simulated rainfall levels under ck treatment respectively the maximum antioxidant enzymes activities were recorded where mad concentration was minimum for ridge covering plastic mulch under 430 mm rainfall level throughout maize growing season 3 4 yield and yield components mulching materials significantly affected yield and yield components of corn under simulated precipitation levels as compared with conventional flat sowing during 2014 2015 table 6 as compared with sc and ck ridge covered with pm and bm treatments significantly improved characteristics of ear such as kernels ear 1 ear diameter ear length grain weight ear 1 and thousand grain weight of maize grow under both simulated precipitation levels in 2014 the corn yield with pm430 pm320 bm430 bm320 sc320 and sc430 treatments were significantly improved by 31 32 27 25 26 67 21 93 15 42 and 11 85 respectively than that of ck320 and ck430 treatments in 2015 the grain yield with pm430 pm320 bm430 bm320 sc320 and sc430 were significantly improved by 28 89 27 61 23 63 23 90 18 52 and 10 27 as compared with ck320 and ck430 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 grain hormonal changing responses to different cultivation systems a dry land farming system is highly dependent on precipitation amount and its distribution rainwater has an intense effect on maize yield in the semi arid areas ren et al 2008 regular water deficiency and drought are key factors to affected negatively hormonal changes in grain and antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves due to preventive rainfall water supply under different growth stages monneveux et al 2006 previous research works have indicated that rfrh system with plastic mulch improve soil moisture which enhance soil water storage and fertility status of soil as a result increased corn productivity in semi arid regions norton 2008 however lack of field study on how mulching materials under different precipitation conditions would influence on corn yield antioxidative enzyme activities and hormonal changes in this research work we find out the influence of various mulching under simulated precipitation conditions on yield antioxidative enzyme activities and hormonal changes and this study would have to fill up this research gaps a previous study suggests that soil moisture may have different effects on the filling of superior and inferior grains xu et al 2007 xu et al 2007 have suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior grains of rice compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture seed filling is significantly regulated by cytokinins ctks it has been reported that ctks in maize ear were significantly associated with grain development yang et al 2002 ctks are generally found maximum in the seeds of maize rice and wheat endosperm and may be necessary for cell partition during the early growth stage yang et al 2000 ctks and iaa contents also play a significant role in regulating seed filling process zhang et al 2009a the current research work showed that iaa and z zr in the maize seeds showed the similar pattern of changing during entire seed filling process the iaa and z zr in the superior seeds were significantly higher as compared with middle and inferior seeds the iaa and z zr in the pm320 bm320 and sc320 treatments achieved a highest value at 15 das for the superior middle and inferior seeds iaa and z zr contents in the ck320 treatment attained a highest value at 18 das for the superior and middle seeds and at 24 das for the inferior seeds at the 430 mm rainfall plastic mulch treatment considerably improved the iaa and z zr in the superior middle and inferior seeds at 3 27 days after sliking as compared with ck treatment after that had non significant difference was observed among all the treatments the ctks and auxin control cell division and developing of endosperm in maize seeds davies 1987 xu et al 2007 singh and gerung 1982 suggested that maximum iaa content in a sink organ can make an attractive power leading to increased ctks in seeds these results suggest that iaa and z zr may regulate maize grain filling in the early silking stage most likely via the manipulation of endosperm cell division thereby creating sink strength the iaa z zr eth and aba contents play key roles in regulated seed filling yang and zhang 2006 suggested that the higher aba concentration and lower eth concentration found in superior versus inferior wheat grains were associated with a higher filling rate in the superior grains the current research work also find a same result the aba in the corn seeds quickly improved in the early seed filling process and then gradually reduced the aba content in the superior and middle seeds was considerably increased as compared with inferior seeds fig 6 the aba in the superior seeds was considerably increased as compared inferior seeds from 3 to 30 days after silking at the 320 430 mm precipitation the pm treatment had considerably improved aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds than that of ck treatment respectively however various ridge covering mulch materials had non significant effect on aba content in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 33 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively the eth evolution rate in superior middle and inferior seeds gradually decline with different seed filling stage fig 6 the eth evolution rate in the inferior seeds had considerably higher than that of middle and inferior seeds during the entire seed filling process plastic mulch treatment with 320 430 mm rainfall levels was significantly lower eth content than that of bm sc and ck treatments however the rf cultivation method under various mulching materials had non significant effects on the eth in the superior middle and inferior seeds from 39 to 42 days after silking under both simulated rainfall levels respectively yang and zhang 2006 showed that aba content enhances and eth content restrains maize seed filling process during rapid pod elongation in peas highest gas levels in the liquid endosperm eeuwens and schwabe 1975 have stated that a ga like material is at the highest level in the liquid endosperm of peas during rapid pod elongation relatively high levels of ga1 4 19 exist in the large panicles of rice just before and at anthesis kurogochi et al 1979 suzuki et al 1981 the current research the gas content was considerably increased in the inferior seeds as compared with in middle and inferior seeds ck320 treatment significantly improved the gas content in the inferior middle and superior seeds as compared with sc320 bm320 and pm320 treatments respectively at 430 mm rainfall level ck treatment also significantly improved the gas in inferior seeds as compared with middle and supper seeds these results indicate that aba promotes corn grain filling and that eth inhibits corn grain filling findings that are consistent with a previous study yang and zhang 2006 4 2 antioxidative enzyme activities responses to different mulching materials active oxygen species aos such as o2 and h2o2 trigger enhanced in plant cell under water deficit conditions which affected crop metabolism in a diversity ways such as cellular injure ge et al 2006 adaptations of crop under water scarcity conditions have been connected to retain a maximum level of antioxidant enzymes activities under water stress conditions fotelli et al 2002 therefore antioxidant enzymes activities and mda concentration determined the degree of injure occurred by water deficit crop mencon et al 1995 the sod cat and pod activities gradually increased from jointing stage to filling stage sharply decreased occurred from filling stage to maturity stage in all treatments tables 2 4 acevedo et al 2001 suggested that reduced level of cat activity is strongly associated with low yield of barley ping et al 2006 observed decline in the 1000 grain weight because of the decrease in cat activity and increase in tbars in wheat the sod cat and pod activities improved with raising the amount of simulated precipitation from 320 mm to 430 mm under plastic mulch and the peak values of sod cat and pod activities appeared in pm430 treatment at filling stage yu et al 1995 reported that the soluble protein content and sod activity of flag leaves in wheat decreased and the process of flag leaves senescence accelerated during the late stage of growth due to reducing irrigation water amount the mda concentration gradually increased from jointing stage to maturity stage in all treatments in maize leaves table 5 the mda concentration decreased with raising the amount of simulated rainfall from 320 mm to 430 mm under ck treatment the peak values of mda content appeared in ck320 treatment at maturity stage membrane damage caused by ros will produce mda thereby further damage however crops have developed advanced antioxidant defense systems in both enzymatic e g sod cat and pod and non enzymatic forms e g osmotic adjustment substances such as soluble sugar protein and free proline to reduce the o2 and h2o2 production thereby preventing membrane peroxidation farooq et al 2009 mda content in maize leaves was significantly increased under drought stress condition as compared with normal condition in agreement with other research works saneoka et al 2004 4 3 cultivation systems effect on soil water storage and maize production previous studies have suggested that rf system could improve the moisture temperature and the nutrients of soil and that the rf system is an effective way to increase water availability for crop yield blanco moure et al 2012 martinez et al 2011 moraru and rusu 2010 zhang et al 2011 the highest yield of corn is related to the balance of hormonal changes in grain and promoting antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves zhang et al 2009b suggested that balance of hormones in grain and promoting antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves significantly contribute to characteristics of ear as a result improved seed yield plastic mulch with 230 mm 340 mm and 440 mm precipitation levels might be enhance grain yield by 12 4 44 5 and 79 9 when precipitation level exceeded from 440 mm the grain yield decreased ren et al 2008 however the effect of rf system on grain yield is disputed some studies have indicated that rf system significantly increases grain yield chen et al 2011 tang et al 2011 whereas other studies have found that rf reduces rather than increases grain yield xie et al 2008 su et al 2007 our results also confirm that mulching materials under simulated precipitation conditions considerably enhanced soil water storage and grain yield these results indicated that pm430 treatment is an efficient farming strategy in semi arid regions due to significantly increased soil water storage antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves thereby balance hormonal changes in corn seeds and thus affected characteristics of ear as a result enhance maize productivity under semi arid regions 5 conclusions the current study clearly suggested that antioxidant enzyme activities and hormonal changes of maize are significantly related with mulching materials under simulated precipitation conditions iaa z zr and aba contents were significantly affected by pm430 treatment and decreased eth and gas contents in inferior seeds than that of ck treatment the rf cultivation under pm430 had considerably improved characteristics of ear antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves hormonal changes in seeds and reducing lipid peroxidation which led to improve grain yield than that of ck treatment the rf cultivation with pm430 treatment considerably improved the sod pod and cat activities with various growth stages of maize and attained a highest value at filling stage while activity of mda content in leaves significant decline and reached up to maximum value at maturity stage based on present research work we suggest that pm430 significantly increased soil water storage antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves thereby balance hormonal changes in corn seeds and thus affected characteristics of ear as a result enhance maize productivity under dry land farming system acknowledgments this work was supported by china support program in the 13th
