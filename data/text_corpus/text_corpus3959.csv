19795,emission models are useful tools for the study and management of atmospheric emissions from passive liquid surfaces in wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are potential sources of odour nuisance and other environmental impacts in this work different theoretical and empirical models for the gas side k g and liquid side k l mass transfer coefficients in passive surfaces in wwtps were critically reviewed and evaluated against experimental data wind forcing and the development of the wind wave field especially the occurrence of microscale wave breaking were identified as the most important physical factors affecting mass transfer in these situations two approaches performed well in describing the available data for k g for water vapour one is an empirical correlation whilst the other consists of theoretical models based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate we also fit to the experimental data set a new alternate equation for k g whose performance was comparable to existing ones however these three approaches do not agree with each other in the whole range of schmidt numbers typical for compounds found in emissions from wwtps as to k l no model was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set excluding two suspected biased sources the water9 us epa 1994 air emission models for waste and wastewater north carolina usa epa 453 r 94 080a approach produced the best results among the most commonly used k l models although still with considerably high relative errors for this same sub set we propose a new alternate approach for estimating k l which resulted in improved performance particularly for longer fetches two main gaps were found in the literature the understanding of the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer over liquid surfaces and the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m

wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may cause nuisance to the exposed communities capelli et al 2009b nicell 2009 lebrero et al 2011 hayes et al 2014 other potential environmental impacts of emissions from wwtps are exposure to harmful substances cheng et al 2008 yang et al 2012 godoi et al 2017 and greenhouse effect daelman et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 the classification as passive indicates the absence of an active gas flow such as active aeration or intense bubbling across the surface vdi 3475 bl 1 2000 gostelow et al 2003 bockreis and steinberg 2005 capelli et al 2009b examples of passive surfaces normally encountered in wwtps are primary and secondary settlement tanks non aerated sequencing batch reactors and stabilization ponds it is important to notice that passive surfaces are not undisturbed surfaces since the wind is likely to promote shear at the water surface and generate waves which in turn can undergo processes of micro and macroscale breaking accurately quantifying the emission rate of specific compounds or odours in general from these surfaces is a critical step for environmental impact assessments including the use of dispersion modelling and for verifying compliance with regulations nicell 2009 capelli et al 2013 schauberger et al 2013 2016 brancher et al 2017 furthermore understanding the behaviour of emissions is important for implementing control initiatives as in the example reported by beghi et al 2012b the emission rate of compounds at passive liquid surfaces can be estimated by the use of one of the following methods gostelow et al 2001 2003 hudson and ayoko 2008a b predictive emission models reverse dispersion modelling indirect method and sampling with enclosure devices such as a flux hood or a wind tunnel direct method if the samples are analysed by dynamic olfactometry the direct and indirect methods can also provide the odour emission rate in odour units per unit time which may be required for regulatory purposes for a simple and rough estimate of the overall odour emission rate odour emission factors capelli et al 2009b are also an option each of the approaches above presents particular advantages and limitations emission models have been widely applied in the estimation of atmospheric emissions from wwtps atasoy et al 2004 blunden et al 2008 cheng et al 2008 ro et al 2008 rumburg et al 2008 santos et al 2009 beghi et al 2012a yang et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 and other types of surface impoundments containing liquid wastes e g rotz et al 2014 karunarathne et al 2017 and can be used for estimating emission rates for environmental impact assessment before building a specific wwtp santos et al 2009 nevertheless this approach still has to be fully consolidated as clearly indicated for instance by ferro and pincince 1996a 1996b gostelow et al 2001 blunden et al 2008 beghi et al 2012a and santos et al 2012 in this sense understanding the physical processes underpinning the liquid air mass transfer of pollutants at passive liquid surfaces is essential not only for the management of the environmental impacts associated with atmospheric emissions from these sources but also for the evaluation and improvement of predictive emission models the overall model for liquid gas mass transfer equation sm6 section i of supplementary material is relatively straightforward based on the two resistance hypothesis and the concepts of liquid side or liquid film and gas side or gas film mass transfer coefficients k l and k g respectively the definition of the mass transfer coefficients and the derivation of the two resistance formulation for liquid gas mass transfer are presented in section i of supplementary material nonetheless the challenge resides in having accurate prediction of k l and k g to date neither a theoretical nor an experimental model for the mass transfer coefficients has been fully established some theoretical models are physically sound but their application to the field situation is rather restricted on the other hand empirical correlations e g mackay and yeun 1983 springer et al 1984 gostelow et al 2001 were not validated against experimental data other than the data from which they were derived and their relation with the theoretical background is not clearly drawn therefore this paper analyses the theoretical and empirical description of liquid gas mass transfer processes at passive liquid surfaces in terms of the gas film and liquid film mass transfer coefficients focusing on the relevant aspects for the study of atmospheric emissions from wwtps and similar facilities the different models are tested against a compilation of experimental data and new alternate approaches are proposed where appropriate 2 the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g in the presence of surface disturbances due to wind shear 2 1 theoretical models and empirical correlations for k g 2 1 1 models based on the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate approached by wind with uniform velocity profile is a classical situation which serves as base for the general study of boundary layers see schlichting 1968 in the laminar case analytic solutions exist in the turbulent case semi empirical parametrisations for the mass transfer coefficient in the air side boundary layer have been established among those thibodeaux and scott 1985 citing sherwood and pigford 1952 and sherwood et al 1975 support equation 1 and equation 2 for the laminar and turbulent boundary layers respectively 1 k g 0 644 d g x r e x 1 2 s c g 1 3 and 2 k g 0 036 d g x r e x 4 5 s c g 1 3 where x is the length of the plate m the wind fetch in this case r e x x u 0 ν g is the fetch reynolds number with u 0 the velocity m s 1 of the approaching uniform flow or the free stream velocity and ν g the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 of the air gas phase s c g ν g d g denotes the schmidt number of the compound in the air gas phase thibodeaux and scott 1985 highlight that equation 1 was experimentally verified in aerodynamic wind tunnels for r e x between 8000 and 20000 and equation 2 for r e x ranging from 20000 to 300000 it is important to notice that the average k g along the length of the boundary layer is evaluated if equations 1 and 2 are used not the local k g equation 1 is obtained for a laminar boundary layer with velocity profiles described by the classical solution of blasius see for instance schetz 1984 laminar boundary layers are likely to occur inside some portable wind tunnels used for direct sampling of emissions bliss et al 1995 capelli et al 2009a prata et al 2014 however they are not an appropriate model for the atmospheric boundary layer which is typically turbulent seinfeld 1986 jacobson 1999 regarding equation 2 although representing a turbulent boundary layer two main critical points prevent its application for modelling k g over passive liquid surfaces in wwtps and other environmental situations i the approaching flow in such cases does not normally have a uniform velocity distribution a condition for which equation 2 was developed so that the free stream velocity u 0 cannot be rigorously defined and ii the flow over passive liquid surfaces in the field does not necessarily resemble the flow over a smooth plate since waves generated by the wind may induce an effective roughness in the air flow prata et al 2017 2 1 2 model based on taylor s statistical theory and a power law wind velocity profile sutton 1953 sutton 1953 discusses the case of a compound evaporating from a smooth rectangular surface with finite length x in the direction of the wind and virtually infinite width in the cross wind direction in the analysed case the difference c g i c g is taken as constant over the whole surface with c g determined far from the surface so it has the same value as in the air upwind the emitting surface also the mean wind velocity profile over the surface was assumed to be satisfactorily approximated by a power law as u z u z z z m where u z is the wind velocity m s 1 at any given height z m u z is the wind velocity measured at a reference height z and m is the exponent that fits the approximate profile using taylor 1922 1932 1935 statistical theory and making additional assumptions sutton arrived at an analytical solution for the concentration field above the surface taking into account advection effects in the wind direction which in turn gives an expression for the evaporation rate per unit of cross wind length kg s 1 m 1 that is equivalent to a boundary layer mass transfer coefficient as in equation 3a 3a k g a u z 2 n 2 n x n 2 n where a is a constant dependent on the reference height z and the kinematic viscosity of air n related to m as m n 2 n is an exponent used by sutton to parametrise the correlation coefficient between turbulent velocity fluctuations in the context of taylor s statistical theory for a wind profile with exponent m 1 7 corresponding to n 1 4 which is the profile normally attributed to the turbulent flow over a smooth plate sutton 1953 equation 3a can be written as equation 3b 3b k g a u z 0 78 x 0 11 one of the major drawbacks of sutton s model is that the molecular diffusivity of the compound which is particularly relevant for the transport in the viscous sublayer adjacent to the smooth surface is not explicitly taken into account one can attempt to incorporate the molecular diffusivity if the constant a is adjusted experimentally as done for example by mackay and matsugu 1973 see item 2 1 7 another limitation is that the model is not suitable for the flow over passive liquid surfaces with aerodynamic roughness which may be the case if waves are present in wwtps prata et al 2017 2 1 3 model based on the assumption that the interfacial sublayer is controlled by renewal mechanisms brutsaert 1975 brutsaert 1975 derived a model for calculating the air side mass and heat transfer over flat surfaces above which a steady state turbulent two dimensional wind boundary layer is present concentration gradients in the along wind direction are neglected thus neglecting any advection effects except the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction meaning that the model may not be suitable to describe the very beginning of the concentration boundary layer at the upwind end of the emitting surface where the boundary layer thickness and the concentration values change significantly in the wind direction the model was constructed based on the idea supported by experimental observations cited by brutsaert 1975 that the mass transfer in the region very close to the surface called interfacial sublayer in the original paper in the case of an aerodynamically smooth surface this comprises the viscous and buffer sublayers of the inner boundary layer of the turbulent flow is controlled by renewal mechanisms which in turn are imposed by turbulent eddies coming from the fully turbulent dynamic sublayer log sublayer immediately above the interfacial sublayer see fig 1 the average renewal frequency was assumed to be proportional to the frequency of the turbulent eddies at the kolmogorov s scale frequency scale given by f ε ν 1 2 being ε the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy units m2 s 3 calculated at the height z s corresponding to the bottom of the dynamic sublayer the boundary between the dynamic and interfacial sublayers see fig 1 for the dynamic sublayer with logarithmic velocity profile ε u 3 κ z where u is the friction velocity m s 1 and κ is the von kárman constant using this expression taking z s 30 ν u considered by brutsaert as the limit of the interfacial sublayer considering a linear velocity profile in the viscous sublayer and making some additional assumptions about the behaviour of the renewing eddies brutsaert 1975 derived the following result equation 4 for the mass transfer coefficient over a smooth flat surface 4 k g s c s u s c g 2 3 where c s is a dimensionless constant to be determined experimentally based on a compilation of experimental results brutsaert 1975 suggests c s 1 13 6 it is important to highlight that equation 4 gives the coefficient for the mass transfer between the interface concentration c g i and the height z s in this case z s 30 ν u to denote this the superscript s was included in the representation of the mass transfer coefficient k g s if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the resistance to mass transfer between the heights z s and z m has to be included discussed in 2 1 5 brutsaert 1975 also presented a model for rough surfaces however as he mentioned in the original paper this model seems not to be completely appropriate for the mass transfer over waves and therefore will not be covered in the present analysis 2 1 4 model based on the reichardt s parametrisation for the effective diffusivity in the viscous and buffer sublayers deacon 1977 similarly to brutsaert 1975 deacon 1977 treats the case of mass or heat transfer over a smooth flat surface in contact with a steady state turbulent two dimensional wind boundary layer also neglecting concentration gradients in the along wind direction hence the same restriction applies the model may not be suitable for the initial stages of the concentration boundary layer at the upwind end of the emitting surface deacon s derivation however is based on the reichardt 1951 parametrisation for the effective diffusivity d e f f the sum of the molecular and eddy diffusivities along the viscous and buffer sublayers of the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate which is given by d e f f d 1 κ s c ζ l z ζ l tanh z ζ l where z u z ν and ζ l is a constant deacon adopts the value ζ l 11 7 for κ 0 41 the resistance to mass transfer r s between the surface and a height z s just slightly above the border of the buffer sublayer is then computed as equation 5a 5a r s 1 k g s 0 z s 1 d e f f d z deacon 1977 numerically computed the integral in equation 5a for z s 50 ν u and proposes an approximation that for 0 6 s c g 10 which is the typical range of s c g for chemicals and also heat in air can be rewritten in terms of k g s as equation 5b below 5b k g s 1 15 2 u s c g 0 61 similarly to what was said about brutsaert 1975 formulation the mass transfer coefficient calculated by equation 5b accounts for the mass transfer between the surface and the height z s 50 ν u that is reason for the superscript s in k g s again if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the resistance to mass transfer between the heights z s and z m has to be included as discussed next 2 1 5 2 1 5 computing the total resistance to mass transfer in the gas phase as mentioned before both brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 formulations equations 4 and 5b respectively calculate the coefficient for mass transfer between the surface concentration c g i and a height z s at the bottom of the dynamic log sublayer where the log sublayer encounters the buffer sublayer see fig 1 taken as z s 30 ν u by brutsaert and z s 50 ν u by deacon if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g has to account for the total resistance to mass transfer between the surface z 0 and z m so equation sm2a can be properly applied the procedure to do so following described is contained in both the works of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 the total resistance to mass transfer in the gas phase between z 0 and z m r g 1 k g can be calculated as the association in series between two resistances as shown in equation 6 the resistance r s 1 k g s between z 0 and z s and the resistance r m between z s and z m 6 r g 1 k g r s r m following the notation adopted here k g s is given by equation 4 if brutsaert s formulation is used and by equation 5b if deacon s formulation is used the resistance r m can be calculated with ease if the measurement height z m is within the fully turbulent log sublayer in this sublayer the molecular diffusivity can be neglected compared to the turbulent diffusivity thus the effective diffusivity can be approximated as d e f f s c t 1 κ u z where s c t is the turbulent schmidt number and the resistance r m is given by equation 7 7 r m z s z m 1 d e f f d z s c t 1 κ u ln z m z s fig 2 shows a comparison of k g calculated for water vapour s c g 0 61 in air at 25 c s c t taken as 1 for the moment using equations 6 and 7 together with brutsaert s fig 2a and deacon s fig 2b k g s formulations for various u and considering different measurement heights z m as expected k g decreases as z m increases since the resistance r m becomes larger it is important to observe that the k g calculated for the same z m using either brutsaert s or deacon s formulations are very similar generally with difference of order 1 or less it is remarkable that these formulations derived through different paths arrive at practically equivalent results it can also be noted that although the curves corresponding to z m other than z s are not precisely linear they can be fairly approximated by a straight line the fact that k g significantly changes with the reference height z m is critical for the proper determination and use of k g formulations otherwise unrealistic resistances would be incorporated if an actual measurement of c g is performed it is imperative that the measurement height z m is within the dynamic sublayer and also within the limits of the concentration boundary layer on the other hand if c g is approximated by the background concentration upwind the emitting surface then z m has to coincide with or be sufficiently close to the top limit of the concentration boundary layer 2 1 6 effect of waves on k g waves on liquid surfaces can affect the dynamics of mass transfer in the air boundary layer by i increasing turbulent transport which means increasing u in the dynamic sublayer due to the form drag arising from resonant wind wave interactions wave induced stress and air flow separation at breaking waves janssen 2004 caulliez et al 2008 kudryavtsev et al 2014 kudryavtsev and chapron 2016 ii modifying the profile of wind velocity and eddy diffusivity in the proximity of a wavy liquid surface due to the wind induced stresses and air flow separation kudryavtsev et al 2014 iii generating separation bubbles downwind the air flow separation detachment point at breaking waves the increase in turbulent transport listed above as process i is automatically taken into account for the modelling of k g if u is measured directly or if an appropriate parametrisation for u i e one that satisfactorily incorporates the changes in u due to the wind wave dynamics is adopted for further discussion on u parametrisations applied to emission modelling in wwtps refer to prata et al 2017 a modified wind velocity profile and the existence of separation bubbles listed above respectively as processes ii and iii are much more difficult to describe and to include in a simple theoretical model for liquid gas mass transfer a remarkable work was performed by kudryavtsev et al 2014 who applied a wind over waves coupling model to calculate the heat transfer which is analogous to mass transfer over sea waves those authors estimated the turbulent fluxes in the air boundary layer by solving a coupled system of conservation equations for momentum in the air side and wave energy in the liquid side using parametrisations for wave induced and air flow separation stresses wave breaking and non linear wave wave interactions among others they show that in the region directly influenced by the waves wind velocity and temperature profiles deviate to some extend from the classical log linear profile moreover their results suggest that k g can be expected to generally increase with the wind speed due to the increase of u but not at the same rate as u which is explained by the sheltering effect due to the wave induced stress and the air flow separation however since some of the parametrisations adopted by kudryavtsev et al 2014 are based on oceanic data and they do not take into account air flow separation arising from the breaking of small scale gravity waves their results cannot be directly extrapolated to the mass transfer in relatively small liquid surfaces such as wwtps for which a much less developed wind wave field can be expected prata et al 2017 the application of wind over waves coupled models to wwtps is theoretically possible although not practical and lacking of preliminary data as briefly discussed in prata et al 2017 thus the exact extent to which k g at passive liquid surfaces in wwtps is influenced by processes ii and iii is presently not clear and these remain as open matters for investigation nonetheless experimental work on the air flow above short gravity waves available in the literature can shed some light on possible effects of process iii before further developing this discussion it is convenient to recall the two classes into which wave breaking events are usually divided namely macroscale and microscale breaking macroscale breaking refers to the breaking events that manifest as plunging or intense spilling at the breaking front generally accompanied by significant air entrainment which leads to the typical whitecaps banner and phillips 1974 caulliez et al 2008 reul et al 2008 kudryavtsev et al 2014 microscale breaking or microbreaking corresponds to the breaking of very short gravity waves wave lengths typically ranging from 0 05 to 0 3 m with none or almost negligible air entrainment normally parasitic capillary waves are generated in this process and travel at a similar speed as the breaking crest banner and phillips 1974 peirson and banner 2003 siddiqui and loewen 2007 air flow separation can certainly be expected to occur wherever macroscale breaking is present due to the abrupt surface disruptions kudryavtsev et al 2014 however in the context of liquid surfaces in wwtps where short fetches and low to moderate wind conditions commonly occur macroscale breaking events are likely to be inexistent or very sparse caulliez et al 2008 observed that the first signs of sporadic air entrainment appeared at wind speeds referenced at 10 m height of 10 9 5 and 8 m s 1 for fetches of 10 13 and 26 m respectively rhee et al 2007 estimated that the rate of macroscale breaking is less than 3 for friction velocities up to 0 6 m s 1 along a tank with total length of 40 m it is important to note that this rate may increase for longer fetches and higher wind speeds microscale breaking waves on the other hand are widely observed at low to moderate wind speeds even for short fetches banner and phillips 1974 kawamura and toba 1988 peirson and banner 2003 siddiqui and loewen 2007 air flow separation from the crests of very short gravity waves has been verified experimentally kawai 1981 1982 kawamura and toba 1988 reul et al 2008 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 although some of these studies kawai 1981 1982 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 do not report if the waves were undergoing microscale breaking there is a high probability that most of the observed separation events occurred over microscale breaking crests taking into consideration images of the flow presented in the papers and also indications by other authors who worked under similar conditions kawamura and toba 1988 peirson and banner 2003 reul et al 2008 the occurrence of air flow separation over short gravity waves appears to be dependent mainly on the local slope at the wave crests a local surface slope i e the local gradient of the surface of 0 6 or greater at the leeward face of the wave crest is identified as a sufficient condition for air flow to separate kawai 1982 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b in the context of their experiment shaikh and siddiqui 2011b argued that the air flow separation observed over waves with smaller gradient was remnant from an earlier stage at which the slope was equal or greater than 0 6 and triggered the separation they also report that no separation was verified for slopes less than 0 4 reul et al 2008 explain that the large surface slope at the leeward side of the crests produces a large adverse pressure gradient which leads to air flow separation waves from which the air flow separates are also normally higher than the ones without separation kawai 1982 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b as for the frequency at which this process happens it varies greatly and depends on fetch and wind conditions both of which certainly influence the maximum slope of the wave crests for example kawai 1982 registered 47 separation events in a total of 79 wave crests examined 59 for u 0 46 m s 1 and fetch 3 7 m at a fetch of 2 1 m the results of shaikh and siddiqui 2011b show air flow separation frequencies of 24 and 64 this includes the remnant separation bubbles downwind crests with steepness less than 0 6 for corresponding u values extracted from shaikh and siddiqui 2011a of 0 149 and 0 175 m s 1 respectively buckley and veron 2016 report that less than 20 of the waves presented associated air flow separation for u 0 167 m s 1 and fetch 22 7 m equivalent 10 m wind speed of 5 m s 1 investigations using particle image velocimetry piv reveal important features of the air flow within the separation bubbles downwind the crest of short gravity waves generally the separation bubble develops as a recirculation region but not as a complete dead zone with reversed flow in relation to the wave form and often a mildly complex pattern of eddies kawai 1982 veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 flow velocities and vorticity are extremely reduced close to the water surface veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 as are the near surface shear stress veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 and the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy shaikh and siddiqui 2011b these particular aspects of the flow can be expected to drastically decrease mass transfer in the boundary layer at the air side of the water surface covered by separation bubbles it is important to remember however that the separation bubble does not extend along the whole wave form flow reattachment takes place at some point downwind the wave crest from which the flow detached before the next wave crest the location of the reattachment point is highly variable and probably depends on the wind speed the geometrical characteristics of the wave and the stage of the wave breaking kawai 1982 kawamura and toba 1988 reul et al 2008 in their study of mechanically generated waves swept by wind reul et al 2008 report in their fig 12 extents of separation bubble ranging approximately from 10 to 60 of the wave form for the cases concerning microscale breaking adding this to the fact that only a fraction of the short gravity waves present separation bubbles as discussed in the previous paragraph one can expect that in many cases the majority of the water surface will correspond to regions without air flow separation in the non separated boundary layer and in the boundary layer re established downwind the reattachment point the mean flow presents many of the characteristics of a typical turbulent flow over a flat plate but following the wave form except for some distortions and increased shear stress resulting from the wave influence kawai 1982 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b therefore in the context of the passive liquid surfaces in wwtps the significance of air flow separation for the gas film mass transfer coefficient averaged throughout the whole surface will depend on how much of the surface is covered by separation bubbles and how much the increase in the shear stress outside the separation regions is able to balance the reduction of mass transfer inside the bubbles 2 1 7 empirical correlations for k g different empirical correlations fitted to experimental mass transfers results have been proposed by several authors with the aim of estimating the gas film mass transfer coefficient over liquid surfaces the present analysis focuses on the empirical k g correlations that are most widely used in the context of emission modelling for wwtps the expression proposed by mackay and matsugu 1973 which is the one incorporated in the us epa endorsed emission model water9 the equation by mackay and yeun 1983 adopted by the model toxchem enviromega 2003 and the correlation used by gostelow et al 2001 in their emission model the corresponding expressions are presented in table 1 which also summarizes relevant auxiliary information in all three cases the k g calculated by the correlations corresponds to the mean value averaged along the whole water surface fetch averaged k g mackay and matsugu 1973 mackay and matsugu 1973 adopted the general theoretical form proposed by sutton 1953 equation 3b discussed previously item 2 1 2 incorporating the factor s c g 0 67 in order to account for the compounds molecular diffusivity in this case the constant a had to be adjusted experimentally which was done by using cumene evaporation data obtained in small pools 1 2 1 2 m and 1 2 2 4 m placed outdoors the wind speed was not measured on site but taken from a nearby meteorological station the authors did not report the range of wind speeds occurring during the experiments the final equation equation 8 is shown in table 1 with the constant converted to be consistent with input variables in si units as suggested by us epa 1994 it is important to mention that mackay and matsugu 1973 adjusted equation 8 using the effective diameter the diameter of a circular pool with the same area as the experimental surface as the fetch parameter x this is also the approach followed by the water9 model us epa 1994 2001 however as explained in item 2 1 2 sutton s 1953 model was derived considering x as the actual physical fetch i e the length across the surface in the direction of the wind the use of the effective diameter instead of the physical fetch introduces systematic deviations in the calculation of k g especially for large length to width ratios which is generally the case of laboratory wind wave tanks as discussed by prata et al 2016 therefore in the present paper x will be always taken as the length of the tank in the direction of the wind mackay and yeun 1983 mackay and yeun 1983 carried out mass transfer experiments in a wind wave tank with fetch 6 m by varying the wind speed in the wind tunnel they obtained friction velocities in the range 0 271 0 993 m s 1 corresponding to u 10 in the range 8 36 23 11 m s 1 calculated based on u and roughness length data reported in their paper water evaporation rate was measured by knowing the volume of water spent to keep a constant water level in the tank using a chicken feeder system from this the k g for water was calculated the mass transfer coefficients for several volatile organic compounds vocs were determined from the decaying of their concentration in the liquid phase correlations for k g and k l in the form of linear functions of u were adjusted to the mass transfer coefficients obtained experimentally normalised by powers of the schmidt number s c g 0 67 and s c l 1 2 respectively intercepts of 1 10 3 and 1 10 6 were introduced in the expressions for k g and k l in order to account for an still air mass transfer coefficient i e the mass transfer coefficient when there is no wind by doing so they arrived at equation 9 for k g mackay and yeun 1983 correlation for k l will be discussed later in this paper item 3 1 3 gostelow et al 2001 the approach applied by gostelow et al 2001 to develop their k g correlation is explained in detail by gostelow 2002 these authors compiled a data set regarding u and k g for water vapour comprising the results reported by three distinct sources liss 1973 mackay and yeun 1983 and ocampo torres et al 1994 overall the data set used by gostelow et al 2001 covered a range of fetches from 4 5 to 32 2 m and u from 0 039 to 0 993 m s 1 equivalent to u 10 from 1 0 to 24 5 m s 1 these authors were able to adjust a straight line to the data set with k g normalised by s c g 0 67 obtaining equation 10 2 2 comparison among models and against an experimental data set the aim of this item is to compare the results produced by different approaches presented in items 2 1 and 2 2 evaluating them against relevant experimental data and conditions with this purpose we compiled a data set of gas phase controlled mass transfer results as well documented in supplementary material item ii 1 as discussed in item ii 1 of supplementary material the data from mackay and yeun 1983 at large u markedly departs from the rest of the data set figure sm2 and the possibility of a significant experimental bias cannot be ruled out especially considering the chicken feeder apparatus used to quantify the evaporation rates therefore in the following analysis the different approaches for estimating k g will be evaluated against the whole data set and against the data set without mackay and yeun 1983 results it is important to mention that equations 1 and 2 were not included in the analysis because given the reasons discussed in item 2 1 they are not suitable for application in the modelling of emissions in wwtps 2 2 1 testing the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 as explained in item 2 1 both brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 models are originally based on the classical description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate despite being derived via different paths it was shown that both models produce practically equivalent results for the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g see fig 2 as also discussed previously the correct application of these models require the clear definition of a reference height consistent with the value of the bulk gas phase concentration c g that is used to calculate the emission by means of equations 6 and 7 together with equation 4 brutsaert s or 5b deacon s in this sense if c g is approximated by the background concentration as usually done in the context of emission modelling and also in the experimental values used herein the reference height ideally coincides with the top limit of the concentration boundary layer δ m because the interest in emission modelling normally resides in the fetch averaged k g and also part of the experimental data set only reports the averaged values of k g and u the models will be all evaluated against the fetch averaged values of k g using fetch averaged input variables u and δ m the possibility of applying brutsaert s and deacon s models with fetch averaged u and δ m to obtain fetch averaged k g was verified for the case of the developing turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate as further discussed in supplementary material section iii among the sources of the present data set only mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 give enough information about the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer in their experiments therefore the primary evaluation of brutsaert s and deacon s models will be based on the data from mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 for which the experimental values of δ m could be obtained in order to extend the comparison against the rest of the data we propose a parametrisation for the average thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer δ m using the data from mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 we were able to satisfactorily correlate the fetch averaged δ m to a fetch reynolds number r e u x ν and a non dimensional fetch x x g u 2 via equation 11 being u also fetch averaged these two non dimensional groups in the right hand side of equation 11 r e and x represent respectively the influences of boundary layer development and wind wave field both of which contribute for the thickness of the boundary layer the constant and exponents were chosen so as to minimize the relative errors in estimating δ m for mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 data achieving a rms relative error of 11 8 with positive and negative maximums of 18 4 and 25 7 11 δ m x 0 751 r e 0 236 x 0 138 the two models i e equation 4 for brutsaert s or equation 5b for deacon s together with equations 6 and 7 were applied with the following input variables judged as the best representation of the experiments in the data set fetch averaged u as obtained from the original references s c g for water vapour in air corrected for the experimental temperatures von kárman constant 0 4 turbulent schmidt number s c t equal 0 8 reference measurement height z m equal the fetch averaged δ m for the cases of mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 the values of δ m were the ones derived from the experimental profile measurements for the rest of the data set δ m was estimated using equation 11 the comparison between the resulting k g and the respective experimental k g from the data set compiled presented in the supplementary material section ii 1 is illustrated in fig 3 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 2 for three sets of data all data all data excluding mackay and yeun 1983 and only mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 proved to predict the experimental k g in the data set considerably well with both models performing in a very similar way this may be an indication that for the range of fetches and u covered in the present paper table sm1 in the supplementary material the process of mass transfer of compounds in the gas side of the air liquid interface does not deviate dramatically from the classical picture of the inner layer of a smooth turbulent boundary layer over a flat surface intrinsic to both models as long as the appropriate value of u is used in the modelling although the mass transfer dynamics may be similar the values of u in the experiments are not necessarily the same as expected for a smooth flow because of the effect of waves on the wind friction prata et al 2017 the relatively good performance of the models is also in accordance with the findings of merlivat and coantic 1975 who show that brustaert s model could predict great part of their experimental results regarding isotopic composition of evaporated water vapour in a 40 m long wind wave tank with u up to 0 228 m s 1 because the mass transfer boundary layer thickness δ m is taken as the reference height z m in this analysis the models automatically account for the effects of the thickening of the boundary layer as fetch increases and were able to capture part of the scatter in the values of k g however this does not explain the entire scatter and relative differences between model estimates and experimental values are observed fig 3 and table 2 besides the errors and imprecisions that may be associated with the experimental data possible additional reasons for such differences are the assumption that z m is inside the dynamic log sublayer of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer which is inherent to the application of equation 7 is not strictly true for at least part of the experiments nevertheless the preliminary testing with the case of the developing turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate section iii of supplementary material indicated that the errors arising from this assumption would be relatively small the use of equation 11 to parametrise δ m i e z m automatically introduces some degree of error however smoothed since the logarithm of z m is taken indeed if the evaluation is done considering only the data of mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 for which the experimental value of δ m is adopted the errors are smaller table 2 the air flow separation over breaking waves and wave induced motions in the air flow could have affected to some extent the mass transfer in the boundary layer over the water surface the mechanisms are discussed in item 2 1 for some of the experiments making it deviate from the classical smooth flow situation originally described by the models the formation of spray upon wave breaking and the consequent additional evaporation from the spray droplets is not accounted for in the models spray may have been present in some of the experiments mainly at high u and resulted in relatively larger experimental k g this is a possible explanation to the seemingly likelihood of the models to underestimate k g for u higher than 0 6 m s 1 which can be seen in fig 3 however as discussed previously the data of mackay and yeun 1983 for which the largest underestimations are observed might have been biased by the chicken feeder system used to measure the volume of water evaporated 2 2 2 testing empirical correlations the empirical models of mackay and matsugu 1973 mackay and yeun 1983 and gostelow et al 2001 equations 8 10 respectively were also evaluated against the compiled experimental data set for the application of these correlations the input variables were considered the same way as in the testing of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 models fetch averaged u or the equivalent u 10 in the case of mackay and matsugu s correlation as obtained from the original references and s c g for water vapour in air corrected for the experimental temperatures the comparison between the estimated k g and respective experimental k g is shown in fig 4 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 3 for the whole data set and for the data set excluding mackay and yeun 1983 experiment it is important to note that mackay and matsugu s model is not compared against resch and selva s 1979 data since no equivalent u 10 could be retrieved for their experiment mackay and matsugu s correlation equation 8 table 1 performs poorly in describing the experimental data set with rms relative error of 85 6 reaching maximum deviations of order 140 furthermore the behaviour predicted by this correlation does not correspond to the observed experimental variation of k g with u 10 as seen in fig 4a together with imprecision of the u 10 characterizing the data set one of the probable reasons for errors of such magnitude are methodological shortcomings in the derivation of mackay and matsugu s correlation such as the use of wind speed values not measured on site but taken from a nearby meteorological station it may also have been affected by the previously discussed limitations of sutton s 1953 model item 2 1 the fact that equation 8 is not able to correctly estimate k g is of particular importance since this is the equation utilised in the model water9 for predicting emissions in liquid impoundments and other types of passive surfaces which is the model endorsed by the us environmental protection agency us epa 1994 2001 and is generally accepted as a regulatory model for the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps the model of mackay and yeun 1983 equation 9 estimates k g with smaller errors rms relative error of 34 7 than mackay and matsugu s although extreme deviations as large as 76 7 were still found besides a trend of this correlation to overestimate most of the data set is clearly observable in fig 4b nonetheless the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 produces comparatively much better predictions with smaller rms relative error 18 0 and extremes as seen in table 3 and fig 4b this can be explained by the fact that part of the present data set was used by gostelow et al 2001 to fit their correlation in other words for part of this data set equation 9 actually is the best linear fit in terms of k g as a function of u a disadvantage of both mackay and yeun s and gostelow s correlations is that they do not respond to differences in fetch 2 3 development of an alternate approach for estimating k g in this work we fit a new alternate equation form to the data set assuming the normalised k g k g u to be proportional to powers of s c g r e and x the last two defined the same way as in equation 11 the attempt to relate k g u to powers of r e and x is inspired by the following facts for the classical case of the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate approached by wind with uniform velocity profile k g is proportional to a power of a fetch reynolds number see item 2 1 1 and for a range of situations the wind friction over wavy passive liquid surfaces can be successfully parametrised as proportional to a power of the non dimensional fetch x as shown by prata et al 2017 the exponent of s c g was set as 2 3 0 67 a value customarily adopted e g equations 8 10 from table 1 the proportionality constant and the exponents of r e and x were then chosen so as to minimize the relative errors between the predicted k g and the k g in the data set excluding mackay and yeun 1983 data for the reasons discussed previously the resulting expression equation 12 allowed to estimate the experimental k g with smaller relative errors than the ones obtained with the other correlations table 3 both for the whole data set and especially for the data set without mackay and yeun 1983 data on the other hand as can be noted in fig 4b equation 12 underestimated the values of k g for u higher than 0 6 m s 1 12 k g u 0 0994 r e 0 0894 x 0 0178 s c g 2 3 one of the potential advantages of fitting a model with the format of equation 12 is the possibility of including the effects of the fetch on k g nonetheless according to equation 12 k g can be expected to vary proportionally to u 0 875 and x 0 072 this shows that k g is much more sensitive to changes in u than to changes in the fetch this also partially explains why a linear fit that does not consider the influence of x such as gostelow s correlation is a relatively good approximation for the variation of k g with u within the data set 2 4 comparison among the best performing approaches in situations of interest to wwtps the present analysis showed that of the approaches tested against the experimental data set three produced clearly better results with the smallest rms relative errors and also the smallest positive and negative extremes the empirical correlation of gostelow et al 2001 equation 10 from table 1 equation 12 and the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 it is then useful to compare the k g that would be calculated by these three approaches for conditions beyond the limits of the experimental data set so as to cover a broader range of situations that are of interest in the modelling of air emissions in wwtps as a starting point fig 5 illustrates the behaviour of k g with u as estimated by gostelow s correlation equation 12 and brutsaert s model with z m equal the fetch averaged δ m estimated by equation 11 for two values of s c g and at three different fetches with u varying from 0 05 to 1 0 m s 1 as expected the results of gostelow s correlation do not change with fetch whereas k g estimated by equation 12 and brutsaert s model decreases slightly as x increases for the same s c g fig 5a c and e and fig 5b d and f the differences between the results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation are normally small for lower u becoming more pronounced for higher u and also increasing with x the behaviour and in fact the values of the relative differences does not change significantly with changes in s c g since both equations contain factors of s c g to a similar power s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 the most remarkable aspect that can be observed in fig 5 however is that brutsaert s model responds differently to changes in s c g compared to the other two approaches compare the pairs at each fetch in fig 5 a b c d and e f this is due to the fact that the resistance r m along the dynamic sublayer calculated via equation 7 does not depend on s c g therefore changes in s c g will have less effect in the total resistance r g 1 k g equation 6 and consequently in the value of k g calculated by brutsaert s model having understood how the differences among the results of the three approaches may vary depending on u x and s c g the next step is to estimate such differences in the whole range of situations that are of practical relevance for the modelling of atmospheric emissions in wwtps with this purpose we conducted a monte carlo simulation with 30000 combinations of u x and s c g calculating k g for each of them applying the three approaches simultaneously gostelow s correlation equation 10 equation 12 and brutsaert s model equation 4 together with equations 6 and 7 being z m the fetch averaged δ m estimated via equation 11 the values of u x and s c g were randomly chosen within the following ranges which can be considered typical in the context of air emissions in wwtps u from 0 05 to 1 0 m s 1 x from 4 to 100 m and s c g from 0 6 to 2 6 table 4 presents the rms and maximum relative differences between results of each pair of models it also indicates the percentage of results for which the respective differences were negative the size of the sample 30000 was such that these differences do not change significantly if larger sample sizes are adopted interestingly the rms relative differences between the results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation and especially between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation are not extremely large being of order 20 and 17 respectively nonetheless it is important to mention that the differences between results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation and between results of equation 12 and brutsaert s model were predominantly negative whilst the differences between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation were relatively more distributed and predominantly positive i e for most of the cases the k g calculated by brusaert s model was larger than the respective k g calculated by gostelow s correlation also noteworthy are the considerably large extreme positive and negative relative differences which occur respectively between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation 53 5 and between equation 12 and brutsaert s model 40 9 both cases observed for s c g closer to 2 6 the maximum value in the s c g range overall the differences between results of brutsaert s model and the other approaches can be majorly related to the different dependency on s c g as pointed out previously on the other hand the differences between results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation are primarily due to the fact that the first has k g proportional to u 0 875 besides considering a slight dependency on fetch while the later takes k g proportional to u the same analysis was done having deacon s model in the place of brutsaert s the results were very similar although the present analysis shows clearly that each of these approaches would present a different behaviour if applied to the variety of u x and s c g that may appear in the practical situations of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps the testing against the experimental data set discussed in the previous topic did not completely indicate which approach shall be favoured since the magnitude of the relative errors between estimated and experimental k g was similar for the three of them in principle any of the three might be the most accurate it might also happen that no single approach would perform satisfactorily in all situations especially if extrapolated beyond the limits of the experimental data set of primary importance is the elucidation regarding the appropriate dependency of k g on u if linear or to a power and s c g if it scales with s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 or follows a more complex relation as expressed in brutsaert s model this will require the conduction of further experimental studies with large wind wave tanks and involving gas phase controlled compounds other than water vapour in the hypothesis of k g varying with s c g in a way different than the s c g 0 67 proportion this could also be related to the relative poor performance of mackay and matsugu 1973 correlation equation 8 from table 1 in estimating the experimental k g for water vapour because this correlation was originally fit for cumene the incorrect extrapolation for water vapour s s c g would then result in overestimated values of k g not forsaking the limitations and the necessity of further work cited above at the present stage the following points can be made the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 equation 10 figures as a reasonable choice if a rapid and simple estimate of k g is required keeping in mind its major limitations not including x and imposing a proportionality to s c g 0 67 the models based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate namely brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 are also interesting alternatives especially for research purposes given their mechanistic character and because they can be incorporated in numerical solutions of coupled wind wave fields and atmospheric boundary layer because of their property of estimating k g values larger than the k g obtained by the other approaches for most of the s c g in the range of interest they can also constitute conservative choices in the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps in such context they have to be used together with an appropriate parametrisation of the boundary layer thickness over the studied surface equation 11 is presented as a preliminary option but additional studies on the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer for a broader range of u x and s c g are necessary so as to confirm or adapt this equation equation 12 generally produces the lowest values of k g thus it may not be the more conservative approach for impact assessment nonetheless this equation was fitted by minimising the errors related to the compiled set of data and therefore this type of correlation should be further investigated 3 the liquid film mass transfer coefficient k l 3 1 theoretical models and empirical correlations for k l 3 1 1 theoretical models for k l deacon 1977 suggested that the mass transfer at the liquid side of a flat unruffled air water interface is dominated by the surface currents produced by the wind and resembles the mass transfer in a smooth turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate thus he again used reichardt 1951 parametrisation for the effective diffusivity d e f f and followed the same basic procedure described in item 2 1 4 but in this case based on the friction velocity and schmidt number in the liquid phase u l and s c l respectively the numerical integration of an analogous form of equation 5a for z s 50 ν u l with ν being the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase in this case led to the approximation expressed by equation 13 valid for 200 s c l 5000 typical range of s c l for chemicals in water 13 k l 0 082 u l s c l 2 3 it is interesting to note that because of the relatively high values of s c l for chemicals in water the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer is usually at the same order of the depth z s in the sheared surface currents considered by deacon 1977 therefore the additional resistance to mass transfer at depths larger than z s can be neglected this is different in the gas side of the interface where the boundary layer thickness is much larger than z s since the friction velocity at the gas side u is normally easier to be measured the friction velocity in the liquid side can be calculated as u l u ρ g ρ l 1 2 which comes from the continuity of the shear stresses at a flat gas liquid interface being ρ g and ρ l the respective densities kg m 3 of the gas and liquid phases for practical purposes however application of deacon 1977 approach is considerably limited since situations with a sheared and at the same time unruffled interface are rare the presence of surface ripples and waves changes not only the rates of mass transfer in the liquid side of the interface but also the dependency of k l on s c l which shifts from a power s c l 2 3 to a power s c l 1 2 this means that the dependency of k l on the power of the molecular diffusivity of the compound in the liquid d l changes from 2 3 to 1 2 jähne and hauβecker 1998 peirson et al 2014 this change in the exponent of s c l or d l can be explained as a result of surface renewal higbie 1935 danckwerts 1951 münnich and flothmann 1975 banerjee and macintyre 2004 turney and banerjee 2013 surface divergence banerjee 1990 csanady 1990 jähne and hauβecker 1998 peirson et al 2014 or the interaction of both turney and banerjee 2013 the surface renewal theory introduced by danckwerts 1951 building on results of higbie 1935 considers that the disturbances at the gas liquid interface promote a periodic renewal of surface elements bringing fluid from the bulk liquid to the interface and taking fluid previously in contact with the interface to the bulk of the liquid phase the theory assumes that during the time between renewal events the unsteady state mass transfer from the interface to each surface element is dominated by molecular diffusion considering an statistical distribution of the time t s between successive renewal events or the time of exposure of the surface elements danckwerts 1951 found equation 17 where t is the mean time s between renewal events the mean of the distribution of t 14 k l d l t 1 2 in practice however determining which are the renewal events and the value of t in a free surface sheared by the wind is not always straightforward münnich and flothmann 1975 evoke the smooth turbulent flow at a flat boundary and propose that t 16 2 ν u l 2 which makes danckwerts 1951 expression for k l become equation 15 15 k l 1 16 u l s c l 1 2 citing direct numerical simulations and experiments banerjee and macintyre 2004 explore the idea that surface renewal is due to the sweeps or upwellings normally observed in a disturbed water surface they argue that if this is the case and t can be taken as the time between sweeps which in turn scales as t 100 ν u l 2 according to those authors equation 14 can be rewritten as equation 16 16 k l 0 1 u l s c l 1 2 there have been a few attempts to experimentally study the renewal events directly turney and banerjee 2013 measured the average age of the surface elements which corresponds to t by tracking flow tracing particles using piv in a wind wave flume garbe et al 2002 used infrared images of the water surface and digital image processing techniques to derive the probability distribution of the time between renewal events in heat transfer from water to air in both of these cases the measurements were restricted to the field of view of the cameras and the results were very specific for each situation the theory of surface divergence in contrast postulates that the mechanism controlling mass transfer at the air water interface is directly related to the existence of divergence or convergence of the flow field at the interface plane which in turn is only possible because the air water interface is not a rigid wall and the liquid phase can move at the surface parallel plane banerjee 1990 jähne and hauβecker 1998 banerjee and macintyre 2004 turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 as a consequence the surface normal turbulent motions can be much more intense close to the interface albeit being zero exactly at the interface than those close to a rigid wall combining the non zero divergent of the surface parallel motions with some other assumptions for high s c l a model for the liquid film mass transfer coefficient is derived in which k l is proportional to the square root of the mean square divergence of the surface parallel turbulent motions and scales proportionally to d l 1 2 see banerjee 1990 banerjee and macintyre 2004 and turney and banerjee 2013 for more details the application of such model requires the value of the root mean square divergence of the surface parallel turbulent motions which can be locally measured using piv e g turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 or may be parametrised for some cases based on other bulk variables e g banerjee 1990 banerjee and macintyre 2004 and turney and banerjee 2013 however none of the existing models utilises variables that are all available or can be reasonably estimated in the usual situations of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps a different take on the surface divergence mechanism was presented by csanady 1990 who solved simplified transport equations for the flow field and mass transfer in an ideal model roller supposed to represent the basic features of a microscale breaking wave with further assumptions including the idea that the intense divergences are determined by variations of the wind stress csanady 1990 was able to simplify the resulting model in the form of equation 17 17 k l ς ϕ u l s c l 1 2 where ς is a dimensionless constant and ϕ represents the fraction of the liquid surface effective in mass transfer i e the areas where surface divergence occur and their surroundings for these parameters csanady 1990 suggests ς 0 513 and ϕ 0 2 but he pointed out that ϕ would change depending on the wind wave field a complete different approach relies on dimensional scaling lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 proposing that mass transfer in the liquid side of the gas liquid interface can be modelled by a film like representation therefore k l d l d l see item i 1 in supplementary material but with the effective film thickness scaling proportionally to batchelor s 1959 length scale l b that is d l l b batchelor s 1959 length scale l b represents the scale of the smallest turbulent fluctuations of the concentration field for high s c l l b is of order l b 2 π ν d l 2 ε 1 4 batchelor 1959 with ν being the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 of the liquid phase and ε the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy m2 s 3 in the liquid side of the interface boundary layer in this case this scaling argument leads to the general k l form written in equation 18 lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 which also contains the schmidt number dependency with power 1 2 it is interesting to note that the proportionality in equation 18 was also obtained by lamont and scott 1970 their equation number 17 as a result of their small eddy cell model following a different mathematical path 18 k l ε ν 1 4 s c l 1 2 similarly to the other approaches discussed above the practical application of an equation with the form of equation 18 for the estimation of emissions in wwtps would depend on a reliable parametrisations for one of its key variables since ε is not normally measured in the field in this context 3 1 2 experimental insights on the mechanisms determining k l at passive liquid surfaces the importance of wind friction in determining the velocity of mass transfer at the liquid side of passive liquid surfaces has been repeatedly verified in controlled experimental studies liss 1973 cohen et al 1978 mackay and yeun 1983 jähne et al 1987 ocampo torres et al 1994 rhee et al 2007 turney and banerjee 2013 nonetheless there is not clear agreement in terms of the functional relationships when the results of individual investigations are compiled together as further discussed in item 3 2 the considerable scatter of these data is normally attributed to differences of the experimental conditions and setups especially wind speed range and wind fetch differences which also are present in the practical application of emission models for wwtps which in turn are certain to influence the underlying physical processes on the other hand given the intrinsic difficulties of investigating multi scale flow features and microscopic chemical transport in the surroundings of a disturbed air water interface such physical mechanisms and their relation with the different theoretical models are rarely demonstrated in an unambiguous way and even more difficult is to generalise the conclusions of each study although relevant insights have been reported in the literature as following discussed except maybe in cases where the water surface is almost perfectly flat the description of the liquid side mass transfer as determined by the development of a smooth turbulent boundary layer in the liquid due to surface currents caused directly by the wind shear as proposed by deacon 1977 does not hold once surface waves appear there is overwhelming experimental evidence indicating that the dynamics of mass transfer changes in the presence of waves compared to a smooth flat surface as discussed in 3 1 1 a fundamental change observed with the onset of surface ripples and waves is the shift of the dependency of k l on s c l nominally from a power s c l 2 3 to a power s c l 1 2 or equivalently a shift of the dependency of k l on d l from a power d l 2 3 to a power d l 1 2 which has been consistently verified in experiments e g jähne et al 1987 jähne and hauβecker 1998 zappa et al 2004 rhee et al 2007 albeit showing that as long as waves are formed mass transfer is not dominated by a turbulent smooth boundary layer in the liquid side this does not clarify about the exact mass transfer mechanism since different proposed mechanisms would lead to the same scaling of k l with d l 1 2 item 3 1 1 the presence of surface ripples and waves is shown to enhance the rate of mass transfer of liquid side controlled compounds early evidence of the direct link between mass transfer and wave dynamics was reported by jähne et al 1987 who identified that k l correlated with the mean square slope of the waves and in that case both variables presented an overall correlation with u l those authors hypothesised that energy put into the wave field by wind is transferred to near surface turbulence enhancing gas transfer and highlighted the necessity of investigating the way the waves are connected with the near surface turbulence in this context the occurrence of microscale wave breaking has been identified to be of primary importance for the liquid side mass transfer peirson and banner 2003 zappa et al 2004 siddiqui and loewen 2007 turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 using infrared images of the water surface zappa et al 2004 were able to define the dominant areas of enhanced heat transfer as the wakes of microscale breaking waves and have an approximate measure of the fraction of the water surface under the direct influence of microscale breaking although measured locally in the field of view of the infrared imaging camera nominally at fetches 5 6 and 11 1 m such fraction showed a non trivial but significant correlation with k l for helium he and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 in the whole tank 18 29 m long besides the fraction of the water surface under the direct influence of microscale breaking also correlated with the mean square slope of the waves which relates straightforward to the earlier findings of jähne et al 1987 peirson and banner 2003 propose that microscale breaking increases the mass transfer rate mainly by the subduction of a thin mass transfer boundary layer at the spilling region of the breaking crests siddiqui and loewen 2007 applied piv and observed the occurrence of turbulent vortexes coherent structures that are formed at the spilling region of the breaking crests and move to the wake of the microscale breaking waves being able to associate such structures to the thermal wakes captured by infrared imagery they hypothesise that these vortexes disrupt the mass and heat transfer boundary layer in a renewal like mechanism enhancing mass transfer turney and banerjee 2013 suggest a model that combines surface divergence and surface renewal and apply it to their piv measurements of the liquid phase motions in situations of microscale breaking identifying that persistent upwelling events in the region upwind the wave crest are significant for mass transfer other experimental studies also point to the relation between k l and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ε zappa et al 2007 showed that a collection of k l results obtained experimentally under different types of forcing including besides wind cases with tidal currents and rain could be generally described by a relation of the form of equation 18 but the data is considerably scattered around the fitted line vachon et al 2010 utilised a data set comprising exchange rates of carbon dioxide co2 measured experimentally in lakes using a floating accumulation chamber simultaneously to measurements of ε in the water a relation of the form of equation 18 and similar proportionality constant as found by zappa et al 2007 adjusted moderately well to the data set but was not the best fit the best fitting equation form was writing k l as a linear function of the logarithm of ε which described the overall variation in the data set also with considerable scatter around the fitted line it is important to mention that in both studies ε was not measured in the immediate vicinities of the gas liquid interface as the theoretical models would rigorously require the piv results of siddiqui and loewen 2007 also provide indirect support for a strong relation between k l and ε besides showing that ε correlated to the mean square slope of the waves which establishes a link with the findings of jähne et al 1987 mentioned before they identify that the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy near the water surface is highly enhanced in microscale breaking waves which could explain the substantial increases in the value of k l in the presence of microscale breaking observed in other studies additionally siddiqui and loewen 2007 report that ε depends on u l which is in agreement at least qualitatively with a large number of controlled experiments of liquid gas mass transfer that show a correlation between u l and k l item 3 2 the effects of macroscale breaking on the liquid side mass transfer are still to be clarified in particular for the wind wave fields that can be expected at the short fetches that are the typical case in wwtps the plunging and intense spilling associated with macroscale breaking certainly produce intense turbulence in the water and together with the generation of bubbles whitecaps will probably enhance local mass transfer however macroscale breaking is likely to be sparse in liquid surfaces in wwtps as discussed in 2 1 6 hence its effect on the overall mass transfer rates may not be so pronounced in this sense rhee et al 2007 found that bubbles from whitecaps did not have a significant role in the mass transfer of several compounds in a 40 m long wind wave tank the range of air side friction velocities in their experiments was up to 0 6 m s 1 more studies covering a broader range of fetches and wind conditions are necessary to conclusively state that macroscale breaking can be neglected in the present context 3 1 3 empirical correlations for k l similarly to what happens for k g the literature reports a number of correlations for k l in passive liquid surfaces derived from empirical data many k l expressions for environmental passive liquid surfaces were recently reviewed by ro et al 2007 and we refer the reader to their work for more detail therefore the present paper does not aim to review the variety of the existing correlations but instead focuses on the k l correlations that are most widely used in the context of emission modelling for wwtps which are explained below the two complementary equations proposed by mackay and yeun 1983 adopted by the model toxchem the correlation used by gostelow et al 2001 in their emission model and the approach followed by the us epa endorsed emission model water9 us epa 1994 2001 mackay and yeun 1983 the experiments of mackay and yeun 1983 were generally described in 2 1 7 the mass transfer coefficients for several vocs were determined from the decaying of their concentration in the liquid phase and equation 19 was fitted to their data set since the minimum u in their experiment was 0 271 m s 1 mackay and yeun 1983 suggest that the range of application of equation 19 is u 0 3 m s 1 and that equation 20 modified from wolff and van der heijde 1982 should be used for u 0 3 m s 1 in both cases they introduced an intercept of 1 10 6 to account for an still air mass transfer coefficient 19 k l 1 10 6 34 1 10 4 u s c l 1 2 20 k l 1 10 6 144 10 4 u 2 2 s c l 1 2 gostelow et al 2001 the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 for k l in passive liquid surfaces equation 21 was derived in a similar way as their k g correlation item 2 1 7 more details can also be found in gostelow 2002 that is by fitting a straight line with zero intercept to an experimental data set in this case assuming k l to scale with s c l 1 2 the data set consisted of experimental k l for different compounds and respective u compiled from five different sources which performed their experiments in wind wave tanks liss 1973 oxygen o2 and co2 cohen et al 1978 benzene mackay and yeun 1983 benzene and toluene wanninkhof and bliven 1991 sf6 and ocampo torres et al 1994 co2 since this same data set is also used in the present analysis item 3 2 contains additional comments on these experiments overall the data set used by gostelow et al 2001 covered a range of fetches from 2 4 to 100 m and u from 0 047 to 1 046 m s 1 equivalent to u 10 from 1 5 to 26 4 m s 1 21 k l 3 5 10 3 u s c l 1 2 water9 approach the scheme adopted by water9 us epa 1994 2001 to model k l for passive liquid surfaces considers different equations depending on the ranges of wind speed u 10 u and the fetch to depth ratio i e the ratio x h where x is the total fetch and h is the water depth in the tank as summarised in table 5 in the examples presented by us epa 1994 and in the source code reported in us epa 2001 the effective diameter is used as the fetch parameter x the same situation happens for the calculation of k g as explained in item 2 1 7 nonetheless in the original studies from which equations 22 24 were built and the application ranges were defined springer et al 1984 lunney et al 1985 the fetch x adopted was the actual physical fetch in the experimental setup the surface length in the wind direction for this reason for the purposes of the present evaluation x will be always taken as the length of the tank in the direction of the wind the use of the effective diameter instead of the physical fetch may lead to systematic deviations in the calculation of k l as discussed by prata et al 2016 3 2 comparison among k l models against an experimental data set in this item different approaches for estimating k l in passive liquid surfaces are evaluated against a data set of relevant liquid phase controlled mass transfer results that we compile from the literature and presented in item ii 2 of supplementary material further analysis on the behaviour of the variation of k l with u in the present data set is developed in section iv of supplementary material and gives support for the construction of an alternate approach for the calculation of k l item 3 3 for the moment it suffices to say that this analysis indicates that the data from liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 might represent biased situations and if this is the case have to be treated separately within their own particularities in this context for a better evaluation of the different k l models the comparison between model predictions and experimental results will consider three sets of data the whole data set sub set a the whole data set for which u 10 is available i e excluding rhee et al 2007 sub set b the whole data set except liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 the experimental data set was used to test the theoretical models of deacon 1977 equation 13 münnich and flothmann 1975 equation 15 and banerjee and macintyre 2004 equation 16 and several empirical models for k l the model of csanady 1990 equation 17 was not evaluated separately since there is no clear information on how to estimate the parameter ϕ which is supposed to change with the wind wave field and the use of the value of ϕ suggested by csanady 1990 makes equation 17 practically coincide with equation 16 among the empirical models besides the three approaches discussed in item 3 1 3 most commonly used in the context of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps other models that are frequently cited in the literature were also tested lunney et al 1985 liss and merlivat 1986 wanninkhof 1992 cole and caraco 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2003 ro et al 2007 wanninkhof et al 2009 and vachon and prairie 2013 the empirical correlations that constitute these additional models are presented in section v of supplementary material table sm6 for the models that require the friction velocity in the liquid side this was calculated based on the friction velocity u in the gas side as u l u ρ g ρ l 1 2 where ρ g and ρ l are the densities of the air and water respectively corrected for the experimental temperatures fig 6 shows the comparison between the estimated k l and respective experimental k l normalised in the graphs by multiplying by s c l 1 2 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 6 considering the whole data set and the sub sets a the whole data set for which u 10 is available and b the whole data set except liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 for the theoretical models and for the empirical approaches of mackay and yeun 1983 gostelow et al 2001 and water9 us epa 1994 2001 table 5 also contains the relative error statistics regarding the alternate approach equations 25 and 26 which is discussed later 3 3 the data from liss 1973 was generally overestimated by all models except the theoretical model of deacon 1977 and the empirical model of lunney et al 1985 results in section v of supplementary material in especial see figure sm7a this might be due to the very shallow tank used in the experiments of liss 1973 which would explain the conformity of lunney s correlation since lunney et al 1985 also made measurements with very shallow water and a short fetch to derive one of their correlations on the other hand all the models that could be tested against the data of rhee et al 2007 i e the models that do not require u 10 tended to underestimate their data which in turn represent a situation of particularly high k l see discussion in section iv of supplementary material overall none of the models was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set for sub set b which excludes the two suspected biased situations results from liss 1973 rhee et al 2007 the performance of most models was significantly better normally falling in the expected range of uncertainty for liquid gas mass transfer models which typically varies from a factor of 2 10 according to turney and banerjee 2013 however even in this case no model performed remarkably well among the models most commonly used in the context of estimating emissions in wwtps mackay and yeun 1983 gostelow et al 2001 water9 the water9 approach produced the best results especially considering only sub set b of particular concern is the fact that the emission models of mackay and yeun 1983 and gostelow et al 2001 generally underestimated k l for the situations with larger fetch data from wanninkhof and bliven 1991 ocampo torres et al 1994 fig 6b and c which are probably the cases with most critical impact in terms of emissions in wwtps since larger emitting areas will be involved 3 3 development of an alternate approach for estimating k l based on an analysis of the behaviour of the variation of k l with u in the present data set section iv of supplementary material we propose here an alternate approach for the calculation of k l in sub set b as can be seen in figure sm6 section iv of supplementary material the data for longer fetch x 16 m in sub set b that is the data of wanninkhof and bliven 1991 ocampo torres et al 1994 collapse well together and in section iv of supplementary material it is shown that these data can be satisfactorily described by equation 25 additionally for fetches varying from 2 4 m to 16 m the data in sub set b can be modelled via equation 26 regarding equation 26 it is worth mentioning that vachon and prairie 2013 also found a k l correlation that depends on the logarithm of the fetch however their correlation was developed for lakes most of them with much larger fetches and do not perform well in the present data set results in section v of supplementary material therefore the approach devised here consists in the use of equation 25 for x 16 m and equation 26 for 2 4 m x 16 m in the equations k l and u are in m s 1 and x is in m 25 k l 4 31 10 3 u s c l 1 2 26 k l 1 191 2 551 log 10 x 10 3 u s c l 1 2 the performance of this new alternate approach in estimating k l is depicted in fig 7 and indicated by the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme reported in table 5 it can be seen that for sub set b the alternate approach generates the best results among all the models and is particularly accurate for longer fetches equation 25 from a fluid dynamics perspective having u as an input variable is more robust than straightforward functions of u 10 since u has a more direct relation to the phenomena that determine liquid side mass transfer in passive surfaces discussion in 3 1 2 nevertheless because u is not directly measured in the typical situations of use of emission models an appropriate parametrisation for u is necessary see prata et al 2017 the alternate approach does not describe well the data from rhee et al 2007 and especially liss 1973 the results of liss 1973 are probably representative only of situations of short fetch and extremely shallow water 10 cm deep which is not a typical situation in wwtps for such very shallow depths the model of lunney et al 1985 seems more appropriate as discussed before on the other hand if the data of rhee et al 2007 is not affected by systematic errors which is not presently clear and the values of k l are actually higher for tanks with fetch of around 40 60 m see further hypothesis in section iv of supplementary material this would have important consequences for the modelling of emissions in wwtps thus more studies are desired to clarify the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m and to adapt the models if necessary 4 conclusions different theoretical and empirical models for k g and k l in passive surfaces in wwtps were critically reviewed and evaluated against relevant experimental data sets wind forcing represented by u and the development of the wind wave field which depends on the wind fetch in special the occurrence of microscale wave breaking were identified as the most important physical factors affecting mass transfer in these situations presently there is no compelling confirmation of any of the theoretical mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain the behaviour of mass transfer in both liquid and gas sides of the gas liquid interface i e to mechanistically model the mass transfer coefficients k g and k l regarding the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 was the one with best performance among the empirical models keeping in mind its major limitations not including x and imposing a proportionality to s c g 0 67 it figures as a reasonable choice for rapid and simple estimates of k g the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 which are based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate are also interesting alternatives especially for research purposes and may constitute conservative choices in the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps to be applied for practical purposes however these models have to be used together with an appropriate parametrisation of the boundary layer thickness over the studied surface equation 11 presented as a preliminary option equation 12 developed by minimising the errors related to the compiled set of data generally resulted in the lowest values of k g thus it may not be the more conservative approach for impact assessment a very concerning outcome of the evaluation of the emission models is that the model of mackay and matsugu 1973 which is the equation utilised in the model water9 endorsed by the us epa and generally accepted as a regulatory model for the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps performed poorly in describing the experimental data set with respect to the models for k l none was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set excluding the two suspected biased situations results from liss 1973 rhee et al 2007 the water9 approach produced the best results among the most commonly used emission models although still with considerably high relative errors for this same sub set we proposed an alternate approach equations 25 and 26 which presented considerably improved performance compared to the other models particularly for longer fetches our critical review and evaluation of emission models also points out that additional research is required for accomplishing further improvements and validation of mass transfer models for passive liquid surfaces in wwtps in especial the following knowledge gaps were identified investigations on the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer over liquid surfaces in order to elucidate the appropriate dependency of k g on u and s c g if it scales with s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 or follows a more complex relation as expressed in brutsaert s model and studies on the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m moreover it is important to notice that the emission models discussed here represent simplified situations and other factors such as surface films broecker et al 1978 and bubbling grant et al 2013 may be present in the field and have the potential to increase the deviations between model predictions and actual emission rates it is also worthy to mention that liquid gas mass transfer models are frequently applied to study the fate of compounds in environments other than wwtps sometimes the same models used for wwtps are adopted for instance qiu et al 2008 and the recent work by tao et al 2017 make use of some of the correlations of mackay and yeun 1983 in this regard although the discussion herein has been focused on models for the mass transfer coefficients in wwtps which were therefore tested against experimental data obtained under conditions that resemble many of the critical physical aspects of the liquid surfaces found in wwtps the outcomes of the present paper can be extrapolated to such other environmental situations as long as the same conditions in terms of fetch and wind speed are observed acknowledgements authors acknowledge the sponsorship from coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior capes and conselho nacional de

19795,emission models are useful tools for the study and management of atmospheric emissions from passive liquid surfaces in wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are potential sources of odour nuisance and other environmental impacts in this work different theoretical and empirical models for the gas side k g and liquid side k l mass transfer coefficients in passive surfaces in wwtps were critically reviewed and evaluated against experimental data wind forcing and the development of the wind wave field especially the occurrence of microscale wave breaking were identified as the most important physical factors affecting mass transfer in these situations two approaches performed well in describing the available data for k g for water vapour one is an empirical correlation whilst the other consists of theoretical models based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate we also fit to the experimental data set a new alternate equation for k g whose performance was comparable to existing ones however these three approaches do not agree with each other in the whole range of schmidt numbers typical for compounds found in emissions from wwtps as to k l no model was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set excluding two suspected biased sources the water9 us epa 1994 air emission models for waste and wastewater north carolina usa epa 453 r 94 080a approach produced the best results among the most commonly used k l models although still with considerably high relative errors for this same sub set we propose a new alternate approach for estimating k l which resulted in improved performance particularly for longer fetches two main gaps were found in the literature the understanding of the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer over liquid surfaces and the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m graphical abstract image 1 keywords emission models wastewater liquid surfaces odorous emissions 1 introduction passive liquid surfaces are one of the major sources of odorous gases related to wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may cause nuisance to the exposed communities capelli et al 2009b nicell 2009 lebrero et al 2011 hayes et al 2014 other potential environmental impacts of emissions from wwtps are exposure to harmful substances cheng et al 2008 yang et al 2012 godoi et al 2017 and greenhouse effect daelman et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 the classification as passive indicates the absence of an active gas flow such as active aeration or intense bubbling across the surface vdi 3475 bl 1 2000 gostelow et al 2003 bockreis and steinberg 2005 capelli et al 2009b examples of passive surfaces normally encountered in wwtps are primary and secondary settlement tanks non aerated sequencing batch reactors and stabilization ponds it is important to notice that passive surfaces are not undisturbed surfaces since the wind is likely to promote shear at the water surface and generate waves which in turn can undergo processes of micro and macroscale breaking accurately quantifying the emission rate of specific compounds or odours in general from these surfaces is a critical step for environmental impact assessments including the use of dispersion modelling and for verifying compliance with regulations nicell 2009 capelli et al 2013 schauberger et al 2013 2016 brancher et al 2017 furthermore understanding the behaviour of emissions is important for implementing control initiatives as in the example reported by beghi et al 2012b the emission rate of compounds at passive liquid surfaces can be estimated by the use of one of the following methods gostelow et al 2001 2003 hudson and ayoko 2008a b predictive emission models reverse dispersion modelling indirect method and sampling with enclosure devices such as a flux hood or a wind tunnel direct method if the samples are analysed by dynamic olfactometry the direct and indirect methods can also provide the odour emission rate in odour units per unit time which may be required for regulatory purposes for a simple and rough estimate of the overall odour emission rate odour emission factors capelli et al 2009b are also an option each of the approaches above presents particular advantages and limitations emission models have been widely applied in the estimation of atmospheric emissions from wwtps atasoy et al 2004 blunden et al 2008 cheng et al 2008 ro et al 2008 rumburg et al 2008 santos et al 2009 beghi et al 2012a yang et al 2012 glaz et al 2016 and other types of surface impoundments containing liquid wastes e g rotz et al 2014 karunarathne et al 2017 and can be used for estimating emission rates for environmental impact assessment before building a specific wwtp santos et al 2009 nevertheless this approach still has to be fully consolidated as clearly indicated for instance by ferro and pincince 1996a 1996b gostelow et al 2001 blunden et al 2008 beghi et al 2012a and santos et al 2012 in this sense understanding the physical processes underpinning the liquid air mass transfer of pollutants at passive liquid surfaces is essential not only for the management of the environmental impacts associated with atmospheric emissions from these sources but also for the evaluation and improvement of predictive emission models the overall model for liquid gas mass transfer equation sm6 section i of supplementary material is relatively straightforward based on the two resistance hypothesis and the concepts of liquid side or liquid film and gas side or gas film mass transfer coefficients k l and k g respectively the definition of the mass transfer coefficients and the derivation of the two resistance formulation for liquid gas mass transfer are presented in section i of supplementary material nonetheless the challenge resides in having accurate prediction of k l and k g to date neither a theoretical nor an experimental model for the mass transfer coefficients has been fully established some theoretical models are physically sound but their application to the field situation is rather restricted on the other hand empirical correlations e g mackay and yeun 1983 springer et al 1984 gostelow et al 2001 were not validated against experimental data other than the data from which they were derived and their relation with the theoretical background is not clearly drawn therefore this paper analyses the theoretical and empirical description of liquid gas mass transfer processes at passive liquid surfaces in terms of the gas film and liquid film mass transfer coefficients focusing on the relevant aspects for the study of atmospheric emissions from wwtps and similar facilities the different models are tested against a compilation of experimental data and new alternate approaches are proposed where appropriate 2 the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g in the presence of surface disturbances due to wind shear 2 1 theoretical models and empirical correlations for k g 2 1 1 models based on the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate approached by wind with uniform velocity profile is a classical situation which serves as base for the general study of boundary layers see schlichting 1968 in the laminar case analytic solutions exist in the turbulent case semi empirical parametrisations for the mass transfer coefficient in the air side boundary layer have been established among those thibodeaux and scott 1985 citing sherwood and pigford 1952 and sherwood et al 1975 support equation 1 and equation 2 for the laminar and turbulent boundary layers respectively 1 k g 0 644 d g x r e x 1 2 s c g 1 3 and 2 k g 0 036 d g x r e x 4 5 s c g 1 3 where x is the length of the plate m the wind fetch in this case r e x x u 0 ν g is the fetch reynolds number with u 0 the velocity m s 1 of the approaching uniform flow or the free stream velocity and ν g the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 of the air gas phase s c g ν g d g denotes the schmidt number of the compound in the air gas phase thibodeaux and scott 1985 highlight that equation 1 was experimentally verified in aerodynamic wind tunnels for r e x between 8000 and 20000 and equation 2 for r e x ranging from 20000 to 300000 it is important to notice that the average k g along the length of the boundary layer is evaluated if equations 1 and 2 are used not the local k g equation 1 is obtained for a laminar boundary layer with velocity profiles described by the classical solution of blasius see for instance schetz 1984 laminar boundary layers are likely to occur inside some portable wind tunnels used for direct sampling of emissions bliss et al 1995 capelli et al 2009a prata et al 2014 however they are not an appropriate model for the atmospheric boundary layer which is typically turbulent seinfeld 1986 jacobson 1999 regarding equation 2 although representing a turbulent boundary layer two main critical points prevent its application for modelling k g over passive liquid surfaces in wwtps and other environmental situations i the approaching flow in such cases does not normally have a uniform velocity distribution a condition for which equation 2 was developed so that the free stream velocity u 0 cannot be rigorously defined and ii the flow over passive liquid surfaces in the field does not necessarily resemble the flow over a smooth plate since waves generated by the wind may induce an effective roughness in the air flow prata et al 2017 2 1 2 model based on taylor s statistical theory and a power law wind velocity profile sutton 1953 sutton 1953 discusses the case of a compound evaporating from a smooth rectangular surface with finite length x in the direction of the wind and virtually infinite width in the cross wind direction in the analysed case the difference c g i c g is taken as constant over the whole surface with c g determined far from the surface so it has the same value as in the air upwind the emitting surface also the mean wind velocity profile over the surface was assumed to be satisfactorily approximated by a power law as u z u z z z m where u z is the wind velocity m s 1 at any given height z m u z is the wind velocity measured at a reference height z and m is the exponent that fits the approximate profile using taylor 1922 1932 1935 statistical theory and making additional assumptions sutton arrived at an analytical solution for the concentration field above the surface taking into account advection effects in the wind direction which in turn gives an expression for the evaporation rate per unit of cross wind length kg s 1 m 1 that is equivalent to a boundary layer mass transfer coefficient as in equation 3a 3a k g a u z 2 n 2 n x n 2 n where a is a constant dependent on the reference height z and the kinematic viscosity of air n related to m as m n 2 n is an exponent used by sutton to parametrise the correlation coefficient between turbulent velocity fluctuations in the context of taylor s statistical theory for a wind profile with exponent m 1 7 corresponding to n 1 4 which is the profile normally attributed to the turbulent flow over a smooth plate sutton 1953 equation 3a can be written as equation 3b 3b k g a u z 0 78 x 0 11 one of the major drawbacks of sutton s model is that the molecular diffusivity of the compound which is particularly relevant for the transport in the viscous sublayer adjacent to the smooth surface is not explicitly taken into account one can attempt to incorporate the molecular diffusivity if the constant a is adjusted experimentally as done for example by mackay and matsugu 1973 see item 2 1 7 another limitation is that the model is not suitable for the flow over passive liquid surfaces with aerodynamic roughness which may be the case if waves are present in wwtps prata et al 2017 2 1 3 model based on the assumption that the interfacial sublayer is controlled by renewal mechanisms brutsaert 1975 brutsaert 1975 derived a model for calculating the air side mass and heat transfer over flat surfaces above which a steady state turbulent two dimensional wind boundary layer is present concentration gradients in the along wind direction are neglected thus neglecting any advection effects except the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction meaning that the model may not be suitable to describe the very beginning of the concentration boundary layer at the upwind end of the emitting surface where the boundary layer thickness and the concentration values change significantly in the wind direction the model was constructed based on the idea supported by experimental observations cited by brutsaert 1975 that the mass transfer in the region very close to the surface called interfacial sublayer in the original paper in the case of an aerodynamically smooth surface this comprises the viscous and buffer sublayers of the inner boundary layer of the turbulent flow is controlled by renewal mechanisms which in turn are imposed by turbulent eddies coming from the fully turbulent dynamic sublayer log sublayer immediately above the interfacial sublayer see fig 1 the average renewal frequency was assumed to be proportional to the frequency of the turbulent eddies at the kolmogorov s scale frequency scale given by f ε ν 1 2 being ε the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy units m2 s 3 calculated at the height z s corresponding to the bottom of the dynamic sublayer the boundary between the dynamic and interfacial sublayers see fig 1 for the dynamic sublayer with logarithmic velocity profile ε u 3 κ z where u is the friction velocity m s 1 and κ is the von kárman constant using this expression taking z s 30 ν u considered by brutsaert as the limit of the interfacial sublayer considering a linear velocity profile in the viscous sublayer and making some additional assumptions about the behaviour of the renewing eddies brutsaert 1975 derived the following result equation 4 for the mass transfer coefficient over a smooth flat surface 4 k g s c s u s c g 2 3 where c s is a dimensionless constant to be determined experimentally based on a compilation of experimental results brutsaert 1975 suggests c s 1 13 6 it is important to highlight that equation 4 gives the coefficient for the mass transfer between the interface concentration c g i and the height z s in this case z s 30 ν u to denote this the superscript s was included in the representation of the mass transfer coefficient k g s if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the resistance to mass transfer between the heights z s and z m has to be included discussed in 2 1 5 brutsaert 1975 also presented a model for rough surfaces however as he mentioned in the original paper this model seems not to be completely appropriate for the mass transfer over waves and therefore will not be covered in the present analysis 2 1 4 model based on the reichardt s parametrisation for the effective diffusivity in the viscous and buffer sublayers deacon 1977 similarly to brutsaert 1975 deacon 1977 treats the case of mass or heat transfer over a smooth flat surface in contact with a steady state turbulent two dimensional wind boundary layer also neglecting concentration gradients in the along wind direction hence the same restriction applies the model may not be suitable for the initial stages of the concentration boundary layer at the upwind end of the emitting surface deacon s derivation however is based on the reichardt 1951 parametrisation for the effective diffusivity d e f f the sum of the molecular and eddy diffusivities along the viscous and buffer sublayers of the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate which is given by d e f f d 1 κ s c ζ l z ζ l tanh z ζ l where z u z ν and ζ l is a constant deacon adopts the value ζ l 11 7 for κ 0 41 the resistance to mass transfer r s between the surface and a height z s just slightly above the border of the buffer sublayer is then computed as equation 5a 5a r s 1 k g s 0 z s 1 d e f f d z deacon 1977 numerically computed the integral in equation 5a for z s 50 ν u and proposes an approximation that for 0 6 s c g 10 which is the typical range of s c g for chemicals and also heat in air can be rewritten in terms of k g s as equation 5b below 5b k g s 1 15 2 u s c g 0 61 similarly to what was said about brutsaert 1975 formulation the mass transfer coefficient calculated by equation 5b accounts for the mass transfer between the surface and the height z s 50 ν u that is reason for the superscript s in k g s again if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the resistance to mass transfer between the heights z s and z m has to be included as discussed next 2 1 5 2 1 5 computing the total resistance to mass transfer in the gas phase as mentioned before both brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 formulations equations 4 and 5b respectively calculate the coefficient for mass transfer between the surface concentration c g i and a height z s at the bottom of the dynamic log sublayer where the log sublayer encounters the buffer sublayer see fig 1 taken as z s 30 ν u by brutsaert and z s 50 ν u by deacon if the bulk concentration c g is measured at a height z m z s the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g has to account for the total resistance to mass transfer between the surface z 0 and z m so equation sm2a can be properly applied the procedure to do so following described is contained in both the works of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 the total resistance to mass transfer in the gas phase between z 0 and z m r g 1 k g can be calculated as the association in series between two resistances as shown in equation 6 the resistance r s 1 k g s between z 0 and z s and the resistance r m between z s and z m 6 r g 1 k g r s r m following the notation adopted here k g s is given by equation 4 if brutsaert s formulation is used and by equation 5b if deacon s formulation is used the resistance r m can be calculated with ease if the measurement height z m is within the fully turbulent log sublayer in this sublayer the molecular diffusivity can be neglected compared to the turbulent diffusivity thus the effective diffusivity can be approximated as d e f f s c t 1 κ u z where s c t is the turbulent schmidt number and the resistance r m is given by equation 7 7 r m z s z m 1 d e f f d z s c t 1 κ u ln z m z s fig 2 shows a comparison of k g calculated for water vapour s c g 0 61 in air at 25 c s c t taken as 1 for the moment using equations 6 and 7 together with brutsaert s fig 2a and deacon s fig 2b k g s formulations for various u and considering different measurement heights z m as expected k g decreases as z m increases since the resistance r m becomes larger it is important to observe that the k g calculated for the same z m using either brutsaert s or deacon s formulations are very similar generally with difference of order 1 or less it is remarkable that these formulations derived through different paths arrive at practically equivalent results it can also be noted that although the curves corresponding to z m other than z s are not precisely linear they can be fairly approximated by a straight line the fact that k g significantly changes with the reference height z m is critical for the proper determination and use of k g formulations otherwise unrealistic resistances would be incorporated if an actual measurement of c g is performed it is imperative that the measurement height z m is within the dynamic sublayer and also within the limits of the concentration boundary layer on the other hand if c g is approximated by the background concentration upwind the emitting surface then z m has to coincide with or be sufficiently close to the top limit of the concentration boundary layer 2 1 6 effect of waves on k g waves on liquid surfaces can affect the dynamics of mass transfer in the air boundary layer by i increasing turbulent transport which means increasing u in the dynamic sublayer due to the form drag arising from resonant wind wave interactions wave induced stress and air flow separation at breaking waves janssen 2004 caulliez et al 2008 kudryavtsev et al 2014 kudryavtsev and chapron 2016 ii modifying the profile of wind velocity and eddy diffusivity in the proximity of a wavy liquid surface due to the wind induced stresses and air flow separation kudryavtsev et al 2014 iii generating separation bubbles downwind the air flow separation detachment point at breaking waves the increase in turbulent transport listed above as process i is automatically taken into account for the modelling of k g if u is measured directly or if an appropriate parametrisation for u i e one that satisfactorily incorporates the changes in u due to the wind wave dynamics is adopted for further discussion on u parametrisations applied to emission modelling in wwtps refer to prata et al 2017 a modified wind velocity profile and the existence of separation bubbles listed above respectively as processes ii and iii are much more difficult to describe and to include in a simple theoretical model for liquid gas mass transfer a remarkable work was performed by kudryavtsev et al 2014 who applied a wind over waves coupling model to calculate the heat transfer which is analogous to mass transfer over sea waves those authors estimated the turbulent fluxes in the air boundary layer by solving a coupled system of conservation equations for momentum in the air side and wave energy in the liquid side using parametrisations for wave induced and air flow separation stresses wave breaking and non linear wave wave interactions among others they show that in the region directly influenced by the waves wind velocity and temperature profiles deviate to some extend from the classical log linear profile moreover their results suggest that k g can be expected to generally increase with the wind speed due to the increase of u but not at the same rate as u which is explained by the sheltering effect due to the wave induced stress and the air flow separation however since some of the parametrisations adopted by kudryavtsev et al 2014 are based on oceanic data and they do not take into account air flow separation arising from the breaking of small scale gravity waves their results cannot be directly extrapolated to the mass transfer in relatively small liquid surfaces such as wwtps for which a much less developed wind wave field can be expected prata et al 2017 the application of wind over waves coupled models to wwtps is theoretically possible although not practical and lacking of preliminary data as briefly discussed in prata et al 2017 thus the exact extent to which k g at passive liquid surfaces in wwtps is influenced by processes ii and iii is presently not clear and these remain as open matters for investigation nonetheless experimental work on the air flow above short gravity waves available in the literature can shed some light on possible effects of process iii before further developing this discussion it is convenient to recall the two classes into which wave breaking events are usually divided namely macroscale and microscale breaking macroscale breaking refers to the breaking events that manifest as plunging or intense spilling at the breaking front generally accompanied by significant air entrainment which leads to the typical whitecaps banner and phillips 1974 caulliez et al 2008 reul et al 2008 kudryavtsev et al 2014 microscale breaking or microbreaking corresponds to the breaking of very short gravity waves wave lengths typically ranging from 0 05 to 0 3 m with none or almost negligible air entrainment normally parasitic capillary waves are generated in this process and travel at a similar speed as the breaking crest banner and phillips 1974 peirson and banner 2003 siddiqui and loewen 2007 air flow separation can certainly be expected to occur wherever macroscale breaking is present due to the abrupt surface disruptions kudryavtsev et al 2014 however in the context of liquid surfaces in wwtps where short fetches and low to moderate wind conditions commonly occur macroscale breaking events are likely to be inexistent or very sparse caulliez et al 2008 observed that the first signs of sporadic air entrainment appeared at wind speeds referenced at 10 m height of 10 9 5 and 8 m s 1 for fetches of 10 13 and 26 m respectively rhee et al 2007 estimated that the rate of macroscale breaking is less than 3 for friction velocities up to 0 6 m s 1 along a tank with total length of 40 m it is important to note that this rate may increase for longer fetches and higher wind speeds microscale breaking waves on the other hand are widely observed at low to moderate wind speeds even for short fetches banner and phillips 1974 kawamura and toba 1988 peirson and banner 2003 siddiqui and loewen 2007 air flow separation from the crests of very short gravity waves has been verified experimentally kawai 1981 1982 kawamura and toba 1988 reul et al 2008 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 although some of these studies kawai 1981 1982 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 do not report if the waves were undergoing microscale breaking there is a high probability that most of the observed separation events occurred over microscale breaking crests taking into consideration images of the flow presented in the papers and also indications by other authors who worked under similar conditions kawamura and toba 1988 peirson and banner 2003 reul et al 2008 the occurrence of air flow separation over short gravity waves appears to be dependent mainly on the local slope at the wave crests a local surface slope i e the local gradient of the surface of 0 6 or greater at the leeward face of the wave crest is identified as a sufficient condition for air flow to separate kawai 1982 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b in the context of their experiment shaikh and siddiqui 2011b argued that the air flow separation observed over waves with smaller gradient was remnant from an earlier stage at which the slope was equal or greater than 0 6 and triggered the separation they also report that no separation was verified for slopes less than 0 4 reul et al 2008 explain that the large surface slope at the leeward side of the crests produces a large adverse pressure gradient which leads to air flow separation waves from which the air flow separates are also normally higher than the ones without separation kawai 1982 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b as for the frequency at which this process happens it varies greatly and depends on fetch and wind conditions both of which certainly influence the maximum slope of the wave crests for example kawai 1982 registered 47 separation events in a total of 79 wave crests examined 59 for u 0 46 m s 1 and fetch 3 7 m at a fetch of 2 1 m the results of shaikh and siddiqui 2011b show air flow separation frequencies of 24 and 64 this includes the remnant separation bubbles downwind crests with steepness less than 0 6 for corresponding u values extracted from shaikh and siddiqui 2011a of 0 149 and 0 175 m s 1 respectively buckley and veron 2016 report that less than 20 of the waves presented associated air flow separation for u 0 167 m s 1 and fetch 22 7 m equivalent 10 m wind speed of 5 m s 1 investigations using particle image velocimetry piv reveal important features of the air flow within the separation bubbles downwind the crest of short gravity waves generally the separation bubble develops as a recirculation region but not as a complete dead zone with reversed flow in relation to the wave form and often a mildly complex pattern of eddies kawai 1982 veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 flow velocities and vorticity are extremely reduced close to the water surface veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b buckley and veron 2016 as are the near surface shear stress veron et al 2007 reul et al 2008 and the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy shaikh and siddiqui 2011b these particular aspects of the flow can be expected to drastically decrease mass transfer in the boundary layer at the air side of the water surface covered by separation bubbles it is important to remember however that the separation bubble does not extend along the whole wave form flow reattachment takes place at some point downwind the wave crest from which the flow detached before the next wave crest the location of the reattachment point is highly variable and probably depends on the wind speed the geometrical characteristics of the wave and the stage of the wave breaking kawai 1982 kawamura and toba 1988 reul et al 2008 in their study of mechanically generated waves swept by wind reul et al 2008 report in their fig 12 extents of separation bubble ranging approximately from 10 to 60 of the wave form for the cases concerning microscale breaking adding this to the fact that only a fraction of the short gravity waves present separation bubbles as discussed in the previous paragraph one can expect that in many cases the majority of the water surface will correspond to regions without air flow separation in the non separated boundary layer and in the boundary layer re established downwind the reattachment point the mean flow presents many of the characteristics of a typical turbulent flow over a flat plate but following the wave form except for some distortions and increased shear stress resulting from the wave influence kawai 1982 veron et al 2007 shaikh and siddiqui 2011b therefore in the context of the passive liquid surfaces in wwtps the significance of air flow separation for the gas film mass transfer coefficient averaged throughout the whole surface will depend on how much of the surface is covered by separation bubbles and how much the increase in the shear stress outside the separation regions is able to balance the reduction of mass transfer inside the bubbles 2 1 7 empirical correlations for k g different empirical correlations fitted to experimental mass transfers results have been proposed by several authors with the aim of estimating the gas film mass transfer coefficient over liquid surfaces the present analysis focuses on the empirical k g correlations that are most widely used in the context of emission modelling for wwtps the expression proposed by mackay and matsugu 1973 which is the one incorporated in the us epa endorsed emission model water9 the equation by mackay and yeun 1983 adopted by the model toxchem enviromega 2003 and the correlation used by gostelow et al 2001 in their emission model the corresponding expressions are presented in table 1 which also summarizes relevant auxiliary information in all three cases the k g calculated by the correlations corresponds to the mean value averaged along the whole water surface fetch averaged k g mackay and matsugu 1973 mackay and matsugu 1973 adopted the general theoretical form proposed by sutton 1953 equation 3b discussed previously item 2 1 2 incorporating the factor s c g 0 67 in order to account for the compounds molecular diffusivity in this case the constant a had to be adjusted experimentally which was done by using cumene evaporation data obtained in small pools 1 2 1 2 m and 1 2 2 4 m placed outdoors the wind speed was not measured on site but taken from a nearby meteorological station the authors did not report the range of wind speeds occurring during the experiments the final equation equation 8 is shown in table 1 with the constant converted to be consistent with input variables in si units as suggested by us epa 1994 it is important to mention that mackay and matsugu 1973 adjusted equation 8 using the effective diameter the diameter of a circular pool with the same area as the experimental surface as the fetch parameter x this is also the approach followed by the water9 model us epa 1994 2001 however as explained in item 2 1 2 sutton s 1953 model was derived considering x as the actual physical fetch i e the length across the surface in the direction of the wind the use of the effective diameter instead of the physical fetch introduces systematic deviations in the calculation of k g especially for large length to width ratios which is generally the case of laboratory wind wave tanks as discussed by prata et al 2016 therefore in the present paper x will be always taken as the length of the tank in the direction of the wind mackay and yeun 1983 mackay and yeun 1983 carried out mass transfer experiments in a wind wave tank with fetch 6 m by varying the wind speed in the wind tunnel they obtained friction velocities in the range 0 271 0 993 m s 1 corresponding to u 10 in the range 8 36 23 11 m s 1 calculated based on u and roughness length data reported in their paper water evaporation rate was measured by knowing the volume of water spent to keep a constant water level in the tank using a chicken feeder system from this the k g for water was calculated the mass transfer coefficients for several volatile organic compounds vocs were determined from the decaying of their concentration in the liquid phase correlations for k g and k l in the form of linear functions of u were adjusted to the mass transfer coefficients obtained experimentally normalised by powers of the schmidt number s c g 0 67 and s c l 1 2 respectively intercepts of 1 10 3 and 1 10 6 were introduced in the expressions for k g and k l in order to account for an still air mass transfer coefficient i e the mass transfer coefficient when there is no wind by doing so they arrived at equation 9 for k g mackay and yeun 1983 correlation for k l will be discussed later in this paper item 3 1 3 gostelow et al 2001 the approach applied by gostelow et al 2001 to develop their k g correlation is explained in detail by gostelow 2002 these authors compiled a data set regarding u and k g for water vapour comprising the results reported by three distinct sources liss 1973 mackay and yeun 1983 and ocampo torres et al 1994 overall the data set used by gostelow et al 2001 covered a range of fetches from 4 5 to 32 2 m and u from 0 039 to 0 993 m s 1 equivalent to u 10 from 1 0 to 24 5 m s 1 these authors were able to adjust a straight line to the data set with k g normalised by s c g 0 67 obtaining equation 10 2 2 comparison among models and against an experimental data set the aim of this item is to compare the results produced by different approaches presented in items 2 1 and 2 2 evaluating them against relevant experimental data and conditions with this purpose we compiled a data set of gas phase controlled mass transfer results as well documented in supplementary material item ii 1 as discussed in item ii 1 of supplementary material the data from mackay and yeun 1983 at large u markedly departs from the rest of the data set figure sm2 and the possibility of a significant experimental bias cannot be ruled out especially considering the chicken feeder apparatus used to quantify the evaporation rates therefore in the following analysis the different approaches for estimating k g will be evaluated against the whole data set and against the data set without mackay and yeun 1983 results it is important to mention that equations 1 and 2 were not included in the analysis because given the reasons discussed in item 2 1 they are not suitable for application in the modelling of emissions in wwtps 2 2 1 testing the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 as explained in item 2 1 both brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 models are originally based on the classical description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate despite being derived via different paths it was shown that both models produce practically equivalent results for the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g see fig 2 as also discussed previously the correct application of these models require the clear definition of a reference height consistent with the value of the bulk gas phase concentration c g that is used to calculate the emission by means of equations 6 and 7 together with equation 4 brutsaert s or 5b deacon s in this sense if c g is approximated by the background concentration as usually done in the context of emission modelling and also in the experimental values used herein the reference height ideally coincides with the top limit of the concentration boundary layer δ m because the interest in emission modelling normally resides in the fetch averaged k g and also part of the experimental data set only reports the averaged values of k g and u the models will be all evaluated against the fetch averaged values of k g using fetch averaged input variables u and δ m the possibility of applying brutsaert s and deacon s models with fetch averaged u and δ m to obtain fetch averaged k g was verified for the case of the developing turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate as further discussed in supplementary material section iii among the sources of the present data set only mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 give enough information about the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer in their experiments therefore the primary evaluation of brutsaert s and deacon s models will be based on the data from mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 for which the experimental values of δ m could be obtained in order to extend the comparison against the rest of the data we propose a parametrisation for the average thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer δ m using the data from mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 we were able to satisfactorily correlate the fetch averaged δ m to a fetch reynolds number r e u x ν and a non dimensional fetch x x g u 2 via equation 11 being u also fetch averaged these two non dimensional groups in the right hand side of equation 11 r e and x represent respectively the influences of boundary layer development and wind wave field both of which contribute for the thickness of the boundary layer the constant and exponents were chosen so as to minimize the relative errors in estimating δ m for mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 data achieving a rms relative error of 11 8 with positive and negative maximums of 18 4 and 25 7 11 δ m x 0 751 r e 0 236 x 0 138 the two models i e equation 4 for brutsaert s or equation 5b for deacon s together with equations 6 and 7 were applied with the following input variables judged as the best representation of the experiments in the data set fetch averaged u as obtained from the original references s c g for water vapour in air corrected for the experimental temperatures von kárman constant 0 4 turbulent schmidt number s c t equal 0 8 reference measurement height z m equal the fetch averaged δ m for the cases of mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 the values of δ m were the ones derived from the experimental profile measurements for the rest of the data set δ m was estimated using equation 11 the comparison between the resulting k g and the respective experimental k g from the data set compiled presented in the supplementary material section ii 1 is illustrated in fig 3 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 2 for three sets of data all data all data excluding mackay and yeun 1983 and only mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 proved to predict the experimental k g in the data set considerably well with both models performing in a very similar way this may be an indication that for the range of fetches and u covered in the present paper table sm1 in the supplementary material the process of mass transfer of compounds in the gas side of the air liquid interface does not deviate dramatically from the classical picture of the inner layer of a smooth turbulent boundary layer over a flat surface intrinsic to both models as long as the appropriate value of u is used in the modelling although the mass transfer dynamics may be similar the values of u in the experiments are not necessarily the same as expected for a smooth flow because of the effect of waves on the wind friction prata et al 2017 the relatively good performance of the models is also in accordance with the findings of merlivat and coantic 1975 who show that brustaert s model could predict great part of their experimental results regarding isotopic composition of evaporated water vapour in a 40 m long wind wave tank with u up to 0 228 m s 1 because the mass transfer boundary layer thickness δ m is taken as the reference height z m in this analysis the models automatically account for the effects of the thickening of the boundary layer as fetch increases and were able to capture part of the scatter in the values of k g however this does not explain the entire scatter and relative differences between model estimates and experimental values are observed fig 3 and table 2 besides the errors and imprecisions that may be associated with the experimental data possible additional reasons for such differences are the assumption that z m is inside the dynamic log sublayer of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer which is inherent to the application of equation 7 is not strictly true for at least part of the experiments nevertheless the preliminary testing with the case of the developing turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate section iii of supplementary material indicated that the errors arising from this assumption would be relatively small the use of equation 11 to parametrise δ m i e z m automatically introduces some degree of error however smoothed since the logarithm of z m is taken indeed if the evaluation is done considering only the data of mangarella 1971 and resch and selva 1979 for which the experimental value of δ m is adopted the errors are smaller table 2 the air flow separation over breaking waves and wave induced motions in the air flow could have affected to some extent the mass transfer in the boundary layer over the water surface the mechanisms are discussed in item 2 1 for some of the experiments making it deviate from the classical smooth flow situation originally described by the models the formation of spray upon wave breaking and the consequent additional evaporation from the spray droplets is not accounted for in the models spray may have been present in some of the experiments mainly at high u and resulted in relatively larger experimental k g this is a possible explanation to the seemingly likelihood of the models to underestimate k g for u higher than 0 6 m s 1 which can be seen in fig 3 however as discussed previously the data of mackay and yeun 1983 for which the largest underestimations are observed might have been biased by the chicken feeder system used to measure the volume of water evaporated 2 2 2 testing empirical correlations the empirical models of mackay and matsugu 1973 mackay and yeun 1983 and gostelow et al 2001 equations 8 10 respectively were also evaluated against the compiled experimental data set for the application of these correlations the input variables were considered the same way as in the testing of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 models fetch averaged u or the equivalent u 10 in the case of mackay and matsugu s correlation as obtained from the original references and s c g for water vapour in air corrected for the experimental temperatures the comparison between the estimated k g and respective experimental k g is shown in fig 4 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 3 for the whole data set and for the data set excluding mackay and yeun 1983 experiment it is important to note that mackay and matsugu s model is not compared against resch and selva s 1979 data since no equivalent u 10 could be retrieved for their experiment mackay and matsugu s correlation equation 8 table 1 performs poorly in describing the experimental data set with rms relative error of 85 6 reaching maximum deviations of order 140 furthermore the behaviour predicted by this correlation does not correspond to the observed experimental variation of k g with u 10 as seen in fig 4a together with imprecision of the u 10 characterizing the data set one of the probable reasons for errors of such magnitude are methodological shortcomings in the derivation of mackay and matsugu s correlation such as the use of wind speed values not measured on site but taken from a nearby meteorological station it may also have been affected by the previously discussed limitations of sutton s 1953 model item 2 1 the fact that equation 8 is not able to correctly estimate k g is of particular importance since this is the equation utilised in the model water9 for predicting emissions in liquid impoundments and other types of passive surfaces which is the model endorsed by the us environmental protection agency us epa 1994 2001 and is generally accepted as a regulatory model for the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps the model of mackay and yeun 1983 equation 9 estimates k g with smaller errors rms relative error of 34 7 than mackay and matsugu s although extreme deviations as large as 76 7 were still found besides a trend of this correlation to overestimate most of the data set is clearly observable in fig 4b nonetheless the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 produces comparatively much better predictions with smaller rms relative error 18 0 and extremes as seen in table 3 and fig 4b this can be explained by the fact that part of the present data set was used by gostelow et al 2001 to fit their correlation in other words for part of this data set equation 9 actually is the best linear fit in terms of k g as a function of u a disadvantage of both mackay and yeun s and gostelow s correlations is that they do not respond to differences in fetch 2 3 development of an alternate approach for estimating k g in this work we fit a new alternate equation form to the data set assuming the normalised k g k g u to be proportional to powers of s c g r e and x the last two defined the same way as in equation 11 the attempt to relate k g u to powers of r e and x is inspired by the following facts for the classical case of the developing boundary layer over a smooth flat plate approached by wind with uniform velocity profile k g is proportional to a power of a fetch reynolds number see item 2 1 1 and for a range of situations the wind friction over wavy passive liquid surfaces can be successfully parametrised as proportional to a power of the non dimensional fetch x as shown by prata et al 2017 the exponent of s c g was set as 2 3 0 67 a value customarily adopted e g equations 8 10 from table 1 the proportionality constant and the exponents of r e and x were then chosen so as to minimize the relative errors between the predicted k g and the k g in the data set excluding mackay and yeun 1983 data for the reasons discussed previously the resulting expression equation 12 allowed to estimate the experimental k g with smaller relative errors than the ones obtained with the other correlations table 3 both for the whole data set and especially for the data set without mackay and yeun 1983 data on the other hand as can be noted in fig 4b equation 12 underestimated the values of k g for u higher than 0 6 m s 1 12 k g u 0 0994 r e 0 0894 x 0 0178 s c g 2 3 one of the potential advantages of fitting a model with the format of equation 12 is the possibility of including the effects of the fetch on k g nonetheless according to equation 12 k g can be expected to vary proportionally to u 0 875 and x 0 072 this shows that k g is much more sensitive to changes in u than to changes in the fetch this also partially explains why a linear fit that does not consider the influence of x such as gostelow s correlation is a relatively good approximation for the variation of k g with u within the data set 2 4 comparison among the best performing approaches in situations of interest to wwtps the present analysis showed that of the approaches tested against the experimental data set three produced clearly better results with the smallest rms relative errors and also the smallest positive and negative extremes the empirical correlation of gostelow et al 2001 equation 10 from table 1 equation 12 and the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 it is then useful to compare the k g that would be calculated by these three approaches for conditions beyond the limits of the experimental data set so as to cover a broader range of situations that are of interest in the modelling of air emissions in wwtps as a starting point fig 5 illustrates the behaviour of k g with u as estimated by gostelow s correlation equation 12 and brutsaert s model with z m equal the fetch averaged δ m estimated by equation 11 for two values of s c g and at three different fetches with u varying from 0 05 to 1 0 m s 1 as expected the results of gostelow s correlation do not change with fetch whereas k g estimated by equation 12 and brutsaert s model decreases slightly as x increases for the same s c g fig 5a c and e and fig 5b d and f the differences between the results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation are normally small for lower u becoming more pronounced for higher u and also increasing with x the behaviour and in fact the values of the relative differences does not change significantly with changes in s c g since both equations contain factors of s c g to a similar power s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 the most remarkable aspect that can be observed in fig 5 however is that brutsaert s model responds differently to changes in s c g compared to the other two approaches compare the pairs at each fetch in fig 5 a b c d and e f this is due to the fact that the resistance r m along the dynamic sublayer calculated via equation 7 does not depend on s c g therefore changes in s c g will have less effect in the total resistance r g 1 k g equation 6 and consequently in the value of k g calculated by brutsaert s model having understood how the differences among the results of the three approaches may vary depending on u x and s c g the next step is to estimate such differences in the whole range of situations that are of practical relevance for the modelling of atmospheric emissions in wwtps with this purpose we conducted a monte carlo simulation with 30000 combinations of u x and s c g calculating k g for each of them applying the three approaches simultaneously gostelow s correlation equation 10 equation 12 and brutsaert s model equation 4 together with equations 6 and 7 being z m the fetch averaged δ m estimated via equation 11 the values of u x and s c g were randomly chosen within the following ranges which can be considered typical in the context of air emissions in wwtps u from 0 05 to 1 0 m s 1 x from 4 to 100 m and s c g from 0 6 to 2 6 table 4 presents the rms and maximum relative differences between results of each pair of models it also indicates the percentage of results for which the respective differences were negative the size of the sample 30000 was such that these differences do not change significantly if larger sample sizes are adopted interestingly the rms relative differences between the results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation and especially between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation are not extremely large being of order 20 and 17 respectively nonetheless it is important to mention that the differences between results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation and between results of equation 12 and brutsaert s model were predominantly negative whilst the differences between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation were relatively more distributed and predominantly positive i e for most of the cases the k g calculated by brusaert s model was larger than the respective k g calculated by gostelow s correlation also noteworthy are the considerably large extreme positive and negative relative differences which occur respectively between brutsaert s model and gostelow s correlation 53 5 and between equation 12 and brutsaert s model 40 9 both cases observed for s c g closer to 2 6 the maximum value in the s c g range overall the differences between results of brutsaert s model and the other approaches can be majorly related to the different dependency on s c g as pointed out previously on the other hand the differences between results of equation 12 and gostelow s correlation are primarily due to the fact that the first has k g proportional to u 0 875 besides considering a slight dependency on fetch while the later takes k g proportional to u the same analysis was done having deacon s model in the place of brutsaert s the results were very similar although the present analysis shows clearly that each of these approaches would present a different behaviour if applied to the variety of u x and s c g that may appear in the practical situations of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps the testing against the experimental data set discussed in the previous topic did not completely indicate which approach shall be favoured since the magnitude of the relative errors between estimated and experimental k g was similar for the three of them in principle any of the three might be the most accurate it might also happen that no single approach would perform satisfactorily in all situations especially if extrapolated beyond the limits of the experimental data set of primary importance is the elucidation regarding the appropriate dependency of k g on u if linear or to a power and s c g if it scales with s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 or follows a more complex relation as expressed in brutsaert s model this will require the conduction of further experimental studies with large wind wave tanks and involving gas phase controlled compounds other than water vapour in the hypothesis of k g varying with s c g in a way different than the s c g 0 67 proportion this could also be related to the relative poor performance of mackay and matsugu 1973 correlation equation 8 from table 1 in estimating the experimental k g for water vapour because this correlation was originally fit for cumene the incorrect extrapolation for water vapour s s c g would then result in overestimated values of k g not forsaking the limitations and the necessity of further work cited above at the present stage the following points can be made the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 equation 10 figures as a reasonable choice if a rapid and simple estimate of k g is required keeping in mind its major limitations not including x and imposing a proportionality to s c g 0 67 the models based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate namely brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 are also interesting alternatives especially for research purposes given their mechanistic character and because they can be incorporated in numerical solutions of coupled wind wave fields and atmospheric boundary layer because of their property of estimating k g values larger than the k g obtained by the other approaches for most of the s c g in the range of interest they can also constitute conservative choices in the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps in such context they have to be used together with an appropriate parametrisation of the boundary layer thickness over the studied surface equation 11 is presented as a preliminary option but additional studies on the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer for a broader range of u x and s c g are necessary so as to confirm or adapt this equation equation 12 generally produces the lowest values of k g thus it may not be the more conservative approach for impact assessment nonetheless this equation was fitted by minimising the errors related to the compiled set of data and therefore this type of correlation should be further investigated 3 the liquid film mass transfer coefficient k l 3 1 theoretical models and empirical correlations for k l 3 1 1 theoretical models for k l deacon 1977 suggested that the mass transfer at the liquid side of a flat unruffled air water interface is dominated by the surface currents produced by the wind and resembles the mass transfer in a smooth turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate thus he again used reichardt 1951 parametrisation for the effective diffusivity d e f f and followed the same basic procedure described in item 2 1 4 but in this case based on the friction velocity and schmidt number in the liquid phase u l and s c l respectively the numerical integration of an analogous form of equation 5a for z s 50 ν u l with ν being the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase in this case led to the approximation expressed by equation 13 valid for 200 s c l 5000 typical range of s c l for chemicals in water 13 k l 0 082 u l s c l 2 3 it is interesting to note that because of the relatively high values of s c l for chemicals in water the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer is usually at the same order of the depth z s in the sheared surface currents considered by deacon 1977 therefore the additional resistance to mass transfer at depths larger than z s can be neglected this is different in the gas side of the interface where the boundary layer thickness is much larger than z s since the friction velocity at the gas side u is normally easier to be measured the friction velocity in the liquid side can be calculated as u l u ρ g ρ l 1 2 which comes from the continuity of the shear stresses at a flat gas liquid interface being ρ g and ρ l the respective densities kg m 3 of the gas and liquid phases for practical purposes however application of deacon 1977 approach is considerably limited since situations with a sheared and at the same time unruffled interface are rare the presence of surface ripples and waves changes not only the rates of mass transfer in the liquid side of the interface but also the dependency of k l on s c l which shifts from a power s c l 2 3 to a power s c l 1 2 this means that the dependency of k l on the power of the molecular diffusivity of the compound in the liquid d l changes from 2 3 to 1 2 jähne and hauβecker 1998 peirson et al 2014 this change in the exponent of s c l or d l can be explained as a result of surface renewal higbie 1935 danckwerts 1951 münnich and flothmann 1975 banerjee and macintyre 2004 turney and banerjee 2013 surface divergence banerjee 1990 csanady 1990 jähne and hauβecker 1998 peirson et al 2014 or the interaction of both turney and banerjee 2013 the surface renewal theory introduced by danckwerts 1951 building on results of higbie 1935 considers that the disturbances at the gas liquid interface promote a periodic renewal of surface elements bringing fluid from the bulk liquid to the interface and taking fluid previously in contact with the interface to the bulk of the liquid phase the theory assumes that during the time between renewal events the unsteady state mass transfer from the interface to each surface element is dominated by molecular diffusion considering an statistical distribution of the time t s between successive renewal events or the time of exposure of the surface elements danckwerts 1951 found equation 17 where t is the mean time s between renewal events the mean of the distribution of t 14 k l d l t 1 2 in practice however determining which are the renewal events and the value of t in a free surface sheared by the wind is not always straightforward münnich and flothmann 1975 evoke the smooth turbulent flow at a flat boundary and propose that t 16 2 ν u l 2 which makes danckwerts 1951 expression for k l become equation 15 15 k l 1 16 u l s c l 1 2 citing direct numerical simulations and experiments banerjee and macintyre 2004 explore the idea that surface renewal is due to the sweeps or upwellings normally observed in a disturbed water surface they argue that if this is the case and t can be taken as the time between sweeps which in turn scales as t 100 ν u l 2 according to those authors equation 14 can be rewritten as equation 16 16 k l 0 1 u l s c l 1 2 there have been a few attempts to experimentally study the renewal events directly turney and banerjee 2013 measured the average age of the surface elements which corresponds to t by tracking flow tracing particles using piv in a wind wave flume garbe et al 2002 used infrared images of the water surface and digital image processing techniques to derive the probability distribution of the time between renewal events in heat transfer from water to air in both of these cases the measurements were restricted to the field of view of the cameras and the results were very specific for each situation the theory of surface divergence in contrast postulates that the mechanism controlling mass transfer at the air water interface is directly related to the existence of divergence or convergence of the flow field at the interface plane which in turn is only possible because the air water interface is not a rigid wall and the liquid phase can move at the surface parallel plane banerjee 1990 jähne and hauβecker 1998 banerjee and macintyre 2004 turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 as a consequence the surface normal turbulent motions can be much more intense close to the interface albeit being zero exactly at the interface than those close to a rigid wall combining the non zero divergent of the surface parallel motions with some other assumptions for high s c l a model for the liquid film mass transfer coefficient is derived in which k l is proportional to the square root of the mean square divergence of the surface parallel turbulent motions and scales proportionally to d l 1 2 see banerjee 1990 banerjee and macintyre 2004 and turney and banerjee 2013 for more details the application of such model requires the value of the root mean square divergence of the surface parallel turbulent motions which can be locally measured using piv e g turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 or may be parametrised for some cases based on other bulk variables e g banerjee 1990 banerjee and macintyre 2004 and turney and banerjee 2013 however none of the existing models utilises variables that are all available or can be reasonably estimated in the usual situations of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps a different take on the surface divergence mechanism was presented by csanady 1990 who solved simplified transport equations for the flow field and mass transfer in an ideal model roller supposed to represent the basic features of a microscale breaking wave with further assumptions including the idea that the intense divergences are determined by variations of the wind stress csanady 1990 was able to simplify the resulting model in the form of equation 17 17 k l ς ϕ u l s c l 1 2 where ς is a dimensionless constant and ϕ represents the fraction of the liquid surface effective in mass transfer i e the areas where surface divergence occur and their surroundings for these parameters csanady 1990 suggests ς 0 513 and ϕ 0 2 but he pointed out that ϕ would change depending on the wind wave field a complete different approach relies on dimensional scaling lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 proposing that mass transfer in the liquid side of the gas liquid interface can be modelled by a film like representation therefore k l d l d l see item i 1 in supplementary material but with the effective film thickness scaling proportionally to batchelor s 1959 length scale l b that is d l l b batchelor s 1959 length scale l b represents the scale of the smallest turbulent fluctuations of the concentration field for high s c l l b is of order l b 2 π ν d l 2 ε 1 4 batchelor 1959 with ν being the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 of the liquid phase and ε the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy m2 s 3 in the liquid side of the interface boundary layer in this case this scaling argument leads to the general k l form written in equation 18 lorke and peeters 2006 zappa et al 2007 which also contains the schmidt number dependency with power 1 2 it is interesting to note that the proportionality in equation 18 was also obtained by lamont and scott 1970 their equation number 17 as a result of their small eddy cell model following a different mathematical path 18 k l ε ν 1 4 s c l 1 2 similarly to the other approaches discussed above the practical application of an equation with the form of equation 18 for the estimation of emissions in wwtps would depend on a reliable parametrisations for one of its key variables since ε is not normally measured in the field in this context 3 1 2 experimental insights on the mechanisms determining k l at passive liquid surfaces the importance of wind friction in determining the velocity of mass transfer at the liquid side of passive liquid surfaces has been repeatedly verified in controlled experimental studies liss 1973 cohen et al 1978 mackay and yeun 1983 jähne et al 1987 ocampo torres et al 1994 rhee et al 2007 turney and banerjee 2013 nonetheless there is not clear agreement in terms of the functional relationships when the results of individual investigations are compiled together as further discussed in item 3 2 the considerable scatter of these data is normally attributed to differences of the experimental conditions and setups especially wind speed range and wind fetch differences which also are present in the practical application of emission models for wwtps which in turn are certain to influence the underlying physical processes on the other hand given the intrinsic difficulties of investigating multi scale flow features and microscopic chemical transport in the surroundings of a disturbed air water interface such physical mechanisms and their relation with the different theoretical models are rarely demonstrated in an unambiguous way and even more difficult is to generalise the conclusions of each study although relevant insights have been reported in the literature as following discussed except maybe in cases where the water surface is almost perfectly flat the description of the liquid side mass transfer as determined by the development of a smooth turbulent boundary layer in the liquid due to surface currents caused directly by the wind shear as proposed by deacon 1977 does not hold once surface waves appear there is overwhelming experimental evidence indicating that the dynamics of mass transfer changes in the presence of waves compared to a smooth flat surface as discussed in 3 1 1 a fundamental change observed with the onset of surface ripples and waves is the shift of the dependency of k l on s c l nominally from a power s c l 2 3 to a power s c l 1 2 or equivalently a shift of the dependency of k l on d l from a power d l 2 3 to a power d l 1 2 which has been consistently verified in experiments e g jähne et al 1987 jähne and hauβecker 1998 zappa et al 2004 rhee et al 2007 albeit showing that as long as waves are formed mass transfer is not dominated by a turbulent smooth boundary layer in the liquid side this does not clarify about the exact mass transfer mechanism since different proposed mechanisms would lead to the same scaling of k l with d l 1 2 item 3 1 1 the presence of surface ripples and waves is shown to enhance the rate of mass transfer of liquid side controlled compounds early evidence of the direct link between mass transfer and wave dynamics was reported by jähne et al 1987 who identified that k l correlated with the mean square slope of the waves and in that case both variables presented an overall correlation with u l those authors hypothesised that energy put into the wave field by wind is transferred to near surface turbulence enhancing gas transfer and highlighted the necessity of investigating the way the waves are connected with the near surface turbulence in this context the occurrence of microscale wave breaking has been identified to be of primary importance for the liquid side mass transfer peirson and banner 2003 zappa et al 2004 siddiqui and loewen 2007 turney and banerjee 2013 peirson et al 2014 using infrared images of the water surface zappa et al 2004 were able to define the dominant areas of enhanced heat transfer as the wakes of microscale breaking waves and have an approximate measure of the fraction of the water surface under the direct influence of microscale breaking although measured locally in the field of view of the infrared imaging camera nominally at fetches 5 6 and 11 1 m such fraction showed a non trivial but significant correlation with k l for helium he and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 in the whole tank 18 29 m long besides the fraction of the water surface under the direct influence of microscale breaking also correlated with the mean square slope of the waves which relates straightforward to the earlier findings of jähne et al 1987 peirson and banner 2003 propose that microscale breaking increases the mass transfer rate mainly by the subduction of a thin mass transfer boundary layer at the spilling region of the breaking crests siddiqui and loewen 2007 applied piv and observed the occurrence of turbulent vortexes coherent structures that are formed at the spilling region of the breaking crests and move to the wake of the microscale breaking waves being able to associate such structures to the thermal wakes captured by infrared imagery they hypothesise that these vortexes disrupt the mass and heat transfer boundary layer in a renewal like mechanism enhancing mass transfer turney and banerjee 2013 suggest a model that combines surface divergence and surface renewal and apply it to their piv measurements of the liquid phase motions in situations of microscale breaking identifying that persistent upwelling events in the region upwind the wave crest are significant for mass transfer other experimental studies also point to the relation between k l and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ε zappa et al 2007 showed that a collection of k l results obtained experimentally under different types of forcing including besides wind cases with tidal currents and rain could be generally described by a relation of the form of equation 18 but the data is considerably scattered around the fitted line vachon et al 2010 utilised a data set comprising exchange rates of carbon dioxide co2 measured experimentally in lakes using a floating accumulation chamber simultaneously to measurements of ε in the water a relation of the form of equation 18 and similar proportionality constant as found by zappa et al 2007 adjusted moderately well to the data set but was not the best fit the best fitting equation form was writing k l as a linear function of the logarithm of ε which described the overall variation in the data set also with considerable scatter around the fitted line it is important to mention that in both studies ε was not measured in the immediate vicinities of the gas liquid interface as the theoretical models would rigorously require the piv results of siddiqui and loewen 2007 also provide indirect support for a strong relation between k l and ε besides showing that ε correlated to the mean square slope of the waves which establishes a link with the findings of jähne et al 1987 mentioned before they identify that the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy near the water surface is highly enhanced in microscale breaking waves which could explain the substantial increases in the value of k l in the presence of microscale breaking observed in other studies additionally siddiqui and loewen 2007 report that ε depends on u l which is in agreement at least qualitatively with a large number of controlled experiments of liquid gas mass transfer that show a correlation between u l and k l item 3 2 the effects of macroscale breaking on the liquid side mass transfer are still to be clarified in particular for the wind wave fields that can be expected at the short fetches that are the typical case in wwtps the plunging and intense spilling associated with macroscale breaking certainly produce intense turbulence in the water and together with the generation of bubbles whitecaps will probably enhance local mass transfer however macroscale breaking is likely to be sparse in liquid surfaces in wwtps as discussed in 2 1 6 hence its effect on the overall mass transfer rates may not be so pronounced in this sense rhee et al 2007 found that bubbles from whitecaps did not have a significant role in the mass transfer of several compounds in a 40 m long wind wave tank the range of air side friction velocities in their experiments was up to 0 6 m s 1 more studies covering a broader range of fetches and wind conditions are necessary to conclusively state that macroscale breaking can be neglected in the present context 3 1 3 empirical correlations for k l similarly to what happens for k g the literature reports a number of correlations for k l in passive liquid surfaces derived from empirical data many k l expressions for environmental passive liquid surfaces were recently reviewed by ro et al 2007 and we refer the reader to their work for more detail therefore the present paper does not aim to review the variety of the existing correlations but instead focuses on the k l correlations that are most widely used in the context of emission modelling for wwtps which are explained below the two complementary equations proposed by mackay and yeun 1983 adopted by the model toxchem the correlation used by gostelow et al 2001 in their emission model and the approach followed by the us epa endorsed emission model water9 us epa 1994 2001 mackay and yeun 1983 the experiments of mackay and yeun 1983 were generally described in 2 1 7 the mass transfer coefficients for several vocs were determined from the decaying of their concentration in the liquid phase and equation 19 was fitted to their data set since the minimum u in their experiment was 0 271 m s 1 mackay and yeun 1983 suggest that the range of application of equation 19 is u 0 3 m s 1 and that equation 20 modified from wolff and van der heijde 1982 should be used for u 0 3 m s 1 in both cases they introduced an intercept of 1 10 6 to account for an still air mass transfer coefficient 19 k l 1 10 6 34 1 10 4 u s c l 1 2 20 k l 1 10 6 144 10 4 u 2 2 s c l 1 2 gostelow et al 2001 the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 for k l in passive liquid surfaces equation 21 was derived in a similar way as their k g correlation item 2 1 7 more details can also be found in gostelow 2002 that is by fitting a straight line with zero intercept to an experimental data set in this case assuming k l to scale with s c l 1 2 the data set consisted of experimental k l for different compounds and respective u compiled from five different sources which performed their experiments in wind wave tanks liss 1973 oxygen o2 and co2 cohen et al 1978 benzene mackay and yeun 1983 benzene and toluene wanninkhof and bliven 1991 sf6 and ocampo torres et al 1994 co2 since this same data set is also used in the present analysis item 3 2 contains additional comments on these experiments overall the data set used by gostelow et al 2001 covered a range of fetches from 2 4 to 100 m and u from 0 047 to 1 046 m s 1 equivalent to u 10 from 1 5 to 26 4 m s 1 21 k l 3 5 10 3 u s c l 1 2 water9 approach the scheme adopted by water9 us epa 1994 2001 to model k l for passive liquid surfaces considers different equations depending on the ranges of wind speed u 10 u and the fetch to depth ratio i e the ratio x h where x is the total fetch and h is the water depth in the tank as summarised in table 5 in the examples presented by us epa 1994 and in the source code reported in us epa 2001 the effective diameter is used as the fetch parameter x the same situation happens for the calculation of k g as explained in item 2 1 7 nonetheless in the original studies from which equations 22 24 were built and the application ranges were defined springer et al 1984 lunney et al 1985 the fetch x adopted was the actual physical fetch in the experimental setup the surface length in the wind direction for this reason for the purposes of the present evaluation x will be always taken as the length of the tank in the direction of the wind the use of the effective diameter instead of the physical fetch may lead to systematic deviations in the calculation of k l as discussed by prata et al 2016 3 2 comparison among k l models against an experimental data set in this item different approaches for estimating k l in passive liquid surfaces are evaluated against a data set of relevant liquid phase controlled mass transfer results that we compile from the literature and presented in item ii 2 of supplementary material further analysis on the behaviour of the variation of k l with u in the present data set is developed in section iv of supplementary material and gives support for the construction of an alternate approach for the calculation of k l item 3 3 for the moment it suffices to say that this analysis indicates that the data from liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 might represent biased situations and if this is the case have to be treated separately within their own particularities in this context for a better evaluation of the different k l models the comparison between model predictions and experimental results will consider three sets of data the whole data set sub set a the whole data set for which u 10 is available i e excluding rhee et al 2007 sub set b the whole data set except liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 the experimental data set was used to test the theoretical models of deacon 1977 equation 13 münnich and flothmann 1975 equation 15 and banerjee and macintyre 2004 equation 16 and several empirical models for k l the model of csanady 1990 equation 17 was not evaluated separately since there is no clear information on how to estimate the parameter ϕ which is supposed to change with the wind wave field and the use of the value of ϕ suggested by csanady 1990 makes equation 17 practically coincide with equation 16 among the empirical models besides the three approaches discussed in item 3 1 3 most commonly used in the context of modelling atmospheric emissions in wwtps other models that are frequently cited in the literature were also tested lunney et al 1985 liss and merlivat 1986 wanninkhof 1992 cole and caraco 1998 schwarzenbach et al 2003 ro et al 2007 wanninkhof et al 2009 and vachon and prairie 2013 the empirical correlations that constitute these additional models are presented in section v of supplementary material table sm6 for the models that require the friction velocity in the liquid side this was calculated based on the friction velocity u in the gas side as u l u ρ g ρ l 1 2 where ρ g and ρ l are the densities of the air and water respectively corrected for the experimental temperatures fig 6 shows the comparison between the estimated k l and respective experimental k l normalised in the graphs by multiplying by s c l 1 2 and the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme are summarised in table 6 considering the whole data set and the sub sets a the whole data set for which u 10 is available and b the whole data set except liss 1973 and rhee et al 2007 for the theoretical models and for the empirical approaches of mackay and yeun 1983 gostelow et al 2001 and water9 us epa 1994 2001 table 5 also contains the relative error statistics regarding the alternate approach equations 25 and 26 which is discussed later 3 3 the data from liss 1973 was generally overestimated by all models except the theoretical model of deacon 1977 and the empirical model of lunney et al 1985 results in section v of supplementary material in especial see figure sm7a this might be due to the very shallow tank used in the experiments of liss 1973 which would explain the conformity of lunney s correlation since lunney et al 1985 also made measurements with very shallow water and a short fetch to derive one of their correlations on the other hand all the models that could be tested against the data of rhee et al 2007 i e the models that do not require u 10 tended to underestimate their data which in turn represent a situation of particularly high k l see discussion in section iv of supplementary material overall none of the models was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set for sub set b which excludes the two suspected biased situations results from liss 1973 rhee et al 2007 the performance of most models was significantly better normally falling in the expected range of uncertainty for liquid gas mass transfer models which typically varies from a factor of 2 10 according to turney and banerjee 2013 however even in this case no model performed remarkably well among the models most commonly used in the context of estimating emissions in wwtps mackay and yeun 1983 gostelow et al 2001 water9 the water9 approach produced the best results especially considering only sub set b of particular concern is the fact that the emission models of mackay and yeun 1983 and gostelow et al 2001 generally underestimated k l for the situations with larger fetch data from wanninkhof and bliven 1991 ocampo torres et al 1994 fig 6b and c which are probably the cases with most critical impact in terms of emissions in wwtps since larger emitting areas will be involved 3 3 development of an alternate approach for estimating k l based on an analysis of the behaviour of the variation of k l with u in the present data set section iv of supplementary material we propose here an alternate approach for the calculation of k l in sub set b as can be seen in figure sm6 section iv of supplementary material the data for longer fetch x 16 m in sub set b that is the data of wanninkhof and bliven 1991 ocampo torres et al 1994 collapse well together and in section iv of supplementary material it is shown that these data can be satisfactorily described by equation 25 additionally for fetches varying from 2 4 m to 16 m the data in sub set b can be modelled via equation 26 regarding equation 26 it is worth mentioning that vachon and prairie 2013 also found a k l correlation that depends on the logarithm of the fetch however their correlation was developed for lakes most of them with much larger fetches and do not perform well in the present data set results in section v of supplementary material therefore the approach devised here consists in the use of equation 25 for x 16 m and equation 26 for 2 4 m x 16 m in the equations k l and u are in m s 1 and x is in m 25 k l 4 31 10 3 u s c l 1 2 26 k l 1 191 2 551 log 10 x 10 3 u s c l 1 2 the performance of this new alternate approach in estimating k l is depicted in fig 7 and indicated by the relative errors rms positive extreme and negative extreme reported in table 5 it can be seen that for sub set b the alternate approach generates the best results among all the models and is particularly accurate for longer fetches equation 25 from a fluid dynamics perspective having u as an input variable is more robust than straightforward functions of u 10 since u has a more direct relation to the phenomena that determine liquid side mass transfer in passive surfaces discussion in 3 1 2 nevertheless because u is not directly measured in the typical situations of use of emission models an appropriate parametrisation for u is necessary see prata et al 2017 the alternate approach does not describe well the data from rhee et al 2007 and especially liss 1973 the results of liss 1973 are probably representative only of situations of short fetch and extremely shallow water 10 cm deep which is not a typical situation in wwtps for such very shallow depths the model of lunney et al 1985 seems more appropriate as discussed before on the other hand if the data of rhee et al 2007 is not affected by systematic errors which is not presently clear and the values of k l are actually higher for tanks with fetch of around 40 60 m see further hypothesis in section iv of supplementary material this would have important consequences for the modelling of emissions in wwtps thus more studies are desired to clarify the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m and to adapt the models if necessary 4 conclusions different theoretical and empirical models for k g and k l in passive surfaces in wwtps were critically reviewed and evaluated against relevant experimental data sets wind forcing represented by u and the development of the wind wave field which depends on the wind fetch in special the occurrence of microscale wave breaking were identified as the most important physical factors affecting mass transfer in these situations presently there is no compelling confirmation of any of the theoretical mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain the behaviour of mass transfer in both liquid and gas sides of the gas liquid interface i e to mechanistically model the mass transfer coefficients k g and k l regarding the gas film mass transfer coefficient k g the correlation of gostelow et al 2001 was the one with best performance among the empirical models keeping in mind its major limitations not including x and imposing a proportionality to s c g 0 67 it figures as a reasonable choice for rapid and simple estimates of k g the models of brutsaert 1975 and deacon 1977 which are based on the description of the inner part of the turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate are also interesting alternatives especially for research purposes and may constitute conservative choices in the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps to be applied for practical purposes however these models have to be used together with an appropriate parametrisation of the boundary layer thickness over the studied surface equation 11 presented as a preliminary option equation 12 developed by minimising the errors related to the compiled set of data generally resulted in the lowest values of k g thus it may not be the more conservative approach for impact assessment a very concerning outcome of the evaluation of the emission models is that the model of mackay and matsugu 1973 which is the equation utilised in the model water9 endorsed by the us epa and generally accepted as a regulatory model for the assessment of atmospheric emissions in wwtps performed poorly in describing the experimental data set with respect to the models for k l none was able to satisfactorily explain the behaviour and the scatter observed in the whole experimental data set excluding the two suspected biased situations results from liss 1973 rhee et al 2007 the water9 approach produced the best results among the most commonly used emission models although still with considerably high relative errors for this same sub set we proposed an alternate approach equations 25 and 26 which presented considerably improved performance compared to the other models particularly for longer fetches our critical review and evaluation of emission models also points out that additional research is required for accomplishing further improvements and validation of mass transfer models for passive liquid surfaces in wwtps in especial the following knowledge gaps were identified investigations on the evolution of the mass transfer boundary layer over liquid surfaces in order to elucidate the appropriate dependency of k g on u and s c g if it scales with s c g 2 3 s c g 0 67 or follows a more complex relation as expressed in brutsaert s model and studies on the behaviour of k l for larger fetches especially in the range from 40 to 60 m moreover it is important to notice that the emission models discussed here represent simplified situations and other factors such as surface films broecker et al 1978 and bubbling grant et al 2013 may be present in the field and have the potential to increase the deviations between model predictions and actual emission rates it is also worthy to mention that liquid gas mass transfer models are frequently applied to study the fate of compounds in environments other than wwtps sometimes the same models used for wwtps are adopted for instance qiu et al 2008 and the recent work by tao et al 2017 make use of some of the correlations of mackay and yeun 1983 in this regard although the discussion herein has been focused on models for the mass transfer coefficients in wwtps which were therefore tested against experimental data obtained under conditions that resemble many of the critical physical aspects of the liquid surfaces found in wwtps the outcomes of the present paper can be extrapolated to such other environmental situations as long as the same conditions in terms of fetch and wind speed are observed acknowledgements authors acknowledge the sponsorship from coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior capes and conselho nacional de

19796,elemental sulfur s0 is always produced during bio denitrification and desulfurization process but the s0 yield and purification quality are too low till now no feasible approach has been carried out to efficiently recover s0 in this study we report the s0 generation and recovery by a newly designed compact biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor bfmfr where s0 was generated within a thauera sp strain hdd formed biofilm on membrane surface and then timely separated from the biofilm through membrane filtration the high s0 generation efficiency 98 in average was stably maintained under the operation conditions with the influent acetate nitrate and sulfide concentration of 115 120 and 100 mg l respectively an initial inoculum volume of approximate 2 4 108 cells and a membrane pore size of 0 45 μm under this condition the sulfide loading approached 62 5 kg m3 d one of the highest compared with the previous reports demonstrating an efficient sulfide removal and s0 generation capacity particular important a solid analysis of the effluent revealed that the recovered s0 was adulterated with barely microorganisms extracellular polymeric substances epss or inorganic chemicals indicating a fairly high s0 recovery purity membrane biofilm analysis revealed that 80 7 of the generated s0 was accomplished within 45 80 μm of biofilm from the membrane surface and while the complete membrane fouling due to bacteria and epss was generally observed after 14 16 days the in situ generation and timely separation of s0 from the bacterial group by bfmfr effectively avoids the sulfur circulation s2 to s0 s0 to so4 2 so4 2 to hs and guarantees the high s0 recovery efficiency and purity is considered as a feasible approach for s0 recovery from sulfide and nitrate contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor denitrification and desulfurization s0 recovery s0 purity removal of sulfide and nitrate 1 introduction sulfate and ammonia nitrate laden wastewater are widely generated from oil refineries paper mills pharmaceutical factories etc altaş and büyükgüngör 2008 hao et al 2014 pikaar et al 2014 although both s and n exist in various valent states in environment sulfide and nitrate are the two common forms of contaminants in these kind of industrial wastewater or biological treatment units originated from sulfate reduction and ammonia nitrification pokorna and zabranska 2015a show et al 2013 sulfide is corrosive and odorous and its concentration can reach to as high as 600 800 mg s l in the effluents of these industries sahinkaya et al 2011 the release of sulfide accounted for approximately 40 of the total toxic weighted pound equivalents twpe of the toxics release inventory tri in the us of 2013 us environmental protection agency 2015 therefore the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and cod are tough assignment for treatment of these kinds of wastewater the recent developed denitrification desulfurization process which enables bio oxidization of sulfide to elemental sulfur s0 or sulfate using nitrate as an electron acceptor show et al 2013 wang et al 2005 supplies a feasible approach during treating the nitrate and sulfide rich industrial wastewater wang et al 2009 sulfate as the terminal sulfide oxidation metabolite is inclined to be reduced back to sulfide once organic carbons electron donors are abundant huang et al 2015a also high concentrations of sulfate can induce a noticeable taste 400 mg l or even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l world health organization 2011 in contrast terminating the oxidation reaction at s0 not only reduces the energy demands but also holds the great value because the separated s0 could possibly be reused as fertilizer or the raw material for sulfuric acid production blázquez et al 2016 chung et al 2013 therefore several studies have conducted focusing on s0 generation and recovery in various bioreactor types such as the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors the expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactors the continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs the anoxic sulfide oxidizing reactor asos etc cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2011 although the satisfactory s0 generation efficiencies have been demonstrated in some of the studies achieving the high s0 generation performance is considered challenging since it requires the precise regulation of the operation parameters such as the sulfide nitrate cod ratios or loadings hydraulic retention time and etc cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2011 in addition the subsequent recovered s0 from either inside the above mentioned bioreactors or using the effluents are difficult since i most of the reactors inoculates the activated sludge as the microbial source and thus the generated s0 frequently merges with the mixtures of microbes epss and inorganic matter ohmura et al 1996 which hinders the s0 further recovery ii the formed s0 tends to be further oxidized or reduced back due to the presence of bacteria in the sludge or on the s0 surface pokorna and zabranska 2015b therefore the improved techniques that could timely separate the newly generated s0 from the reaction zone and meanwhile guarantee the high s0 generation rate and sulfide nitrate and cod removal rates are in urgent need xie et al 2016 the recent developed membrane separation based technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have demonstrated as the emerging technics for the recovery of nutrients from wastewater including ammonium phosphate potassium and etc blöcher et al 2012 maurer et al 2006 mccarty et al 2011 xie et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 meanwhile membrane works as an excellent biocarrier for microbial growth as far several modified membrane dependent bioreactors have been developed and favorable denitrification performance has been observed given the different kinds of electron donors or acceptors the short organic acids o2 sulfur and etc ergas and rheinheimer 2004 mcadam and judd 2007 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 sulfide oxidation were once reported in an oxygen based membrane biofilm by optimizing the influent loadings or o2 pressure sahinkaya et al 2011 however the recovered s0 purity was not mentioned in this study up to date no membrane related study has reported for the bio s0 generation and recovery through the denitrification desulfurization process normally the generated bio s0 granules are much smaller with the size 1 μm than bacteria 1 2 μm in size according to the microscopic observations kleinjan et al 2003 madigan et al 2014 this inspires us that whether the membrane can work as the biocarrier and meanwhile realize the in situ recovery of s0 by timely separating the generated s0 from the bacteria group with the similar principle of pressure driven and membrane rejection therefore in this study we proposed a biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor bfmfr with a compact design for the in situ generation and recovery of s0 through denitrification desulfurization process in this reactor the simulated water containing certain concentration of sulfide nitrate and sodium acetate were applied as the influent acetate one of the simplest organic acids was applied for the simulation of cod s0 was initially generated in the biofilm formed membrane and then timely separated with the bacterial group into the effluent by pressure driven and membrane filtration the aim was to explore the feasibility of a membrane based technique to efficiently recovery of s0 and improve the s0 recovery purity thauera sp strain hdd capable of oxidizing sulfide to s0 to sulfate was utilized to verify the proof of concept s0 recovery efficiency and reactor longevity were evaluated under the different operation parameters the morphology element contents and structure of the recovered s0 in the effluent were characterized the three dimensional architecture of the biofilm formed on the surface of the membrane and the biofilm activity were analyzed and quantified 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals microbial sources and s0 generation optimization sodium sulfide 99 99 no 431648 sodium acetate 90 no s2889 and sodium nitrate 99 99 no 204110 were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis usa thauera sp strain hdd a heterotrophic denitrifying sulfide oxidation bacterium isolated from a long term continuously maintained uasb reactor huang et al 2017 was utilized as the bacterial source for the bfmfr strain hdd is capable of oxidizing sulfide to s0 to sulfate by utilizing nitrate as an electron acceptor the detailed cultivation methods and nutrient demands are described in supplementary information si batch array tests and cubic spline algorithm simulation analyses were conducted to determine the optimal concentration range for achieving a high s0 generation rate by fixing the sulfide concentration and altering the concentrations of acetate 0 125 mg l and nitrate 0 500 mg l concentration of sulfide were fixed at 100 mg l s since the too high sulfide concentration would induce the bio toxicity hao et al 2014 batch array experiments were conducted in 48 well culture clusters coring3548 coring usa consisting 45 wells fed hdd and 3 wells without hdd as the blank controls each well held the approximate volume of 1200 μl nine sets of independent batch tests were conducted with five duplicates for each set each well with bacteria contained 950 μl of the culture solution and 50 μl of hdd suspension taken from the logarithmic phase od600 nm 0 3 culture solution contained micronutrients and certain concentration of sulfide nitrate and acetate the prepared cluster was sealed using pcr sealing film pcr ts axygen usa and incubated at 30 c for 24 h the concentrates of s0 sulfide thiosulfate s2o3 2 sulfate acetate nitrate and nitrite no2 were measured every 1 h from 24 successive prepared clusters then cubic spline algorithm simulation analysis was conducted by matlab software the mathworks usa and the calculation of interpolation was based on the code from the matlab s online forum the methods to determine the strain hdd growth curves and calculate the s0 generation rates the s0 yield for a single cell per second under batch conditions are described in the si after the reaction the morphology of strain hdd and formed s0 were measured under the transmission electron microscope tem by positive and negative staining with the detailed methods as shown in si 2 2 system setup operation parameters and operation conditions the setup of the bfmfr is shown in fig 1 the bioreactor consisted of a cylindrical glass made tank with an operating volume of 12 56 ml and a submerged flat sheet polyolefin membrane module navigator tianjin china with an effective filtration area of 12 56 cm2 the reaction zone containing the tank and membrane was the actual reaction zone the funnel below the membrane was applied for s0 capitation a synthetic wastewater influent connected

collect bottle by latex pipes 25 signal shijiazhuang china which works as the function of filtration the filtered water was collected in a 100 ml glass tank the flow rate of the system can be maintained at approximately 0 3 l per day before operation the dissolved oxygen was removed from the influent tank and anaerobic conditions were maintained by continuously supplying argon gas purity 99 99 liming co harbin china the liquid was replenished under an anaerobic workstation bactron shellab cornelius usa a pressure gauge was applied for monitoring the permeate pressure using an electronic pressure gauge arduino uno ivrea italy all glass instruments and latex pipes were sterilized before use the reactors were operated at 30 c in a thermostatic room in the steadily maintained bfmfr strain hdd was mostly deposited on the membrane as a biofilm thus the contact time t of the denitrification desulfurization reaction was approximately equal to the time of the contact flux through the biofilm which was calculated using the following equation t ε v j where j is the water flux v is the accumulated volume of the biofilm and ε is the biocake porosity the values of ε were determined based on optical sectional images that were obtained using confocal laser scan microscopy clsm nikon eclipse ti tokyo japan the sectioned images were reconstructed into a three dimensional

triplicate 3 results 3 1 s0 generation efficiency in batch array tests by strain hdd from the batch array tests the highest generated s0 was 84 4 mg l and 80 2 mg l at 8 h and 24 h respectively fig 2 a and c at 8 h the optimal region of s0 generation 80 mg l can be achieved when acetate was around 75 125 mg l and nitrate was around of 100 500 mg l black dotted circle fig 2a while under these conditions the generated sulfate was maintained at 10 14 mg l fig 2b as the reaction time extended s0 further oxidation to sulfate was commonly observed under all of the conditions fig 2b and d at 24 h the highest sulfate concentration approached at 91 4 mg l indicating that 35 69 of generated s0 was converted to sulfate fig 2d the lowest sulfate generation zones were kept under the acetate and nitrate concentration of 40 110 mg l and 0 200 mg l respectively and while under these conditions the s0 generation efficiency could be maintained at around 75 black dotted circle fig 2c si table s3 the optimal acetate and nitrate concentrations were 75 125 mg l and 100 200 mg l respectively when the applied sulfide was 100 mg l under this concentration range the s0 generation efficiency was averagely maintained at 84 and the generated sulfate was lower than 20 by strain hdd si table s3 therefore the influent nitrate acetate and sulfide concentration in bfmfr was initially set at 120 mg l 115 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 3 2 bfmfr performance the performance of the bfmfr including s0 generation efficiency removals of sulfide nitrate and acetate as well as the system tmp were investigated under the different pore sizes influent concentrations and inoculum volumes are shown in figs 3 and 4 and table s4 in general the s0 generation efficiency was maintained at a relatively high level 89 3 93 5 under the different membrane pore sizes 0 22 0 45 and 1 μm conditions i ii and vi in fig 3 respectively membrane fouling was majorly resulted from pore blocking and cake layer formation caused by mass propagation and eps production fig 6h and i biomass growth on the membrane surface will form a cake layer on membrane surface at the same time the eps secreted by the biomass would easily enter the membrane pore which lead to a severe pore blocking allen et al 2004 malaeb et al 2013 membrane fouling restricted the longevity of the bfmfr to approximately 14 16 days under the optimal operation conditions proliferation and eps production given the larger pore size 1 μm condition vi 14 5 mg l of sulfate in average was detected in the effluent this was probably due to the s0 over oxidization since some of the free bacteria could penetrate through the membrane under the large pore size and further oxidize s0 to sulfate with the water flow to effluent condition vi in fig 3 si table s4 the results were agree with the batch array test results that under all of the conditions s0 over oxidation to sulfate was commonly observed as the reaction time extended fig 2 under condition ii with the pore size of 0 45 μm over 90 of s0 generation rate was achieved and the removal rates of sulfide nitrate and acetate obtained over 95 condition ii in fig 3 si table s4 the complete membrane fouling was occurred after the continuous running for 14 d condition ii in fig 3 the acetate nitrate and sulfide concentrations were individually increased to examine the reactor performance under the membrane pore sizes of 0 45 μm as the influent acetate increased from 115 mg l to 500 mg l the s0 generation efficiency quickly approached 100 on the 2nd day and remained constant for the following 5 days condition iii in fig 3 the abundance of acetate carbon source obviously promoted the denitrification desulfurization process and s0 generation probably caused by the rapid growth of sulfur oxidizing bacteria which was consistent with the previous report by chen et al 2015 however the excess amount of acetate 195 6 mg l in average flowed out from the effluent because of acetate excessive dosing condition iii in fig 4 si table s4 which resulted in the severe membrane fouling tmp 51 1 kpa that occurred 2 3 days earlier than condition ii fig 3 when supplying with 500 mg l of nitrate the removal rates of acetate and sulfide approached 100 and the high s0 generation efficiency 94 4 on average could be stably maintained condition iv in figs 3 and 4 however the higher nitrate influent concentration led to a large amount of unreacted nitrate 135 6 mg l in average leaving the reactor the complete membrane fouling was occurred on the 13th day one day ahead of condition ii as the sulfide concentration increased to 300 mg l the removal rates of acetate and nitrate approached to 100 however the s0 generation efficiency became much lower 31 1 on average and certain amount of unreacted sulfide 83 6 in average flowed out from the reactor condition v in figs 3 and 4 when the initial inoculum volume decreased to 5 ml approximately 1 2 108 cells condition vii in fig 3 a low s0 generation efficiency 87 5 was observed during the first 3 days compared with condition ii which was probably attributed to the slow bacterial growth rate after 5 days the s0 generation efficiency increased to 98 4 100 while it decreased to 85 1 as the tmp increased to 30 3 kpa on day 16 under this condition removal rates of sulfide nitrate and acetate can approach over 95 condition vii in fig 3 si table s4 as the initial inoculum volume further increased 20 ml approximately 4 8 108 cells condition viii in fig 3 the s0 generation efficiency quickly approached 95 on the 1st day however the membrane was completely fouled after 6 days of operation since the tmp increased to 43 2 kpa inoculating the higher strain hdd concentration accelerated the membrane fouling the above studies suggested that condition ii was optimal for the high rate and efficient maintenance generation of s0 if the influent concentrations or inoculum volumes were extreme either a low s0 generation efficiency or side reactions occurred which accelerated the membrane fouling and shortened the reactor longevity 3 3 the characteristic and quality of recovered s0 the morphology element contents and structure of the recovered solids in effluents of the stable maintained bfmfr condition ii were determined using sem xps and xrd fig 5 a b and c to make the clear comparisons the solids in the effluent of a steadily maintained uasb reactor average s0 generation rate of 78 huang et al 2017 were analyzed fig 5d f si fig s2 a c from the sem observations the recovered solids in the bfmfr effluent were majorly smooth and spherical granules edx analysis detected the solids in effluent of bfmfr was predominant with sulfur element and trace contents of carbon nitrogen and metallic element na indicating the relatively high purity of the recovered s0 fig 5a in contrast the solid samples in the effluent of the uasb reactor were mostly in a crystal solid form with the irregular shapes from the sem observation fig 5d and si fig s2 a c the edx analysis revealed the solids were composed of a mixture of sulfur carbon oxygen and various metallic elements such as na k or mg fig 5d as predicted these results revealed that the complex components besides sulfur such as a bacterial mixture were present in the effluent of the uasb reactor xps was applied to evaluate the valences of the recovered solid samples from the two reactors fig 5b and e in the bfmfr only one intensive peak sulfur valence of 0 was predominant at 163 6 164 0 ev fig 5b in comparison there were three sulfur valence forms determined at 162 0 163 6 ev 6 163 6 164 0 ev 0 and 167 0 170 0 ev 2 in the uasb reactor fig 5e by comparison the peak with sulfur valence of 6 was much smaller and can be negligible from bfmfr effluent the results confirmed the much simpler sulfur existed form as s0 in bfmfr effluent than in the uasb reactor both the effluents of bfmfr and uasb presented an intensive peak between the diffraction angle of 23 and 28 through xrd analysis corresponded to s0 that correlated to the standard card for sulfur no 08 0247 fig 5 c and f the above analysis confirmed that s0 was recovered in both the bfmfr and uasb reactors however the s0 recovered from the bfmfr held a much higher purity in contrast the recovered s0 in uasb reactor effluent was adulterated with microorganisms or other chemical compounds including s2 or so4 2 3 4 biofilm characteristics and membrane fouling of bfmfr typical sem and clsm micrographs of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface were measured and the biofilm morphology and structures were monitored on the 1st day 6th day and 12th day under condition ii fig 6a and b shows the section view and surface view profiles of the initial biomass on the membrane at the first day as soon as the inoculation of the strain hdd at this point the biofilm layer was barely visible sporadic spots of bacterial colonization were observed on the membrane surface fig 6c even this slight colonization enabled a s0 generation efficiency of 80 9 fig 3b and table s4 on the 6th day the membrane was covered with a biofilm layer and the visible particles were assembled on the surface however the tmp was still relatively low at this point less than 1 kpa fig 3b fig 6d and e the growth of strain hdd was clearly observed using clsm although membrane pores were still visible at that time fig 6f in the meantime the s0 generation efficiency increased to 98 9 the 6th day based on the bacterial proliferation fig 3b after 12 days a completely mature and compacted biofilm was observed and an evident eps matrix was embedded in the biofilm fig 6g h and i under this condition the s0 generation rate decreased to 89 2 and the tmp exceeded 22 7 kpa the 12th day fig 3b these results were attributed to the large amount of epss generated which blocked the membrane pores and increased the retention of s0 inside the biofilm fig 6i then the ph concentration of the dissolved sulfide and do profiles were measured using microsensors condition ii as shown in fig 7 the thickness of the mature biofilm was approximately 80 μm the 12th day the concentration of sulfide was approximately 80 3 mg l near the biofilm surface which significantly dropped to 15 5 mg l at a depth of 45 μm afterwards a much slower decreasing trend was observed these results indicated that 80 7 of the sulfide was consumed in the upper and middle sections 80 45 μm of the biofilm layers while the remaining sulfide 19 3 was completely consumed in the lower section between 45 μm and 5 μm of the biofilm layer from the membrane base along the biofilm layer the ph significantly increased from 8 0 to 8 7 the decrease in the ph was one indicator of the denitrification process lu et al 2014 moraes et al 2012 in addition do was undetectable demonstrating the prevalence of anaerobic conditions in the biofilm the microsensor results revealed the significant sulfide oxidization activity in upper and middle layers of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface 4 discussion 4 1 the sulfur fates in the bfmfr and conventional bioreactors after the batch array tests the morphologies of strain hdd and formed s0 were observed through tem analysis strain hdd was 0 4 0 7 1 0 1 5 μm in size and while the generated s0 was 50 nm in diameter and extensively assembled on the external and inner surfaces of the bacterial membranes fig s3 thus s0 could easily pass through membrane pores as soon as it was generated due to the water flow under the suitable membrane pore size and while the bacterial groups and eps matrix were rejected on the membrane surface under the suitable membrane pore size no reactional acetate nitrate and sulfide could pass through membrane pores which effectively prevented the occurrence of s0 further oxidation the in situ separation of the recovered s0 from the bacteria largely improved the s0 purity in the effluent and simultaneously avoided the s0 further oxidization or reduction during the follow up treatment fig 5 si fig s4 in comparison the analysis of the granule sludge inside the uasb reactor using sem edx and raman spectroscopy showed that s0 was inhomogeneously distributed and embedded in a matrix of microbes epss and inorganic matter containing multiple elements such as c o na k and cl si fig s2 d f and fig s4 the same phenomenon was observed in the sludge granules of other bioreactors such as a cstr huang et al 2015a and an anaerobic baffled reactor abr huang et al 2015b data not shown this further indicated that the generated sulfur was in various forms and mixed with bacteria and other chemicals therefore we hypothesized that the sulfur metabolism progressed as a circulation process s2 to s0 s0 to so4 2 so4 2 to hs that was difficult to control or interrupt inside the previously studied conventional bioreactors even though the high s0 generation rates were obtained in some of the abovementioned reactors cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 4 2 s0 recovery rate in the bfmfr the bfmfr produced the high s0 recovery efficiencies 89 3 94 8 under the effective contact times between 56 3 and 80 5 s except for the condition when the sulfide was overloaded fig 3 and table 1 indicating an efficient s0 recovery capacity as calculated the sulfide loading applied in this study was 62 5 kg m3 d which is one of the highest sulfide loadings compared to the previous reports using the same calculation method si table s5 a cstr 0 29 kg m3 d reyes avila et al 2004 an egsb reactor 6 09 kg m3 d chen et al 2008 an aso reactor 3 40 kg m3 d cai et al 2008 or a uasb reactor 0 66 kg m3 d huang et al 2017 one reason for this high treatment capacity was due to the application of the single strain hdd and however in most of the previously reported studies the activated sludge or contaminated water or sediments were inoculated as the microbial sources the inoculation of the single strain effectively avoided the nutrient competition between sulfide oxidation and other metabolism processes e g methanogenesis and anaerobic fermentation additionally strain hdd possesses a 99 9 similarity with thauera sp strain mz1t from the 16s rrna gene sequence which has a genome that contains the complete enzyme system for sulfide oxidization adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase and sulfur oxidation ncbi bioproject prjna20091 this similarity ensured that s0 would be efficiently generated in the membrane on a genetic basis in addition from the batch array tests the max of a single cell per second was calculated as 2 8 10 9 mg cell s si fig s5 in the meantime the sulfide was mostly consumed by the biofilm the formed s0 passed through membrane and thereafter increased the sulfide concentration difference across the membrane in bfmfr therefore the sulfide concentration difference formed in the bfmfr possibly resulted in a faster reaction rate compared with the batch condition despite the high efficiency in bfmfr for the further industrial application engineering bacteria or mixed consortia would be applied instead of the pure culture and while the system efficiency and performance would possibly be influenced 4 3 nitrate acetate and sulfide transformation mechanism as far there is no significant clarification on electron transport and energy conservation for the denitrification and desulfurization bacteria herrmann et al 2008 wu et al 2006 xu et al 2014 here electron balances were conducted to better understand the sulfur transformation and hdd working mechanism si tables s6 s8 autotrophic denitrification and desulfurization occurred when no acetate was added condition ii fig 2 si tables s6 s8 while the bacterial growth rate was comparable with the heterotrophic conditions si fig s5 when no nitrate was added neither acetate degradation nor sulfide oxidation happened confirming nitrate was working as an essential electron acceptor 92 86 of electron balance was obtained under condition iii and iv when nitrate acetate and sulfide were 125 250 mg l 100 125 mg l and 100 mg l respectively si tables s3 s6 s8 coincidently these conditions were just under the range for the highest s0 generation efficiencies in both batch tests nitrate acetate and sulfide of 100 500 mg l 75 125 mg l and 100 mg l and the continuous flow bfmfr nitrate acetate and sulfide of 120 mg l 115 mg l and 100 mg l figs 2 4 as nitrate concentration further increase condition v or the nitrate acetate ratio further increase conditions vi vii and ix the reduced electrons became excessive than the oxidized ones this might be caused by the further transformation of nitrate to ammonia jones et al 2017 which was not included into electron balance calculation meanwhile partial acetate organic carbon would be utilized for cell synthesis and growth instead of converting to co2 lee et al 2014 which also influenced the electron balance calculation the optimal nitrate acetate sulfide ratios for s0 generation from batch array tests and bfmfr by strain hdd were 1 0 1 6 1 9 condition iii and 0 8 1 1 6 condition ii respectively fig 2 si tables s6 s8 figs 3 and 4 the optimized ratios were similar between batch array tests and bfmfr but much more different from the optimized ones from both the previous studies s n molar ratio of 5 2 anoxic sulfide oxidizing reactor cai et al 2008 c n molar ratio of 1 26 1 egsb reactor chen et al 2008 s n molar ratio of 5 2 to 5 9 the continuous stirred tank reactor huang et al

believe it is not remarkable since the optimized ratio would vary based on the difference on strain type bacterial metabolism reactor type or performance and et al reyes avila et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 4 4 membrane fouling and bfmfr longevity high tmps were generally observed after continuously running the bfmfr for 2 12 days which subsequently decreased the s0 generation rate fig 3 membrane fouling was majorly resulted from pore blocking and cake layer formation caused by mass propagation and eps production fig 6h and i biomass growth on the membrane surface will form a cake layer on membrane surface at the same time the eps secreted by the biomass would easily enter the membrane pore which lead to a severe pore blocking allen et al 2004 malaeb et al 2013 membrane fouling restricted the longevity of the bfmfr to approximately 14 16 days under the optimal operation conditions decreasing the initial inoculum volume or increasing the pore volume extended the reactor longevity to 16 days or more this trend was attributed to either the low s0 generation rate especially during the first 3 days or the over oxidation of s0 to sulfate fig 3f and g si table s3 increasing the concentration of acetate or nitrate would accelerate the proliferation of strain hdd however the membrane fouling rate became faster than that under the other different conditions fig 3c and e membrane fouling is currently the greatest obstacle that hinders the development and application of membrane related technologies and the current effective solutions include a backwash strategy meng et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 therefore it was speculated that the backwash strategy could relieve membrane fouling and thus improve the sustainability of the whole reactor system this hypothesis will be explored in a further study 5 conclusions the application of a novel designed compact biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor by effectively controlling the sulfide acetate nitrate concentration inoculation volumes and membrane pore sizes not only enables the highly efficient conversion of aqueous sulfide to solid state s0 and the simultaneous removal of acetate and nitrate by strain hdd formed biofilm on membrane surface but also and most importantly realizes the in situ s0 separation and recovery in the effluent with the superior efficiency and purity by membrane rejection by interrupting the bioreaction process and timely separating the generated s0 from bacteria the bioreactor designed in this study solves the problems of the low s0 yield rate and the low s0 recovered purity that adulteration with bacteria and other inorganic chemicals thus is regarded as one step forward compared with the treatment process by the conventional bioreactors bfmfr had a maximum operation time nearly two weeks 14 16 days with pure culture of thauera sp strain hdd which may be lengthened by the subsequent back washing in view of the dramatic s0 recovery effect the simplicity of the process and its economic advantages bfmfr provides a feasible approach during treating of and resource recovery from some non complex nitrate and sulfide containing wastewater

19796,elemental sulfur s0 is always produced during bio denitrification and desulfurization process but the s0 yield and purification quality are too low till now no feasible approach has been carried out to efficiently recover s0 in this study we report the s0 generation and recovery by a newly designed compact biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor bfmfr where s0 was generated within a thauera sp strain hdd formed biofilm on membrane surface and then timely separated from the biofilm through membrane filtration the high s0 generation efficiency 98 in average was stably maintained under the operation conditions with the influent acetate nitrate and sulfide concentration of 115 120 and 100 mg l respectively an initial inoculum volume of approximate 2 4 108 cells and a membrane pore size of 0 45 μm under this condition the sulfide loading approached 62 5 kg m3 d one of the highest compared with the previous reports demonstrating an efficient sulfide removal and s0 generation capacity particular important a solid analysis of the effluent revealed that the recovered s0 was adulterated with barely microorganisms extracellular polymeric substances epss or inorganic chemicals indicating a fairly high s0 recovery purity membrane biofilm analysis revealed that 80 7 of the generated s0 was accomplished within 45 80 μm of biofilm from the membrane surface and while the complete membrane fouling due to bacteria and epss was generally observed after 14 16 days the in situ generation and timely separation of s0 from the bacterial group by bfmfr effectively avoids the sulfur circulation s2 to s0 s0 to so4 2 so4 2 to hs and guarantees the high s0 recovery efficiency and purity is considered as a feasible approach for s0 recovery from sulfide and nitrate contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor denitrification and desulfurization s0 recovery s0 purity removal of sulfide and nitrate 1 introduction sulfate and ammonia nitrate laden wastewater are widely generated from oil refineries paper mills pharmaceutical factories etc altaş and büyükgüngör 2008 hao et al 2014 pikaar et al 2014 although both s and n exist in various valent states in environment sulfide and nitrate are the two common forms of contaminants in these kind of industrial wastewater or biological treatment units originated from sulfate reduction and ammonia nitrification pokorna and zabranska 2015a show et al 2013 sulfide is corrosive and odorous and its concentration can reach to as high as 600 800 mg s l in the effluents of these industries sahinkaya et al 2011 the release of sulfide accounted for approximately 40 of the total toxic weighted pound equivalents twpe of the toxics release inventory tri in the us of 2013 us environmental protection agency 2015 therefore the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and cod are tough assignment for treatment of these kinds of wastewater the recent developed denitrification desulfurization process which enables bio oxidization of sulfide to elemental sulfur s0 or sulfate using nitrate as an electron acceptor show et al 2013 wang et al 2005 supplies a feasible approach during treating the nitrate and sulfide rich industrial wastewater wang et al 2009 sulfate as the terminal sulfide oxidation metabolite is inclined to be reduced back to sulfide once organic carbons electron donors are abundant huang et al 2015a also high concentrations of sulfate can induce a noticeable taste 400 mg l or even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l world health organization 2011 in contrast terminating the oxidation reaction at s0 not only reduces the energy demands but also holds the great value because the separated s0 could possibly be reused as fertilizer or the raw material for sulfuric acid production blázquez et al 2016 chung et al 2013 therefore several studies have conducted focusing on s0 generation and recovery in various bioreactor types such as the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors the expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactors the continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs the anoxic sulfide oxidizing reactor asos etc cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2011 although the satisfactory s0 generation efficiencies have been demonstrated in some of the studies achieving the high s0 generation performance is considered challenging since it requires the precise regulation of the operation parameters such as the sulfide nitrate cod ratios or loadings hydraulic retention time and etc cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2011 in addition the subsequent recovered s0 from either inside the above mentioned bioreactors or using the effluents are difficult since i most of the reactors inoculates the activated sludge as the microbial source and thus the generated s0 frequently merges with the mixtures of microbes epss and inorganic matter ohmura et al 1996 which hinders the s0 further recovery ii the formed s0 tends to be further oxidized or reduced back due to the presence of bacteria in the sludge or on the s0 surface pokorna and zabranska 2015b therefore the improved techniques that could timely separate the newly generated s0 from the reaction zone and meanwhile guarantee the high s0 generation rate and sulfide nitrate and cod removal rates are in urgent need xie et al 2016 the recent developed membrane separation based technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have demonstrated as the emerging technics for the recovery of nutrients from wastewater including ammonium phosphate potassium and etc blöcher et al 2012 maurer et al 2006 mccarty et al 2011 xie et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 meanwhile membrane works as an excellent biocarrier for microbial growth as far several modified membrane dependent bioreactors have been developed and favorable denitrification performance has been observed given the different kinds of electron donors or acceptors the short organic acids o2 sulfur and etc ergas and rheinheimer 2004 mcadam and judd 2007 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 sulfide oxidation were once reported in an oxygen based membrane biofilm by optimizing the influent loadings or o2 pressure sahinkaya et al 2011 however the recovered s0 purity was not mentioned in this study up to date no membrane related study has reported for the bio s0 generation and recovery through the denitrification desulfurization process normally the generated bio s0 granules are much smaller with the size 1 μm than bacteria 1 2 μm in size according to the microscopic observations kleinjan et al 2003 madigan et al 2014 this inspires us that whether the membrane can work as the biocarrier and meanwhile realize the in situ recovery of s0 by timely separating the generated s0 from the bacteria group with the similar principle of pressure driven and membrane rejection therefore in this study we proposed a biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor bfmfr with a compact design for the in situ generation and recovery of s0 through denitrification desulfurization process in this reactor the simulated water containing certain concentration of sulfide nitrate and sodium acetate were applied as the influent acetate one of the simplest organic acids was applied for the simulation of cod s0 was initially generated in the biofilm formed membrane and then timely separated with the bacterial group into the effluent by pressure driven and membrane filtration the aim was to explore the feasibility of a membrane based technique to efficiently recovery of s0 and improve the s0 recovery purity thauera sp strain hdd capable of oxidizing sulfide to s0 to sulfate was utilized to verify the proof of concept s0 recovery efficiency and reactor longevity were evaluated under the different operation parameters the morphology element contents and structure of the recovered s0 in the effluent were characterized the three dimensional architecture of the biofilm formed on the surface of the membrane and the biofilm activity were analyzed and quantified 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals microbial sources and s0 generation optimization sodium sulfide 99 99 no 431648 sodium acetate 90 no s2889 and sodium nitrate 99 99 no 204110 were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis usa thauera sp strain hdd a heterotrophic denitrifying sulfide oxidation bacterium isolated from a long term continuously maintained uasb reactor huang et al 2017 was utilized as the bacterial source for the bfmfr strain hdd is capable of oxidizing sulfide to s0 to sulfate by utilizing nitrate as an electron acceptor the detailed cultivation methods and nutrient demands are described in supplementary information si batch array tests and cubic spline algorithm simulation analyses were conducted to determine the optimal concentration range for achieving a high s0 generation rate by fixing the sulfide concentration and altering the concentrations of acetate 0 125 mg l and nitrate 0 500 mg l concentration of sulfide were fixed at 100 mg l s since the too high sulfide concentration would induce the bio toxicity hao et al 2014 batch array experiments were conducted in 48 well culture clusters coring3548 coring usa consisting 45 wells fed hdd and 3 wells without hdd as the blank controls each well held the approximate volume of 1200 μl nine sets of independent batch tests were conducted with five duplicates for each set each well with bacteria contained 950 μl of the culture solution and 50 μl of hdd suspension taken from the logarithmic phase od600 nm 0 3 culture solution contained micronutrients and certain concentration of sulfide nitrate and acetate the prepared cluster was sealed using pcr sealing film pcr ts axygen usa and incubated at 30 c for 24 h the concentrates of s0 sulfide thiosulfate s2o3 2 sulfate acetate nitrate and nitrite no2 were measured every 1 h from 24 successive prepared clusters then cubic spline algorithm simulation analysis was conducted by matlab software the mathworks usa and the calculation of interpolation was based on the code from the matlab s online forum the methods to determine the strain hdd growth curves and calculate the s0 generation rates the s0 yield for a single cell per second under batch conditions are described in the si after the reaction the morphology of strain hdd and formed s0 were measured under the transmission electron

triplicate 3 results 3 1 s0 generation efficiency in batch array tests by strain hdd from the batch array tests the highest generated s0 was 84 4 mg l and 80 2 mg l at 8 h and 24 h respectively fig 2 a and c at 8 h the optimal region of s0 generation 80 mg l can be achieved when acetate was around 75 125 mg l and nitrate was around of 100 500 mg l black dotted circle fig 2a while under these conditions the generated sulfate was maintained at 10 14 mg l fig 2b as the reaction time extended s0 further oxidation to sulfate was commonly observed under all of the conditions fig 2b and d at 24 h the highest sulfate concentration approached at 91 4 mg l indicating that 35 69 of generated s0 was converted to sulfate fig 2d the lowest sulfate generation zones were kept under the acetate and nitrate concentration of 40 110 mg l and 0 200 mg l respectively and while under these conditions the s0 generation efficiency could be maintained at around 75 black dotted circle fig 2c si table s3 the optimal acetate and nitrate concentrations were 75 125 mg l and 100 200 mg l respectively when the applied sulfide was 100 mg l under this concentration range the s0 generation efficiency was averagely maintained at 84 and the generated sulfate was lower than 20 by strain hdd si table s3 therefore the influent nitrate acetate and sulfide concentration in bfmfr was initially set at 120 mg l 115 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 3 2 bfmfr performance the performance of the bfmfr including s0 generation efficiency removals of sulfide nitrate and acetate as well as the system tmp were investigated under the different pore sizes influent concentrations and inoculum volumes are shown in figs 3 and 4 and table s4 in general the s0 generation efficiency was maintained at a relatively high level 89 3 93 5 under the different membrane pore sizes 0 22 0 45 and 1 μm conditions i ii and vi in fig 3 respectively membrane fouling was majorly resulted from pore blocking and cake layer formation caused by mass propagation and eps production fig 6h and i biomass growth on the membrane surface will form a cake layer on membrane surface at the same time the eps secreted by the biomass would easily enter the membrane pore which lead to a severe pore blocking allen et al 2004 malaeb et al 2013 membrane fouling restricted the longevity of the bfmfr to approximately 14 16 days under the optimal operation conditions proliferation and eps production given the larger pore size 1 μm condition vi 14 5 mg l of sulfate in average was detected in the effluent this was probably due to the s0 over oxidization since some of the free bacteria could penetrate through the membrane under the large pore size and further oxidize s0 to sulfate with the water flow to effluent condition vi in fig 3 si table s4 the results were agree with the batch array test results that under all of the conditions s0 over oxidation to sulfate was commonly observed as the reaction time extended fig 2 under condition ii with the pore size of 0 45 μm over 90 of s0 generation rate was achieved and the removal rates of sulfide nitrate and acetate obtained over 95 condition ii in fig 3 si table s4 the complete membrane fouling was occurred after the continuous running for 14 d condition ii in fig 3 the acetate nitrate and sulfide concentrations were individually increased to examine the reactor performance under the membrane pore sizes of 0 45 μm as the influent acetate increased from 115 mg l to 500 mg l the s0 generation efficiency quickly approached 100 on the 2nd day and remained constant for the following 5 days condition iii in fig 3 the abundance of acetate carbon source obviously promoted the denitrification desulfurization process and s0 generation probably caused by the rapid growth of sulfur oxidizing bacteria which was consistent with the previous report by chen et al 2015 however the excess amount of acetate 195 6 mg l in average flowed out from the effluent because of acetate excessive dosing condition iii in fig 4 si table s4 which resulted in the severe membrane fouling tmp 51 1 kpa that occurred 2 3 days earlier than condition ii fig 3 when supplying with 500 mg l of nitrate the removal rates of acetate and sulfide approached 100 and the high s0 generation efficiency 94 4 on average could be stably maintained condition iv in figs 3 and 4 however the higher nitrate influent concentration led to a large amount of unreacted nitrate 135 6 mg l in average leaving the reactor the complete membrane fouling was occurred on the 13th day one day ahead of condition ii as the sulfide concentration increased to 300 mg l the removal rates of acetate and nitrate approached to 100 however the s0 generation efficiency became much lower 31 1 on average and certain amount of unreacted sulfide 83 6 in average flowed out from the reactor condition v in figs 3 and 4 when the initial inoculum volume decreased to 5 ml approximately 1 2 108 cells condition vii in fig 3 a low s0 generation efficiency 87 5 was observed during the first 3 days compared with condition ii which was probably attributed to the slow bacterial growth rate after 5 days the s0 generation efficiency increased to 98 4 100 while it decreased to 85 1 as the tmp increased to 30 3 kpa on day 16 under this condition removal rates of sulfide nitrate and acetate can approach over 95 condition vii in fig 3 si table s4 as the initial inoculum volume further increased 20 ml approximately 4 8 108 cells condition viii in fig 3 the s0 generation efficiency quickly approached 95 on the 1st day however the membrane was completely fouled after 6 days of operation since the tmp increased to 43 2 kpa inoculating the higher strain hdd concentration accelerated the membrane fouling the above studies suggested that condition ii was optimal for the high rate and efficient maintenance generation of s0 if the influent concentrations or inoculum volumes were extreme either a low s0 generation efficiency or side reactions occurred which accelerated the membrane fouling and shortened the reactor longevity 3 3 the characteristic and quality of recovered s0 the morphology element contents and structure of the recovered solids in effluents of the stable maintained bfmfr condition ii were determined using sem xps and xrd fig 5 a b and c to make the clear comparisons the solids in the effluent of a steadily maintained uasb reactor average s0 generation rate of 78 huang et al 2017 were analyzed fig 5d f si fig s2 a c from the sem observations the recovered solids in the bfmfr effluent were majorly smooth and spherical granules edx analysis detected the solids in effluent of bfmfr was predominant with sulfur element and trace contents of carbon nitrogen and metallic element na indicating the relatively high purity of the recovered s0 fig 5a in contrast the solid samples in the effluent of the uasb reactor were mostly in a crystal solid form with the irregular shapes from the sem observation fig 5d and si fig s2 a c the edx analysis revealed the solids were composed of a mixture of sulfur carbon oxygen and various metallic elements such as na k or mg fig 5d as predicted these results revealed that the complex components besides sulfur such as a bacterial mixture were present in the effluent of the uasb reactor xps was applied to evaluate the valences of the recovered solid samples from the two reactors fig 5b and e in the bfmfr only one intensive peak sulfur valence of 0 was predominant at 163 6 164 0 ev fig 5b in comparison there were three sulfur valence forms determined at 162 0 163 6 ev 6 163 6 164 0 ev 0 and 167 0 170 0 ev 2 in the uasb reactor fig 5e by comparison the peak with sulfur valence of 6 was much smaller and can be negligible from bfmfr effluent the results confirmed the much simpler sulfur existed form as s0 in bfmfr effluent than in the uasb reactor both the effluents of bfmfr and uasb presented an intensive peak between the diffraction angle of 23 and 28 through xrd analysis corresponded to s0 that correlated to the standard card for sulfur no 08 0247 fig 5 c and f the above analysis confirmed that s0 was recovered in both the bfmfr and uasb reactors however the s0 recovered from the bfmfr held a much higher purity in contrast the recovered s0 in uasb reactor effluent was adulterated with microorganisms or other chemical compounds including s2 or so4 2 3 4 biofilm characteristics and membrane fouling of bfmfr typical sem and clsm micrographs of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface were measured and the biofilm morphology and structures were monitored on the 1st day 6th day and 12th day under condition ii fig 6a and b shows the section view and surface view profiles of the initial biomass on the membrane at the first day as soon as the inoculation of the strain hdd at this point the biofilm layer was barely visible sporadic spots of bacterial colonization were observed on the membrane surface fig 6c even this slight colonization enabled a s0 generation efficiency of 80 9 fig 3b and table s4 on the 6th day the membrane was covered with a biofilm layer and the visible particles were assembled on the surface however the tmp was still relatively low at this point less than 1 kpa fig 3b fig 6d and e the growth of strain hdd was clearly observed using clsm although membrane pores were still visible at that time fig 6f in the meantime the s0 generation efficiency increased to 98 9 the 6th day based on the bacterial proliferation fig 3b after 12 days a completely mature and compacted biofilm was observed and an evident eps matrix was embedded in the biofilm fig 6g h and i under this condition the s0 generation rate decreased to 89 2 and the tmp exceeded 22 7 kpa the 12th day fig 3b these results were attributed to the large amount of epss generated which blocked the membrane pores and increased the retention of s0 inside the biofilm fig 6i then the ph concentration of the dissolved sulfide and do profiles were measured using microsensors condition ii as shown in fig 7 the thickness of the mature biofilm was approximately 80 μm the 12th day the concentration of sulfide was approximately 80 3 mg l near the biofilm surface which significantly dropped to 15 5 mg l at a depth of 45 μm afterwards a much slower decreasing trend was observed these results indicated that 80 7 of the sulfide was consumed in the upper and middle sections 80 45 μm of the biofilm layers while the remaining sulfide 19 3 was completely consumed in the lower section between 45 μm and 5 μm of the biofilm layer from the membrane base along the biofilm layer the ph significantly increased from 8 0 to 8 7 the decrease in the ph was one indicator of the denitrification process lu et al 2014 moraes et al 2012 in addition do was undetectable demonstrating the prevalence of anaerobic conditions in the biofilm the microsensor results revealed the significant sulfide oxidization activity in upper and middle layers of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface 4 discussion 4 1 the sulfur fates in the bfmfr and conventional bioreactors after the batch array tests the morphologies of strain hdd and formed s0 were observed through tem analysis strain hdd was 0 4 0 7 1 0 1 5 μm in size and while the generated s0 was 50 nm in diameter and extensively assembled on the external and inner surfaces of the bacterial membranes fig s3 thus s0 could easily pass through membrane pores as soon as it was generated due to the water flow under the suitable membrane pore size and while the bacterial groups and eps matrix were rejected on the membrane surface under the suitable membrane pore size no reactional acetate nitrate and sulfide could pass through membrane pores which effectively prevented the occurrence of s0 further oxidation the in situ separation of the recovered s0 from the bacteria largely improved the s0 purity in the effluent and simultaneously avoided the s0 further oxidization or reduction during the follow up treatment fig 5 si fig s4 in comparison the analysis of the granule sludge inside the uasb reactor using sem edx and raman spectroscopy showed that s0 was inhomogeneously distributed and embedded in a matrix of microbes epss and inorganic matter containing multiple elements such as c o na k and cl si fig s2 d f and fig s4 the same phenomenon was observed in the sludge granules of other bioreactors such as a cstr huang et al 2015a and an anaerobic baffled reactor abr huang et al 2015b data not shown this further indicated that the generated sulfur was in various forms and mixed with bacteria and other chemicals therefore we hypothesized that the sulfur metabolism progressed as a circulation process s2 to s0 s0 to so4 2 so4 2 to hs that was difficult to control or interrupt inside the previously studied conventional bioreactors even though the high s0 generation rates were obtained in some of the abovementioned reactors cai et al 2008 chen et al 2008 huang et al 2017 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 4 2 s0 recovery rate in the bfmfr the bfmfr produced the high s0 recovery efficiencies 89 3 94 8 under the effective contact times between 56 3 and 80 5 s except for the condition when the sulfide was overloaded fig 3 and table 1 indicating an efficient s0 recovery capacity as calculated the sulfide loading applied in this study was 62 5 kg m3 d which is one of the highest sulfide loadings compared to the previous reports using the same calculation method si table s5 a cstr 0 29 kg m3 d reyes avila et al 2004 an egsb reactor 6 09 kg m3 d chen et al 2008 an aso reactor 3 40 kg m3 d cai et al 2008 or a uasb reactor 0 66 kg m3 d huang et al 2017 one reason for this high treatment capacity was due to the application of the single strain hdd and however in most of the previously reported studies the activated sludge or contaminated water or sediments were inoculated as the microbial sources the inoculation of the single strain effectively avoided the nutrient competition between sulfide oxidation and other metabolism processes e g methanogenesis and anaerobic fermentation additionally strain hdd possesses a 99 9 similarity with thauera sp strain mz1t from the 16s rrna gene sequence which has a genome that contains the complete enzyme system for sulfide oxidization adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase and sulfur oxidation ncbi bioproject prjna20091 this similarity ensured that s0 would be efficiently generated in the membrane on a genetic basis in addition from the batch array tests the max of a single cell per second was calculated as 2 8 10 9 mg cell s si fig s5 in the meantime the sulfide was mostly consumed by the biofilm the formed s0 passed through membrane and thereafter increased the sulfide concentration difference across the membrane in bfmfr therefore the sulfide concentration difference formed in the bfmfr possibly resulted in a faster reaction rate compared with the batch condition despite the high efficiency in bfmfr for the further industrial application engineering bacteria or mixed consortia would be applied instead of the pure culture and while the system efficiency and performance would possibly be influenced 4 3 nitrate acetate and sulfide transformation mechanism as far there is no significant clarification on electron transport and energy conservation for the denitrification and desulfurization bacteria herrmann et al 2008 wu et al 2006 xu et al 2014 here electron balances were conducted to better understand the sulfur transformation and hdd working mechanism si tables s6 s8 autotrophic denitrification and desulfurization occurred when no acetate was added condition ii fig 2 si tables s6 s8 while the bacterial growth rate was comparable with the heterotrophic conditions si fig s5 when no nitrate was added neither acetate degradation nor sulfide oxidation happened confirming nitrate was working as an essential electron acceptor 92 86 of electron balance was obtained under condition iii and iv when nitrate acetate and sulfide were 125 250 mg l 100 125 mg l and 100 mg l respectively si tables s3 s6 s8 coincidently these conditions were just under the range for the highest s0 generation efficiencies in both batch tests nitrate acetate and sulfide of 100 500 mg l 75 125 mg l and 100 mg l and the continuous flow bfmfr nitrate acetate and sulfide of 120 mg l 115 mg l and 100 mg l figs 2 4 as nitrate concentration further increase condition v or the nitrate acetate ratio further increase conditions vi vii and ix the reduced electrons became excessive than the oxidized ones this might be caused by the further transformation of nitrate to ammonia jones et al 2017 which was not included into electron balance calculation meanwhile partial acetate organic carbon would be utilized for cell synthesis and growth instead of converting to co2 lee et al 2014 which also influenced the electron balance calculation the optimal nitrate acetate sulfide ratios for s0 generation from batch array tests and bfmfr by strain hdd were 1 0 1 6 1 9 condition iii and 0 8 1 1 6 condition ii respectively fig 2 si tables s6 s8 figs 3 and 4 the optimized ratios were similar between batch array tests and bfmfr but much more different from the optimized ones from both the previous studies s n molar ratio of 5 2 anoxic sulfide oxidizing reactor cai et al 2008 c n molar ratio of 1 26 1 egsb reactor chen et al 2008 s n molar ratio of 5 2 to 5 9 the continuous stirred tank reactor huang et al 2017 and the theoretical denitrification desulfurization biochemical equations proposed by kleerebezem et al 2010 s2 1 25ch3cooh 2 4no3 2 4h 2 5co2 1 2n2 s0 2 7h2o 2oh g0 1285 3 kj mol nevertheless we believe it is not remarkable since the optimized ratio would vary based on the difference on strain type bacterial metabolism reactor type or performance and et al reyes avila et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 4 4 membrane fouling and bfmfr longevity high tmps were generally observed after continuously running the bfmfr for 2 12 days which subsequently decreased the s0 generation rate fig 3 membrane fouling was majorly resulted from pore blocking and cake layer formation caused by mass propagation and eps production fig 6h and i biomass growth on the membrane surface will form a cake layer on membrane surface at the same time the eps secreted by the biomass would easily enter the membrane pore which lead to a severe pore blocking allen et al 2004 malaeb et al 2013 membrane fouling restricted the longevity of the bfmfr to approximately 14 16 days under the optimal operation conditions decreasing the initial inoculum volume or increasing the pore volume extended the reactor longevity to 16 days or more this trend was attributed to either the low s0 generation rate especially during the first 3 days or the over oxidation of s0 to sulfate fig 3f and g si table s3 increasing the concentration of acetate or nitrate would accelerate the proliferation of strain hdd however the membrane fouling rate became faster than that under the other different conditions fig 3c and e membrane fouling is currently the greatest obstacle that hinders the development and application of membrane related technologies and the current effective solutions include a backwash strategy meng et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 therefore it was speculated that the backwash strategy could relieve membrane fouling and thus improve the sustainability of the whole reactor system this hypothesis will be explored in a further study 5 conclusions the application of a novel designed compact biofilm formed membrane filtration reactor by effectively controlling the sulfide acetate nitrate concentration inoculation volumes and membrane pore sizes not only enables the highly efficient conversion of aqueous sulfide to solid state s0 and the simultaneous removal of acetate and nitrate by strain hdd formed biofilm on membrane surface but also and most importantly realizes the in situ s0 separation and recovery in the effluent with the superior efficiency and purity by membrane rejection by interrupting the bioreaction process and timely separating the generated s0 from bacteria the bioreactor designed in this study solves the problems of the low s0 yield rate and the low s0 recovered purity that adulteration with bacteria and other inorganic chemicals thus is regarded as one step forward compared with the treatment process by the conventional bioreactors bfmfr had a maximum operation time nearly two weeks 14 16 days with pure culture of thauera sp strain hdd which may be lengthened by the subsequent back washing in view of the dramatic s0 recovery effect the simplicity of the process and its economic advantages bfmfr provides a feasible approach during treating of and resource recovery from some non complex nitrate and sulfide containing wastewater

19797,previous work has demonstrated that pre treatment of waste activated sludge was with free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 enhances the biodegradability of was identified by a 20 50 increase in specific methane production in biochemical methane potential bmp tests this suggests that fna pre treatment would enhance the destruction of volatile solids vs in an anaerobic sludge digester and reduce overall sludge disposal costs provided that the dewaterability of the digested sludge is not negatively affected this study experimentally evaluates the impact of fna pre treatment on the vs destruction in anaerobic sludge digestion and on the dewaterability of digested sludge using continuously operated bench scale anaerobic digesters pre treatment of full scale was for 24 h at an fna

production increased by 16 1 biochemical methane potential tests indicated that the final digestate stability was also improved with a lower potential from fna treated digestate further a 2 1 0 2 log improvement in pathogen reduction was also achieved with inorganic solids representing 15 22 of the full scale was used fna pre treatment resulted in a 16 17 reduction in the volume of dewatered sludge for final disposal this results in significantly reduced costs as assessed by economic analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion dewaterability free nitrous acid pre treatment volatile solids reduction waste activated sludge 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the major by product of biological wastewater treatment and its disposal can incur substantial disposal costs abelleira peraira et al 2015 foladori et al 2010 these costs can account for up to 60 of the total operating cost of a wastewater treatment plants wwtps low et al 2000 therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce sludge production amounts sludge is normally treated biologically to stabilise and improve final dewatering and anaerobic digestion is widely applied as a method to do this neyens and baeyens 2003 the extent of digestion is limited by the relatively low degradability of was compared with primary sludges ge et al 2011 wang et al 2017

2011 zhang et al 2015a analysis using batch biochemical methane potential bmp tests showed that fna pre treatment enhanced methane production of was by 20 50 wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b suggesting that fna pre treatment would enhance vs destruction of was in a continuous anaerobic sludge digester however the impact on a continuous digester has not been determined as bmp tests are conservative compared with continuous operation and do not allow direct measurement of vs destruction jensen et al 2011 similarly bmp tests do not allow dewaterability assessment due to the impact of inoculum inoculum to substrate ratio in bmp tests is typically in the range of 1 5 2 5 on a dry vs basis which masks the effect of fna pre treatment on dewaterability of final anaerobic digested sludge wang et al 2014 the aim of the present study is to experimentally assess the impact of fna sludge pre treatment on the destruction of vs and on the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge in a continuous anaerobic digester two continuous anaerobic digesters were employed one served as a control and the other served as an experimental anaerobic digester fed with fna pre treated sludge vs destruction and dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge were monitored routinely for both digesters the ch4 production nh4 n release and pathogen inactivation in both digesters were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup and operation 2 1 1 reactors the schematic diagram of the two reactor systems used for the study is shown in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a 0 1 l pre treatment reactor and a 1 3 l anaerobic digester 1 l working volume with the control system being only the 1 3 l anaerobic digester the temperature in both digesters was maintained at 35 c by a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production rate was recorded with a custom made tipping bucket gas meter which was calibrated twice a week through metered injection of gas the exhaust gas from the gas meter was collected in a gas bag both digesters were continually mixed with magnetic stirrers ph in both digesters was measured with a ph meter tps minichem and logged online using a programmable logic controller plc for the pre treatment reactor in the experimental system it was continually mixed with magnetic stirrers and the ph was measured with a ph meter tps minichem and controlled by plc as was detailed in section 2 1 3 the sludge from the feed tank was uniformly supplied to both systems and simultaneously discharged from each anaerobic digester by a peristaltic pump equipped with plc 2 1 2 substrate and inoculum the feed sludge was dissolved air flotation daf thickened waste activated sludge collected from the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lp wwtp in brisbane which is a biological nutrient removal plant with an activated sludge solids retention time srt of approximately 15 days the sludge was collected every two weeks and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to its use both anaerobic digesters were inoculated with sludge collected from the anaerobic sludge digester in lp wwtp the main characteristics of the feed sludge and the inoculum are summarized in table 1 the average vs loading rate to both reactors was 2 1 gvs l d 0 067 l feed volume 31 4 g l feed vs 1 l digester volume 2 1 3 experimental design the two systems were operated continuously for 162 days which were divided into two phases in phase i baseline phase day 0 75 the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was not operated the two systems were operated identically to establish convergence that is they reached stable and similar vs destruction and methane production prior to commencement of the experiment both anaerobic digesters were operated with an srt of 15 days by feeding 67 ml thickened waste activated sludge on a daily basis and simultaneously discharging the same volume of digested sludge the ph in each anaerobic digester was not controlled but monitored varying between 7 0 and 7 2 the phase ii experimental phase day 75 162 was started when convergence were reached in both systems the pre treatment unit was commissioned to deliver 67 ml pre treated sludge to the experimental digester on a daily basis in batch mode pre treatment was 24 h during which the thickened was were mixed in the pre treatment unit operated at room temperature 25 c a stock nitrite solution nano2 20 g n l was added to the pre treatment unit at the beginning of pre treatment resulting in a theoretical no2 concentration of 250 mg n l ph in the pre treatment unit was maintained at 5 5 0 1 during the pre treatment using 1 0 m hcl solution via a programmable logic controller plc resulting in an fna concentration of 1 8 mg n l based on the optimum observed by wang et al 2013 the concentration of fna was calculated as s n o 2 n k a 10 p h where k a e 2 300 273 t with t 25 c anthonisen et al 1976 2 1 4 monitoring protocol vs concentrations of both the feed sludge was and the digested sludge from two anaerobic digesters were measured 2 3 times per week to determine the extent of vs destruction the methane production of both anaerobic digesters was also measured 2 3 times per week as detailed in section 2 2 the ammonium concentration in the two anaerobic digesters was measured once a week dewaterability of digested sludge from the two systems was assessed when convergence were reached in both systems at phase i and then 2 3 times per week once both systems at phase ii reached stable performance the e coli level in the feed sludge the digested sludge from anaerobic digesters and also in the fna pre treated sludge was measured in triplicate when both systems at phase ii reached stable performance in addition the main characteristics including the vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble kjeldahl nitrogen skn nh4 n and volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations in the was with and without fna pre treatment were measured weekly 2 2 analytical methods ts vs tcod tkn were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction in the continuous anaerobic digester was calculated based on the difference between the vs concentrations in the feed and in the digested sludge expressed as switzenbaum et al 2003 1 v s d e s t r u c t i o n vs conc in vs conc out vs conc in 100 where vsconc in and vsconc out are the vs concentration in the feed and in the digested sludge for the measurement of scod skn nh4 n and vfa filtration was performed first using a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size nh4 n was measured with a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfa was analysed using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column biogas production volume was recorded with a custom made tipping bucket gas meter the biogas composition i e h2 ch4 co2 was analysed using a perkin elmer loop injection gas chromatograph gc which was fitted with a 2 44

injection port temperature was set at 75 c the oven temperature at 40 c ramp rate 20 c min and the detector at 100 c wang et al 2013 methane production was calculated based on the amount of biogas produced per vs fed and the methane fraction in biogas ml ch4 g vsfed dewaterability analysis was done according to chen et al 2001 and devlin et al 2011 briefly the sludge samples and cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge were mixed and stirred for 1 min then the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric the solids cake was centrifuged in a centrifuge cup with the belt filter fabric at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the solids content of cake was determined quantification of fecal coliforms was performed by colilert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 the sludge samples were diluted to 100 ml diluted 103 to 105 times depending on the sludge samples in 120 ml sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples the 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was next incubated at an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h finally the positive wells were counted and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform was obtained based on the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au 2 3 biochemical methane potential bmp tests bmp tests were done on anaerobic digester effluent from both systems and for feed sludge with and without fna pre treatment with samples taken on 130 d according to wang et al 2013 and jensen et al 2011 briefly a feed sludge sample of 25 ml along with 75 ml inoculum collected from the anaerobic sludge digester in lp wwtp in brisbane was added to 160 ml serum vials and the sludge was anaerobically digested for 35 days in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c blank tests were also done to account for native methane contribution from the inoculum the methane production from sample was obtained by subtracting methane production from blank test pointwise all tests were carried out in triplicate the biogas volume and composition were monitored based on which the cumulative production of methane was determined methane production was reported as the amount of methane produced per vs mass added l ch4 kg vs added at stp 25c 1 bar 380 mlch4 gcod 1 based on the methane curves a two substrate model was applied as described in wang et al 2013 fitting methane potentials b01 b02 and hydrolysis coefficients k1 k2 with the net b0 calculated from b0 b01 b02 the parameter estimation procedure of batstone et al 2009 was used with 95 confidence interval in b0 determined using analytical propagation procedures as in batstone 2013 including a correction for correlation in b01 b02 a first order model was also fitted to determine aggregate hydrolysis coefficient k apparent vs destruction was evaluated using b0 by equation 2 2 y b 0 380 r ss where b0 is biochemical methane potential of sludge l ch4 kg vs added 380 is theoretical biochemical methane potential of sludge at standard conditions 25 c 1 atm l ch4 kg tcod metcalf and eddy 2003 rss is measured percentage of vs to tcod of sludge in this study this was identified as being correct based on methane yield versus vs destruction from the continuous digesters the degradable fraction in sludge was converted part in sludge measured by vs destruction of sludge in the continuous reactor the degradable but not degraded fraction was determined by the apparent vs destruction of anaerobic digester effluent from continuous system according to the bmp experiment the remainder was assumed to be not degradable i e inert organics 3 results 3 1 overall performance of reactors 3 1 1 vs destruction fig 2 presents the vs destruction ammonium release and methane production in the control and experimental system during phase i following convergence and the entire phase ii the two systems reached convergence on day 61 with both systems operating comparably for nearly 5 hrts in phase ii following the feed of fna treated sludge to the experimental digester vs destruction in the experimental system gradually exceeded that in the control between day 72 and 105 approximately 2 hrts and then remained stable over the remainder of phase ii similar trends were also observable on the ammonium release and methane production profiles the average vs destruction in the two systems from day 105 to day 162 i e over 3 hrts after both systems in phase ii reached stable performance is compared in table 2 along with the comparison of the average ammonium nitrogen concentration and methane production for the control system the average vs destruction from day 105 to day 162 was 29 2 0 9 mean 95 confidence interval in comparison vs destruction in the experimental system was 34 2 1 1 representing a relative increase of 17 1 fna pre treatment significantly enhanced vs destruction of was fna treatment did substantially increase the soluble cod and skn concentrations see supplementary information si fig s1 consistent with previous studies wang et al 2013 pijuan et al 2012 however the vs concentration of fna treated was also measured and found to be comparable with that of untreated was both at 30 9 1 7 g l thus the increase in vs destruction occurred in the anaerobic sludge digester rather than in the pretreatment step aligning with vs destruction data the average nh4 n concentration in the experimental digester from day 105 to day 162 was 1091 20 mg l which was 16 1 higher than that measured in the control digester over the same period 943 30 mg l nh4 n the increase in ammonium release supported the vs destruction results as vs destruction and the subsequent conversion of the organics released to methane is expected to be accompanied by ammonium release in addition the concentration of effluent alkalinity from the experimental and control system was 3 6 and 3 2 g caco3 l respectively vfa accumulated in both anaerobic reactors were lower than 25 mg l similarly fna pre treatment resulted in higher conversion of organic components to methane the average methane production from day 105 to day 162 was 153 5 ml g vsfed compared to the control system of 132 5 ml g vsfed with an increase of 16 1 this increase was also consistent with the vs destruction result the average daily methane production from the experimental and control system was equivalent to 0 85 0 03 and 0 73 0 03 g cod day respectively cod in the feed was 2 85 0 04 g cod day while that in the digested sludge from the experimental and control system was 1 99 0 02 and 2 10 0 03 g cod day respectively thus complete cod balance closure was achieved within measurement error with cod destruction results aligning with observed vs destruction results 3 1 2 dewaterability of digested sludge the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the two systems in phase i and phase ii after both systems reached stable performance in each phase was compared in fig 3 and further summarized in table 2 similar solids contents in dewatered sludge 13 2 0 2 were achieved in the two systems in phase i after convergence was reached however the average solids content 14 1 0 4 measured for the digested sludge in the experimental system from day 105 to day 162 was significantly p 9 97e 12 higher than that in the control 12 4 0 4 representing a relative increase of 14 1 this revealed that fna pre treatment was effective in improving dewaterability of digested sludge 3 1 3 pathogen removal the other potential impact of fna pre treatment was the improvement of the reduction of pathogens the biomass specific mpn of fecal coliform in the was fna treated was and digested sludge from two systems in phase ii after both systems reached stable performance was presented in si fig s2 and the pathogen reduction in the two systems was compared in table 2 the results showed that the experimental system reduced the mpn of fecal coliform in the was from 6 3 0 1 to 3 6 0 1 log mpn g ts with a 2 1 0 2 log increase in pathogen removal compared to the control note here the mpn of fecal coliform in was have already decreased to 3 7 0 2 log mpn g ts after fna pre treatment which was comparable with that of digested sludge from the experimental anaerobic digester implying that fna pre treatment significantly enhanced pathogen reduction of was prior to anaerobic digestion 3 2 biochemical methane potential tests methane production curves for the four tested materials were given in fig 4 the methane potential from the fna pre treated was 207 30 ml ch4 gvs vs 187 5 ml ch4 gvs for the untreated was while the confidence intervals overlap there was a significant gain p 0 001 comparing the two models or in a pair wise t test this represented an 11 1 increase in observed yield and was lower than the gain observed in the continuous digesters 16 1 increase in observed yield the apparent hydrolysis coefficient k value of was with and without fna pre treatment was not different 0 32 0 06 and 0 31 0 09 analysing effluent from both systems the control had a methane potential of 88 3 vs 79 4 for the experimental system with fna pre treatment indicating a more stabilised state in digestate from the experimental system with fna pre treatment unit the hydrolysis coefficients k for both tests were the same and on the order of 0 24 d 1 in terms of vs destruction this aligned with an additional post digestion vs destruction of 14 5 0 5 for the control and 13 0 0 7 for the experimental system based on the results of bmp and continuous reactors tests the relative fractions of sludge on a vs basis vs in the control and experimental system including the converted fraction in the reactor degradable but not degraded fraction and not degradable fraction were further analysed and presented in fig 5 the converted fraction actually degraded was that observed in control and experiment i e 29 2 0 9 and 34 2 1 1 respectively the degradable but not degraded fraction in sludge i e 13 0 0 7 and 14 5 0 5 was determined by the apparent vs destruction observed by testing the effluent from control and experiment through a bmp test the remainder was assumed to be not degradable i e inert organics the results indicated that in both systems approximately 30 of the degradable fraction was not degraded limited by the 15 day hrt applied however the fna pre treatment increased the apparent amount of sludge degradable and enhanced in reactor degradation of existing sludge it was the combination of the two that resulted in an improved overall vs destruction 4 discussion this study revealed for the first time that fna pre treatment prior to anaerobic digestion of was can combine the benefits of better vs destruction with improved dewaterability to achieve sludge reduction this was experimentally demonstrated by lab scale continuous anaerobic digestion tests using two systems with and without fna pre treatment the fna pre treatment technology applied enhanced vs destruction by 17 which was also supported by the results of nh4 n release and methane production this could be attributed to both an increase in degradable material increasing degradability by 3 5 absolute as well as an increased stability in the final digestate fna likely changed the floc structure of the sludge wang et al 2013 destroyed cells and or extracellular polymeric substances eps with the release of intracellular and or extracellular dissolved organic compounds to the aqueous phase reflected in significantly higher skn and scod release after fna treatment these dissolved components then improved the efficiency of a subsequent biodegradation process wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b notably the 17 improvement in vs destruction achieved in the continuous experiment was higher than the improvement observed in comparable bmp tests 11 thus vs destruction in bmp test was conservative with respect to its impact in continuous digesters it should be noted that the improvement to b0 achieved in previous bmp tests ranged from 20 to 50 wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b significantly higher than the 11 achieved in this study this reflected the varying nature of was particularly at moderate sludge ages previous study showed that some was pre treatment technologies e g ultrasound ozonation thermal and alkaline pre treatment among others also caused a positive effect on vs destruction in comparison to the case without pre treatment el hadj et al 2007 demonstrated that vs destruction in anaerobic digestion hrt 20 d 35 c improved by 12 after ultrasound pre treatment of was at an es value of 11 000 kj kg ts wessex water employed an ultrasonic pre treatment system to treat the industrial and domestic mixed sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion and found that ultrasonic pre treatment improved vs destruction by 20 wang et al 2017 ozonation pre treatment is generally performed at 0 05 0 15 g o3 g ts with an increased vs destruction of 8 28 chu et al 2009 silvestre et al 2015 commonly technologies with relatively low input energies such as those listed above have a limited impact on vs destruction with outcomes comparable to the current study carrère et al 2010 it should be noted that the current study only requires chemical input rather than electrical input and fna pretreatment has provided more consistent and measurable outcomes in a range of studies with the current performance at the lower end for was studies wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b primary sludge degradability is normally not enhanced by fna pretreatment zhang et al 2016 in addition many mechanical chemical pre treatment technologies including the ultrasonic 4400 kj kg ts ozonation and alkaline pre treatment cause deteriorated dewaterability of digested sludge doğan and sanin 2009 feng et al 2009 erden and filibeli 2011 in comparison fna pre treatment was found to improve dewaterability of digested sludge by 14 for the sludge used the physical state of water in sludge is generally described as free water and bound water bound water is generally not removed by mechanical techniques kopp and dichtl 2000 but free water is strongly impacted by surface properties which is heavily impacted by organic fraction and particularly eps katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 was is rich in extracellular polymeric substances eps which increases bound water by forming a loose but highly hydrated capsule around the bacterial cell wall to aid the survival of the bacterial cell fna pre treatment likely degraded eps leading to the loss of water bounding capacity and opened bacteria cells with cell water freed chen et al 2001 in addition the damage of eps may make the floc structure of the sludge into a more compact sludge aggregates neyens and baeyens 2003 therefore the sludge dewatering characteristics can be significantly improved fna pre treatment also enhanced pathogen removal the control anaerobic digester 15 day hrt with no storage stage achieved a 0 6 log reduction in this e coli in this study in line with previous conclusions that in a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr it would be very unlikely to get an e coli reduction of more than 1 5 log due to the stirred nature devlin et al 2011 in comparison an increased 2 1 log pathogen reduction was reached by incorporating an fna pre treatment unit 24 h 1 8 mg n l prior to the anaerobic digester this could be attributed to the toxic effect of fna on pathogen cells causing their lysis particularly in a batch treatment process note that 93 of the pathogen removal occurred in the pre treatment unit indicating the fna pre treatment rather than the anaerobic digester played the key role in the pathogen removal by the experimental system the enhanced vs destruction and dewaterability of digested sludge translates to lower overall costs for sludge disposal for the sludge used in this study with inorganic solids representing 15 22 of the was the fna pre treatment was estimated to reduce the volume of sludge to be disposed of by 16 17 see si for details of the calculation a desktop economic evaluation was performed based on the experimental results to estimate the potential economic benefits of the fna pre treatment technology for a hypothetical full scale wwtp with a 400 000 population equivalent pe and an anaerobic digester operated with a solids retention time of 15 d see supporting information for details with a 17 increase in vs destruction a 14 increase in dewatered solids content and a 16 increase in methane production see table 2 as revealed in this study the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 205 000 per annum compared with the system without fna pre treatment by also taking into consideration of the capital and operational costs of the fna pre treatment unit the operational costs considered are the associated costs of chemical purchase i e hcl and nano2 and storage fna pre treatment reactor and mixing the net benefit arises from the decreased was transport and disposal costs 150 000 per annum and the value of the enhanced methane production 120 000 per annum overweighing the additional costs for was pre treatment using fna 65 000 per annum it should be noted that the cost for fna production from purchased hcl and nano2 reagents is similar to the cost for biological fna production from anaerobic digestion liquor law et al 2015 in addition the nitrite is rapidly removed in the digester through denitrification wang et al 2013 therefore the fna based pre treatment technology is economically attractive 5 conclusions the feasibility of enhancing vs destruction of was and the dewaterability of digested sludge based on fna pre treatment was assessed using continuously operated bench scale anaerobic digesters the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the fna pre treatment significantly enhanced vs destruction with 17 improvement achieved for the full scale sludge used in this study this was accompanied by a similar increase in methane production and was due to both an increase in available degradable fraction of sludge and in extent of degradation in the digester the fna pre treatment significantly enhanced dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge with 14 improvement achieved for the sludge used in this study through reducing sludge disposal costs and enhancing biogas production fna pre treatment resulted in significant economic benefits to

19797,previous work has demonstrated that pre treatment of waste activated sludge was with free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 enhances the biodegradability of was identified by a 20 50 increase in specific methane production in biochemical methane potential bmp tests this suggests that fna pre treatment would enhance the destruction of volatile solids vs in an anaerobic sludge digester and reduce overall sludge disposal costs provided that the dewaterability of the digested sludge is not negatively affected this study experimentally evaluates the impact of fna pre treatment on the vs destruction in anaerobic sludge digestion and on the dewaterability of digested sludge using continuously operated bench scale anaerobic digesters pre treatment of full scale was for 24 h at an fna concentration of 1 8 mg nn l enhanced vs destruction by 17 1 from 29 2 0 9 to 34 2 1 1 and increased dewaterability centrifuge test from 12 4 0 4 to 14 1 0 4 supporting the vs destruction data methane production increased by 16 1 biochemical methane potential tests indicated that the final digestate stability was also improved with a lower potential from fna treated digestate further a 2 1 0 2 log improvement in pathogen reduction was also achieved with inorganic solids representing 15 22 of the full scale was used fna pre treatment resulted in a 16 17 reduction in the volume of dewatered sludge for final disposal this results in significantly reduced costs as assessed by economic analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion dewaterability free nitrous acid pre treatment volatile solids reduction waste activated sludge 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the major by product of biological wastewater treatment and its disposal can incur substantial disposal costs abelleira peraira et al 2015 foladori et al 2010 these costs can account for up to 60 of the total operating cost of a wastewater treatment plants wwtps low et al 2000 therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce sludge production amounts sludge is normally treated biologically to stabilise and improve final dewatering and anaerobic digestion is widely applied as a method to do this neyens and baeyens 2003 the extent of digestion is limited by the relatively low degradability of was compared with primary sludges ge et al 2011 wang et al 2017 also due to the high residual organic fraction anaerobically digested sludge dewaters to a relatively low extent compared with digested primary sludge feitz et al 2001 further increasing its bulk pre treatment processes e g thermal mechanical chemical and biological have been commonly applied to enhance sludge degradability and final dewaterability neyens and baeyens 2003 doğan and sanin 2009 wei et al 2017 however existing pre treatment technologies such as thermal hydrolysis and chemical treatment may have limited effect require substantial capital input and or require substantial energy or chemical inputs with cost implications and other negative impacts carrère et al 2010 carballa et al 2011 wang et al 2013 2017 there is particularly a need for low capital cost effective pre treatment methods with a combined effect e g both improved volatile solids vs destruction and improved dewaterability free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 is a low cost and renewable chemical that can be produced on

2011 zhang et al 2015a analysis using batch biochemical methane potential bmp tests showed that fna pre treatment enhanced methane production of was by 20 50 wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b suggesting that fna pre treatment would enhance vs destruction of was in a continuous anaerobic sludge digester however the impact on a continuous digester has not been determined as bmp tests are conservative compared with continuous operation and do not allow direct measurement of vs destruction jensen et al 2011 similarly bmp tests do not allow dewaterability assessment due to the impact of inoculum inoculum to substrate ratio in bmp tests is typically in the range of 1 5 2 5 on a dry vs basis which masks the effect of fna pre treatment on dewaterability of final anaerobic digested sludge wang et al 2014 the aim of the present study is to experimentally assess the impact of fna sludge pre treatment on the destruction of vs and on the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge in a continuous anaerobic digester two continuous anaerobic digesters were employed one served as a control and the other served as an experimental anaerobic digester fed with fna pre treated sludge vs destruction and dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge were monitored routinely for both digesters the ch4 production nh4 n release and pathogen inactivation in both digesters were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors setup and operation 2 1 1 reactors the schematic diagram of the two reactor systems used for the study is shown in fig 1 the experimental system consisted of a 0 1 l pre treatment reactor and a 1 3 l anaerobic digester 1 l working volume with the control system being only the 1 3 l anaerobic digester the temperature in both digesters was maintained at 35 c by a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production rate was recorded with a custom made tipping bucket gas meter which was calibrated twice a week through metered injection of gas the exhaust gas from the gas meter was collected in a gas bag both digesters were continually mixed with magnetic stirrers ph in both digesters was measured with a ph meter tps minichem and logged online using a programmable logic controller plc for the pre treatment reactor in the experimental system it was continually mixed with magnetic stirrers and the ph was measured with a ph meter tps minichem and controlled by plc as was detailed in section 2 1 3 the sludge from the feed tank was uniformly supplied to both systems and simultaneously discharged from each anaerobic digester by a peristaltic pump equipped with plc 2 1 2 substrate and inoculum the feed sludge was dissolved air flotation daf thickened waste activated sludge collected from the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lp wwtp in brisbane which is a biological nutrient removal plant with an activated sludge solids retention time srt of approximately 15 days the sludge was collected every two weeks and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to its use both anaerobic digesters were inoculated with sludge collected from the anaerobic sludge digester in lp wwtp the main characteristics of the feed sludge and the inoculum are summarized in table 1 the average vs loading rate to both reactors was 2 1 gvs l d 0 067 l feed volume 31 4 g l feed vs 1 l digester volume 2 1 3 experimental design the two systems were operated continuously for 162 days which were divided into two phases in phase i baseline phase day 0 75 the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was not operated the two systems were operated identically to establish convergence that is they reached stable and similar vs destruction and methane production prior to commencement of the experiment both anaerobic digesters were operated with an srt of 15 days by feeding 67 ml thickened waste activated sludge on a daily basis and simultaneously discharging the same volume of digested sludge the ph in each anaerobic digester was not controlled but monitored varying between 7 0 and 7 2 the phase ii experimental phase day 75 162 was started when convergence were reached in both systems the pre treatment unit was commissioned to deliver 67 ml pre treated sludge to the experimental digester on a daily basis in batch mode pre treatment was 24 h during which the thickened was were mixed in the pre treatment unit operated at room temperature 25 c a stock nitrite solution nano2 20 g n l was added to the pre treatment unit at the beginning of pre treatment resulting in a theoretical no2 concentration of 250 mg n l ph in the pre treatment unit was maintained at 5 5 0 1 during the pre treatment using 1 0 m hcl solution via a programmable logic controller plc resulting in an fna concentration of 1 8 mg n l based on the optimum observed by wang et al 2013 the concentration of fna was calculated as s n o 2 n k a 10 p h where k a e 2 300 273 t with t 25 c anthonisen et al 1976 2 1 4 monitoring protocol vs concentrations of both the feed sludge was and the digested sludge from two anaerobic digesters were measured 2 3 times per week to determine the extent of vs destruction the methane production of both anaerobic digesters was also measured 2 3 times per week as detailed in section 2 2 the ammonium concentration in the two anaerobic digesters was measured once a week dewaterability of digested sludge from the two systems was assessed when convergence were reached in both systems at phase i and then 2 3 times per week once both systems at phase ii reached stable performance the e coli level in the feed sludge the digested sludge from anaerobic digesters and also in the fna pre treated sludge was measured in triplicate when both systems at phase ii reached stable performance in addition the main characteristics including the vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod soluble kjeldahl nitrogen skn nh4 n and volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations in the was with and without fna pre treatment were measured weekly 2 2 analytical methods ts vs tcod tkn were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction in the continuous anaerobic digester was calculated based on the difference between the vs concentrations in the feed and in the digested sludge expressed as switzenbaum et al 2003 1 v s d e s t r u c t i o n vs conc in vs conc out vs conc in 100 where vsconc in and vsconc out are the vs concentration in the feed and in the digested sludge for the measurement of scod skn nh4 n and vfa filtration was performed first using a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size nh4 n was measured with a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfa was analysed using a gc agilent fid with polar capillary column biogas production volume was recorded with a custom made tipping bucket gas meter the biogas composition i e h2 ch4 co2 was analysed using a perkin elmer loop injection gas chromatograph gc which was fitted with a 2 44 m stainless steel column haysep at 80 100 mesh and a gc plus data station model 1022 perkin elmer waltham ma usa high purity nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow pressure of 55 kpa the injection port temperature was set at 75 c the oven temperature at 40 c ramp rate 20 c min and the detector at 100 c wang et al 2013 methane production was calculated based on the amount of biogas produced per vs fed and the methane fraction in biogas ml ch4 g vsfed dewaterability analysis was done according to chen et al 2001 and devlin et al 2011 briefly the sludge samples and cationic polymer 0 005 g polymer g sludge were mixed and stirred for 1 min then the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric the solids cake was centrifuged in a centrifuge cup with the belt filter fabric at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the solids content of cake was determined quantification of fecal coliforms was performed by colilert 18 test kit from the idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 the sludge samples were diluted to 100 ml diluted 103 to 105 times depending on the sludge samples in 120 ml sterilized bottles the colilert 18 reagents were afterwards dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples the 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and then sealed with a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was next incubated at an incubator at 44 5 0 5 c for 18 h finally the positive wells were counted and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform was obtained based on the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au 2 3 biochemical methane potential bmp tests bmp tests were done on anaerobic digester effluent from both systems and for feed sludge with and without fna pre treatment with samples taken on 130 d according to wang et al 2013 and jensen et al 2011 briefly a feed sludge sample of 25 ml along with 75 ml inoculum collected from the anaerobic sludge digester in lp wwtp in brisbane was added to 160 ml serum vials and the sludge was anaerobically digested for 35 days in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c blank tests were also done to account for native methane contribution from the inoculum the methane production from sample was obtained by subtracting methane production from blank test pointwise all tests were carried out in triplicate the biogas volume and composition were monitored based on which the cumulative production of methane was determined methane production was reported as the amount of methane produced per vs mass added l ch4 kg vs added at stp 25c 1 bar 380 mlch4 gcod 1 based on the methane curves a two substrate model was applied as described in wang et al 2013 fitting methane potentials b01 b02 and hydrolysis coefficients k1 k2 with the net b0 calculated from b0 b01 b02 the parameter estimation procedure of batstone et al 2009 was used with 95 confidence interval in b0 determined using analytical propagation procedures as in batstone 2013 including a correction for correlation in b01 b02 a first order model was also fitted to determine aggregate hydrolysis coefficient k apparent vs destruction was evaluated using b0 by equation 2 2 y b 0 380 r ss where b0 is biochemical methane potential of sludge l ch4 kg vs added 380 is theoretical biochemical methane potential of sludge at standard conditions 25 c 1 atm l ch4 kg tcod metcalf and eddy 2003 rss is measured percentage of vs to tcod of sludge in this study this was identified as being correct based on methane yield versus vs destruction from the continuous digesters the degradable fraction in sludge was converted part in sludge measured by vs destruction of sludge in the continuous reactor the degradable but not degraded fraction was determined by the apparent vs destruction of anaerobic digester effluent from continuous system according to the bmp experiment the remainder was assumed to be not degradable i e inert organics 3 results 3 1 overall performance of reactors 3 1 1 vs destruction fig 2 presents the vs destruction ammonium release and methane production in the control and experimental system during phase i following convergence and the entire phase ii the two systems reached convergence on day 61 with both systems operating comparably for nearly 5 hrts in phase ii following the feed of fna treated sludge to the experimental digester vs destruction in the experimental system gradually exceeded that in the control between day 72 and 105 approximately 2 hrts and then remained stable over the remainder of phase ii similar trends were also observable on the ammonium release and methane production profiles the average vs destruction in the two systems from day 105 to day 162 i e over 3 hrts after both systems in phase ii reached stable performance is compared in table 2 along with the comparison of the average ammonium nitrogen concentration and methane production for the control system the average vs destruction from day 105 to day 162 was 29 2 0 9 mean 95 confidence interval in comparison vs destruction in the experimental system was 34 2 1 1 representing a relative increase of 17 1 fna pre treatment significantly enhanced vs destruction of was fna treatment did substantially increase the soluble cod and skn concentrations see supplementary information si fig s1 consistent with previous studies wang et al 2013 pijuan et al 2012 however the vs concentration of fna treated was also measured and found to be comparable with that of untreated was both at 30 9 1 7 g l thus the increase in vs destruction occurred in the anaerobic sludge digester rather than in the pretreatment step aligning with vs destruction data the average nh4 n concentration in the experimental digester from day 105 to day 162 was 1091 20 mg l which was 16 1 higher than that measured in the control digester over the same period 943 30 mg l nh4 n the increase in ammonium release supported the vs destruction results as vs destruction and the subsequent conversion of the organics released to methane is expected to be accompanied by ammonium release in addition the concentration of effluent alkalinity from the experimental and control system was 3 6 and 3 2 g caco3 l respectively vfa accumulated in both anaerobic reactors were lower than 25 mg l similarly fna pre treatment resulted in higher conversion of organic components to methane the average methane production from day 105 to day 162 was 153 5 ml g vsfed compared to the control system of 132 5 ml g vsfed with an increase of 16 1 this increase was also consistent with the vs destruction result the average daily methane production from the experimental and control system was equivalent to 0 85 0 03 and 0 73 0 03 g cod day respectively cod in the feed was 2 85 0 04 g cod day while that in the digested sludge from the experimental and control system was 1 99 0 02 and 2 10 0 03 g cod day respectively thus complete cod balance closure was achieved within measurement error with cod destruction results aligning with observed vs destruction results 3 1 2 dewaterability of digested sludge the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the two systems in phase i and phase ii after both systems reached stable performance in each phase was compared in fig 3 and further summarized in table 2 similar solids contents in dewatered sludge 13 2 0 2 were achieved in the two systems in phase i after convergence was reached however the average solids content 14 1 0 4 measured for the digested sludge in the experimental system from day 105 to day 162 was significantly p 9 97e 12 higher than that in the control 12 4 0 4 representing a relative increase of 14 1 this revealed that fna pre treatment was effective in improving dewaterability of digested sludge 3 1 3 pathogen removal the other potential impact of fna pre treatment was the improvement of the reduction of pathogens the biomass specific mpn of fecal coliform in the was fna treated was and digested sludge from two systems in phase ii after both systems reached stable performance was presented in si fig s2 and the pathogen reduction in the two systems was compared in table 2 the results showed that the experimental system reduced the mpn of fecal coliform in the was from 6 3 0 1 to 3 6 0 1 log mpn g ts with a 2 1 0 2 log increase in pathogen removal compared to the control note here the mpn of fecal coliform in was have already decreased to 3 7 0 2 log mpn g ts after fna pre treatment which was comparable with that of digested sludge from the experimental anaerobic digester implying that fna pre treatment significantly enhanced pathogen reduction of was prior to anaerobic digestion 3 2 biochemical methane potential tests methane production curves for the four tested materials were given in fig 4 the methane potential from the fna pre treated was 207 30 ml ch4 gvs vs 187 5 ml ch4 gvs for the untreated was while the confidence intervals overlap there was a significant gain p 0 001 comparing the two models or in a pair wise t test this represented an 11 1 increase in observed yield and was lower than the gain observed in the continuous digesters 16 1 increase in observed yield the apparent hydrolysis coefficient k value of was with and without fna pre treatment was not different 0 32 0 06 and 0 31 0 09 analysing effluent from both systems the control had a methane potential of 88 3 vs 79 4 for the experimental system with fna pre treatment indicating a more stabilised state in digestate from the experimental system with fna pre treatment unit the hydrolysis coefficients k for both tests were the same and on the order of 0 24 d 1 in terms of vs destruction this aligned with an additional post digestion vs destruction of 14 5 0 5 for the control and 13 0 0 7 for the experimental system based on the results of bmp and continuous reactors tests the relative fractions of sludge on a vs basis vs in the control and experimental system including the converted fraction in the reactor degradable but not degraded fraction and not degradable fraction were further analysed and presented in fig 5 the converted fraction actually degraded was that observed in control and experiment i e 29 2 0 9 and 34 2 1 1 respectively the degradable but not degraded fraction in sludge i e 13 0 0 7 and 14 5 0 5 was determined by the apparent vs destruction observed by testing the effluent from control and experiment through a bmp test the remainder was assumed to be not degradable i e inert organics the results indicated that in both systems approximately 30 of the degradable fraction was not degraded limited by the 15 day hrt applied however the fna pre treatment increased the apparent amount of sludge degradable and enhanced in reactor degradation of existing sludge it was the combination of the two that resulted in an improved overall vs destruction 4 discussion this study revealed for the first time that fna pre treatment prior to anaerobic digestion of was can combine the benefits of better vs destruction with improved dewaterability to achieve sludge reduction this was experimentally demonstrated by lab scale continuous anaerobic digestion tests using two systems with and without fna pre treatment the fna pre treatment technology applied enhanced vs destruction by 17 which was also supported by the results of nh4 n release and methane production this could be attributed to both an increase in degradable material increasing degradability by 3 5 absolute as well as an increased stability in the final digestate fna likely changed the floc structure of the sludge wang et al 2013 destroyed cells and or extracellular polymeric substances eps with the release of intracellular and or extracellular dissolved organic compounds to the aqueous phase reflected in significantly higher skn and scod release after fna treatment these dissolved components then improved the efficiency of a subsequent biodegradation process wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b notably the 17 improvement in vs destruction achieved in the continuous experiment was higher than the improvement observed in comparable bmp tests 11 thus vs destruction in bmp test was conservative with respect to its impact in continuous digesters it should be noted that the improvement to b0 achieved in previous bmp tests ranged from 20 to 50 wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b significantly higher than the 11 achieved in this study this reflected the varying nature of was particularly at moderate sludge ages previous study showed that some was pre treatment technologies e g ultrasound ozonation thermal and alkaline pre treatment among others also caused a positive effect on vs destruction in comparison to the case without pre treatment el hadj et al 2007 demonstrated that vs destruction in anaerobic digestion hrt 20 d 35 c improved by 12 after ultrasound pre treatment of was at an es value of 11 000 kj kg ts wessex water employed an ultrasonic pre treatment system to treat the industrial and domestic mixed sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion and found that ultrasonic pre treatment improved vs destruction by 20 wang et al 2017 ozonation pre treatment is generally performed at 0 05 0 15 g o3 g ts with an increased vs destruction of 8 28 chu et al 2009 silvestre et al 2015 commonly technologies with relatively low input energies such as those listed above have a limited impact on vs destruction with outcomes comparable to the current study carrère et al 2010 it should be noted that the current study only requires chemical input rather than electrical input and fna pretreatment has provided more consistent and measurable outcomes in a range of studies with the current performance at the lower end for was studies wang et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2015b primary sludge degradability is normally not enhanced by fna pretreatment zhang et al 2016 in addition many mechanical chemical pre treatment technologies including the ultrasonic 4400 kj kg ts ozonation and alkaline pre treatment cause deteriorated dewaterability of digested sludge doğan and sanin 2009 feng et al 2009 erden and filibeli 2011 in comparison fna pre treatment was found to improve dewaterability of digested sludge by 14 for the sludge used the physical state of water in sludge is generally described as free water and bound water bound water is generally not removed by mechanical techniques kopp and dichtl 2000 but free water is strongly impacted by surface properties which is heavily impacted by organic fraction and particularly eps katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 was is rich in extracellular polymeric substances eps which increases bound water by forming a loose but highly hydrated capsule around the bacterial cell wall to aid the survival of the bacterial cell fna pre treatment likely degraded eps leading to the loss of water bounding capacity and opened bacteria cells with cell water freed chen et al 2001 in addition the damage of eps may make the floc structure of the sludge into a more compact sludge aggregates neyens and baeyens 2003 therefore the sludge dewatering characteristics can be significantly improved fna pre treatment also enhanced pathogen removal the control anaerobic digester 15 day hrt with no storage stage achieved a 0 6 log reduction in this e coli in this study in line with previous conclusions that in a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr it would be very unlikely to get an e coli reduction of more than 1 5 log due to the stirred nature devlin et al 2011 in comparison an increased 2 1 log pathogen reduction was reached by incorporating an fna pre treatment unit 24 h 1 8 mg n l prior to the anaerobic digester this could be attributed to the toxic effect of fna on pathogen cells causing their lysis particularly in a batch treatment process note that 93 of the pathogen removal occurred in the pre treatment unit indicating the fna pre treatment rather than the anaerobic digester played the key role in the pathogen removal by the experimental system the enhanced vs destruction and dewaterability of digested sludge translates to lower overall costs for sludge disposal for the sludge used in this study with inorganic solids representing 15 22 of the was the fna pre treatment was estimated to reduce the volume of sludge to be disposed of by 16 17 see si for details of the calculation a desktop economic evaluation was performed based on the experimental results to estimate the potential economic benefits of the fna pre treatment technology for a hypothetical full scale wwtp with a 400 000 population equivalent pe and an anaerobic digester operated with a solids retention time of 15 d see supporting information for details with a 17 increase in vs destruction a 14 increase in dewatered solids content and a 16 increase in methane production see table 2 as revealed in this study the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 205 000 per annum compared with the system without fna pre treatment by also taking into consideration of the capital and operational costs of the fna pre treatment unit the operational costs considered are the associated costs of chemical purchase i e hcl and nano2 and storage fna pre treatment reactor and mixing the net benefit arises from the decreased was transport and disposal costs 150 000 per annum and the value of the enhanced methane production 120 000 per annum overweighing the additional costs for was pre treatment using fna 65 000 per annum it should be noted that the cost for fna production from purchased hcl and nano2 reagents is similar to the cost for biological fna production from anaerobic digestion liquor law et al 2015 in addition the nitrite is rapidly removed in the digester through denitrification wang et al 2013 therefore the fna based pre treatment technology is economically attractive 5 conclusions the feasibility of enhancing vs destruction of was and the dewaterability of digested sludge based on fna pre treatment was assessed using continuously operated bench scale anaerobic digesters the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the fna pre treatment significantly enhanced vs destruction with 17 improvement achieved for the full scale sludge used in this study this was accompanied by a similar increase in methane production and was due to both an increase in available degradable fraction of sludge and in extent of degradation in the digester the fna pre treatment significantly enhanced dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge with 14 improvement achieved for the sludge used in this study through reducing sludge disposal costs and enhancing biogas production fna pre treatment resulted in significant economic benefits to

american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and bacteriophage qβ atcc 15597 b1 atcc were cultivated as follows escherichia coli a pure culture of e coli was incubated at 37 c overnight in luria bertani broth and subsequently washed with phosphate buffered solution pbs ph 7 2 3 times before the uv exposure experiments the number of e coli was determined in a colony forming unit cfu assay with chromocult agar according to the method of manufacturer merck darmstadt germany bacillus subtilis spores cultivation harvesting and determination technique of b subtilis spores were modified from the methods of nicholson and setlow 1990 in which a pure culture stock of b subtilis was incubated in trypticase soy broth at 37 c for 6 h transferred into liquid enrichment medium 2 sg medium and then incubated at 37 c with vigorous aeration for 7 8 days for sporulation subsequently b subtilis spores were harvested by washing with cold sterile water three times heating at 80 c for 12 min to inactivate vegetative and germinating cells and washing again with cold sterile water 6 times sequentially the purity of the spore solution according to phase contrast microscopy was up to

previously rattanakul et al 2014 was mixed in pbs for uv exposure experiments and to enumerate qβ a double layer agar technique using e coli k 12 a λ f as a host was applied to qβ containing samples which were evaluated as plaque forming units pfu per ml adam 1959 for pathogenic microorganisms including l pneumophila atcc 33152 and p aeruginosa atcc 10145 the details of cultivation were as follows legionella pneumophila a modified method of buse et al 2015 for cultivation and determination of l pneumophila was performed as follows a stock solution of l pneumophila was cultivated in buffered yeast extract medium at 37 c for 48 h and then washed 3 times with pbs before use the enumeration method was performed using a cfu assay with buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye α agar cm0655 oxoid hampshire uk supplied with growth supplement sr 0110 oxoid at 37 c for 4 days of incubation pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas aeruginosa samples were prepared by incubating an aliquot of stock solution in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24 h and washing with pbs 3 times nutrient broth agar was used to measure the number of p aeruginosa in a cfu assay at 37 c and 24 h incubation following the method provided by atcc 2 2 apparatuses for uv led lpuv and fluence measurement uv leds nikkiso giken co ltd ishikawa japan with peak emission wavelengths of 265 280 and 300 nm were used the uv led apparatus consisted of a circuit board installed with 8 uv led chips in a circular arrangement for each wavelength 4 chips in series 2 series in parallel fan a power supply unit and temperature control system as shown in fig 1 a to set equivalent fluence rate at the surface of the microbial suspensions for different uv leds the electronic currents required for each uv led were 51 5 ma for 265 nm 18 5 ma for 280 nm and 14 5 ma for 300 nm the voltages needed to achieve these values were 6 05 v for 265 nm 5 16 v for 280 nm and 4 82 v for 300 nm respectively the fluence rate or irradiance was measured by ferrioxalate actinometry bolton et al 2011 and fluence rates were 0 99 mw cm2 for 265 and 280 nm uv leds and 1 01 mw cm2 for 300 nm uv leds the incident fluence rate was adjusted as described by bolton and linden 2003 considering water e g uv absorbance and water depth and reflection factor only for lpuv system and the fluence was a product of time and the incident fluence rate a collimated beam low pressure uv lpuv system was used for comparison and consisted of a 15 w lpuv lamp gl15 toshiba japan emitting a peak wavelength at 254 nm shutter and time controller the fluence rate was measured using a radiometer uvr2 ud25 topcon following an adjustment method as described previously the emission spectra of uv leds and lpuv are shown in fig 1b 2 3 uv disinfection procedure disinfection procedures for both uv leds and lpuv were similar and each microorganism was tested separately as follows five or 35 ml of pbs spiked with microbial stock solution was placed in a glass petri dish with diameter of 3 or 8 5 cm providing sample depth of 0 707 or 0 617 cm under the uv leds or lpuv system respectively which was continuously stirred with a magnetic bar throughout the disinfection experiments untreated n 0 and treated samples n t were collected at exposure time zero and designated exposure times t to eliminate the effects of photoreactivation uv disinfection experiments were performed at least three independent batches with a vary of exposure time among the batches under a red light condition and all treated samples were kept in the dark until microbial analysis 2 4 inactivation kinetics uv inactivation kinetics of each species at difference wavelengths was mathematically determined from fluence response curves using a multi target model severin et al 1983 as described by the following equation 1 n t n 0 1 1 10 k f n c where n 0 and n t are the microbial concentration cfu or pfu ml at time zero and t respectively k is the inactivation rate constant cm2 mj f is the uv fluence at exposure time t and n c is the number of critical targets to cause inactivation the values of k and n c are the slope and y intercept of the linear region of the fluence response curve the multi target model eq 1 can be reduced to a single target model if n c is equal to 1 as follows 2 n t n 0 10 k f another inactivation kinetic model proposed by geeraerd et al 2000 later expressed as the geeraerd s model considering effects of shoulder and tailing was applied to compare with the multi target model and geeraerd s model is derived from eq 3 3 n t n 0 10 k f 1 n res n 0 10 k t l 1 10 k t l t 10 k t n res n 0 where n res is the microbial concentration of a specific sub population either more resistant or appearing as a result of experimental artifacts cfu or pfu ml k is the maximum inactivation rate constant of critical components given as the slope of the linear part cm2 mj and t l is the shoulder length mj cm2 which can be obtained by dividing the value of y intercept of the linear part with the k 2 5 electrical energy efficiency the electrical energy per order e eo is a parameter used to assess the performance of different uv disinfection systems i e uv leds and lpuv based on electrical energy consumption which is defined as the amount of electrical energy required to lower the concentration of microbes by one order of magnitude in a specific volume of water if the linear fluence response profile is observed e eo can be derived as follows sharpless and linden 2005 4 e eo a 3 6 10 3 v k c w f where e eo is the electrical energy per order of magnitude kwh m3 order a is the irradiant surface area cm2 v is the volume of sample ml k is the fluence based inactivation rate constant cm2 mj wf is the water factor the value of 3 6 103 is a unit conversion constant for mw and kw sec and hr and ml and m3 and c is the wall plug efficiency which can be calculated based on eq 5 5 c p output p input f a i a v a where p output is the uv leds optical power mw p input is the applied electrical power mw i a is the applied current ma v a is the applied voltage v and f a is the radiant flux mw information regarding radiant flux per uv led chip provided by the manufacturer nikkiso giken co ltd was 2 01 mw for 265 nm 1 82 mw for 280 nm and 300 nm uv leds accordingly the c values became 0 333 for the lpuv 0 006 for the 265 nm 0 019 for the 280 nm and 0 026 for the 300 nm uv leds respectively in cases where fluence response curves showed non linear log reduction e g shoulder tailing or sigmoidal curve the electrical energy per specific n log10 reduction e e n kwh m3 n log reduction was calculated as follows beck et al 2017 6 e e n a f n 3 6 10 3 v c w f where f n is the fluence required for n log10 reduction mj cm2 2 6 model fitting and statistical analysis fit testing of the inactivation kinetic models for each microorganism was conducted using microsoft excel and either root mean square error rmse or the coefficient of determination r 2 was determined to assess the goodness of fit with the observed data for non linear fluence response curves such as a curve with shoulder and tailing r 2 was not applicable because of invalidation of the r 2 assumption and a higher r 2 indicated a better predicted value model fitted with the observed data in contrast a lower value for rmse indicated a better fit analysis of covariance was introduced to indicate a difference in the inactivation rate in the linear part of the inactivation profile at different uv wavelengths and p values less than 0 05 indicated a significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetic modeling fluence response curves or survival curves of target microorganisms inactivated by different uv wavelengths are shown in fig 2 two types of survival curve linear and sigmoidal curves a curve with a shoulder and tailing were observed in this study the linear curve was observed for l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ whereas a sigmoidal curve was found for e coli p aeruginosa and b subtilis spores in sigmoidal curves the shoulder may indicate the resynthesis rate of vital components which reached a level higher than the destruction rate mossel et al 1995 while tailing may have resulted from multiple hit lowering inactivation efficiency and the existence of a small number of resistant sub populations including uv induced and adapted resistance cerf 1997 in the present study the length of the shoulder on fluence response curves as shown in table 1 differed based on the microbial species and emission wavelengths indicating that accumulation of damage or resynthesis of vital component before inactivation may differ among each microorganism and different wavelengths resulted in different magnitudes of damage affecting the shoulder for the microorganims for instance the shoulder length at 254 nm was longer than that at 265 nm but there was a clear increasing trend following exposure to longer wavelengths 280 and 300 nm in e coli and b subtilis spores showing the highest value at 300 nm this indicates that damage resynthetic ability may be mostly supressed at 265 nm but other unknown mechanisms may contribute to this phenomenon and it is needed to be examined in further studies tailing was observed after microorganisms were inactivated at approximately 4 5 log10 inactivation at all wavelengths these results support that resistant sub populations were present even in pure cultures because after 4 5 log10 inactivation the microbial concentration remained approximately 100 300 cfu ml compared to original number of 106 107 cfu ml cerf 1997 introduction of the multi target model to the fluence response curves of all microorganisms as shown in fig 2 suggested that this model fitted well with the observed data except for cases of e coli and b subtilis spores exhibiting sigmoidal curves because the multi target model does not account for tailing which may overestimate the effectiveness of uv leds in the tailing region another model covering both shoulder and tailing effects should be employed the geeraerd s model appeared to be suitable in the present study because this model not only uses a deterministic approach based on fitting but also is supported by biological mechanisms in the background such as possible factors affecting the shoulder microorganims being clumped damage re synthesis ability or difference in critical components and tailing existance of resistant sub population including adapted resistance as shown in fig 2 geeraerd s model showed good fitting of not only the sigmoidal curves e coli and b subtilis spores but also curves with shoulders p aeruginosa and linear curves of l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ considering the goodness of curve fitting based on rmse and r 2 as shown in table 2 for the comparison between the multi target and geeraerd s model the rmse and r 2 values in linear fluence response curves of l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ for both models were equivalent at all wavelengths and the sigmoidal curves for e coli and b subtilis spores were better characterized by geeraerd s model at all wavelengths for p aeruginosa exhibiting fluence response curves with a shoulder the rsme of both models was similar in conclusion based on the results shown in table 2 the geeraerd s model covered all survival curve situations in this study 3 2 inactivation efficiency of uv leds and lpuv to compare the efficiency of uv inactivation at different wavelengths inactivation rate constants calculated form a linear part for each microorganism are shown in table 3 3 2 1 254 nm lpuv inactivation at this wavelength was effective against vegetative bacteria cells particularly e coli p aeruginosa and l pneumophila with inactivation rate constants k 254 95 confidence interval of 0 81 0 07 0 45 0 05 and 0 66 0 03 cm2 mj respectively the range of k 254 values for different e coli strains reported in previous studies sommer et al 2000 hijnen et al 2006 rattanakul et al 2014 was 0 44 0 91 cm2 mj which is consistent with the results of the present study similarly k 254 for l pneumophila was comparable to those in other studies 0 7 cm2 mj oguma et al 2004 cervero aragó et al 2014 while p aeruginosa appeared to be more resistant than previously reported values of 0 95 1 3 cm2 mj but the different strains used may account for the uv sensitivity difference clauß 2006 teksoy et al 2011 both qβ and b subtilis spores were highly uv resistant compared to the tested bacteria with k 254 values of 0 08 0 002 and 0 10 0 006 cm2 mj respectively these values are comparable to previously reported values mamane gravetz et al 2005 rattanakul et al 2014 beck et al 2015 the high uv resistance in b subtilis spores may be related to the major uv induced lesions in spores as spore photo products rather than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6 4 photoproducts major lesions in bacteria and that spore photo products can be repaired rapidly via specific mechanisms setlow 2001 for qβ and many viruses factors including their small size and host machinery involving life cycle may contribute to their high uv resistance 3 2 2 265 nm uv leds inactivation rate constants of all tested microorganism were highest by inactivation with 265 nm uv leds except for e coli whose rate constant was not significantly different from that at 254 nm p 0 05 the observed value of k 265 0 80 0 06 for e coli in the present study was higher than in previous studies 0 17 0 37 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 oguma et al 2013 and differences in experimental conditions and the shape of the inactivation profile may be involved k 265 values for p aeruginosa and l pneumophila which were first reported in the present study were 0 77 0 05 and 0 86 0 05 cm2 mj respectively there was no significant difference p 0 05 in k 265 between e coli and p aeruginosa and the k 265 values for these species were slightly lower than that of l pneumophila among the wavelengths tested the 265 nm uv led achieved highest bacterial inactivation regardless of the bacterial species this is because as well noted uv absorbance of nucleic acid is highest at approximately 260 nm harm 1980 similarly the k 265 for b subtilis spores and qβ were higher than k 254 which is also attributable to the higher absorbance of nucleic acid at 265 nm 3 2 3 280 nm uv leds the uv absorbance of protein showed a relative peak at approximately 280 nm harm 1980 and uv induced protein damage may enhance microbial inactivation however as the uv absorbance of the genome decreases at this wavelength relative to that at 265 nm k 285 values for all microorganisms were also decreased to 0 56 0 04 cm2 mj for e coli 0 51 0 05 cm2 mj for p aeruginosa 0 45 0 01 10 1 cm2 mj for l pneumophila 0 06 0 001 cm2 mj for qβ and 0 10 0 006 cm2 mj for b subtilis spores at 280 nm qβ and b subtilis spores were more uv resistant than bacteria as was the case at 265 nm furthermore inactivation by 280 nm uv led showed lower effectiveness than that by 254 nm lpuv in e coli l pneumophila and qβ but remained the same as that at 254 nm particularly for p aeruginosa p 0 05 and was slightly higher for b subtilis for qβ uv induced protein damage may not be a dominant cause of inactivation at this wavelength although a previous study demonstrated that uv induced protein damage played an important role in virus inactivation eischeid and linden 2011 the number of protein components involved in the infection processes of qβ is lower than those of enteric viruses which may result in a lower contribution of protein damage to inactivation 3 2 4 300 nm uv leds although uv absorbance of both genome and protein considerably decreases at 300 nm the inactivation rate constants of tested microorganisms k 300 were still observable the k 300 values for vegetative bacteria cells were lowest among the other wavelengths similarly k 300 values for b subtilis spores and qβ were lowest among the wavelengths tested these data are consistent with those of a previous study that tested the efficiency of uv leds at 310 nm demonstrating low but observable inactivation against e coli oguma et al 2013 the present study showed that e coli was more sensitive to uv than were the pathogenic bacteria p aeruginosa and l pneumophila at all wavelengths this poses a fundamental question regarding relevance of adopting e coli as a surrogate for water borne pathogenic bacteria for uv disinfection this study also revealed that compared to conventional lpuv 254 nm and other uv leds wavelengths inactivation of pathogenic and surrogate microorganisms by 265 nm uv leds showed the best results based on the fluence based inactivation rate constants 3 3 electrical energy efficiency selection of uv leds at different wavelengths based solely on inactivation rate constants can generate misleading results electrical energy efficiency is another factor involved in making an economically reasonable decision in this study electrical energy consumption per 3 log10 inactivation e e 3 was considered for all tested microorganisms as the fluence response curves of e coli p aeruginosa and b subtilis spores were non linear table 4 shows the values of e e 3 for all microorganism at different uv wavelengths e e 3 for tested microorganisms at 254 nm lpuv were 0 006 0 064 kwh m3 which were lower than those of uv leds at all wavelengths for all species notably e e 3 of lpuv for qβ and b subtilis spores were approximately 5 10 fold higher than that for bacteria although 265 nm uv leds provided higher inactivation rates than 254 nm lpuv 265 nm uv leds required approximately 25 40 fold more energy consumption for 3 log10 inactivation among all tested microorganisms the e e 3 of 265 nm uv leds for bacterial species l pneumophila e coli and p aeruginosa was lower than that for qβ and b subtilis spores as was the case with lpuv at 254 nm additionally 280 nm uv leds consumed approximately half as much energy as 265 nm uv leds for all microorganisms definitely because of the difference in wall plug efficiency the e e 3 values of all tested microorganisms at 300 nm was highest compared to other wavelengths showing the highest wall plug efficiency among the uv leds tested the low inactivation effectiveness resulted in high energy consumption to achieve a specific level of inactivation the e e 3 values observed in this study for e coli inactivation at 280 nm were lower than the value of 1 04 kwh m3 which was calculated based on the data reported by beck et al 2017 the lower energy consumption in the present study was mostly attributable to the difference in wall plug efficiency also our results show that lpuv was more energy efficient than uv leds at all wavelengths as was reported previously austin et al 2013 beck et al 2017 for uv leds 265 nm showed highest inactivation rate constants while the 280 nm product was the most energy efficient among the wavelengths tested energy consumption of 300 nm uv led was very high for all tested microbial species particularly for b subtilis spores requiring 17 4 kwh m3 for 3 log10 inactivation thus energy consumption required for a certain level of inactivation may be a useful indicator for comparing uv light sources including uv leds 4 conclusions uv leds are effective for inactivating p aeruginosa l pneumophila and surrogate microorganisms in water among uv leds with nominal peak emissions at 265 280 and 300 nm the 280 nm uv led is a good option for achieving a high inactivation rate constant and showed the lowest energy consumption for achieving 3 log10 inactivation in all microbial species tested our results can be used in the development of water disinfection systems with uv leds acknowledgements this study was supported by the japan society for the promotion of science as the grants in aid for scientific research 26289181 and 17h03329 and

with uv leds 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation and enumeration of microorganisms surrogate microorganisms including e coli ifo 3301 institute for fermentation japan b subtilis spores atcc 6633 american type culture collection atcc manassas va usa and bacteriophage qβ atcc 15597 b1 atcc were cultivated as follows escherichia coli a pure culture of e coli was incubated at 37 c overnight in luria bertani broth and subsequently washed with phosphate buffered solution pbs ph 7 2 3 times before the uv exposure experiments the number of e coli was determined in a colony forming unit cfu assay with chromocult agar according to the method of manufacturer merck darmstadt germany bacillus subtilis spores cultivation harvesting and determination technique of b subtilis spores were modified from the methods of nicholson and setlow 1990 in which a pure culture stock of b subtilis was incubated in trypticase soy broth at 37 c for 6 h transferred into liquid enrichment medium 2 sg medium and then incubated at 37 c with vigorous aeration for 7 8 days for sporulation subsequently b subtilis spores were harvested by washing with cold sterile water three times heating at 80 c for 12 min to inactivate vegetative and germinating cells and washing again with cold sterile water 6 times sequentially the purity of the spore solution according to phase contrast microscopy was up to 90 the number of active spores was determined by cfu assays with nutrient agar at 37 c after 24 h incubation bacteriophage qβ an aliquot 100 μl of bacteriophage qβ prepared and purified as described previously rattanakul et al 2014 was mixed in pbs for uv exposure experiments and to enumerate qβ a double layer agar technique using e coli k 12 a λ f as a host was applied to qβ containing samples which were evaluated as plaque forming units pfu per ml adam 1959 for pathogenic microorganisms including l pneumophila atcc 33152 and p aeruginosa atcc 10145 the details of cultivation were as follows legionella pneumophila a modified method of buse et al 2015 for cultivation and determination of l pneumophila was performed as follows a stock solution of l pneumophila was cultivated in buffered yeast extract medium at 37 c for 48 h and then washed 3 times with pbs before use the enumeration method was performed using a cfu assay with buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye α agar cm0655 oxoid hampshire uk supplied with growth supplement sr 0110 oxoid at 37 c for 4 days of incubation pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas aeruginosa samples were prepared by incubating an aliquot of stock solution in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24 h and washing with pbs 3 times nutrient broth agar was used to measure the number of p aeruginosa in a cfu assay at 37 c and 24 h incubation following the method provided by atcc 2 2 apparatuses for uv led lpuv and fluence measurement uv leds nikkiso giken co ltd ishikawa japan with peak emission wavelengths of 265 280 and 300 nm were used the uv led apparatus consisted of a circuit board installed with 8 uv led chips in a circular arrangement for each wavelength 4 chips in series 2 series in parallel fan a power supply unit and temperature control system as shown in fig 1 a to set equivalent fluence rate at the surface of the microbial suspensions for different uv leds the electronic currents required for each uv led were 51 5 ma for 265 nm 18 5 ma for 280 nm and 14 5 ma for 300 nm the voltages needed to achieve these values were 6 05 v for 265 nm 5 16 v for 280 nm and 4 82 v for 300 nm respectively the fluence rate or irradiance was measured by ferrioxalate actinometry bolton et al 2011 and fluence rates were 0 99 mw cm2 for 265 and 280 nm uv leds and 1 01 mw cm2 for 300 nm uv leds the incident fluence rate was adjusted as described by bolton and linden 2003 considering water e g uv absorbance and water depth and reflection factor only for lpuv system and the fluence was a product of time and the incident fluence rate a collimated beam low pressure uv lpuv system was used for comparison and consisted of a 15 w lpuv lamp gl15 toshiba japan emitting a peak wavelength at 254 nm shutter and time controller the fluence rate was measured using a radiometer uvr2 ud25 topcon following an adjustment method as described previously the emission spectra of uv leds and lpuv are shown in fig 1b 2 3 uv disinfection procedure disinfection procedures for both uv leds and lpuv were similar and each microorganism was tested separately as follows five or 35 ml of pbs spiked with microbial stock solution was placed in a glass petri dish with diameter of 3 or 8 5 cm providing sample depth of 0 707 or 0 617 cm under the uv leds or lpuv system respectively which was continuously stirred with a magnetic bar throughout the disinfection experiments untreated n 0 and treated samples n t were collected at exposure time zero and designated exposure times t to eliminate the effects of photoreactivation uv disinfection experiments were performed at least three independent batches with a vary of exposure time among the batches under a red light condition and all treated samples were kept in the dark until microbial analysis 2 4 inactivation kinetics uv inactivation kinetics of each species at difference wavelengths was mathematically determined from fluence response curves using a multi target model severin et al 1983 as described by the following equation 1 n t n 0 1 1 10 k f n c where n 0 and n t are the microbial concentration cfu or pfu ml at time zero and t respectively k is the inactivation rate constant cm2 mj f is the uv fluence at exposure time t and n c is the number of critical targets to cause inactivation the values of k and n c are the slope and y intercept of the linear region of the fluence response curve the multi target model eq 1 can be reduced to a single target model if n c is equal to 1 as follows 2 n t n 0 10 k f another inactivation kinetic model proposed by geeraerd et al 2000 later expressed as the geeraerd s model considering effects of shoulder and tailing was applied to compare with the multi target model and geeraerd s model is derived from eq 3 3 n t n 0 10 k f 1 n res n 0 10 k t l 1 10 k t l t 10 k t n res n 0 where n res is the microbial concentration of a specific sub population either more resistant or appearing as a result of experimental artifacts cfu or pfu ml k is the maximum inactivation rate constant of critical components given as the slope of the linear part cm2 mj and t l is the shoulder length mj cm2 which can be obtained by dividing the value of y intercept of the linear part with the k 2 5 electrical energy efficiency the electrical energy per order e eo is a parameter used to assess the performance of different uv disinfection systems i e uv leds and lpuv based on electrical energy consumption which is defined as the amount of electrical energy required to lower the concentration of microbes by one order of magnitude in a specific volume of water if the linear fluence response profile is observed e eo can be derived as follows sharpless and linden 2005 4 e eo a 3 6 10 3 v k c w f where e eo is the electrical energy per order of magnitude kwh m3 order a is the irradiant surface area cm2 v is the volume of sample ml k is the fluence based inactivation rate constant cm2 mj wf is the water factor the value of 3 6 103 is a unit conversion constant for mw and kw sec and hr and ml and m3 and c is the wall plug efficiency which can be calculated based on eq 5 5 c p output p input f a i a v a where p output is the uv leds optical power mw p input is the applied electrical power mw i a is the applied current ma v a is the applied voltage v and f a is the radiant flux mw information regarding radiant flux per uv led chip provided by the manufacturer nikkiso giken co ltd was 2 01 mw for 265 nm 1 82 mw for 280 nm and 300 nm uv leds accordingly the c values became 0 333 for the lpuv 0 006 for the 265 nm 0 019 for the 280 nm and 0 026 for the 300 nm uv leds respectively in cases where fluence response curves showed non linear log reduction e g shoulder tailing or sigmoidal curve the electrical energy per specific n log10 reduction e e n kwh m3 n log reduction was calculated as follows beck et al 2017 6 e e n a f n 3 6 10 3 v c w f where f n is the fluence required for n log10 reduction mj cm2 2 6 model fitting and statistical analysis fit testing of the inactivation kinetic models for each microorganism was conducted using microsoft excel and either root mean square error rmse or the coefficient of determination r 2 was determined to assess the goodness of fit with the observed data for non linear fluence response curves such as a curve with shoulder and tailing r 2 was not applicable because of invalidation of the r 2 assumption and a higher r 2 indicated a better predicted value model fitted with the observed data in contrast a lower value for rmse indicated a better fit analysis of covariance was introduced to indicate a difference in the inactivation rate in the linear part of the inactivation profile at different uv wavelengths and p values less than 0 05 indicated a significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation kinetic modeling fluence response curves or survival curves of target microorganisms inactivated by different uv wavelengths are shown in fig 2 two types of survival curve linear and sigmoidal curves a curve with a shoulder and tailing were observed in this study the linear curve was observed for l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ whereas a sigmoidal curve was found for e coli p aeruginosa and b subtilis spores in sigmoidal curves the shoulder may indicate the resynthesis rate of vital components which reached a level higher than the destruction rate mossel et al 1995 while tailing may have resulted from multiple hit lowering inactivation efficiency and the existence of a small number of resistant sub populations including uv induced and adapted resistance cerf 1997 in the present study the length of the shoulder on fluence response curves as shown in table 1 differed based on the microbial species and emission wavelengths indicating that accumulation of damage or resynthesis of vital component before inactivation may differ among each microorganism and different wavelengths resulted in different magnitudes of damage affecting the shoulder for the microorganims for instance the shoulder length at 254 nm was longer than that at 265 nm but there was a clear increasing trend following exposure to longer wavelengths 280 and 300 nm in e coli and b subtilis spores showing the highest value at 300 nm this indicates that damage resynthetic ability may be mostly supressed at 265 nm but other unknown mechanisms may contribute to this phenomenon and it is needed to be examined in further studies tailing was observed after microorganisms were inactivated at approximately 4 5 log10 inactivation at all wavelengths these results support that resistant sub populations were present even in pure cultures because after 4 5 log10 inactivation the microbial concentration remained approximately 100 300 cfu ml compared to original number of 106 107 cfu ml cerf 1997 introduction of the multi target model to the fluence response curves of all microorganisms as shown in fig 2 suggested that this model fitted well with the observed data except for cases of e coli and b subtilis spores exhibiting sigmoidal curves because the multi target model does not account for tailing which may overestimate the effectiveness of uv leds in the tailing region another model covering both shoulder and tailing effects should be employed the geeraerd s model appeared to be suitable in the present study because this model not only uses a deterministic approach based on fitting but also is supported by biological mechanisms in the background such as possible factors affecting the shoulder microorganims being clumped damage re synthesis ability or difference in critical components and tailing existance of resistant sub population including adapted resistance as shown in fig 2 geeraerd s model showed good fitting of not only the sigmoidal curves e coli and b subtilis spores but also curves with shoulders p aeruginosa and linear curves of l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ considering the goodness of curve fitting based on rmse and r 2 as shown in table 2 for the comparison between the multi target and geeraerd s model the rmse and r 2 values in linear fluence response curves of l pneumophila and bacteriophage qβ for both models were equivalent at all wavelengths and the sigmoidal curves for e coli and b subtilis spores were better characterized by geeraerd s model at all wavelengths for p aeruginosa exhibiting fluence response curves with a shoulder the rsme of both models was similar in conclusion based on the results shown in table 2 the geeraerd s model covered all survival curve situations in this study 3 2 inactivation efficiency of uv leds and lpuv to compare the efficiency of uv inactivation at different wavelengths inactivation rate constants calculated form a linear part for each microorganism are shown in table 3 3 2 1 254 nm lpuv inactivation at this wavelength was effective against vegetative bacteria cells particularly e coli p aeruginosa and l pneumophila with inactivation rate constants k 254 95 confidence interval of 0 81 0 07 0 45 0 05 and 0 66 0 03 cm2 mj respectively the range of k 254 values for different e coli strains reported in previous studies sommer et al 2000 hijnen et al 2006 rattanakul et al 2014 was 0 44 0 91 cm2 mj which is consistent with the results of the present study similarly k 254 for l pneumophila was comparable to those in other studies 0 7 cm2 mj oguma et al 2004 cervero aragó et al 2014 while p aeruginosa appeared to be more resistant than previously reported values of 0 95 1 3 cm2 mj but the different strains used may account for the uv sensitivity difference clauß 2006 teksoy et al 2011 both qβ and b subtilis spores were highly uv resistant compared to the tested bacteria with k 254 values of 0 08 0 002 and 0 10 0 006 cm2 mj respectively these values are comparable to previously reported values mamane gravetz et al 2005 rattanakul et al 2014 beck et al 2015 the high uv resistance in b subtilis spores may be related to the major uv induced lesions in spores as spore photo products rather than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6 4 photoproducts major lesions in bacteria and that spore photo products can be repaired rapidly via specific mechanisms setlow 2001 for qβ and many viruses factors including their small size and host machinery involving life cycle may contribute to their high uv resistance 3 2 2 265 nm uv leds inactivation rate constants of all tested microorganism were highest by inactivation with 265 nm uv leds except for e coli whose rate constant was not significantly different from that at 254 nm p 0 05 the observed value of k 265 0 80 0 06 for e coli in the present study was higher than in previous studies 0 17 0 37 cm2 mj chatterley and linden 2010 oguma et al 2013 and differences in experimental conditions and the shape of the inactivation profile may be involved k 265 values for p aeruginosa and l pneumophila which were first reported in the present study were 0 77 0 05 and 0 86 0 05 cm2 mj respectively there was no significant difference p 0 05 in k 265 between e coli and p aeruginosa and the k 265 values for these species were slightly lower than that of l pneumophila among the wavelengths tested the 265 nm uv led achieved highest bacterial inactivation regardless of the bacterial species this is because as well noted uv absorbance of nucleic acid is highest at approximately 260 nm harm 1980 similarly the k 265 for b subtilis spores and qβ were higher than k 254 which is also attributable to the higher absorbance of nucleic acid at 265 nm 3 2 3 280 nm uv leds the uv absorbance of protein showed a relative peak at approximately 280 nm harm 1980 and uv induced protein damage may enhance microbial inactivation however as the uv absorbance of the genome decreases at this wavelength relative to that at 265 nm k 285 values for all microorganisms were also decreased to 0 56 0 04 cm2 mj for e coli 0 51 0 05 cm2 mj for p aeruginosa 0 45 0 01 10 1 cm2 mj for l pneumophila 0 06 0 001 cm2 mj for qβ and 0 10 0 006 cm2 mj for b subtilis spores at 280 nm qβ and b subtilis spores were more uv resistant than bacteria as was the case at 265 nm furthermore inactivation by 280 nm uv led showed lower effectiveness than that by 254 nm lpuv in e coli l pneumophila and qβ but remained the same as that at 254 nm particularly for p aeruginosa p 0 05 and was slightly higher for b subtilis for qβ uv induced protein damage may not be a dominant cause of inactivation at this wavelength although a previous study demonstrated that uv induced protein damage played an important role in virus inactivation eischeid and linden 2011 the number of protein components involved in the infection processes of qβ is lower than those of enteric viruses which may result in a lower contribution of protein damage to inactivation 3 2 4 300 nm uv leds although uv absorbance of both genome and protein considerably decreases at 300 nm the inactivation rate constants of tested microorganisms k 300 were still observable the k 300 values for vegetative bacteria cells were lowest among the other wavelengths similarly k 300 values for b subtilis spores and qβ were lowest among the wavelengths tested these data are consistent with those of a previous study that tested the efficiency of uv leds at 310 nm demonstrating low but observable inactivation against e coli oguma et al 2013 the present study showed that e coli was more sensitive to uv than were the pathogenic bacteria p aeruginosa and l pneumophila at all wavelengths this poses a fundamental question regarding relevance of adopting e coli as a surrogate for water borne pathogenic bacteria for uv disinfection this study also revealed that compared to conventional lpuv 254 nm and other uv leds wavelengths inactivation of pathogenic and surrogate microorganisms by 265 nm uv leds showed the best results based on the fluence based inactivation rate constants 3 3 electrical energy efficiency selection of uv leds at different wavelengths based solely on inactivation rate constants can generate misleading results electrical energy efficiency is another factor involved in making an economically reasonable decision in this study electrical energy consumption per 3 log10 inactivation e e 3 was considered for all tested microorganisms as the fluence response curves of e coli p aeruginosa and b subtilis spores were non linear table 4 shows the values of e e 3 for all microorganism at different uv wavelengths e e 3 for tested microorganisms at 254 nm lpuv were 0 006 0 064 kwh m3 which were lower than those of uv leds at all wavelengths for all species notably e e 3 of lpuv for qβ and b subtilis spores were approximately 5 10 fold higher than that for bacteria although 265 nm uv leds provided higher inactivation rates than 254 nm lpuv 265 nm uv leds required approximately 25 40 fold more energy consumption for 3 log10 inactivation among all tested microorganisms the e e 3 of 265 nm uv leds for bacterial species l pneumophila e coli and p aeruginosa was lower than that for qβ and b subtilis spores as was the case with lpuv at 254 nm additionally 280 nm uv leds consumed approximately half as much energy as 265 nm uv leds for all microorganisms definitely because of the difference in wall plug efficiency the e e 3 values of all tested microorganisms at 300 nm was highest compared to other wavelengths showing the highest wall plug efficiency among the uv leds tested the low inactivation effectiveness resulted in high energy consumption to achieve a specific level of inactivation the e e 3 values observed in this study for e coli inactivation at 280 nm were lower than the value of 1 04 kwh m3 which was calculated based on the data reported by beck et al 2017 the lower energy consumption in the present study was mostly attributable to the difference in wall plug efficiency also our results show that lpuv was more energy efficient than uv leds at all wavelengths as was reported previously austin et al 2013 beck et al 2017 for uv leds 265 nm showed highest inactivation rate constants while the 280 nm product was the most energy efficient among the wavelengths tested energy consumption of 300 nm uv led was very high for all tested microbial species particularly for b subtilis spores requiring 17 4 kwh m3 for 3 log10 inactivation thus energy consumption required for a certain level of inactivation may be a useful indicator for comparing uv light sources including uv leds 4 conclusions uv leds are effective for inactivating p aeruginosa l pneumophila and surrogate microorganisms in water among uv leds with nominal peak emissions at 265 280 and 300 nm the 280 nm uv led is a good option for achieving a high inactivation rate constant and showed the lowest energy consumption for achieving 3 log10 inactivation in all microbial species tested our results can be used in the development of water disinfection systems with uv leds acknowledgements this study was supported by the japan society for the promotion of science as the grants in aid for scientific research 26289181 and 17h03329 and

municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps distributed across china the composition profiles of different mp categories in the influent effluent and excess sludge were explored and the aqueous

micropollutants mps in the environment is of global concern due to their potential ecological risks many kinds of mps including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have been widely detected in environmental matrices such as surface water and soils bradley et al 2017 liu and wong 2013 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received considerable attention over the past decades because they act as a barrier to prevent mps from entering the environment intensive sampling and analysis efforts have been made globally to improve understanding of the occurrence behavior and fate of mps in wwtps in china the number of wwtps rapidly increased from 481 in 2000 3717 in 2014 with a total treatment capacity of 1 57 million m3 d 1 mhurd 2015 meanwhile as one of the biggest producers and consumers of chemicals china is also confronted with challenges from mps a few previous studies have preliminarily revealed the status of mps in some china s wwtps sui et al 2010 yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 however a comprehensive comparison of the occurrence and removal of diverse categories of mps in different wwtps distributed across china has not yet been made previous studies have demonstrated that most mps can be only partly removed in wastewater treatment processes and subsequently released into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal bueno et al 2012 garcía galán et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a b correspondingly the removal of specific mps has been extensively studied with biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge treatment cast anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o process membrane bioreactor mbr and oxidation ditch od as well as advanced treatment processes including ozonation chlorination and uv photolysis processes in lab scale tests drillia et al 2005 esplugas et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 however there is a severe lack of research which compares the removal efficiencies of mps among different full scale wastewater treatment processes currently adopted in various regions of china nowadays china s wwtps are challenged with more stringent effluent discharge standards zhang et al 2016 in addition with increasing demands for wastewater reclamation e g urban and agriculture irrigation toilet flushing stream augmentation and wetland enhancement wwtps are also striving to eliminate mps from the final effluent therefore a better understanding of the efficacies of commonly used wastewater treatment processes for eliminating mps is urgently needed in this study a nationwide survey was conducted on the removal of different categories of mps in 14 municipal wwtps distributed across china a total of 30 ppcps and 12 edcs which mainly originate from anthropogenic sources were selected as target mps for analysis quantitative meta analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of different wastewater treatment processes on eliminating mps furthermore ecological risks induced by residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge were also assessed this study helps better understand the occurrence removal and risks of mps in wwtps across china and proposes effective treatment processes for eliminating mps from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the target ppcps consisted of 23 antibiotics and

50 tris from cdn isotopes quebec canada were used as isotopically labeled internal standards the stock solutions of target mps and internal standards were individually prepared by dissolving each compound in methanol at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and then stored at 20 c in a refrigerator other chemicals and reagents used for the analysis of mps are provided in text s1 2 2 sample collection wastewater and sludge samples were collected from 14 wwtps which are distributed in nine cites in different geographical regions of china sampling was conducted continuously for one day for each wwtp during the period from april to october 2015 information on the location treatment processes operational parameters and collected sample types of the studied wwtps is detailed in table 1 wastewater samples included influent secondary effluent and tertiary effluent if tertiary treatment was employed and sludge samples represented the excess sludge during the sampling campaigns the wwtps were confirmed to be under normal operation conditions and no rainfall events were recorded moreover the wastewater temperature during the time of sampling in 14 wwtps varied within a relatively narrow range i e 19 2 24 2 c so the temperature difference was unlikely to significantly influence the biological treatment performance among the studied wwtps flow proportional 24 h composite samples were collected using autosamplers sd900 hach usa for plants 1 and 2 where the autosamplers were not available wastewater and sludge samples were collected three times on a sampling day i e in the morning noon and evening and mixed together all samples were transferred to brown glass bottles chilled in iceboxes and transported to the laboratory within two days for processing 2 3 analytical methods and quality control the concentrations of 30 ppcps and 12 edcs in the collected samples were determined by two separate analytical methods developed in our previous studies yuan et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 detailed information on sample pretreatment and extraction as well as instrumental parameters is provided in text s1 and table s2 the recoveries of target mps were determined in the range of 57 129 the limits of quantification loqs of target mps ranged from 0 02 to 2 2 ng l 1 and 0 02 4 9 ng g 1 for wastewater and sludge respectively table s2 the calibration curves of target mps were re established every month if any concentration was detected above the upper limit of the calibration range then the sample was diluted and analyzed again during the sample analysis ongoing quality control checks including blanks duplicates of samples and spiking recovery checks were performed every 15 samples to ensure that all data were of good quality 2 4 environmental risk assessment the potential risks of residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge to aquatic organisms were assessed using risk quotient rq which is calculated as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec to the predicted no effect concentration pnec of a target compound european commission 2003 in this study the strictest standard that is the lowest pnec value of a specific compound in water ever reported was adopted for calculation the weighted measured environmental concentration wmec of a specific compound in the final effluent i e secondary or tertiary effluent or excess sludge collected from the 14 wwtps was calculated as follows 1 w m e c c ave r tot c max r 90 max where c ave and c max represent the average and maximum concentrations respectively r tot represents the detection frequency and r 90 max represents the ratio of the number of samples with concentrations higher than the 90 maximum concentration to the total number of samples hence the rq was calculated as follows 2 r q w m e c p n e c the specific values used for rq calculations are detailed in table s3 common ranking criteria were adopted in this work rq 0 1 low risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk and rq 1 high risk 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of mps in the 14 wwtps the detected concentrations and frequencies of target mps in the 14 wwtps are shown in table 2 a total of 38 mps were detected and the mp numbers with 100 detection in the influent effluent and excess sludge samples were 26 19 and 17 respectively tcs fqs and mls were the most frequently detected which was attributed to their high human consumptions in china zhang et al 2015 two veterinary antibiotics tia and tyl were not detected the absence of sfx and ee2 was possibly due to the limited human application and fast degradation in sewage transport pipes respectively hence it is noted that the stability of mps may also influence their occurrence in the influent of wwtps for another example glucuronide conjugated ses i e e1 3g e2 3g and e2 17g were detected with lower frequencies than other ses because they could be readily deconjugated into free ses in sewage transport pipes ben et al 2017 the composition profiles of different categories of mps in the influent effluent and excess sludge from the 14 wwtps are shown in fig 1 although the total mp concentrations varied markedly among different wwtps a similar distribution of different categories of mps was generally observed 3 1 1 mp concentrations in the influent the highest level of mps in the influent was found for caf with a median concentration of 7885 8 ng l 1 caf at μg l 1 level in the influent was usually reported in wwtps of different countries such as spain bueno et al 2012 usa hedgespeth et al 2012 and china yuan et al 2015 revealing its large and universal usage pes were detected with notably high concentrations in all influent samples with median concentrations of 2648 1 and 760 8 ng l 1 for np and bpa respectively these concentration levels are in line with those reported in other countries where the influent concentrations of np and bpa were detected in the ranges of 240 41207 and 88 5620 ng l 1 respectively liu et al 2009 mls and fqs were two dominant antibiotic categories with high concentrations and detection frequencies followed by sas and tcs the prevailing status of mls and fqs over other antibiotic categories in the influent was also found in previous studies in china lin et al 2018 spain bueno et al 2012 and uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 the six miscellaneous pharmaceuticals ate met prop bf cbz and tmp generally had a median concentration lower than 100 ng l 1 except for met at 237 6 ng l 1 these concentrations agree closely with a recent study conducted in china ashfaq et al 2017 but are considerably lower than those detected in other countries for example the concentrations of ate and prop are up to an order of magnitude lower than those reported in korea behera et al 2011 spain bueno et al 2012 and usa subedi and kannan 2015 in terms of specific compounds olf rox and azn were the predominant mps with median concentrations of 479 7 405 4 and 351 4 ng l 1 respectively additionally smx met ery cla nor and otc were also abundant in influent samples with median concentrations higher than 100 ng l 1 the relatively high concentrations of these compounds were mainly related to their human consumptions for example olf nor and ery were more frequently used by humans 1000 tons in 2013 than other antibiotics zhang et al 2015 e1 e2 and e3 were detected at median concentrations of 72 7 6 7 and 52 7 ng l 1 respectively which coincides with their different excretion amounts by humans i e higher excretion of e1 and e3 than e2 zhang et al 2014a b because ses are mainly excreted from human bodies in conjugated forms conjugated ses were frequently detected in the influent samples with median concentrations ranging from 2 2 e1 3g to 11 2 ng l 1 e3 3s the location and wastewater source of a wwtp may also affect the mp concentrations in the influent as shown in fig 1a plants 9 12 13 and 14 which are located in northern china had obviously higher total mp concentrations than other studied wwtps a possible reason is that the lower rainfall in northern china weakened the dilution effect on the mp concentrations relatively higher proportions of pes were detected in the influents of plants 1 2 4 6 and 7 indicating a notable contribution of industrial wastewater to the influents of these wwtps 3 1 2 mp concentrations in the effluent and excess sludge in the effluent mls fqs and pes accounted for the highest proportions fig 1b with median concentrations of 35 3 108 4 1 8 253 3 and 34 6 136 8 ng l 1 respectively table 1 similar to the influent olf met rox and azn were still the most abundant mps in the effluent with median concentrations of 253 3 112 0 108 4 and 105 4 ng l 1 respectively smx and nor were also present at relatively high concentrations of 64 1 and 58 6 ng l 1 respectively meanwhile the concentration of caf the most abundant compound in the influent declined to 36 3 ng l 1 compared to those in the effluent the composition profiles of mp categories in the excess sludge were quite simple with notable proportions of pes fqs tcs and mls superior to other categories fig 1c pes tcs and mls were detected with median concentrations of 159 0 14050 7 8 5 387 8 and 5 3 749 0 ng g 1 respectively indicating their tendency of accumulation in the sludge in terms of specific compounds np was the most abundant with a median concentration of 14050 7 ng g 1 followed by olf nor azn and otc with median concentrations of 3150 0 2003 7 749 0 and 387 8 ng g 1 respectively because of the predominant role of np higher total mp concentrations were detected in the excess sludge of wwtps containing a larger portion of industrial wastewater i e plants 1 2 4 6 and 7 pearson correlation analysis showed that in the effluent the total mp concentration had no significant correlation with the hydraulic retention time hrt or sludge retention time srt of the studied wwtps and the individual mp concentration had no significant correlation with its octanol water partitioning coefficient logk ow however the total mp concentration in the excess sludge was significantly correlated with the srt r 0 750 p 0 05 a longer srt generally favors the adsorption of mps onto sludge ben et al 2017 zhang and li 2011 the relative abundance of hydrophobic genera increases with the sludge age which tends to enhance the adsorption capacity of biomass for mps davenport et al 2000 moreover the individual mp concentration in the excess sludge was significantly correlated with its logk ow value r 0 382 p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic partition played an important role in the adsorption of mps onto sludge 3 2 aqueous removal of mps fig 2 shows the aqueous removal efficiencies of target mps in the studied wwtps as calculated based on the concentrations of a specific compound in the influent and final effluent secondary or tertiary effluent according to the treatment processes adopted high removal efficiencies were observed for tcs bf caf ses and pes with median i e the 50 line values higher than 80 except 75 1 for dox moreover the inter quartiles of the corresponding boxes of bf caf free ses and pes were below 15 denoting a stable removal of these mps in wwtps earlier studies also reported that caf free ses and bf could be readily removed from wwtps bueno et al 2012 liu et al 2009 sui et al 2010 specifically more than 99 of caf e2 and e3 ashfaq et al 2017 behera et al 2011 and 87 of bf sui et al 2010 were removed in the final effluents with respect to other mp categories the removal efficiencies were highly variable in general fqs sas and mls presented median removal efficiencies in the ranges of 76 1 86 9 61 2 83 2 and 65 6 84 3 respectively tran et al 2016 reported that fqs were removed effectively 76 6 99 9 while a moderate removal was found for sas 66 8 88 1 and mls 54 8 91 4 however the removal efficiencies of these antibiotics varied largely from 13 to 100 among different studies behera et al 2011 bueno et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 for β blockers the median removal efficiencies of ate and met reached 85 7 and 77 1 respectively while that was only 12 1 for prop a refractory compound among β blockers radjenović et al 2009 low removal was found for cbz median efficiency 9 2 because of its persistence in conventional wastewater treatment processes subedi and kannan 2015 it is noted that some mps such as smr olf enr rox azn prop and cbz showed occasionally negative removal efficiencies probably due to the transformation of conjugated forms to free forms ashfaq et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2015 for example the cleavage of hydroxylated cbz metabolite by microbial activity caused an increase of cbz concentration in the bio treatment effluent subedi and kannan 2015 3 3 comparison of different treatment processes as described above the removal of mps appeared to be compound specific fig 2 which makes it difficult to compare the efficacies of different treatment processes hence quantitative meta analysis was performed which is able to control the variability in removal among different categories of mps the standardized removal efficiency sre of each compound was calculated according to a method described in a recent study melvin and leusch 2016 to avoid the bias potentially introduced by the anomalous outcomes for different treatment processes the number of data points available for each treatment process was considered in the calculation of sre 3 s r e x μ σ n n where x is each individual removal efficiency μ is the average removal efficiency of a specific compound across all treatment processes σ is the standard deviation of the removal efficiencies of a specific compound across all treatment processes n is the number of data points obtained for each treatment process and n is the total number of data points for a specific compound across all treatment processes the quantitative meta analysis results though dependent on the mps studied could provide an overview of the performance of different treatment processes in eliminating the target mps 3 3 1 secondary treatment processes in general the secondary treatment processes usually referring to bio treatment processes mainly account for the removal of mps in wwtps as shown in fig 3 a cast had the lowest efficacy for removing mps with a significantly different sre value as compared to other treatment processes a a o and od achieved relatively higher removal of mps and no significant difference was identified between the two processes a a o combined with a moving bed biofilm reactor a a o mbbr achieved the highest removal of mps and mbr was the next most effective process it has been reported that mbbr can remove some pharmaceuticals e g sdz ate cbz tmp and diclofenac more effectively than the conventional activated sludge and mbr processes casas et al 2015 falås et al 2012 tang et al 2017 the biofilm developed on the surface of carriers in the mbbr consists of microorganisms capable of using pharmaceuticals as organic substrates zupanc et al 2013 thus leading to a higher removal of mps falås et al 2013 recently mbbr has been increasingly applied in wwtps in china especially following a a o to enhance nitrification this study demonstrates an additional merit of a a o mbbr that is the post positioned mbbr can further remove some mps which are recalcitrant to activated sludge treatment as shown in fig 3a mbr achieved a higher removal of mps than a a o od and cast previous studies also reported that mbr exhibited better performance over cast od and trickling biofilters for removing a broad spectrum of mps melvin and leusch 2016 tran et al 2016 the longer srt in the mbr allows for the enrichment of slowly growing bacteria and the subsequent establishment of a more diverse microbial community which favors the co metabolic degradation of mps batt et al 2006 tran et al 2013 moreover the smaller sizes of sludge particles in the mbr also provide higher surface areas for adsorption of mps kimura et al 2007 in this study mbr was adopted in plant 12 with an srt of 22 5 d longer than those in most other studied wwtps which may explain its preferable removal of mps hence the operation parameters of wwttps could also affect the removal of mps another example is that the hrts of the two wwtps adopting cast i e 6 5 h for plant 10 and 5 h for plant 11 were obviously lower than those of most other wwtps which may partly explain the low removal of cast for target mps 3 3 2 tertiary treatment processes tertiary treatment processes may further eliminate mps present in the secondary effluent while different processes exhibited significant discrepancies in the mp removal efficiency fig 3b rotary fiber disc filters rfdf which were widely adopted in the studied wwtps showed the lowest removal of mps the addition of uv disinfection to rfdf or the sole uv disinfection showed slightly better performance than the rfdf but no significant difference was identified amongst these three processes notably high heterogeneity of the sre for uv disinfection was observed mainly due to a large variation in the light sensitivity of different mps although some mps e g smx and ses are found to be well removed by uv irradiation carlson et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 direct uv photolysis at wastewater disinfection dosages e g 10 20 mj cm 2 has been proven ineffective in removing the majority of mps yang et al 2014 the coagulation sedimentation rfdf uv combined process cs rfdf uv exhibited a higher removal of mps than the rfdf and uv rfdf processes coagulation can effectively eliminate some hydrophobic mps logk ow 4 e g bpa from water alexander et al 2012 luo et al 2014 the application of clo2 disinfection in the cs rfdf clo2 and rfdf clo2 combined processes notably enhanced the removal of mps the high reactivity of clo2 toward aniline phenolic and tertiary amine functional groups is well known lee and von gunten 2010 it has been reported that clo2 can completely remove many reactive mps such as smx ses and cip in bio treated wastewater andersen 2010 hey et al 2012 lee and von gunten 2010 the maximum sre was achieved when employing an ultrafiltration ozonation clo2 disinfection combined process uf o3 clo2 uf membrane can retain typically hydrophobic edcs and ppcps e g e1 and ery yoon et al 2007 o3 is highly effective in removing a broad spectrum of mps in bio treated wastewater especially those with aromatic moieties amine groups or double bonds such as smx and cbz hollender et al 2009 in china the most widely used wastewater treatment process is a a o which has been adopted in 31 of wwtps zhang et al 2016 from the results obtained above the currently running a a o process can be readily expanded to the a a o mbbr combined process to enhance the removal of mps moreover ozonation and clo2 disinfection showed preferable performance in removing mps among the studied tertiary treatment processes however underlying the effective destruction of mp molecular structures these chemical oxidants may also produce more harmful or persistent by products than the parent compounds carlson et al 2015 which warrants further investigation 3 4 environmental risks of mps as shown in fig 4 in the effluent the rqs for smx olf cip cla ery e1 and bpa were higher than 1 0 indicating they could pose high risks to aquatic organisms the rqs of e2 17g e1 3s e2 np tcn and otc were between 1 0 and 0 1 indicating medium risks with respect to excess sludge e2 3s posed a high risk while medium risks could be induced by e1 3g e1 3s olf and cip in previous studies medium to high risks were identified for smx sdz ery cbz and olf in the wwtp effluents in china ma et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 and globally díaz garduño et al 2017 garcía galán et al 2011 while limited research has been conducted to assess the risks of mps in the excess sludge it is noted that even though the concentrations of conjugated ses in the sludge phase were lower than those of free ses table 2 their higher partition to water phase may also induce high risks to aquatic organisms this result highlights a particular concern for conjugated forms of mps in wwtps the simultaneous presence of different mps can result in toxic effects at concentrations lower than the pnec for each individual pollutant wang et al 2010 as a result the risks associated with residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge are probably even higher than the calculated values in addition the transformation by products of mps especially in the tertiary treatment processes may pose additional risks although the dilution by a receiving water will lower the mp concentrations when the wwtp effluent is discharged the continuous input of mps may require a risk assessment method considering long term exposure scenarios with respect to the excess sludge the residual mps may move up into the food chain through uptake by plants if the sludge is composted and applied to farmlands adeel et al 2017 yu et al 2013 overall the risks of residual mps in downstream environments need further assessment in comprehensive consideration of their stability mobility exposure pathways and exposure concentrations 4 conclusions this study has revealed a wide distribution of mps in the studied wwtps with pes fqs and mls identified as the predominant categories a significant part of mps could not be effectively removed by wastewater treatment processes thus being discharged into the environment through the effluent and excess sludge for the removal of mps the combined a a o mbbr process exhibited the best performance among the secondary treatment processes and the uf o3 clo2 combined process was the most effective among the tertiary treatment processes risk assessment revealed that the high risk compounds consisted of smx olf cip cla ery e1 and bpa in the effluent and e2 3s in the excess sludge the risks associated with the conjugated forms and transformation by products of mps warrant further investigation in the future acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19799,this study investigated the occurrence removal and risk of 42 organic micropollutants mps including 30 pharmaceuticals and personal care products and 12 endocrine disrupting chemicals in 14 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps distributed across china the composition profiles of different mp categories in the influent effluent and excess sludge were explored and the aqueous removal efficiencies of mps were determined quantitative meta analysis was performed to compare the efficacies of different wastewater treatment processes in eliminating mps results indicate that different mp categories showed quite similar distributions among the studied wwtps with phenolic estrogenic compounds pes macrolides and fluoroquinolones being always dominant in the influent effluent and excess sludge tetracyclines bezafibrate caffeine steroid estrogens and pes showed high and stable aqueous removal efficiencies whereas other mps showed considerably varied aqueous removal

erythromycin estrone and bisphenol a in the effluent as well as β estradiol 3 sulfate in the excess sludge could pose high risks this study draws an overall picture about the current status of mps in

micropollutants mps in the environment is of global concern due to their potential ecological risks many kinds of mps including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs have been widely detected in environmental matrices such as surface water and soils bradley et al 2017 liu and wong 2013 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have received considerable attention over the past decades because they act as a barrier to prevent mps from entering the environment intensive sampling and analysis efforts have been made globally to improve understanding of the occurrence behavior and fate of mps in wwtps in china the number of wwtps rapidly increased from 481 in 2000 3717 in 2014 with a total treatment capacity of 1 57 million m3 d 1 mhurd 2015 meanwhile as one of the biggest producers and consumers of chemicals china is also confronted with challenges from mps a few previous studies have preliminarily revealed the status of mps in some china s wwtps sui et al 2010 yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 however a comprehensive comparison of the occurrence and removal of diverse categories of mps in different wwtps distributed across china has not yet been made previous studies have demonstrated that most mps can be only partly removed in wastewater treatment processes and subsequently released into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal bueno et al 2012 garcía galán et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a b correspondingly the removal of specific mps has been extensively studied with biological treatment processes including conventional activated sludge treatment cast anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o process membrane bioreactor mbr and oxidation ditch od as well as advanced treatment processes including ozonation chlorination and uv photolysis processes in lab scale tests drillia et al 2005 esplugas et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 however there is a severe lack of research which compares the removal efficiencies of mps among different full scale wastewater treatment processes currently adopted in various regions of china nowadays china s wwtps are challenged with more stringent effluent discharge standards zhang et al 2016 in addition with increasing demands for wastewater reclamation e g urban and agriculture irrigation toilet flushing stream augmentation and wetland enhancement wwtps are also striving to eliminate mps from the final effluent therefore a better understanding of the efficacies of commonly used wastewater treatment processes for eliminating mps is urgently needed in this study a nationwide survey was conducted on the removal of different categories of mps in 14 municipal wwtps distributed across china a total of 30 ppcps and 12 edcs which mainly originate from anthropogenic sources were selected as target mps for analysis quantitative meta analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of different wastewater treatment processes on eliminating mps furthermore ecological risks induced by residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge were also assessed this study helps better understand the occurrence removal and risks of mps in wwtps across china and proposes effective treatment processes for eliminating mps from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the target ppcps consisted of 23 antibiotics and

e3 3s and ii phenolic estrogenic compounds pes as representative mps in industrial wastewater which usually constitute a certain proportion in the influent of some wwtps bisphenol a bpa and 4 nonylphenol np the major physicochemical properties of the target mps are listed in table s1 all standards of mps 95 purity were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china or dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany smn 13c6 hemihydrate and olf d3 from witega berlin germany caf 13c3 from cerilliant round rock usa demeclocycline from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany and e2 d2 98 and e2 3s d4 50 tris from cdn isotopes quebec canada were used as isotopically labeled internal standards the stock solutions of target mps and internal standards were individually prepared by dissolving each compound in methanol at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and then stored at 20 c in a refrigerator other chemicals and reagents used for the analysis of mps are provided in text s1 2 2 sample collection wastewater and sludge samples were collected from 14 wwtps which are distributed in nine cites in different geographical regions of china sampling was conducted continuously for one day for each wwtp during the period from april to october 2015 information on the location treatment processes operational parameters and collected sample types of the studied wwtps is detailed in table 1 wastewater samples included influent secondary effluent and tertiary effluent if tertiary treatment was employed and sludge samples represented the excess sludge during the sampling campaigns the wwtps were confirmed to be under normal operation conditions and no rainfall events were recorded moreover the wastewater temperature during the time of sampling in 14 wwtps varied within a relatively narrow range i e 19 2 24 2 c so the temperature difference was unlikely to significantly influence the biological treatment performance among the studied wwtps flow proportional 24 h composite samples were collected using autosamplers sd900 hach usa for plants 1 and 2 where the autosamplers were not available wastewater and sludge samples were collected three times on a sampling day i e in the morning noon and evening and mixed together all samples were transferred to brown glass bottles chilled in iceboxes and transported to the laboratory within two days for processing 2 3 analytical methods and quality control the concentrations of 30 ppcps and 12 edcs in the collected samples were determined by two separate analytical methods developed in our previous studies yuan et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 detailed information on sample pretreatment and extraction as well as instrumental parameters is provided in text s1 and table s2 the recoveries of target mps were determined in the range of 57 129 the limits of quantification loqs of target mps ranged from 0 02 to 2 2 ng l 1 and 0 02 4 9 ng g 1 for wastewater and sludge respectively table s2 the calibration curves of target mps were re established every month if any concentration was detected above the upper limit of the calibration range then the sample was diluted and analyzed again during the sample analysis ongoing quality control checks including blanks duplicates of samples and spiking recovery checks were performed every 15 samples to ensure that all data were of good quality 2 4 environmental risk assessment the potential risks of residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge to aquatic organisms were assessed using risk quotient rq which is calculated as the ratio of the measured environmental concentration mec to the predicted no effect concentration pnec of a target compound european commission 2003 in this study the strictest standard that is the lowest pnec value of a specific compound in water ever reported was adopted for calculation the weighted measured environmental concentration wmec of a specific compound in the final effluent i e secondary or tertiary effluent or excess sludge collected from the 14 wwtps was calculated as follows 1 w m e c c ave r tot c max r 90 max where c ave and c max represent the average and maximum concentrations respectively r tot represents the detection frequency and r 90 max represents the ratio of the number of samples with concentrations higher than the 90 maximum concentration to the total number of samples hence the rq was calculated as follows 2 r q w m e c p n e c the specific values used for rq calculations are detailed in table s3 common ranking criteria were adopted in this work rq 0 1 low risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk and rq 1 high risk 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of mps in the 14 wwtps the detected concentrations and frequencies of target mps in the 14 wwtps are shown in table 2 a total of 38 mps were detected and the mp numbers with 100 detection in the influent effluent and excess sludge samples were 26 19 and 17 respectively tcs fqs and mls were the most frequently detected which was attributed to their high human consumptions in china zhang et al 2015 two veterinary antibiotics tia and tyl were not detected the absence of sfx and ee2 was possibly due to the limited human application and fast degradation in sewage transport pipes respectively hence it is noted that the stability of mps may also influence their occurrence in the influent of wwtps for another example glucuronide conjugated ses i e e1 3g e2 3g and e2 17g were detected with lower frequencies than other ses because they could be readily deconjugated into free ses in sewage transport pipes ben et al 2017 the composition profiles of different categories of mps in the influent effluent and excess sludge from the 14 wwtps are shown in fig 1 although the total mp concentrations varied markedly among different wwtps a similar distribution of different categories of mps was generally observed 3 1 1 mp concentrations in the influent the highest level of mps in the influent was found for caf with a median concentration of 7885 8 ng l 1 caf at μg l 1 level in the influent was usually reported in wwtps of different countries such as spain bueno et al 2012 usa hedgespeth et al 2012 and china yuan et al 2015 revealing its large and universal usage pes were detected with notably high concentrations in all influent samples with median concentrations of 2648 1 and 760 8 ng l 1 for np and bpa respectively these concentration levels are in line with those reported in other countries where the influent concentrations of np and bpa were detected in the ranges of 240 41207 and 88 5620 ng l 1 respectively liu et al 2009 mls and fqs were two dominant antibiotic categories with high concentrations and detection frequencies followed by sas and tcs the prevailing status of mls and fqs over other antibiotic categories in the influent was also found in previous studies in china lin et al 2018 spain bueno et al 2012 and uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 the six miscellaneous pharmaceuticals ate met prop bf cbz and tmp generally had a median concentration lower than 100 ng l 1 except for met at 237 6 ng l 1 these concentrations agree closely with a recent study conducted in china ashfaq et al 2017 but are considerably lower than those detected in other countries for example the concentrations of ate and prop are up to an order of magnitude lower than those reported in korea behera et al 2011 spain bueno et al 2012 and usa subedi and kannan 2015 in terms of specific compounds olf rox and azn were the predominant mps with median concentrations of 479 7 405 4 and 351 4 ng l 1 respectively additionally smx met ery cla nor and otc were also abundant in influent samples with median concentrations higher than 100 ng l 1 the relatively high concentrations of these compounds were mainly related to their human consumptions for example olf nor and ery were more frequently used by humans 1000 tons in 2013 than other antibiotics zhang et al 2015 e1 e2 and e3 were detected at median concentrations of 72 7 6 7 and 52 7 ng l 1 respectively which coincides with their different excretion amounts by humans i e higher excretion of e1 and e3 than e2 zhang et al 2014a b because ses are mainly excreted from human bodies in conjugated forms conjugated ses were frequently detected in the influent samples with median concentrations ranging from 2 2 e1 3g to 11 2 ng l 1 e3 3s the location and wastewater source of a wwtp may also affect the mp concentrations in the influent as shown in fig 1a plants 9 12 13 and 14 which are located in northern china had obviously higher total mp concentrations than other studied wwtps a possible reason is that the lower rainfall in northern china weakened the dilution effect on the mp concentrations relatively higher proportions of pes were detected in the influents of plants 1 2 4 6 and 7 indicating a notable contribution of industrial wastewater to the influents of these wwtps 3 1 2 mp concentrations in the effluent and excess sludge in the effluent mls fqs and pes accounted for the highest proportions fig 1b with median concentrations of 35 3 108 4 1 8 253 3 and 34 6 136 8 ng l 1 respectively table 1 similar to the influent olf met rox and azn were still the most abundant mps in the effluent with median concentrations of 253 3 112 0 108 4 and 105 4 ng l 1 respectively smx and nor were also present at relatively high concentrations of 64 1 and 58 6 ng l 1 respectively meanwhile the concentration of caf the most abundant compound in the influent declined to 36 3 ng l 1 compared to those in the effluent the composition profiles of mp categories in the excess sludge were quite simple with notable proportions of pes fqs tcs and mls superior to other categories fig 1c pes tcs and mls were detected with median concentrations of 159 0 14050 7 8 5 387 8 and 5 3 749 0 ng g 1 respectively indicating their tendency of accumulation in the sludge in terms of specific compounds np was the most abundant with a median concentration of 14050 7 ng g 1 followed by olf nor azn and otc with median concentrations of 3150 0 2003 7 749 0 and 387 8 ng g 1 respectively because of the predominant role of np higher total mp concentrations were detected in the excess sludge of wwtps containing a larger portion of industrial wastewater i e plants 1 2 4 6 and 7 pearson correlation analysis showed that in the effluent the total mp concentration had no significant correlation with the hydraulic retention time hrt or sludge retention time srt of the studied wwtps and the individual mp concentration had no significant correlation with its octanol water partitioning coefficient logk ow however the total mp concentration in the excess sludge was significantly correlated with the srt r 0 750 p 0 05 a longer srt generally favors the adsorption of mps onto sludge ben et al 2017 zhang and li 2011 the relative abundance of hydrophobic genera increases with the sludge age which tends to enhance the adsorption capacity of biomass for mps davenport et al 2000 moreover the individual mp concentration in the excess sludge was significantly correlated with its logk ow value r 0 382 p 0 05 indicating that hydrophobic partition played an important role in the adsorption of mps onto sludge 3 2 aqueous removal of mps fig 2 shows the aqueous removal efficiencies of target mps in the studied wwtps as calculated based on the concentrations of a specific compound in the influent and final effluent secondary or tertiary effluent according to the treatment processes adopted high removal efficiencies were observed for tcs bf caf ses and pes with median i e the 50 line values higher than 80 except 75 1 for dox moreover the inter quartiles of the corresponding boxes of bf caf free ses and pes were below 15 denoting a stable removal of these mps in wwtps earlier studies also reported that caf free ses and bf could be readily removed from wwtps bueno et al 2012 liu et al 2009 sui et al 2010 specifically more than 99 of caf e2 and e3 ashfaq et al 2017 behera et al 2011 and 87 of bf sui et al 2010 were removed in the final effluents with respect to other mp categories the removal efficiencies were highly variable in general fqs sas and mls presented median removal efficiencies in the ranges of 76 1 86 9 61 2 83 2 and 65 6 84 3 respectively tran et al 2016 reported that fqs were removed effectively 76 6 99 9 while a moderate removal was found for sas 66 8 88 1 and mls 54 8 91 4 however the removal efficiencies of these antibiotics varied largely from 13 to 100 among different studies behera et al 2011 bueno et al 2012 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 for β blockers the median removal efficiencies of ate and met reached 85 7 and 77 1 respectively while that was only 12 1 for prop a refractory compound among β blockers radjenović et al 2009 low removal was found for cbz median efficiency 9 2 because of its persistence in conventional wastewater treatment processes subedi and kannan 2015 it is noted that some mps such as smr olf enr rox azn prop and cbz showed occasionally negative removal efficiencies probably due to the transformation of conjugated forms to free forms ashfaq et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2015 for example the cleavage of hydroxylated cbz metabolite by microbial activity caused an increase of cbz concentration in the bio treatment effluent subedi and kannan 2015 3 3 comparison of different treatment processes as described above the removal of mps appeared to be compound specific fig 2 which makes it difficult to compare the efficacies of different treatment processes hence quantitative meta analysis was performed which is able to control the variability in removal among different categories of mps the standardized removal efficiency sre of each compound was calculated according to a method described in a recent study melvin and leusch 2016 to avoid the bias potentially introduced by the anomalous outcomes for different treatment processes the number of data points available for each treatment process was considered in the calculation of sre 3 s r e x μ σ n n where x is each individual removal efficiency μ is the average removal efficiency of a specific compound across all treatment processes σ is the standard deviation of the removal efficiencies of a specific compound across all treatment processes n is the number of data points obtained for each treatment process and n is the total number of data points for a specific compound across all treatment processes the quantitative meta analysis results though dependent on the mps studied could provide an overview of the performance of different treatment processes in eliminating the target mps 3 3 1 secondary treatment processes in general the secondary treatment processes usually referring to bio treatment processes mainly account for the removal of mps in wwtps as shown in fig 3 a cast had the lowest efficacy for removing mps with a significantly different sre value as compared to other treatment processes a a o and od achieved relatively higher removal of mps and no significant difference was identified between the two processes a a o combined with a moving bed biofilm reactor a a o mbbr achieved the highest removal of mps and mbr was the next most effective process it has been reported that mbbr can remove some pharmaceuticals e g sdz ate cbz tmp and diclofenac more effectively than the conventional activated sludge and mbr processes casas et al 2015 falås et al 2012 tang et al 2017 the biofilm developed on the surface of carriers in the mbbr consists of microorganisms capable of using pharmaceuticals as organic substrates zupanc et al 2013 thus leading to a higher removal of mps falås et al 2013 recently mbbr has been increasingly applied in wwtps in china especially following a a o to enhance nitrification this study demonstrates an additional merit of a a o mbbr that is the post positioned mbbr can further remove some mps which are recalcitrant to activated sludge treatment as shown in fig 3a mbr achieved a higher removal of mps than a a o od and cast previous studies also reported that mbr exhibited better performance over cast od and trickling biofilters for removing a broad spectrum of mps melvin and leusch 2016 tran et al 2016 the longer srt in the mbr allows for the enrichment of slowly growing bacteria and the subsequent establishment of a more diverse microbial community which favors the co metabolic degradation of mps batt et al 2006 tran et al 2013 moreover the smaller sizes of sludge particles in the mbr also provide higher surface areas for adsorption of mps kimura et al 2007 in this study mbr was adopted in plant 12 with an srt of 22 5 d longer than those in most other studied wwtps which may explain its preferable removal of mps hence the operation parameters of wwttps could also affect the removal of mps another example is that the hrts of the two wwtps adopting cast i e 6 5 h for plant 10 and 5 h for plant 11 were obviously lower than those of most other wwtps which may partly explain the low removal of cast for target mps 3 3 2 tertiary treatment processes tertiary treatment processes may further eliminate mps present in the secondary effluent while different processes exhibited significant discrepancies in the mp removal efficiency fig 3b rotary fiber disc filters rfdf which were widely adopted in the studied wwtps showed the lowest removal of mps the addition of uv disinfection to rfdf or the sole uv disinfection showed slightly better performance than the rfdf but no significant difference was identified amongst these three processes notably high heterogeneity of the sre for uv disinfection was observed mainly due to a large variation in the light sensitivity of different mps although some mps e g smx and ses are found to be well removed by uv irradiation carlson et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 direct uv photolysis at wastewater disinfection dosages e g 10 20 mj cm 2 has been proven ineffective in removing the majority of mps yang et al 2014 the coagulation sedimentation rfdf uv combined process cs rfdf uv exhibited a higher removal of mps than the rfdf and uv rfdf processes coagulation can effectively eliminate some hydrophobic mps logk ow 4 e g bpa from water alexander et al 2012 luo et al 2014 the application of clo2 disinfection in the cs rfdf clo2 and rfdf clo2 combined processes notably enhanced the removal of mps the high reactivity of clo2 toward aniline phenolic and tertiary amine functional groups is well known lee and von gunten 2010 it has been reported that clo2 can completely remove many reactive mps such as smx ses and cip in bio treated wastewater andersen 2010 hey et al 2012 lee and von gunten 2010 the maximum sre was achieved when employing an ultrafiltration ozonation clo2 disinfection combined process uf o3 clo2 uf membrane can retain typically hydrophobic edcs and ppcps e g e1 and ery yoon et al 2007 o3 is highly effective in removing a broad spectrum of mps in bio treated wastewater especially those with aromatic moieties amine groups or double bonds such as smx and cbz hollender et al 2009 in china the most widely used wastewater treatment process is a a o which has been adopted in 31 of wwtps zhang et al 2016 from the results obtained above the currently running a a o process can be readily expanded to the a a o mbbr combined process to enhance the removal of mps moreover ozonation and clo2 disinfection showed preferable performance in removing mps among the studied tertiary treatment processes however underlying the effective destruction of mp molecular structures these chemical oxidants may also produce more harmful or persistent by products than the parent compounds carlson et al 2015 which warrants further investigation 3 4 environmental risks of mps as shown in fig 4 in the effluent the rqs for smx olf cip cla ery e1 and bpa were higher than 1 0 indicating they could pose high risks to aquatic organisms the rqs of e2 17g e1 3s e2 np tcn and otc were between 1 0 and 0 1 indicating medium risks with respect to excess sludge e2 3s posed a high risk while medium risks could be induced by e1 3g e1 3s olf and cip in previous studies medium to high risks were identified for smx sdz ery cbz and olf in the wwtp effluents in china ma et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 and globally díaz garduño et al 2017 garcía galán et al 2011 while limited research has been conducted to assess the risks of mps in the excess sludge it is noted that even though the concentrations of conjugated ses in the sludge phase were lower than those of free ses table 2 their higher partition to water phase may also induce high risks to aquatic organisms this result highlights a particular concern for conjugated forms of mps in wwtps the simultaneous presence of different mps can result in toxic effects at concentrations lower than the pnec for each individual pollutant wang et al 2010 as a result the risks associated with residual mps in the effluent and excess sludge are probably even higher than the calculated values in addition the transformation by products of mps especially in the tertiary treatment processes may pose additional risks although the dilution by a receiving water will lower the mp concentrations when the wwtp effluent is discharged the continuous input of mps may require a risk assessment method considering long term exposure scenarios with respect to the excess sludge the residual mps may move up into the food chain through uptake by plants if the sludge is composted and applied to farmlands adeel et al 2017 yu et al 2013 overall the risks of residual mps in downstream environments need further assessment in comprehensive consideration of their stability mobility exposure pathways and exposure concentrations 4 conclusions this study has revealed a wide distribution of mps in the studied wwtps with pes fqs and mls identified as the predominant categories a significant part of mps could not be effectively removed by wastewater treatment processes thus being discharged into the environment through the effluent and excess sludge for the removal of mps the combined a a o mbbr process exhibited the best performance among the secondary treatment processes and the uf o3 clo2 combined process was the most effective among the tertiary treatment processes risk assessment revealed that the high risk compounds consisted of smx olf cip cla ery e1 and bpa in the effluent and e2 3s in the excess sludge the risks associated with the conjugated forms and transformation by products of mps warrant further investigation in the future acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china
